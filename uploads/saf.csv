The seven vehicles have performed well since the trial at the airport started in May, said CAG.

The six-month trial is part of a push by the airport operator to find cleaner alternatives for its existing fleet of 60 vehicles deployed airside, where loading and unloading of aircraft, as well as take-offs and landings, take place.

The renewable diesel is being used to fuel heavy vehicles and specialised equipment that do not yet have viable electric variants.

CAG said electric variants are more readily available for light vehicles, such as forklifts and tractors.

Most heavy vehicles used in the aviation industry are still diesel-powered, such as airport runway sweepers.

These specialised vehicles are used to remove debris, including foreign objects, from runways and taxiways, and are crucial for maintaining runway safety.

Another example is runway rubber removal vehicles, which remove rubber deposits left by aircraft tyres, which can affect braking and safety.

The used cooking oil collected from Changi Airport eateries contributes to the feedstock – or raw material – to produce the renewable diesel used in the trial, CAG said.

The feedstock is converted into high-quality renewable diesel fuel that has a similar chemical composition to fossil diesel, it said.

This is done at

a refinery in Tuas run by Neste Singapore

, a renewable energy company.

Renewable diesel can be adopted as an easy replacement for fossil diesel as it can be used in existing diesel engines without modification.

Minimal adjustments are required for renewable diesel to use existing transportation, storage and distribution infrastructure.

The six-month trial will use approximately 14,000 litres of renewable diesel, said Mr Steven Bartholomeusz, Neste’s Asia-Pacific head of public and regulatory affairs.

CAG began its trial in May with a 50 per cent renewable diesel blend. This was upped to 100 per cent in August.

At 100 per cent renewable diesel, up to 90 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions will be produced over the fuel’s life cycle, when compared with fossil diesel, CAG said.

Renewable diesel can also be blended with fossil diesel in any proportion, helping companies to match the use of clean energy to their decarbonisation goals.

Mr Gerald Ng, CAG’s vice-president for regulatory affairs and sustainability, said the vehicles in the trial have performed well on the 50 per cent renewable diesel blend, and “without any impact to vehicle operations and efficiency”.

Renewable diesel trials have taken place at Changi Airport since 2024, when the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced a year-long trial of the fuel, also for heavy and specialised airside vehicles.

These trials are the result of the

sustainable air hub blueprint

launched in 2024, which aims to help reduce domestic aviation emissions by 20 per cent (from 2019 levels) by 2030 and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

Other initiatives from the blueprint include a passenger levy on flights departing from Singapore from 2026 to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as well as increased deployment of solar panels at the airport.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f92c1588acd29bcd3ed9e4f207590ba36430d104670b5e1681597f3f37b897a8,N,,2025-08-19 13:56:39.039133

Air India partners IndianOil to boost sustainable aviation Air India and IndianOil Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel.","Airlines across the world are uniting under one goal: to make flying cleaner, greener, and sustainable for the future. Air India has now joined global leaders including United, Delta, American, JetBlue, Alaska, and IAG in boosting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This new update signals not just a trend, but a decisive move towards the aviation industry’s Net Zero 2050 target. Air India and IndianOil Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This agreement represents a turning point for Indian aviation. It signals a shift from conventional jet fuels to green energy. Both companies are aligning with India’s climate commitments. The MoU reflects urgency. It shows aviation is moving to meet Net Zero targets. Sustainable Aviation Fuel will be central to this transformation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is changing the way we think about flight. Made from renewable sources such as waste oils, plant matter, and other innovative feedstocks, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel. It is also compatible with today’s aircraft engines, meaning airlines can adopt it without waiting for new technology. For Air India, working with IndianOil to secure certified SAF represents both a national milestone and a global statement of intent.

In the United States, carriers like United and Delta have already committed to multi-billion-gallon supply contracts. JetBlue and Alaska are running corporate SAF programmes to attract eco-conscious travellers. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, is investing in new UK SAF plants, while American Airlines is supporting research into e-fuels. Air India’s step to join this circle of pioneers underlines India’s growing role in aviation sustainability.

The message is clear. The future of flying will not just be about more destinations and faster connections. It will be about responsibility, resilience, and reducing emissions with SAF at its heart.

Aviation is changing. Airlines around the world are racing to cut emissions. They are investing in new aircraft, new technology, and a new type of fuel. This fuel is called Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF. It is made from renewable sources, not fossil oil. It can cut carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent over its life cycle. For an industry that produces around three per cent of global CO₂ emissions, this is a major shift. Governments are now setting targets. Airlines are signing contracts. Energy companies are building refineries. Together they are moving towards the goal of Net Zero by 2050.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel and why it matters

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not science fiction. It is already here. SAF is produced from waste oils, plant material, and even captured carbon. Unlike fossil fuels, SAF can be dropped into existing aircraft without any change to engines. This means airlines can adopt it now. For the planet, it is a lifeline. The International Air Transport Association has pledged Net Zero by 2050. That goal will only be possible if SAF is scaled. Today, SAF use is less than one per cent of all jet fuel. The challenge is to increase production and lower costs.

India steps forward with Air India and IndianOil

India is joining the green aviation race. In August 2025, Air India and IndianOil signed a landmark agreement. IndianOil has produced SAF at its Panipat refinery. It is certified under CORSIA, the international carbon scheme for airlines. Air India will use this fuel to meet its Net Zero by 2050 targets. The airline is also renewing its fleet with 570 new aircraft. These planes will be among the most fuel-efficient in the world. Air India is also testing new technology like electric towing, single engine taxiing, and lighter onboard materials. Together with SAF, these steps show India’s ambition.

United States pushes ahead with large-scale commitments

The United States is one of the largest air travel markets. It is also a leader in SAF policy. The government has launched the SAF Grand Challenge. It aims to produce three billion gallons a year by 2030. United Airlines is leading the charge. It has signed the biggest forward contracts for SAF of any carrier. It has invested in Blue Blade Energy, a joint venture that converts ethanol into SAF. Delta is also scaling. It has contracted more than 200 million gallons already and aims for 10 per cent SAF use by 2030. American Airlines has partnered with Infinium to secure e-fuels. JetBlue has secured more than 670 million gallons through a deal with SG Preston. Alaska Airlines is running projects with Microsoft and SkyNRG. Each of these carriers sees SAF as essential.

Europe sets strict mandates for SAF use

Europe has moved from voluntary action to law. The European Union has passed the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation. It requires airlines to blend two per cent SAF by 2025, six per cent by 2030, and seventy per cent by 2050. The UK has also set a two per cent mandate from 2025. To support airlines, Heathrow Airport offers incentives that cut the cost premium of SAF by half. Virgin Atlantic made history by flying the first transatlantic flight using 100 per cent SAF in 2023. International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, is building UK plants with LanzaJet and Nova Pangaea. Lufthansa and SWISS are working with Synhelion to use solar fuels. Air France-KLM has signed a contract with TotalEnergies for up to 1.5 million tonnes of SAF over ten years. Low-cost carriers are also joining. Ryanair aims for 12.5 per cent SAF by 2030 and is working with Neste and OMV. easyJet is exploring hydrogen as a long-term option but will also use SAF to meet mandates.

Middle East airlines test 100 per cent SAF flights

The Gulf airlines are also moving. Emirates flew a Boeing 777 with one engine powered fully by SAF. It also flew an Airbus A380 with SAF in one engine. This was the first such test for the world’s largest passenger aircraft. Emirates has begun SAF uplifts in Singapore with Neste. Etihad has its Greenliner programme and is adopting SAF in regular operations. These moves are important. The Middle East is a major global hub. SAF adoption here can influence travel across Asia, Europe, and Africa.

Asia-Pacific builds regional supply chains

Asia-Pacific airlines are not behind. Singapore Airlines is running a national SAF pilot with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Neste is supplying SAF directly into Changi Airport’s system. Corporate customers can also buy SAF credits. In Japan, both ANA and JAL are targeting ten per cent SAF use by 2030. They have corporate SAF programmes and strong government support. Qantas in Australia aims for ten per cent SAF by 2030 and sixty per cent by 2050. It is investing with Airbus in new projects in Queensland. Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong has signed a deal with Aemetis to buy 38 million gallons for flights from San Francisco. Across Asia, governments are starting to set mandates. India will require one per cent SAF blending in 2027, rising to two per cent in 2028.

The barriers to faster adoption

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is ready, but supply is short. Costs remain two to five times higher than fossil jet fuel. Infrastructure is still being built. Airlines want to buy more, but there is not enough available. Policy is critical. Incentives, subsidies, and mandates reduce the price gap. Airports like Heathrow are proving that targeted support works. The challenge is scale. Current global capacity may reach 2.1 million tonnes by 2025. That is still less than one per cent of what is needed.

The bigger picture: SAF and tourism

Tourism is tied closely to aviation. Travellers are more aware of carbon footprints. Corporate customers want to reduce emissions from business travel. SAF provides a solution. Airlines can market green flights. Countries can brand themselves as sustainable destinations. India, with its new SAF supply, can tell travellers that their flights are greener. Europe can show it is serious about climate goals. The United States can link tourism to energy innovation. Travellers benefit because they can enjoy destinations while knowing their impact is reduced.

The role of alliances and collective action

Airlines are stronger when they work together. The oneworld alliance has pooled demand for more than 350 million gallons of SAF. This allows producers to secure finance for new plants. The SkyTeam and Star alliances are also exploring similar moves. By acting collectively, airlines can create stable demand and push prices down faster.

The road to Net Zero by 2050

Net Zero by 2050 is not a slogan. It is a binding goal for global aviation. It requires fleet renewal, operational efficiency, and fuel innovation. SAF is the biggest single lever. It is not the only one. Hydrogen and electric aircraft will play roles in the future, especially on short routes. But for long-haul travel, SAF is the answer. Airlines are proving it works. Governments are mandating it. Producers are scaling up. The challenge is to move from small volumes to mass supply.

A global race for green skies

The shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel is happening. Air India is partnering with IndianOil to secure domestic supply. United and Delta are signing billion-gallon deals. Virgin Atlantic has shown a full SAF transatlantic flight is possible. Emirates has tested SAF on the largest aircraft in the world. Singapore and Japan are embedding SAF into their national strategies. Qantas and Cathay are securing supply for international routes. The European Union and the United Kingdom are mandating blending. The United States is investing billions in production.

Aviation has always been an industry of innovation. Today, its greatest challenge is climate change. SAF is the most practical solution available. It reduces emissions now, not decades from now. It works with existing aircraft. It aligns with national goals. It ensures aviation remains a driver of tourism and trade without damaging the planet. The race is on. The winners will be the airlines and countries that act fastest. The world is watching. And the future of flying depends on it.

Air India partners IndianOil to boost sustainable aviation

Air India and IndianOil Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This agreement represents a turning point for Indian aviation. It signals a shift from conventional jet fuels to green energy. Both companies are aligning with India’s climate commitments. The MoU reflects urgency. It shows aviation is moving to meet Net Zero targets. Sustainable Aviation Fuel will be central to this transformation.

The announcement reflects a bold step forward. Air India is owned by the Tata Group. Its modernisation includes sustainability. IndianOil is the country’s largest fuel supplier. Together, the two giants can change aviation’s carbon footprint. The agreement was signed in the presence of top leadership. It marked a shared pledge to decarbonise skies. The partnership reflects India’s global role in climate action. It ties energy innovation with aviation growth.

SAF adoption powers Net Zero by 2050 goals

The focus of this collaboration is Sustainable Aviation Fuel. SAF is a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel. It cuts lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent. India has set a target of five per cent SAF blending by 2030. This MoU helps accelerate that goal. Air India is committed to IATA’s Net Zero 2050 pledge. IndianOil is producing ISCC-CORSIA-certified SAF at its Panipat refinery. The partnership ensures availability and demand. It builds a supply chain for green fuel in India.

Global aviation contributes nearly three per cent of global emissions. Decarbonising flights is critical. SAF is the most effective short-term solution. For Air India, using SAF is more than compliance. It is also brand positioning. It signals leadership. For IndianOil, it is energy diversification. It demonstrates readiness to supply future fuels. Both companies are creating a framework for the future of travel.

Fleet renewal and green innovation drive progress

Air India is investing in fleet renewal. With 570 new aircraft on order, it will operate one of the most fuel-efficient fleets globally. Modern aircraft reduce emissions through lighter bodies and advanced engines. The airline is also optimising routes. Direct non-stop flights mean less fuel burn and fewer stopovers. The MoU with IndianOil complements these efforts. Fuel efficiency plus SAF equals transformation.

Green practices are already in place. Air India has cut single-use plastics. It uses lighter cutlery to save fuel weight. Processes like single-engine taxiing and autonomous electric towing are being rolled out. Frequent engine washes reduce drag and increase efficiency. These steps save millions of litres of jet fuel annually. Adding SAF adoption makes the programme comprehensive. Air India is becoming a leader in green aviation.

IndianOil strengthens its clean energy leadership

IndianOil has become the first Indian company to earn ISCC-CORSIA certification for SAF. Its Panipat refinery is producing certified green fuels. Certification matters. It means compliance with international standards. It ensures the SAF meets lifecycle carbon emission rules. For IndianOil, this milestone strengthens global credibility. It shows India can supply fuel that meets the strictest environmental checks.

The MoU allows IndianOil to expand its SAF supply. It will serve not only Air India but potentially international airlines in India. This positions IndianOil as a regional SAF leader. As demand rises globally, the company can also look at export markets. This is important for India’s energy security and trade. It links energy innovation with aviation and economic growth.

Aligning India’s climate strategy with aviation

India has made bold commitments in the energy transition. Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Yet it is vital. Domestic air travel is expanding. International connectivity is increasing. Demand for flights is rising. Without sustainable fuels, emissions will climb.

The MoU between Air India and IndianOil shows alignment with India’s 2030 and 2070 climate goals. It is also in step with ICAO’s CORSIA scheme. By ensuring supply and adoption, India builds resilience. It avoids dependence on imported SAF. It secures energy autonomy. And it sends a message that India’s aviation sector will lead, not lag, in the green transition.

Global context and competitive advantage

Airlines around the world are racing to secure SAF. European and American carriers already operate SAF-powered flights. Singapore and Japan are building supply chains. India cannot afford to fall behind. This MoU provides competitive advantage. It secures future fuel for Air India. It supports branding as a sustainable global carrier. It will attract international travellers conscious of emissions.

In the global market, SAF adoption is also linked with airport hubs. Airports providing SAF will attract international carriers. For India, this opens an opportunity. Major hubs like Delhi and Mumbai can become SAF-ready airports. This enhances competitiveness. It makes India a global leader in sustainable aviation routes.

Industry implications and ripple effects

The impact of this MoU goes beyond Air India and IndianOil. It sets a precedent for other Indian carriers. Vistara, Indigo, and SpiceJet will likely follow. SAF will become an industry standard. IndianOil can expand supply. Other refiners may join. This builds a domestic SAF ecosystem.

Travel industry stakeholders must prepare. Tour operators can market India as a green travel destination. Hotels can highlight sustainable transport links. Business travellers can choose India for eco-conscious meetings. The ripple effects extend to tourism branding. India can position itself as both an ancient land of heritage and a modern leader in green travel.

Challenges in scaling sustainable aviation fuel

SAF adoption is not without challenges. Production costs remain high. Global SAF is limited in supply. Infrastructure is still building. Yet demand is rising. The MoU addresses these by linking supply with demand. IndianOil will scale production. Air India will guarantee uptake. Over time, scale will reduce cost. Certification ensures transparency. India is positioning itself early.

For travellers, SAF may not change ticket prices immediately. But over time, green fuels will reduce dependence on fossil jet fuel imports. This stabilises long-term costs. It also makes aviation resilient against carbon taxes and international regulations.

Tourism benefits and global image of India

Tourism is a sector sensitive to sustainability. Travellers now seek destinations with strong green credentials. Airlines are central to this. Air India’s adoption of SAF enhances India’s image. It signals that visiting India supports green aviation. It reassures travellers that flights are aligned with climate goals.

This branding has value. It can influence high-spending international tourists. It can support India’s bid to host global events. It also enhances the image of Air India itself. It positions the airline as a leader in Asia. It strengthens Tata Group’s role in sustainability.

A decisive move for green skies

The MoU between Air India and IndianOil is historic. It links aviation with energy. It links climate with commerce. It is a decisive move towards Net Zero. For India, it sets a standard. It shows leadership in green aviation. For the travel industry, it offers reassurance. It proves that India is future-ready.

The challenge now is scaling. Production, distribution, and infrastructure must grow. But the foundation is laid. Air India’s new fleet will run on fuel-efficient technology. IndianOil will supply SAF certified to global standards. Together, they are ensuring India takes flight into a sustainable future.

This MoU is not just an agreement. It is a signal to the world. It says India will lead in sustainable aviation. It says green skies are possible. And it says travellers can fly with confidence that India is on the path to Net Zero.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-19-at-170130_348aacb9.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 13:56:47.429909

That’s according to Chetan Krishna, head of research and diligence at Third Derivative, RMI’s climate tech accelerator, which just announced support for a cohort of nine climate tech startups, five of which are based in India.

“A decade ago, there were a couple hundred climate tech startups in India. Today, there are about 3,000,” Krishna told Latitude Media. In 2024, he added, $1.5 billion — roughly 10% of all Indian venture capital investments — went into the sector.

That’s not much compared to the $24 billion that went into climate tech startups in the U.S. in the same period, but it’s still a sign of promising growth. And it appears to be slowly stirring the interest of some climate-focused venture capital investors in North America and Europe looking for opportunities beyond their usual geographies.

U.S.-based Lowercarbon Capital, for instance, has two Indian startups in its portfolio: River, which develops electric two-wheelers, and rooftop solar developer SolarSquare. SE Ventures, Schneider Electric’s venture capital arm, recently expanded its investment horizon to include India, leveraging “a partner on the ground helping [it] identify opportunities first and best,” said Carlos Kokron, one of the company’s general partners. And about 15% of Third Derivatives’ portfolio companies are based in India, which is the accelerator’s largest geography after North America and Europe.

It’s still too early to say whether these moves mark the start of a lasting trend, but they already invite a closer look at what makes India attractive to Western VCs—and how deep its climate tech potential truly runs.

Fast growth

The size of India’s economy is one immediate selling point for investors, explained Jai Shekhar, senior analyst at Peak Sustainability Ventures, a Mumbai-based early-stage climate VC firm.

“If you are willing to risk capital on the fact that the Indian economy is going to grow at a very substantial pace over the next 10 years, then the sector is attractive,” he said. And India is growing fast — it’s considered the fastest growing economy and the fourth largest in the world, having just surpassed Japan.

That growth has itself created an urgent need for scaling up the climate sector. Sandiip Bhammer, founder and managing partner of Green Frontier Capital, one of the first Indian early-stage VC funds dedicated to climate, pointed out that as India’s economy grows, so will its greenhouse gas emissions.

“There is no other country in the world where the demand for climate technology to address the environment is going to be extremely high, while also delivering potential for high returns. That’s the reason why people are gravitating towards India,” Bhammer said.

“If you are an American climate VC fund, you have the ability to find very well-priced startup deals in India, because the supply of capital in India is not very large yet and the prices of companies in India tend to be a little lower,” Krishna added.

Plus, compared to China, the other comparable market outside of North America and Europe, the Indian market is relatively accessible. “Entering China as a VC is difficult. The economy is structured differently, norms are different, and languages are different,” Krishna said. “But in India, you can operate in English, and the overall structure of the economy is very similar to the U.S. or EU.”

A country for scaling

For Rajesh Swaminathan, partner at Khosla Ventures, where he manages many of the firm’s climate tech investments, the conversation around Indian climate tech changes depending on the sector.

U.S. climate tech investors backing technologies such as nuclear and geothermal, for instance, are better off keeping their capital and innovation in the country. The “U.S. needs a strong competitive advantage,” he said. But for expensive technologies, like green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, that need to prove that they can be scaled economically, India provides a great platform.

“There’s an advantage in building first-of-a-kind plants, especially for hardware, expensive technologies, in countries like India, because it just reduces the cost and the risk potential,” he said. China is not as advantageous, he added because the technology gets copied pretty quickly.

In other sectors, like solar and batteries, India can provide the advantage of scale, if not necessarily of technical innovation. When it comes to batteries, for example, Swaminathan has found that many Indian companies are focusing on importing core technologies from abroad and scaling them up, rather than developing them themselves. Participating in this scaling, through joint ventures and partnerships, can provide interesting opportunities for Western investors.

“We see more market expansion and relatively less hardcore, fundamental technical innovation,” Swaminathan said. For now, “I think the innovation would still come from pockets in the US, and maybe Europe, and a lot of the expansion will happen in India.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-28-1024x683.png,N,,2025-08-19 13:57:04.623009

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Air India have partnered to promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a significant move towards greener aviation in India. IOC will supply SAF produced from used cooking oil, starting December, at its Panipat refinery, with an annual production of 35,000 tonnes.

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has signed a landmark agreement to supply sustainable aviation fuel to Air India, representing a significant step towards a greener and cleaner aviation in India.

IOC plans to begin production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil starting December this year at its Panipat refinery, according to Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney. The facility is expected to produce 35,000 tonne of green fuel annually, using waste cooking oil sourced from hotel and restaurant chains such as ITC and Haldiram's.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IOC on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) which ""outlines the shared commitment of both parties to promote the adoption of low-carbon fuels in aviation, support global decarbonisation goals, and contribute to the transition toward more sustainable air transport operations,"" it said in a statement.

The MoU was signed by Shailesh Dhar, Executive Director (Aviation), IOC, and P Balaji, Group Head - Governance, Regulatory, Compliance (GRC) and Corporate Affairs, Air India, in the presence of Sahney and Air India CEO Campbell Wilson.

""This collaboration reaffirms IOC's role as a trailblazer in India's energy transition, bringing India closer to a greener, cleaner aviation future,"" the statement said.

IOC has become the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery.

The certification is granted under ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which establishes IOC's capability to produce SAF that meets the most stringent international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards.

Sahney said, ""The signing of this MoU with Air India represents a strategic step in India's transition to sustainable aviation. With our ISCC-CORSIA-certified SAF from Panipat, IOC is ready to provide a sustainable fuel solution that will help decarbonise air travel. Partnering with India's flagship carrier, we are aligning national growth with global climate goals and setting a benchmark for the industry.""

Wilson said through this MoU, Air India is committed to supporting Government of India's initiatives to promote sustainable development in the aviation sector and to further its own sustainability goals to achieve the IATA net zero by 2050 target.

By integrating certified green fuels into commercial operations, IOC and Air India are together reinforcing India's position as a front-runner in sustainable aviation and energy transition.

""Through this MoU, IOC and Air India aim to collaborate on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets and even exceeding them for international flights, ensuring a reliable, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply to support both companies' environmental goals,"" the statement added.

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil.
CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels.

Through this MoU, IOCL and Air India aim to collaborate on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets for international flights, ensuring a reliable, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply to support both companies’ environmental goals,” Air India and IOC said in a statement.","By the end of this calendar year, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil, which will be sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors like Haldiram’s, which usually discard cooking oil after single use.

IOC became the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana. ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. According to IOC, the certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend. For instance, Airbus claims that all its aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50 per cent blend of SAF and conventional fuel. Various Indian airlines have already operated successfully a few test and demonstration flights using jet fuel doped with SAF in various proportions. According to aviation industry and energy experts, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

The year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

“By integrating certified green fuels into commercial operations, Indian Oil and Air India are together reinforcing India’s position as a front-runner in sustainable aviation and energy transition. Through this MoU, IOCL and Air India aim to collaborate on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets for international flights, ensuring a reliable, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply to support both companies’ environmental goals,” Air India and IOC said in a statement.

According to Air India, the MoU is part of the airline’s efforts that align with India’s broader push for green aviation, which includes blending regular jet fuel with SAF, and development of supply chains for the biofuel across the country. As part of its broader strategy to achieve the International Air Transport Association’s target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and comply with CORSIA obligations, Air India is actively pursuing initiatives in operational efficiency, low-carbon emissions, and SAF.

While IOC has already received the certification for the used cooking oil pathway for SAF production, the company is also working on setting up units based on the alcohol-to-jet pathway, which involves using ethanol as a feedstock to make SAF. A few other companies in India are also working to build units based on the various SAF manufacturing pathways.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/08/air-india-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 12:56:53.627718

Unlike traditional gas-fired reformers that cost millions and require massive infrastructure, the Ouro Reactor uses modified automotive industry components to achieve the same result at a fraction of the size and cost.
“Farmers in the U.S. and around the world are sitting on an untapped goldmine,” said Dr. Stephen Beaton, chief executive officer and founder of Circularity Fuels.
The Ouro Reactor operates on standard electrical connections, uses industrially proven catalysts and processes raw biogas without expensive pretreatment.

The successful demonstration marks a major step toward transforming the economics of renewable fuel production, one that Circularity believes will help airlines meet mandates for sustainable fuel alternatives while unlocking billions of dollars in new revenue streams for farmers. America’s 20,000-plus large livestock operations generate nearly a trillion pounds of manure each year, yet fewer than 6% of them capture the biogas that is produced as the waste decomposes.

Unlike traditional gas-fired reformers that cost millions and require massive infrastructure, the Ouro Reactor uses modified automotive industry components to achieve the same result at a fraction of the size and cost.

“Farmers in the U.S. and around the world are sitting on an untapped goldmine,” said Dr. Stephen Beaton, chief executive officer and founder of Circularity Fuels. “We’re giving them the ability to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need.”

Meeting aviation fuel demand

The demonstration – the first to electrically reform farm raw biogas from a lagoon digester into a jet fuel precursor without combustion – validates several critical innovations. The Ouro Reactor operates on standard electrical connections, uses industrially proven catalysts and processes raw biogas without expensive pretreatment. Importantly, it maintains stable operation despite the contaminants typically found in agricultural biogas that would damage conventional reformers.

The milestone comes as airlines face increasing mandates to incorporate SAF into their fuel mix, with current production meeting less than 1% of demand. The syngas produced by the Ouro Reactor can be converted into jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven industrial process that transforms carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons.

The lack of access to natural gas pipelines has prevented most agricultural biogas from being converted into renewable fuels. Circularity's Ouro Reactor addresses this problem by slashing reforming costs from millions to tens of thousands of dollars, making the technology affordable enough to deploy directly at large farms. When paired with scaled-down Fischer-Tropsch systems, these distributed units can produce liquid fuel on site that can be transported by truck or rail, eliminating the need for pipeline infrastructure entirely.

“For the first time, farmers will become renewable fuel producers without waiting for pipeline infrastructure that will never come,” Beaton said. “The liquid fuel can be trucked out using existing transportation networks, making energy production as straightforward as any other farm output.”

If deployed across all viable U.S. waste sites – including farms, landfills and wastewater treatment plants – biogas-to-SAF technology could produce 42 million gallons per day, meeting 70% of the nation’s jet fuel demand.

Circularity will showcase the technology next month at the SAF Global Summit in London, U.K., where airlines and fuel producers gather to address the industry’s supply challenges. The company plans to demonstrate complete biogas-to-SAF production later this year at a California farm, with commercial deployment targeted for 2026 across farms in California and beyond.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blte5a51c2d28bbcc9c/bltbe40cbea6cec3e55/67f989c255e7c7e418f54854/dairy_cows_in_front_of_dairy_digester_biogas_facility_-_GettyImages.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-19 12:56:59.447704

No official designation has been disclosed, but the aircraft appears relatively small, seemingly designed to carry six to twelve occupants. Its layout includes a T-tail, tricycle landing gear, and a passenger cabin with multiple windows. Photos also show another airframe under assembly, suggesting more than one prototype is under evaluation.

Like the US V-22, China’s tiltrotor combines vertical take-off and landing with the ability to transition to fixed-wing flight, enabling higher speeds and longer ranges compared with helicopters. Such capability could significantly enhance the operational flexibility of China’s amphibious forces, especially in shipborne missions.

Beyond military roles, analysts note that tiltrotors may also serve civilian markets such as offshore oil and gas transport or regional connectivity in areas with limited infrastructure.

Partnering with India’s flagship carrier, we are aligning national growth with global climate goals and setting a benchmark for the industry,” said AS Sahney, chairman of IndianOil.

The agreement was signed by Shailesh Dhar, executive director (Aviation), IndianOil, and P Balaji, group head – GRC and Corporate Affairs, Air India, in the presence of Sahney and Campbell Wilson, CEO & managing director of Air India.

Wilson said: “Through this MoU, Air India is committed to support the Government of India’s initiatives to promote sustainable development in the aviation sector and to further its own sustainability goals to achieve the IATA Net Zero by 2050 target.”

The partnership comes as Air India sharpens its sustainability portfolio. The airline, which has placed orders for 570 new aircraft, aims to operate one of the world’s lowest carbon-emitting fleets. “Alongside its fleet renewal, Air India is introducing more non-stop city pairs to reduce emissions, upgrading route planning and optimisation software and working closely with air traffic management to cut fuel burn,” said an airline official.

Air India has also entered into a research collaboration with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Indian Institute of Petroleum to develop and deploy SAF. On the ground, it has rolled out a series of green practices, including reducing single-use plastics, replacing inflight cutlery and dishes with lighter materials, carrying out more frequent engine and airframe washes, adopting single-engine taxiing, and deploying autonomous EV towing to conserve fuel.

The broader push aligns with India’s national target of 5 per cent SAF blending by 2030. Indian Oil has already taken the lead, becoming the first Indian company to secure ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery. The certification, issued under ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, validates that the fuel meets the toughest international sustainability and life cycle carbon standards.

Long-Term Recovery: A Sector on the Mend Despite the turbulence, the Canadian aviation sector is demonstrating resilience in its post-pandemic recovery.
In the long term, the Canadian aviation sector's potential is underpinned by its role in global connectivity and innovation.","The August 2025 operational suspension of Air Canada, triggered by a strike involving 10,000 flight attendants represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), has exposed the fragility of the Canadian aviation sector in the post-pandemic era. The strike, centered on disputes over unpaid boarding time and inflation-adjusted wages, led to the cancellation of over 1,700 flights, stranding 130,000 passengers and eroding investor confidence. Air Canada's stock plummeted 14.25% during the crisis, underscoring the sector's sensitivity to labor unrest and operational disruptions. Yet, beneath the immediate chaos lies a broader narrative of recovery, innovation, and structural challenges that investors must weigh when assessing the sector's long-term potential.

Short-Term Volatility: A Microcosm of Systemic Risks

The strike revealed critical vulnerabilities in Air Canada's business model and the wider industry. By refusing to compensate flight attendants for pre- and post-flight duties—such as safety demonstrations and galley checks—the airline exacerbated tensions with its workforce, leading to a prolonged labor action. The government's intervention via binding arbitration, while criticized as overreach by unions, highlighted the precarious balance between corporate interests, labor rights, and regulatory oversight.

The immediate financial fallout was severe. Air Canada suspended its 2025 financial guidance, citing uncertainty from the strike, and faced estimated daily EBITDA losses of C$75 million. The airline's reliance on a single unionized workforce for critical operations—ground handling, customer service, and flight operations—exposed it to systemic risks. Meanwhile, the cancellation of international and transcontinental flights disrupted Air Canada's 73% of 2024 revenue tied to non-domestic routes, compounding its financial strain.

This crisis mirrors broader trends in the aviation sector, where labor shortages, rising operational costs, and regulatory shifts (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel mandates) are creating a volatile environment. For investors, the key takeaway is that airlines with weak labor relations and rigid operational structures are particularly vulnerable to short-term shocks.

Long-Term Recovery: A Sector on the Mend

Despite the turbulence, the Canadian aviation sector is demonstrating resilience in its post-pandemic recovery. Passenger traffic at Canada's eight largest airports reached 4.7 million in May 2025, a 5.5% increase over pre-pandemic levels in May 2019. Domestic traffic has rebounded strongly, with a 6.7% year-over-year growth, while international travel outside the U.S. surged 16.2% compared to 2019. This recovery is driven by a surge in inbound tourism, fueled by Canada's natural attractions and aggressive marketing campaigns.

However, the sector's long-term health depends on its ability to adapt to evolving dynamics. Airlines are investing in digital transformation—biometric screening, AI-driven analytics, and touchless technologies—to enhance efficiency and passenger experience. Sustainability is also a priority, with carriers like Air Canada and WestJet exploring sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and energy-efficient aircraft. These initiatives align with Canada's net-zero emissions goals and could position the sector for long-term growth.

Government policies are further shaping the landscape. Infrastructure investments in terminal expansions and runway upgrades are boosting capacity, while regulatory reforms—such as the proposed Air Passenger Protection Regulations—aim to improve customer satisfaction. Yet, challenges persist, including U.S. trade tensions and the high cost of debt in a high-interest-rate environment.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Opportunity

For investors, the Air Canada strike serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of labor relations and operational flexibility. While Air Canada remains a dominant player, its recent struggles highlight the risks of over-concentration in a single operator. Competitors like WestJet and Porter, with stronger labor relations and more agile business models, may offer safer long-term bets.

The sector's recovery also hinges on macroeconomic factors. Rising labor costs and inflationary pressures could erode profit margins, particularly for low-cost carriers. Conversely, airlines that integrate fair compensation practices and proactive labor strategies—such as Alaska Airlines in the U.S.—are gaining a competitive edge. Investors should monitor key indicators, including fuel prices, interest rates, and regulatory developments, to gauge sector-wide risks.

In the long term, the Canadian aviation sector's potential is underpinned by its role in global connectivity and innovation. As air travel becomes more sustainable and digitized, airlines that prioritize ESG alignment and technological adoption will likely outperform. However, the path to recovery remains uneven, with transborder traffic to the U.S. declining and regional disparities in airport growth persisting.

1. Aircraft emit water vapour, soot, sulfur aerosols, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which contribute to the formation of contrails – clouds that form when water vapour condenses and freezes around small particles (aerosols) in aircraft exhaust. All of these factors have additional warming effects on the atmosphere. In this context, SAF has emerged as a credible alternative with the potential to reduce aviation-related emissions.

Story continues below this ad

2. According to aviation industry and energy experts, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

3. SAF, also known as aviation biofuel, is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil.

4. It is a ‘drop in’ fuel, meaning it can be blended with ATF without requiring any change in the existing machinery of aircraft.

5. SAF can be derived from a range of materials, including:

Story continues below this ad

— Oils and fats such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO), oil-rich seeds from plants, algae oils, animal fats,

— Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)

— Agricultural and forestry residues such as wood waste, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, husks and straw, sugars and starches.

6. There are various methods to produce SAF, with each using different combinations of raw materials. However, for SAF to be truly sustainable, it is important that the feedstock used in its production does not compete with food production, cause deforestation, or harm biodiversity.

Benefits of SAF

1. SAF offers multiple benefits. The primary advantage is its ability to significantly reduce emissions and its compatibility with the current global aircraft fleet. It means SAF can be used without modifications to existing planes, engines, or fueling infrastructure.

Story continues below this ad

2. It is estimated that SAF has the potential to reduce GHG emissions in air travel by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

3. Diversification of fuel sources in the aviation sector can help reduce import dependence and protect the sector from global oil price volatility. This, in turn, could lead to a more stable aviation sector, possibly making air travel accessible to larger sections of society

4. Moreover, SAF adoption will also generate employment opportunities in the sustainability sector.

Barriers to the widespread adoption of SAF

1. The cost of producing these biofuels, which is more than double that of conventional fuels, makes its large-scale adoption difficult for airlines without passing the burden onto consumers.

Story continues below this ad

2. The production, storage, blending, and transportation of SAF require the development of new infrastructure, which would add significantly to the initial cost of adoption.

3. Another key issue is the availability and sustainability of feedstock required for SAF production. The characteristics and variety of necessary feedstock mean that there is no guarantee of year-round supply.

BEYOND THE NUGGET: What is ISCC CORSIA?

1. Earlier this week, IOC became the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana. ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF.

2. ISCC CORSIA is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. Notably, the year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in.

3. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

Story continues below this ad

4. India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights.

5. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

India is set to begin commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale by December 2025. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest fuel refiner and retailer, has received international certification for manufacturing SAF from used cooking oil at its Panipat refinery. This marks step towards reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Recent Developments in SAF Production

IOC has secured the ISCC CORSIA certification, essential for commercial SAF production under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. The Panipat refinery will produce 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually from used cooking oil. This volume aligns with India’s target of 1 per cent SAF blending for international flights by 2027. The certification also sets a precedent for other Indian refiners to expand SAF manufacturing.

Feedstock Sourcing

The primary feedstock for IOC’s SAF is used cooking oil collected from large hotels, restaurants, and food manufacturers like Haldiram’s. While collection from big businesses is manageable, gathering used oil from smaller users and households remains a challenge. IOC plans to engage aggregators to streamline collection and ensure a steady supply of raw materials.

Importance of SAF in Aviation Decarbonisation

SAF is a biofuel made from sustainable sources with chemical properties similar to conventional jet fuel. Aircraft engines can use SAF blends without modification. Airbus states its planes can operate on up to 50 per cent SAF blend. Aviation experts estimate SAF will contribute over 60 per cent of the sector’s carbon reduction efforts globally. The move supports international commitments to curb emissions.

Regulatory Framework and Future Targets

India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee has set indicative SAF blending targets – 1 per cent in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028 for international flights. Domestic flight mandates are expected after 2027. These targets align with the global CORSIA framework, which requires airlines to offset carbon emissions growth beyond 2020 levels from 2027 onwards. The government is cautious about earlier mandates due to SAF’s higher costs and airline concerns.

Cost and Production Pathways

Currently, SAF costs roughly three times more than conventional jet fuel. IOC is exploring multiple production methods, including the alcohol-to-jet pathway using ethanol. Other Indian companies are developing SAF units based on various technologies. All must obtain certification before commercial operation. The higher cost remains a key barrier but is expected to decline with scale and innovation.

Global Market and Export Potential

Europe’s established SAF blending mandates make European airlines potential buyers of IOC’s SAF when flying into India. The global demand for SAF is projected to rise sharply in the coming years. IOC is actively exploring export opportunities to meet this growing market. The year 2027 is critical as CORSIA’s mandatory phase begins, increasing pressure on airlines worldwide to adopt SAF.",https://i0.wp.com/www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/logopeg.jpg?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-19 03:56:15.330927

Prelims: India’s indicative blending Target for SAF; CORSIA framework.

Mains: Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Advantages & Challenges.

India's first Sustainable Aviation Fuel Plant

IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil by the end of 2025.

Feedstock: The used cooking oil will be sourced by engaging aggregators from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors, which is otherwise discarded after use.

The capacity (35,000 tonnes per year) will be sufficient to meet the country’s 1% SAF blending requirement (for international flights) by 2027.

IOC has become the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana.

ISCC CORSIA Certification System:

ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production.

The certification sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

About Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks. SAF has chemistry and properties similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel (derived from crude oil) but with a smaller carbon footprint.

It can be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.

Sources of SAF:

Oil seeds, other fats, oils, and greases

Agricultural residues, Forestry residues, Wood mill waste

Municipal solid waste streams, Wet wastes (manures, wastewater treatment sludge)

It can also be produced synthetically via a process that captures carbon directly from the air.

Advantages of SAF:

Engine compatibility: Existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend (up to 50% blend) without modification.

Fewer greenhouse gas emissions: It is estimated that SAF alone is likely to account for over 60% of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

Sustainable: Raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, or is responsible for forest degradation.

More flexibility: SAF is a replacement for conventional jet fuel, allowing for multiple products from various feedstocks and production technologies.

Challenges Associated with SAF:

SAF is about three-four times more expensive than the price of regular jet fuel.

SAF success will require using a greater diversity of feedstock and production methods.

Moreover, collection of SAF would be a challenge. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households.

Key Facts:

International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) is dedicated to reducing carbon emissions from international civil aviation.

To mitigate the environmental impact of aviation, ICAO has set several aspirational goals:

Two Percent Annual Fuel Efficiency Improvement: Targeted through 2050.

Carbon Neutral Growth: Striving for no net increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from international aviation.

Net Zero CO2 Emissions from aviation by 2050.

These goals are encompassed under two major initiatives: Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the Long-Term Aspirational Goals (LTAG).

CORSIA Implementation Phases:

CORSIA will be implemented in three phases:

Pilot Phase (2021-2023): Voluntary participation by States.

First Phase (2024-2026): Also voluntary, but with expanded participation.

Second Phase (2027 onwards): Mandatory for all ICAO member states, including India.

India’s indicative blending Target for SAF:

In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are:

1% SAF indicative blending target in 2027 (Initially for International flights)

2% SAF blending target in 2028 (Initially for International flights)

5% by 2030.

The success of SAF will require using a greater diversity of feedstock and production methods. This includes areas such as investing in carbon offset programmes and the diversification of SAF feedstocks.

IOC is also working to set up units based on the alcohol-to-jet pathway, which involves using ethanol as a feedstock to make SAF.",https://i0.wp.com/compass.rauias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/daily-current-affairs-64ec4be4a6652.webp,N,,2025-08-19 02:56:14.622432

Continued wrangling on biofuel policy

U.S. industry groups continue to spar with the Trump administration over a proposal to slash incentives for biofuel imports. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal, which could be finalized before the end of the year, would allocate half as many renewable fuel credits to imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks as to domestic ones.

Livestock Tax Deferral regions announced for drought-affected producers

Cattle producers in large swaths of Western Canada and northwest Ontario will qualify for Livestock Tax Deferral in 2025, federal agriculture minister Heath MacDonald announced on Monday.

Effectively, U.S. biofuel plants using Canadian canola would earn 12 cents less per pound from fuel credits than if they used U.S. soybean oil, wrote FCC senior economist Justin Shepherd in an Aug. 13 report.

The American Petroleum Institute said in a letter to the EPA that the country lacks enough feedstock to meet federal quotas without imports.

“As proposed it is unworkable and would have significant harmful effects on the overall (Renewable Fuel Standard) program and could place upward pressure on fuel costs,” the institute said.

The institute also challenged the legality of the proposal.

U.S. producers, specifically soybean farmers, hailed the proposed shift as a victory, arguing the Renewable Fuel Standard was always intended to boost domestic production and that countries like China were flooding the market with cheap supply.

Canadian impacts

“Canada exports more vegetable oil – mainly canola – to the U.S. for biofuel production than it uses domestically,” Shepherd wrote.

Canada used a bit more than 1 million tonnes of vegetable oil for domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel, but exported 2.8 million tonnes to the U.S, he said.

The U.S. tax credit for biofuels has also shifted from being granted at the point of blending to a producer-based model. This changed excludes imported Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel.

“This adjustment may reduce opportunities for Canadian exports of these biofuels, leading domestically produced biodiesel and renewable diesel to seek alternative markets,” Shepherd said.

Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel output ramped up in 2024 as two new facilities came online, however the FCC report shows production dropped off as the new year began. It attributes this to uncertainty around the U.S. blender tax credit.

The EPA also announced higher-than-expected blending targets for 2026 and 2027, which boosted North American oilseed markets.

Hopeful signs?

“These considerations indicate that biodiesel and renewable diesel produced in Canada may face demand constraints,” wrote Shepherd.

However, the USDA projects that more than half of U.S.-produced soybean oil will be used for biofuels. This could send domestic and international buyers to Canadian vegetable oil as an alternative. Since canola oil is closely linked in price to soybean oil, it could see some market support.

Canadian oilseed producers could also see some opportunity down the line in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Sustainable aviation fuel production is produced via similar methods to renewable diesel and also typically uses vegetable oils as feedstocks.

“Canada does not have operational plants, though future development is anticipated,” Shepherd said.

The buyer, Conestoga Energy, will integrate SAFFiRE into its Kansas operations, where a pilot facility for the technology is expected to begin production in 2026. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

SAFFiRE holds an exclusive license for Deacetylation and Mechanical Refining, a process developed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab. The technology is designed to produce ethanol with an ultra-low carbon intensity for conversion into jet fuel. Under the agreement, Conestoga acquires all intellectual property, related technologies and the proposed pilot facility, along with key leadership staff including Chief Technology Officer Marykate O’Brien and Director of Engineering Nitin Kolhapure.

Conestoga CEO Tom Willis said the acquisition positions the company at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel development. “Sustainable aviation fuel represents a multibillion-dollar market opportunity, and this acquisition positions Conestoga at the leading edge of efforts to bridge the critical supply-demand gap facing the aviation industry while creating transformative opportunities for American agriculture,” Willis said.

Southwest originally invested in SAFFiRE in 2022 and took full ownership in 2024 through its renewable ventures platform. At the time, company leaders described the acquisition as central to its “Nonstop to Net Zero” sustainability plan. While Southwest did not comment on the reason for its divestment, the airline said it was proud to have supported SAFFiRE’s early-stage development and expressed confidence in Conestoga’s ability to advance the technology.

The transaction comes as the sustainable aviation fuel sector faces turbulence. World Energy, a major producer, recently suspended operations at its California facility after industrial gases group Air Products withdrew from a planned $2 billion expansion. World Energy CEO Gene Gebolys acknowledged the setback but maintained that progress in scaling up low-carbon fuels remains on track despite challenges.

The refinery has secured the ISCC CORSIA certification, a global benchmark under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s emissions offset scheme, validating its ability to produce SAF that meets stringent international standards. At launch, the facility will boast an annual production capacity of 35,000 tonnes, enough to satisfy India’s mandated 1% SAF blending requirement for international flights starting 2027, with expectations to scale to 2% by 2028.

The fuel’s feedstock will come from major hotel chains, restaurants, and snack manufacturers such as Haldiram’s—traditionally discarded after single use. IOC plans to collaborate with aggregators for efficient collection across the supply chain.

On World Biodiesel Day, a significant milestone was reached in sustainable fuel production by MOL Group. The company has successfully produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery. This achievement is part of a pilot project that also involves the generation of renewable diesel known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). This latest accomplishment is the second test of its kind for MOL Group, following an earlier successful pilot conducted at the Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These advancements underscore MOL Group’s technological capability and its dedication to alternative fuel solutions aimed at promoting environmental sustainability and energy security.

Collaboration at Rijeka Refinery

The pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was carried out in collaboration with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor for the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit. The project’s goal was to test the co-processing of 5% Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) along with traditional fossil feedstocks. A total of 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were utilized during this trial. An independent audit was conducted by Bureau Veritas d.o.o., which confirmed that the process met the parameters set by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard for sustainable biofuels.

Preparation and Testing Process

The preparations for the pilot project unfolded over a period of eight months, primarily due to the intricate nature of processing a novel type of feedstock alongside specific physical and chemical characteristics. Throughout the test runs, over 400 samples were diligently collected for analysis at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL). External laboratories, notably the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen, were also engaged to assess the biogenic content through a C14 analysis.

Further Developments at Bratislava Refinery

In a similar vein, earlier this year, the Bratislava Refinery achieved notable success with production tests involving diesel fuel infused with HVO and SAF. This HVO was derived from cashew nut shells, and in the SAF case, partially refined cooking oil was co-processed with conventional crude oil. These tests affirmed that the production unit at the Bratislava Refinery, dedicated to producing standard aviation kerosene, is also capable of manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel.

Innovative Co-Processing Method

Utilizing a co-processing method has been a common practice for MOL Group at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for several years. This method effectively reduces emissions associated with traditional fuels by blending plant waste products, where both bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously during production.

Strategic Commitment to Renewable Fuels

Renewable fuels play an essential part in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already recognized as a leader in biofuel markets in Hungary and the surrounding region, particularly for HVO produced from waste materials. This leadership is significant, as it meets the criteria for one of the most environmentally-friendly fuel options and positions MOL Group among the pioneers in aviation biofuel production in Europe.

MOL Group’s Vision for Sustainable Mobility

Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President for Fuels at MOL Group, emphasized that the company has been producing diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable sources and is poised to expand its production capabilities. This readiness and strategic commitment reaffirm MOL Group’s vision for sustainable mobility, whether for road transport or air travel. By becoming a comprehensive mobility service provider, the company can offer an even wider variety of fuels, fostering a seamless energy transition for customers.

Commercialization of SAF

MOL Group is actively involved in research and development, continuously exploring new possibilities for biofuel production and utilization. In 2022, in partnership with Budapest Airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Supply LLC, the company initialized commercial testing of SAF in Hungary. This initiative has led to the sale of SAF as a regular part of their operations in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, amounting to approximately 14 kilotons of biocomponents.

Technical and Environmental Standards

It is important to note that SAF can only be produced from traditional renewable feedstocks or from waste, complying with the same technical and environmental standards as conventional kerosene. Although very few refineries globally possess the capability to produce SAF, the current demand significantly surpasses supply, which reflects in the pricing dynamics. Thus, the ongoing developments by MOL Group hold strategic significance both for climate protection and the security of fuel supply.

Conclusion: A Step Towards Sustainable Logistics

MOL Group’s recent successful SAF and HVO production testing not only marks a crucial technological advancement but also signals an active commitment towards sustainable mobility. The emphasis on renewable fuels is vital, aligning with global energy trends and regulatory frameworks that prioritize reduced carbon footprints.

In the ever-evolving landscape of logistics, such advancements in fuel production resonate closely with modern transportation needs and environmental sustainability efforts.

The main market for the product will be Europe, which has SAF blending mandates for airlines operating on its territory.

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from waste materials such as cooking oil and biomass, is believed to be a necessary element of the energy transition due to the amount of emissions from the aviation industry, which amount to 2.5 per cent of the global total emissions of carbon dioxide.

However, sustainable aviation fuels are expensive to produce, which has made their transformation into a mainstream blending component for jet fuel problematic.

The high costs are attributable to the complex process required to turn waste fats and oils into biofuel and to a more challenging problem: the lack of sufficient waste fats and oils.

Reuters recently published a detailed look into the present state of SAF production globally and its immediate outlook. The picture painted by that article was not an optimistic one.

A number of large air carriers made commitments to buy significant amounts of sustainable fuels from startup producers only to change their minds later, likely when they realised the bill they would be facing.",https://theelectricityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SAF-Chile-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 17:56:50.709073

After weeks of talks, the government said on Friday it would not be providing financial support for the bioethanol sector, which is facing increased competition from imported US ethanol.

Vivergo, owned by Associated British Foods, said that would have meant continuing as a ""heavily loss-making"" business. As a result it is closing, with all staff due to be gone and the site ready for demolition by end of the year.

The government said it had decided a rescue would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry's long-term problems.

Bioethanol, can be made from waste oil or grains and is used as an additive to fuels, to reduce climate-damaging emissions. For example it is added to E5 and E10 petrol and sustainable aviation fuel.

In May the UK signed a trade deal which removed 19% tariffs on US-imported ethanol up to a quota of 1.4bn, roughly eqivalent to the size of the UK market.

It was one of the concessions made by the UK as part of a broader trade pact, that eased the tariffs that President Donald Trump had said he would impose on UK car and steel being imported across the Atlantic to the US.

Even before that trade agreement, the UK sector had complained that US imports had an unfair financial advantage as their ethanol is certified as a waste byproduct in the UK, whereas domestically-produced bioethanol is not.

Vivergo is one of two bioethanol sites in the UK which has said without support it will be forced to close.

The BBC understands that the other plant in Redcar, Teesside, which is owned by German firm Ensus, is waiting to hear whether the government will provide support to protect its CO2 production, a product widely used in industry, food production and healthcare.

Vivergo had also been planning to start capturing CO2 produced as part of the bioethanol making process, but had not yet started.

Ben Hackett, Vivergo's managing director described the government's decision not to provide a rescue package as a ""massive blow to Hull and the Humber"".

He said the government had decided the bioethanol sector was something that could be ""traded away"" and that it amounted to a ""flagrant act of economic self-harm"".

As well as the loss of its own staff, Vivergo warned there would be a knock-on effect on suppliers and customers. It would be hard for UK farmers to find alternative customers for wheat which is not food-grade, Mr Hackett said.

Andrew Symes, the chief executive of OXCCU, which makes sustainable aviation fuel, told the BBC's Today programme that the closure would make the UK reliant on imports for CO2 and for ethanol, which he described as ""risky"".

""I think that was probably what wasn't realised when the trade deal was done,"" he said.

The government said it had taken the decision ""in the national interest"" and that the tariff deal with the US had protected ""hundreds of thousands of jobs in sectors like auto and aerospace"".

A government spokesperson said it would work to support the companies through the closure process and that it was continuing to work on proposals that would ""ensure the resilience of our CO2 supply in the long-term"".

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB National Officer, said the government's commitment to green policies should mean a commitment to green jobs.

""A clean energy industrial strategy means nothing if we cannot protects plants long enough to deliver clean energy jobs here in the UK,"" she said.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2dde/live/deacf570-7c45-11f0-b34b-3f615028e3e9.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 11:56:07.882029

BirdLife International reports that the illegal wildlife trade brings in between $7 and $23 billion.

Ecological implications The extraction of wild birds as a class from their ecological niche can have very detrimental effects.
International responsibility The illegal wildlife trade is a cross-border crime that requires cross-border cooperation.","Nigeria’s customs agency caught more than 1,600 parrots and canaries headed to Kuwait. Officials call this the country’s ‘largest’ wildlife-trafficking bust by number.

The shipment was seized at Lagos’ Murtala Muhammed International Airport. This incident is indicative of a broader, ongoing issue – Nigeria as a source and transit point for illegal wildlife trade, which treaties such as CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) attempts to combat.

However, poor enforcement capability and scant border security allow wildlife traffickers to engage in business unhindered. Borders remain porous due to a lack of resources.

BirdLife International reports that the illegal wildlife trade brings in between $7 and $23 billion. This makes it the 4th most profitable cross-border crime right behind drugs, weapons, and human trafficking.

Singing competitions popular in some Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian regions have boosted the demand for songbirds like canaries. Rare parrots, some critically endangered, can exceed $1,000 per bird in global markets.

There is appeal beyond aesthetics. Some buyers desire rare feathers for fashion or home decoration. Others keep birds as status symbols. The trade has become so commonplace that complete smuggling networks exist that routinely source, transport, and launder illegally taken birds using fictitious documentation.

Ecological implications

The extraction of wild birds as a class from their ecological niche can have very detrimental effects. Parrots and other seed dispersers are extremely important in maintaining healthy ecosystems, in regenerating forests, and determining insect populations. Over-extraction is an all too real problem and has adverse effects by degrading habitats and diminishing biodiversity.

For species likely already facing pressures from deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and climate change, wildlife trafficking adds pressure to already limited populations and pushes species closer to extinction. Many parrot species in West Africa, including the African grey, have seen their wild populations drop by over 90% in some regions due to traps set up just for the wildlife trade.

This latest seizure marks a big win for Nigerian customs, but experts note that such captures are too infrequent. Nigeria plays a key role for smuggling networks because it directly links to other areas.

Animals trafficked out of Nigeria typically go first to a Middle Eastern or Asian countries before their final destination. Wildlife experts warn that unless funding continues and more severe consequences are established for traffickers, no real dent will be made in the illicit trade.

International responsibility

The illegal wildlife trade is a cross-border crime that requires cross-border cooperation. Supply countries are not the only ones that should have a shared accountability for their encroachment, and demand countries also need to be doing their share to help mitigate this trade.

If the consumer market for exotic pets and status-symbol animals continues to thrive, enforcement actions in the supply country will likely be of little effect.

Some conservation groups have called for more public awareness campaigns in nations that serve as a regular destination, in conjunction with stricter monitoring of captive-breeding claims, which is a frequent loophole in laundering wild-caught birds as ‘bred in captivity.’

For now, the fate of the birds will remain uncertain. Rehab and release is a huge challenge when the animals are not injured or stressed by the transport. As it stands, wildlife rescue centers in Nigeria are always underfunded and understaffed.

This crackdown underscores how big, lucrative, and complex wildlife trafficking is and serves as a reminder that there is a collective responsibility for all to be custodians for animals. They’re not commodities to be bought and sold, key players in our ecological web that sustains all life on Earth.",https://thred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/parrots-wildlifeSOS.png,N,,2025-08-18 14:56:58.834110

Discussing his work at United, Tom explains, “I feel a tremendous sense of pride working for United and playing a part in everything that we do to unite the world. The ability to board one of the most complex pieces of machinery created by man, fly at a speed of 500 mph at 37,000 ft and land safely at our destination is proof the system we have built is robust and healthy.”

Tom’s colleague Ken Allen of United Airlines says, “Whether it is upholding quality and mitigating risk in maintenance operations or establishing the operational protocol and viability for introducing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Tom is ready for the challenge. Tom’s approach to anything quality or compliance is not How can I make this better? but rather How do we make this better?”

This collaborative attitude shines through in Greif’s sentiments, such as his hopes for the future of aircraft maintenance.

Greif says, “We need to continue to foster a culture of industry-wide collaboration to evolve our safety and quality practices. We should never compete on safety nor rest in the pursuit of quality excellence.”

When asked about the accomplishment he’s most proud of, Greif answers, “The most notable accomplishment was leading United’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) quality initiatives which resulted in (United being) the first domestic airline to use SAF for regularly scheduled flights, first to complete the longest trans-Atlantic flight powered by SAF and first to complete a domestic flight powered by 100% SAF.”

Allen praises Greif for this achievement, He remains an industry go-to person in this space.”

Greif also offers advice to new professionals entering the aviation industry for the first time. He says, “Commercial aviation was built upon the shoulders of giants, and we have a responsibility to maintain those traditions but continue to evolve for the future. This industry has always been about building and maintaining relationships.”

Greif concludes, “If you are fortunate to have strong mentors early in your career, pay it forward later by mentoring new and upcoming leaders. Operate every day with a sense of pride, ownership and accountability.”","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/07/686fd123521e9e86a9e4e947-picture_1.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-18 11:56:13.108102

“We would be (producing) enough SAF to meet country’s demand. As of now, there is no mandate on SAF blending (in India). We can export too,” said IOC chairman Sahney. Indian Oil also plans to export the green aviation fuel and has said that the overseas demand is currently stronger than domestic.

SAF, or bio-jet fuel, is a low-carbon fuel used in aircraft and made from non-petroleum products such as ethanol, which results in lower emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. The blending of SAF with aviation turbine fuel (ATF) has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel.

India is yet to set rigorous SAF blending targets, but mandates are expected for one percent SAF blending with ATF for Indian airlines beginning 2027. For one percent blending of SAF in jet fuel, India would require around 140 million litres of SAF every year.

Indian Oil has already received ISCC CORSIA (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) mandate for SAF production, emerging as the only Indian company with the certification, which is mandatory for commercial SAF production.

As India aims to achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2070, the government has been focusing on shifting towards a greener economy, and the adoption of SAF is seen as a move in that direction. Globally, the aviation sector contributes around 12 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, and SAF is expected to help reduce this emission.

Through the SAF initiative, India is looking to boost the rural economy and help farmers increase their income. According to an estimate, just by one percent SAF blending, more than five lakh farmers could benefit from the supply of sugarcane as feedstock. The move promises to create over one lakh green jobs.

The government has already set the target of achieving 20 percent ethanol blending with petrol by October 2025.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2020/09/indian-oil-ioc.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 11:56:19.525730

What’s the ongoing story: Kerala’s health department has sounded an alert in Kozhikode district after three back to back cases of the rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) were reported in the region. One of the victims, a nine-year-old girl, died and two others, including a three-month-old baby, are battling for their lives.

Key Points to Ponder:

Story continues below this ad

— What is Naegleria fowleri or ‘brain-eating amoeba’ (rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) ?

— In which season is PAM more likely to occur?

— How does Naegleria fowleri infect people?

— What are the symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis?

— Read about the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).

— What steps should we take to stop the spread of PAM?

Key Takeaways:

— Amoebic meningoencephalitis is caused by Naegleria fowleri, known as the “brain eating amoeba”. It is a free-living amoeba found in warm, fresh water and soil, and infects people when it enters the body through the nose. This year, Kerala had eight confirmed cases and two deaths, including the one reported in Thamarassery in Kozhikode on August 14.

— Health department officials said there is no common factor among the three cases, which were reported from different villages in the district.

Story continues below this ad

— Sources said that when molecular diagnosis of meningoencephalitis was done, it was understood that apart from naegleria fowleri, another genus, acanthamoeba, also causes the illness.

— The first case of PAM in India was reported in 1971, and the first case in Kerala was reported in 2016. From 2016 to 2023, the state had only eight cases. Last year, Kerala had 36 positive cases and nine deaths.

— If the fatality of the disease is 97 per cent globally, Kerala has been able to bring it down to 25 per cent. All reported cases in India had led to the patient’s death until July 2024, when a 14-year-old boy in Kozhikode district became the first Indian to survive the disease. He was only the 11th PAM survivor in the world.

— One of the reasons for the spike in cases in Kerala has been increased testing for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) – a condition that can be caused by various diseases including amoebic meningoencephalitis – as well as other factors such as climate change and environmental pollution. Last year when Kerala faced a sudden spike in cases, the state issued a special treatment protocol and a standard operating procedure for the management of amoebic meningoencephalitis cases – the first state in India to do so.

Do You Know:

Story continues below this ad

— The initial symptoms of PAM include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Later on, the patient may experience a stiff neck, confusion, seizures, hallucinations, and slip into a coma.

— Scientists have not yet identified any effective treatments for the disease. Currently, doctors use a combination of drugs, including amphotericin B, azithromycin, fluconazole, rifampin, miltefosine, and dexamethasone for treatment.

— According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the rising global temperatures, the chances of getting Naegleria fowleri infection will go up as the amoeba mainly thrives in warm freshwater bodies. The organism best grows in high temperatures up to 46°C and sometimes can survive at even higher temperatures.

— India is home to a very large livestock population of 536.76 million, according to the 20th Livestock Census conducted in 2019, and is also seeing a boom in the practice of keeping pets or companion animals.

— Livestock include cattle, buffalo, goats, and sheep, as well as animals such as horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, camels, and pigs. India has the world’s largest population of cattle and buffalo, and the second-largest population of goats. The population of companion animals is estimated at 125 million, according to the draft guidelines.

— The livestock and companion animal sector plays a pivotal role in the country’s agricultural economy and rural livelihoods. The animal husbandry and dairying sector contributes about 30 per cent of the agricultural GVA and 5.5 per cent of the national economy.

— Given this context, there is an urgent need to formalise critical and emergency veterinary care services, including blood transfusion support across species, the draft says. Blood transfusion, it says, is “increasingly recognized globally as a life-saving intervention, essential for managing trauma, severe anemia, surgical blood loss, infectious diseases, and coagulation disorders”.

Story continues below this ad

— India, the draft notes, “lacks a national regulatory framework and standardized protocols guiding veterinary transfusion medicine with structured blood banking and transfusion practices”. Most animal blood transfusions are dependent on “hospital-available or client-owned donors, without consistent screening, blood typing, or standard operating protocols”.

— According to the government, the SOPs will address this situation “by providing structured, ethical, and scientifically sound guidance on donor selection, blood collection, processing, storage, transfusion procedures, and safety monitoring”.

— The veterinary blood banks will be hosted at veterinary colleges and universities, referral hospitals and polyclinics, large veterinary diagnostic centres, and multi-speciality animal hospitals operated by the government. The veterinary blood banks will function round the clock, according to the draft.

— Notably, the draft document prohibits monetary incentives to pet owners or livestock owners for the donation of the animal blood.

Do You Know:

— The volume of blood in both humans and animals ranges between 7 per cent and 9 per cent of body weight. Transfusion is required when the volume of blood falls below this level.

— Cattle have 55 ml of blood per kg of their body weight, and at an average weight of 300 kg, each head of cattle carries 16.5 litres of blood.

— Like humans, there are a large number of blood groups in animals, produced by species-specific antigens on the cell membrane of their red blood cells. There are 11 blood groups in cattle, 9 in dogs, 8 in horses, and 4 in cats, according to the draft guidelines.

India’s S&P rating upgrade

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national importance, Economic development.

Mains Examination: General Studies-III: Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilisation, of resources, growth, development and employment.

What’s the ongoing story: Last week was turning out to be a great one for the Indian economy even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a raft of reforms in his Independence Day speech. A day earlier, S&P Global Ratings had upgraded its rating on India to BBB from BBB-.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What is the Sovereign Credit Rating System?

— What are the credit rating agencies in India?

— Who regulates credit rating agencies in India?

— Read about the S&P rating.

— What is the significance of rating upgrade on India by S&P?

— What can be the implications of better rating by S&P for India?

— What are the reasons behind India’s improved S&P rating?

— Know about the SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999.

— Read about the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Key Takeaways:

— The sovereign rating upgrade by S&P is significant for two key reasons. One, it came after a gap of nearly two decades; and two, it has meaningful implications for the Indian economy.

— The Indian government has over the last several years aggressively pursued the three global agencies — S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings — for higher ratings that, in its opinion, better reflect the economy’s fundamentals. In fact, New Delhi has repeatedly expressed its displeasure over the agencies’ methodologies, saying they were biased against emerging economies. So, what has convinced S&P that now is a good time for India to be given an upgrade?

— The primary reason is clarity on the government’s finances. While the Centre has had a law called the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act since 2003 — it demands reducing the annual fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP — it has rarely been met.

— However, post the coronavirus pandemic, the fiscal deficit has been reduced aggressively from 9.2 per cent in 2020-21 to a targeted 4.4 per cent in 2025-26. Going forward, the Centre will start targeting a reduction in its debt-to-GDP from 57.1 per cent in 2024-25 to 49-51 per cent by 2030-31.

— Then there is growth. Despite GDP growth falling to a four-year low of 6.5 per cent in 2024-25, India remains one of the fastest growing large economies in the world — or in S&P’s words, “among the best performing economies in the world”. And this is real, or inflation-adjusted, growth; nominal growth — which is the actual increase in the GDP in today’s prices — is even higher.

— Another key factor has been the fairly low and stable domestic inflation, with S&P praising the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation management record.

— To be sure, India’s rating level with S&P has itself not changed — the country remains in the BBB category. It’s just that it has gone from the lowest edge of it, or BBB-, to a more secure position. The next step would be BBB+.

— Ratings are divided into two rough classes: investment and speculative grades. Entities, including countries, in the former class are worth investing in, while repayment of loans taken by those in the latter is difficult to predict. But even within the investment grade, there are steps, and BBB is the lowest.

— According to S&P, a BBB rating indicates “adequate capacity to meet financial commitments, but more subject to adverse economic conditions”. The next step is A, then AA, and finally, AAA, which signifies “extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments”.

– The implications of a better credit rating are clear — the Indian government should be able to borrow at a lower rate of interest. This has already occurred, with government bond yields in the secondary market on August 14 falling as much as 10 basis points, with the rupee’s exchange rate also getting a boost.

Do You Know:

— A credit rating is nothing more than a measure of an entity’s creditworthiness, or how likely it is that they may pay back borrowed money. If you pay back your loans and credit card bills on time and in full, your credit score improves. It is the same for countries.

— Most countries need to borrow money every year to fund some of their expenditures. The difference between the total income and the expenditure for a year is the fiscal deficit; the Indian government’s is Rs 15.69 lakh crore for 2025-26. This has to be met by borrowing money from the markets, with the government paying interest on it. Now, if the government is seen as being more likely to repay the loan — which is what a higher credit rating indicates — then the rate of interest is lower.

India’s first sustainable aviation fuel plant to start production by year-end

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national importance.

Mains Examination: General Studies-III: ScienceandTechnology- developments and their applications and effects in everyday life, Environmental pollution and degradation.

What’s the ongoing story: The country’s largest refiner and fuel retailer Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) expects to start producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on commercial scale at its Panipat refinery by December, following the recent international certification received by the unit for manufacturing the biofuel from used cooking oil, according to energy major’s chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?

— How is SAF different from conventional aviation fuel?

— What is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)?

— What are the key environmental benefits of adopting SAF in the aviation sector?

— Why is SAF referred to as a “drop-in” fuel?

— What are the primary feedstocks used in SAF production? How can India leverage its agricultural and waste resources to become a global exporter of SAF?

— How has India positioned itself in the global SAF landscape, and what are its national blending targets?

— What are the major global initiatives for promoting SAF adoption?

Key Takeaways:

— By the end of this calendar year, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil, which will be sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors like Haldiram’s, which normally discard cooking oil after single use.

— Earlier this week, IOC became the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana.

— ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. According to IOC, the certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

— SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend.

— The year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

— India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

The next leap forward

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national importance, economic and social development.

Mains Examination: General Studies-II, III: Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation, Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilisation of resources, growth, development and employment.

What’s the ongoing story: Ashok Gulati and Ritika Juneja write- “As the Tricolour was unfurled on India’s 79th Independence Day, the country stood proudly as a confident, resilient, and rising nation. It is not just the world’s largest democracy, but a country that has successfully crafted its destiny since attaining independence in 1947.”

Key Points to Ponder:

— As India has become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal terms and third-largest in PPP terms, what is the significance of this achievement?

— What are the challenges that remain for inclusive growth?

— Why do the issues of nutritional security still persist in India?

— Why is rationalising food and fertiliser subsidies the need of the hour?

— What measures should be taken to ensure efficiency and equity of subsidies?

— Why are increasing investments in agri-R&D and efficient value chains important?

Key Takeaways:

— “Just look at the last decade, India’s GDP has more than doubled. It is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by 2025, making India the fourth-largest economy, behind the United States ($30.5 trillion), China ($19.2 trillion), and Germany ($4.74 trillion) (IMF estimates).”

— “Measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, India is already the world’s third-largest economy at $17.65 trillion, trailing only China ($40.72 trillion) and the US ($30.51 trillion) in 2025. All this is a reflection of rising aspirations and India’s strong resolve to regain its civilisational legacy.”

— “When India gained independence in 1947, its GDP was around $30 billion. The population stood at 330 million, with an estimated 80 per cent living in poverty. The average life expectancy was a mere 32 years (1947), and literacy levels were just 18.3 per cent (1951). Foodgrain production stood at about 50 million metric tonnes (MMT).”

— “Fast forward to 2025: India’s population has increased to 1.46 billion, but poverty, measured at the $3/day (2021 PPP) threshold, has fallen to just 5.3 per cent, as per World Bank estimates. Literacy has surged to 77 per cent, while life expectancy has more than doubled to 72 years (2023). Foodgrain production has multiplied sevenfold, reaching 353.9 MMT in 2024-25. India is now the world’s largest rice exporter, shipping 20.2 MMT in FY25…India is a net exporter of agriculture, unlike the US and China, which are both net importers of agriculture. These are not mere statistics; they narrate the story of a country in motion.”

— “However, even as India has achieved food security, there are still many challenges: Nutritional security, especially of children under the age of five, remains pressing. This calls for a sharper focus on women’s education, improved maternal health, and continued emphasis on sanitation. The Modi government deserves compliments for making India open defecation free (ODF), which will help improve child nutrition.”

— “In the agri-food space, however, much more can be done. In particular, rationalising food and fertiliser subsidies needs to be put on high priority…While these subsidies are meant to shield vulnerable populations, they are plagued by large inefficiencies.”

— “Studies suggest that at least 20 to 25 per cent of these subsidies fail to reach intended beneficiaries. Though politically tempting, these subsidies come at the cost of productive investments.”

— “The next leap forward has to be rationalising subsidies and increasing investments in agri-R&D and efficient value chains. India’s future lies in empowering its citizens to innovate, invest, and generate sustainable incomes. Environmental sustainability has to be central to this journey. The quality of India’s soil, water, and air needs to be protected to attain the Viksit Bharat vision by 2047.

Stress tests for nuclear taboo

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance

Mains Examination: General Studies-II: Important International institutions, agencies and fora- their structure, mandate

What’s the ongoing story: C. Uday Bhaskar writes- “The bombing of Hiroshima with an atomic weapon on August 6, 1945, that killed almost 1,40,000 people and led to the end of World War II is a pivotal event in global history. It marked the dawn of the apocalyptic atomic age, wherein nuclear weapons demonstrated their enormous destructive capability — first in Hiroshima and three days later over Nagasaki. Progressively, a norm was internalised globally that Nagasaki would be the last time that a nuclear weapon would be used militarily. And so, the nuclear taboo was born.”

Key Points to Ponder:

— How did the bombing of Hiroshima also mark the start of a new way of thinking about war, peace, and the use of force?

— What was the Cuban missile crisis?

— What is the doctrine of MAD — mutually assured destruction?

— What is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)?

— Is India part of the NPT? What is the purpose of the NPT?

— What is India’s Nuclear doctrine?

— India’s nuclear power programme

— Read about the Helsinki Accords.

Key Takeaways:

— “It is a matter of considerable relief that the nuclear-weapon nations of the world have so far respected the sanctity of the nuclear taboo. But the run-up to the 80th anniversary suggests that the taboo is under stress in a very unexpected manner. The recent war of words between the US and Russia, laced with menacing references to nuclear weapons, is cause for deep concern and augurs ill for global nuclear stability and restraint.”

— “The US and Russia (which inherited the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union) were the two superpowers of the Cold War decades and had amassed thousands of nuclear weapons of varying yields. After the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis that saw these two nations stepping back from the precipice, they arrived at a modus vivendi that neither nation would use the dreaded nuke except to “deter” the other. Thus was born the deterrence doctrine of MAD — mutually assured destruction — an anomalous form of ensuring “security” in a SAD manner: Self-assured destruction.

— “To regulate the spread of nuclear weapons, the two superpowers introduced the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) in 1970, and while this had no legitimacy in law, it was a de facto imposition of realpolitik and techno-strategic power. The world was divided into the nuclear haves — the first five nuclear weapon powers (US, USSR/Russia, UK, France, and China) — and the permanent nuclear have-nots, who were compelled to forego the option of ever acquiring nuclear weapons.”

— “The quid pro quo was that the latter, the NNWS (non-nuclear weapon states), would have access to civilian nuclear technology, and they would not be threatened by an NWS (nuclear weapon state). Concurrently, the NWS agreed to “negotiate in good faith” towards disarmament — this remains the elusive Holy Grail.”

– “In summary, the world had evolved two norms to ensure the sanctity of the nuclear taboo. One, that nuclear weapons would not be brandished to resolve territorial disputes (Pakistan was rebuked for its attempt to do so in the 1999 Kargil War), and secondly, the sovereignty of a NNWS would not be violated without legitimate sanction.”

— “There was no sabre-rattling for almost three decades, from 1991 till 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Moscow found it necessary to invoke its nuclear capability.”

— “This was a major setback to the deterrence template and agreements such as the 1975 Helsinki Accords that sanctified the inviolability of borders in Europe. This was compounded in June 2025 when Israel, not an NPT signatory, attacked Iran, a NNWS, on the assumption that Tehran was about to acquire a nuclear weapon in violation of its NPT commitment.”

— “The more alarming exigency is a breakdown in US-Russia relations and an unintended military escalation. While the probability is low, it merits notice that both nations possess the world’s largest nuclear arsenals — Russia with 5,459 warheads and the US with 5,177 (Federation of American Scientists’ 2025 report on the Status of the World’s Nuclear Forces).”

— “Even a limited exchange could cause catastrophic loss of life. A 2019 Princeton University simulation estimated 91.5 million casualties in the first few hours of a US-Russia nuclear war, with long-term effects like radioactive fallout and global cooling adding to the atomic apocalypse.”

Do You Know:

— The NPT is an international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of disarmament.

— In 1968, the NPT came into existence. The treaty defines nuclear-weapon states as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967 – the US, Russia (formerly USSR), the UK, France and China – and effectively disallows any other state from acquiring nuclear weapons.

— While the treaty has been signed by almost every country in the world, India is one of the few non-signatories.

,,2025-08-18 12:37:20+00:00,www.argusmedia.com,US refiners ready for heavy crude return | Latest Market News - Argus Media,Argus Media,,,,,https://www.argusmedia.com/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2722191-us-refiners-ready-for-heavy-crude-return,"US refiners are expecting a boost from returning medium and heavy crude supplies from Canada, Venezuela and the Opec+ group of countries.
This means the group will have restored all of a scheduled 2.46mn b/d increase in six months.
Forward markets show heavy crude at a $9-10/bl discount to light crude in the third quarter and a $13/bl discount in the fourth quarter, he says.
There is potential for that heavy crude discount to get even larger sometime in 2026, Ledbetter says.
Marathon is also looking forward to having access to more heavy crude produced in California because of the upcoming closures of two large refineries in the state, Hessling says.","US refiners are expecting a boost from returning medium and heavy crude supplies from Canada, Venezuela and the Opec+ group of countries.

About 2mn-2.5mn b/d of medium and heavy crude should be returning to the market in the autumn, coinciding with seasonal refinery maintenance, US independent PBF Energy chief executive Matthew Lucey says. This will cause light-heavy spreads to widen in the third and fourth quarters, he says. Additional supplies will be ""a huge tailwind going forward"" for PBF by lowering the cost of feedstocks, which has ""a dollar-for-dollar impact"" on the company's bottom line, Lucey says.

US sanctions against Venezuela pulled about 200,000 b/d out of the US Gulf coast market and Canadian wildfires took about 5mn bl of June supply off the market, Valero's chief operating officer Gary Simmons says. ""Things will get better,"" probably starting in the fourth quarter, he says.

Marathon Petroleum chief commercial officer Rick Hessling says that he sees ""positive trends"" in Canadian oil for his company's refineries that consume large amounts of heavy and medium crude. These include less competition for supply because of turnarounds at the US Gulf coast in the autumn. ""The signals and the differentials are already beginning to change,"" he says. Mars and WCS crudes have fallen by $0.70-1.00/bl against benchmark WTI prices since late July (see graph).

Meanwhile, Chevron-linked oil tankers have converged on Venezuela's main terminals. One is already carrying a cargo of Boscan crude from Bajo Grande and another Hamaca crude from the Jose terminal. The movements suggest Chevron has resumed loading Venezuelan crude for export in August under its restricted US licence. Chevron said previously that it expects limited oil flows to resume from Venezuela to the US this month after the administration of President Donald Trump reversed course on an earlier decision to cancel its licence to operate.

Re-engagement rings

In another supply boost, eight predominantly sour crude producers in Opec+ will raise their collective production target by 547,000 b/d in September, matching an increase in August. This means the group will have restored all of a scheduled 2.46mn b/d increase in six months. US refiners have not seen that much of this rise in Opec+ production so far because of higher oil burn at power stations in the Mideast Gulf in the summer, Simmons says. ""As we move out of summer, more of those barrels will make their way to the market,"" he says. Valero has recently ""re-engaged"" with historic partners in the Middle East, Simmons says, suggesting to him that Opec's Mideast Gulf members plan to sell more crude to the US.

HF Sinclair commercial vice-president Steven Ledbetter agrees that higher Opec+ production is not yet having an impact on light-heavy crude spreads in the US market. But it will in the longer term, together with Canadian production exceeding pipeline export capacity, he says. Forward markets show heavy crude at a $9-10/bl discount to light crude in the third quarter and a $13/bl discount in the fourth quarter, he says. There is potential for that heavy crude discount to get even larger sometime in 2026, Ledbetter says.

Marathon is also looking forward to having access to more heavy crude produced in California because of the upcoming closures of two large refineries in the state, Hessling says. The firm's 365,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery ""will have access to a lot of local California crudes"" to which it currently has limited or no access, he says. Valero is planning to shut or repurpose its 145,000 b/d Benicia refinery near San Francisco by April and Phillips 66 plans to shut its 139,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery complex by the end of this year.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-08-18 09:56:47.380777

The global aviation industry continues to make significant progress toward achieving the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation's net-zero target, driven by efforts to reduce carbon intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. In parallel, the US, at both federal and state levels, has introduced various incentives to support the growth of low-carbon fuels, including SAF, contributing to a steady rise in production and consumption.

Following extensive feedback from market participants, Platts identified a clear demand for transparent, market-based SAF assessments. Additionally, stakeholders, particularly airlines and aviation fuel buyers, have expressed the need for assessments that reflect the market value of SAF, independent of environmental credits such as Renewable Identification Numbers, Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits and 45Z tax credits.

Platts has therefore launched four SAF assessments that exclude environmental credits, in response to market feedback that the value of SAF with credits detached is a more widely used price reference, particularly among airlines seeking clarity on the intrinsic value of SAF itself.

The new assessments have the following specifications:

SAF (H-S) California (credits detached)

The California neat SAF (HEFA-SPK) assessment is published as an outright price in US cents/gallon, as well as a premium to the Platts Jet Kero LA pipeline (PJAAP00) assessment. The assessments are exclusive of the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard carbon credit, federal SAF tax credit and D4 biomass-based diesel Renewable Identification Number. This is assessed on a delivered at place basis and reflects SAF delivered via rail car or barge to Los Angeles. Neat SAF delivered to other locations within California, such as San Francisco, is also considered, but may be normalized back to the basis location.

SAF (H-S) Illinois (credits detached)

The Illinois neat SAF (HEFA-SPK) assessment is published as an outright price in US cents/gallon, as well as a premium to the Platts Jet Kero Chicago pipeline (PJAAF00) assessment. The assessment excludes the Illinois SAF tax credit, federal SAF tax credit and D4 biomass-based diesel RINs. It is assessed on a DAP basis and reflects SAF delivered via rail car or barge to the Chicago area.

Both assessments reflect delivery five to 25 days forward.

The assessments reflect a minimum volume of 1,000 barrels, meeting the ASTM D7566 standard specification for Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (SPK-HEFA), as referenced in Annex A2, using feedstocks such as vegetable oils, waste oils, fats, tallow and other similar feedstocks. Platts is not considering SAF produced from palm oil or palm fatty acid distillate within the assessment. The values reflect a reference carbon intensity of 42gCO2e/MJ.

The assessments consider information reported to Platts and published as heards throughout the day, including firm bids and offers, trades and indicative values, as well as any other data deemed relevant to the assessment process.

The assessments reflect a 13:30 Houston time market close and follow the Platts US publishing schedule.

The new SAF assessments are published against the following symbols:

Based on the new policy, 242 oil and gas companies globally have been excluded.
“It is ultimately up to our investment managers to decide whether to allocate to these companies,” says Marcel Roberts, CIO of SPMS.
At the moment, SPMS invests in eight oil and gas companies, including Shell, Total and Eni.","The Dutch pension fund for self-employed medical specialists (SPMS) will only invest in oil and gas companies that want to commit to the goals of the Paris Agreement or commit at least 20% of their annual capital expenditure to renewable energy projects, according to the fund’s annual report.

The new policy follows from a survey among participants about their sustainability preferences.

This showed that only a minority of 22% want to exclude fossil fuels altogether. However, 62% want their pension to invest sustainably, the survey showed.

A majority of active members also expect SPMS to assume “a leading role” when it comes to sustainable investments. This is not the case for pensioners, who are less ambitious in this regard.

Climate benchmarks

The new fossil fuel policy only applies to the pension fund’s actively managed equity portfolios for European equities and emerging market equities, as well as to European and US corporate bonds.

This is because SPMS considers that the new policy would “interfere” with the climate transition benchmark it has been running for its passively managed equity portfolios (developed market equities excluding European equities) since 2022, implementing an annual CO2 reduction of 7%.

Climate transition benchmarks are already heavily underweight to oil and gas companies compared to regular indices.

Capital expenditure

SPMS has now determined that investments in oil and gas companies in the actively managed portfolios may only be made if they allocate more than 20% of their annual capital expenditure to renewable energy and/or technology that supports this, such as battery storage, hydrogen, charging station infrastructure or lithium extraction. Investments in carbon storage also count.

The pension fund’s sustainability adviser, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, checks annually which companies meet this criterion. Based on the new policy, 242 oil and gas companies globally have been excluded. Investments can still be made in a small number of firms, which are mostly headquartered in Europe.

As per The Economic Times report, Chairman A. S. Sahney confirmed, “Indian Oil Corporation, the country’s largest refiner, will begin producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in December.” The dedicated SAF unit at Panipat, Haryana, will deliver 35,000 tonnes per year, a capacity designed to meet all of India’s mandated international aviation requirements by 2027.

Blending Mandates, Costs and Feedstock Assurance

As per news reports, India has rolled out a phased blending obligation for SAF in jet fuel, starting at 1% for international flights in 2027, ramping up to 2% by 2028. While sustainable aviation fuel is expected to cost nearly 3 times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF), Sahney said airlines “must comply with the blending mandate” so the company will not struggle to secure buyers. If local demand does not absorb Panipat’s full output, Indian Oil will consider exports.

Used cooking oil (UCO) has been selected as the feedstock for this SAF initiative. Sahney explained, “Arranging feedstock is not a challenge. There is an ample collection of UCO in the country, most of which is currently exported.” The corporation will leverage established UCO supply chains, drawing oil predominantly from large hotels, restaurant groups, and traditional snack producers.

Certification and Unique Market Position

The Panipat facility has been awarded ISCC CORSIA certification, a requirement for commercial-scale SAF production. Sahney noted that Indian Oil is “currently the only company in India to hold this certification for producing SAF from used cooking oil,” which remains valid for the next year. This milestone firmly establishes Indian Oil as a pioneer in India’s sustainable aviation sector, particularly for SAF derived from UCO.

China National Aviation Fuel Company just snapped up another stake in a privately run sustainable aviation fuel plant, showing it’s ready to back cleaner alternatives even before nationwide rules roll in.

What does this mean?

China is making a serious play to decarbonize its skies. The country’s top aviation fuel supplier, CNAF, is throwing support behind Henan Junheng’s plant in Puyang, which turns used cooking oil into sustainable jet fuel. That facility is on track to more than double its output to one million metric tons a year by June 2026. This follows CNAF’s $36 million move to buy into another SAF supplier last year. While there’s still no official nationwide mandate for greener jet fuel, China started requiring SAF on some outbound domestic flights from major hubs in March. Add in China’s deep well of used cooking oil and the country is positioning itself to slash aviation emissions in a big way.

Why should I care?

For markets: China’s SAF play could spark global change.

China is the world’s second-biggest market for aviation fuel, so its push into SAF matters for both investors and airlines. With global SAF demand expected to surge tenfold this decade, local suppliers and carriers are well-positioned to drive standards and shape supply chains both in Asia and beyond. As investment picks up, Chinese companies could lead a new wave in low-carbon aviation—and that’s likely to catch the attention of global players looking to keep up.

The bigger picture: China’s head start could set the pace for green aviation.

China’s preemptive moves in sustainable jet fuel signal momentum even before detailed regulations are in place. Boosting homegrown biofuel production can shrink emissions for one of the busiest air networks on Earth and help meet national climate goals.

On Aug 15, the carrier signed an agreement to use 1,200 cubic metres (cu m) of this fuel, blended in Vietnam and supplied by Petrolimex Aviation, the fuel subsidiary of Petrolimex, which is the country’s state-owned national petroleum company and largest distributor of oil products.

The airline said in a recent statement that its fleet, with 576 modern aircraft on order, would increasingly incorporate this fuel, which it said can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent, compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

Petrolimex Aviation said in a separate statement that it is the first company in Vietnam to master the technology behind blending aviation fuel that meets international standards.

The partnership between Vietjet and Petrolimex Aviation builds on their cooperation in October 2024, when they operated the first two flights using this fuel.

The following month, the Vietnamese low-cost airline ran the “Green Friday” promotional campaign in Singapore, touting its new-generation fleet that is significantly more economical with fuel, and also reduces emissions and noise. In its responses to media queries, the firm said the promotion reflected its adoption of the sustainable aviation fuel.

The Green Friday campaign was, however, short-lived. In January, the campaign was pulled in Singapore after the city-state’s advertising watchdog found the company’s claims about its fleet’s reduced fuel consumption and emissions misleading, and applicable only to certain combinations of aircraft and engine types.

It is not immediately clear how many Vietjet flights would be powered by the bumped-up volume of this greener fuel.

Data suggests that the Airbus A321neo, commonly used by Vietjet, would typically use about 5 cu m of fuel for a two-hour flight; 1,200 cu m of fuel could therefore power about 240 such short- to medium-haul flights.

Airbus noted in its website that the model is currently able to fly on up to a 50 per cent blend of the sustainable fuel and conventional fuel, with a target to increase to 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel capability by 2030.

As at the end of the first quarter, Vietjet was running a fleet of 99 Airbus aircraft, including seven A330s, 21 A320s and 71 A321s.

The green aviation fuel it uses is blended in Petroleum’s Nha Be Oil Depot in Ho Chi Minh City, using imported synthetic blending components – hydrocarbons produced from biologically renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass and urban waste.

Before Vietjet, national flag-carrier Vietnam Airlines flew a commercial flight from Singapore to Hanoi in May 2024 using sustainable fuel; that fuel was, however, produced and supplied by international partners.

In the first half of 2025, Vietjet reported consolidated revenue of about US$1.4 billion, up 5 per cent from a year ago. Its pre-tax profit was US$61 million, 65 per cent higher than in the year before.

Analysts from Vietcap, a brokerage firm, said that Vietjet achieved higher gross profit margin in Q2, at 13.5 per cent, on the back of strong passenger numbers, effective cost control and low jet fuel prices.

In the first six months of this year, Vietjet, including Vietjet Thailand, transported 17.7 million passengers and nearly 65,200 tonnes of cargo.

Vietnam welcomed nearly 10.7 million international arrivals during the period, a 21 per cent year-on-year increase; the figure was 26 per cent higher than that in 2019, pre-pandemic.

Production and adoption

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in June that the production of sustainable aviation fuel is expected to reach two million tonnes or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director-general, said: “Even that relatively small amount will add US$4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

Under the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub blueprint launched in February 2024, flights departing from Singapore will be required to use this sustainable fuel from 2026; 1 per cent of the total fuel used for such departures will be of the sustainable type, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Airports like Changi now offer fuelling with this greener fuel. Singapore Airlines and Scoot are already using the fuel produced by Neste, which runs the world’s largest sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Singapore.

However, despite biofuels’ clean energy profile and growing global demand, they cost more to produce and face competition from fossil fuels, said GlobalData in a report in May.

Global integrators like UPS, FedEx, DHL and Agility Logistics Chile SA maintain significant operations via charter and scheduled freighters and extensive forwarding networks.
Prospects ahead until 2030 Looking ahead from mid 2025, Chile’s airfreight sector is poised for moderate but steady expansion.","Chile’s air cargo sector has demonstrated steady growth and strategic dynamism in recent years. In 2024, Santiago’s Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport (SCL) handled 409,824 tonnes of cargo – a 14% increase compared to 2019 and a 1.5% rise over 2023 – making it the country’s undisputed cargo hub. Exports of salmon and cherries dominate the mix, representing approximately 61% and 28.3% of volumes respectively, with the United States as the top destination by far.

In terms of productivity, Chile’s airfreight volume stood at 1.33 billion tonne kilometres in 2023, and forecasts expect this to rise to 1.38 billion by 2028, implying a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 0.6%. The national freight and logistics segment overall is projected to grow from $20.1 billion in 2024 to $27.9 billion by 2030 (CAGR 5.6%) – underpinned by major infrastructure investments in ports, roads, railways and customs facilities.

Cargo airports, major airlines and forwarders

Santiago’s Arturo Merino Benítez is by far the primary cargo gateway for Chile. Its facilities serve LATAM Cargo and other operators; salmon, cherries and high value perishables flow through in temperature controlled conditions. A second airport, Concepción (Carriel Sur, CCP), while mainly domestic, this airport functions as an alternate international airport and may handle overflow cargo when SCL is constrained. The other 17 commercial regional airports are less significant in airfreight volumes, which remain concentrated at these two hubs.

LATAM Cargo Chile is the dominant domestic-sector carrier. Operating out of Santiago, its fleet of six Boeing 767 freighters serves roughly 21 destinations across South America, North America and Europe, alongside belly hold cargo in LATAM’s passenger flights. In response to perishable goods demand, LATAM added freighter capacity and increased weekly frequencies, especially for cherries during the 2023–24 season, to export over 7,500 tonne of cherries (a 32% increase year over year).

Avianca Cargo, though based in Colombia, serves Santiago regularly and is expanding its presence. Plans announced include introducing multiple Airbus A330 freighters to boost capacity by up to 70%, contributing to Chilean connectivity.

Global integrators like UPS, FedEx, DHL and Agility Logistics Chile SA maintain significant operations via charter and scheduled freighters and extensive forwarding networks. DHL and UPS have also embraced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Chile, echoing LATAM’s shift toward environmental efficiency.

The Chilean airfreight forwarding market is competitive, featuring both national and multinational players: Samex, KLog.co, Andes Logistics Group, Pedro Serrano and Balmoral Chile are among the top Santiago based forwarders focused on airfreight, ocean freight, warehousing and consultancy services.

Membership in global networks like Globalia Logistics Network and Conqueror Freight Network is increasingly common among medium and small forwarders aiming to enhance international reach and sales leads. Larger multinationals like UPS, FedEx and DHL often lead individual player rankings in market share, but smaller forwarders remain competitive through specialisation in e commerce, cold chain logistics, customs consultancy or niche routes.

Chile’s government has supported the logistics sector robustly. Between 2020 and 2022, it invested $1.9 billion in railway infrastructure through the state rail company EFE – aiding intermodal connections with airports and ports. A wider $17.6 billion infrastructure roadmap (2024 2028) includes rail expansions, customs facility upgrades and port modernisation, with completion targets around 2026.

Environmental sustainability is also top of mind. The government has outlined plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale by 2030, aiming for SAF to meet 50 % of aviation needs by 2050. Meanwhile, major carriers such as LATAM Cargo, UPS are already using SAF blends, reducing lifecycle emissions significantly and positioning Chile as a regional leader in green logistics.

E commerce growth is a critical driver. In Chile, cross border e commerce categories—particularly apparel (59%) and electronics (51%)—are increasing airfreight demand. Forwarders now offer integrated solutions combining air cargo with last mile delivery and digital tracking tools.

Prospects ahead until 2030

Looking ahead from mid 2025, Chile’s airfreight sector is poised for moderate but steady expansion. Volume forecasts suggest cargo tonne kilometres rising from 1.33 billion in 2023 to around 1.38 billion in 2028 (0.6% CAGR). Economic and logistics market growth is expected to deliver stronger momentum: the overall freight and logistics market is projected to grow at 5.5% per annum, reaching $27.9 billion by 2030; air cargo volume should benefit via modal share gains and efficiency gains from digital platforms and infrastructure modernisation.

Perishables exports, such as cherries, seafood and salmon are expected to remain a core component of international airfreight from Chile. LATAM Cargo’s expansion of cherry specific freighter flights and new interline routing to Asia and North America illustrates evolving responsiveness to seasonal demand.

Competition dynamics will evolve as regional carriers like Avianca scale their freighter fleets in South America, offering alternatives to LATAM dominance and diversifying routings out of Santiago. Smaller forwarders may see opportunity in niche verticals (e commerce, cold chain, customs compliance), aided by membership in global networks and digital platforms, enabling them to compete for cross border shipments and higher value contracts.

Conclusion

Chile’s airfreight industry is grounded in strong fundamentals: a dominant cargo hub in Santiago, rising exports of perishables, modernising infrastructure and a logistics market that embraces digital transformation and sustainability. While growth in pure tonne kilometres is expected to be modest – the 1.33 billion tonne kilometres in 2023 rising to approximately 1.38 billion by 2028 – value added segments and technological efficiencies are likely to deliver stronger commercial impact.

Over the next five years, continued investment in cold chain facilities, SAF expansion, and digital logistics platforms will shape a progressively more efficient and sustainable Chilean air cargo ecosystem, enhancing its role within Latin America’s supply chain architecture.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1024px-Terminal_Aeropuerto_Pudahuel.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 09:57:12.821368

Major Challenges in Aviation Fuel Industry

The primary factor preventing the aviation fuel market from expanding is expected to be the cost of fuel. The high cost is likely to be a barrier to market expansion. Since jet fuel is a derivative of Brent crude oil, the reason for the rise in fuel prices is the higher price of Brent crude oil. The price of Brent crude oil is rising as a result of the mismatch between supply and demand. Despite the rising demand for Brent crude oil, prices are driven up by the lack of production. Saudi Arabia, one of the founding members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), significantly cut back on its crude oil production. They claimed that the weakening global economy and rising interest rates in some western countries were the reasons behind the production cut, which accounted for 2% of global supply.

The market is predicted to suffer since low-income nations might not be able to pay the exorbitant airfares brought on by these factors. Asia Pacific and Africa are two of the price-sensitive regions. Due to their lower per capita incomes, developing countries in the region are unable to purchase pricey tickets.

Competitive Landscape

ExxonMobil is expected to generate USD 339.9 billion in 2024, followed by Chevron with USD 194.7 billion, Total with USD 210.2 billion, Shell with USD 302 billion, and Reliance Petroleum with USD 15.7 million. These are the top five companies in the aviation fuel industry. Each business contributes to the growth of the regional aviation fuel sector.

Regional Outlook

North America held the largest aviation fuel market in 2024 due to its robust commercial aviation sector, ongoing additions of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), and robust regulatory support. SAF gained popularity due to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and incentives for producing biofuel. The continued use of conventional and alternative aircraft fuels was ensured by major airlines and regional defense operations.

Asia-Pacific expanded at the fastest rate in 2024 due to aggressive fleet growth, a growing middle class, and more people traveling. Much money was spent on creating SAF throughout the region, particularly in Southeast Asia, China, and India. As defense spending increased and infrastructure improved, both the military and the civilian sectors required more types of aviation fuel.

Europe is significantly ahead in 2024 due to its stringent environmental laws, such as the EU ETS (Emissions Trading System), which mandated SAF blending and carbon pricing. SAF production and usage increased as a result of the region's focus on decarbonizing aviation and collaboration between airlines and fuel suppliers. Power-to-liquid fuels and hydrogen are also very popular in the European market.

The LAMEA aviation fuel market grew steadily in 2024. Due to its extensive refinery capacity and importance on international aviation routes, the Middle East had a significant impact. Regional air travel increased in Latin America, and new airline routes and infrastructure upgrades in Africa increased demand. Comparatively speaking, this region's adoption of SAF was still quite low.

Understanding the formation mechanisms of these scatterers is crucial for understanding mantle dynamics and chemical evolution. Previous studies suggest that their formation is linked to the structural phase transition of SiO2 from stishovite to post-stishovite in the subducted oceanic crusts, with variations in Al and H content potentially influencing the transition depth. However, earlier experiments on (Al, H)-bearing stishovite phase transition were conducted only at high pressures and 300 K, limiting our ability to quantify the relationship between variations in subducted oceanic crust composition and small-scale scatterers in the lower mantle. In this study, we investigate the phase transition of (Al, H)-bearing stishovite under simultaneously high pressure and temperature conditions. Our results reveal that the incorporation of 0.01 a.p.f.u Al into stishovite with H/Al ratio of ~1/3 lowers the transition pressure by 6.7(3) GPa. However, the Clapeyron slope of this transition is nearly unaffected by changes in the Al content and has a value of 12.2-12.5(3) MPa/K. According to our results, Al content variation ranging from 0 to 0.07 a.p.f.u in SiO2 can reasonably explain the depth distribution from 800 to 1900 km of the seismic scatterers observed in the circum-Pacific region.

These issues are not isolated; they reflect systemic bottlenecks in Australia's energy infrastructure.
The Albanese government's ability to deliver on these fronts will determine whether Australia's energy transition remains aspirational or becomes a reality.
Australia's renewable energy infrastructure is at a defining moment.
The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon—it is a present-day imperative, and firms like Ampol are leading the charge.","Australia's energy transition is at a pivotal crossroads. As global demand for decarbonization accelerates, traditional energy firms are no longer passive observers but active participants in reshaping the sector. Among them, Ampol stands out as a case study in strategic adaptation, navigating the dual challenges of declining refining margins and the urgent need to build renewable infrastructure. For investors, the company's struggles and ambitions highlight a broader opportunity: the reallocation of capital toward firms capable of pivoting from fossil fuels to renewables, provided they secure the right policy frameworks.

The Ampol Dilemma: A Catalyst for Policy Reform

Ampol's recent warnings about the energy transition's fragility—particularly in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and refining sector viability—serve as a wake-up call. CEO Matt Halliday has underscored delays in connecting EV charging stations to the grid, poor resale values for EVs, and stagnating adoption rates. These issues are not isolated; they reflect systemic bottlenecks in Australia's energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ampol's refining operations face margin compression, exacerbated by the underperformance of the Fuel Security Services Payment (FSSP) program, which was designed to stabilize the sector during unprofitable periods.

The company's pivot to renewable fuels, however, offers a blueprint for resilience. Ampol's Brisbane Renewable Fuels (BRF) Project, a proposed Low-Carbon Liquid Fuels (LCLF) plant at its Lytton refinery, aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel using feedstocks like used cooking oil and tallow. This initiative aligns with global trends: SAF production reached 1.25 billion litres in 2024, and Australia's potential to produce 14 billion litres by 2050 hinges on policy support. Ampol's collaboration with partners like ENEOS and GrainCorp further underscores the need for industry-government partnerships to scale renewable infrastructure.

Policy as a Critical Enabler

Ampol's calls for 2025 policy announcements are not mere requests—they are a demand for structural reform. The Australian government's $1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund and $18.5 million for renewable fuel certification are steps forward, but they fall short of addressing the sector's systemic risks. For instance, the FSSP program's rigid margin-based criteria have left Ampol without support during periods of low refining margins, despite rising operational costs. Reforming such mechanisms to account for inflation and supply-chain volatility is essential to prevent the collapse of transitional infrastructure.

Investors should note that Ampol's success in transitioning to renewables depends on three pillars:

1. Supply-side incentives: Subsidies for feedstock procurement and production tax credits for SAF and renewable diesel.

2. Demand-side mandates: Regulatory requirements for blending renewable fuels into existing infrastructure.

3. Grid modernization: Accelerated investment in transmission lines and EV charging networks to alleviate bottlenecks.

The Albanese government's ability to deliver on these fronts will determine whether Australia's energy transition remains aspirational or becomes a reality.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

For investors, the key lies in identifying firms like Ampol that are not only adapting to the new energy paradigm but actively shaping it. Ampol's 2025 capital expenditure of A$600 million—directed toward the Lytton ultra-low sulphur fuels project and the BRF Project—signals a commitment to long-term sustainability. Its proposed A$1.1 billion acquisition of EG Australia to expand convenience retail further diversifies its revenue streams, reducing reliance on volatile refining margins.

However, Ampol's stock remains undervalued relative to its peers, reflecting market skepticism about its transition costs. This presents an opportunity for patient investors who recognize that the company's pivot to renewables is not a risk but a necessity. The BRF Project, expected to operationalize by 2029, could unlock significant value if policy reforms align with Ampol's timelines.

The Path Forward: A Call for Immediate Action

The energy transition is not a linear process; it requires iterative policy adjustments and bold capital allocation. Ampol's warnings about EV infrastructure delays and refining sector fragility should galvanize policymakers to act. For investors, the lesson is clear: firms that can bridge the gap between traditional energy and renewables—while securing government support—will dominate the next decade.

Australia's renewable energy infrastructure is at a defining moment. Ampol's journey from refining giant to green energy pioneer exemplifies the potential of strategic reallocation. For those willing to invest in this transition, the rewards will be measured not just in financial returns but in the creation of a resilient, low-carbon economy.

In conclusion, the time to act is now. The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon—it is a present-day imperative, and firms like Ampol are leading the charge. For investors, the question is not whether to participate, but how to position themselves to benefit from the inevitable shift.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-18 04:56:18.320403

The Indian Oil Corporation recently secured the ISCC CORSIA certification, the global standard that allows airlines to count biofuel use under international carbon offsetting rules. This sought to clear the final regulatory hurdle before commercial production.

Indian Oil Turns Waste Oil Into Jet Fuel

According to Indian Express, the Panipat plant is designed to turn out 35,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel annually. That quantity, according to Indian Oil, would be sufficient to meet India’s first blending requirement of 1% for international flights in 2027. Oil collected from hotel kitchens, restaurant chains, and packaged food companies, including brands such as Haldiram’s, is expected to provide the bulk of the sustainable feedstock.

The appeal of Indian Oil’s sustainable aviation experiment lies in its compatibility. It mirrors the chemistry of aviation turbine fuel, so no changes to aircraft engines are required. Airbus has already confirmed that its fleet can fly on a 50% SAF blend, and several Indian carriers have flown demonstration services using biofuel mixes. Analysts tracking global climate goals expect SAF to shoulder over 60% of aviation’s total emissions reductions.

India’s Sustainable Aviation Experiment

The year 2027 has become a looming milestone for the industry. That is when the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) shifts into its binding phase, obliging airlines to cap emissions at 2020 levels or face penalties. In line with this timetable, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee has set an initial SAF blending target of 1% in 2027 and 2% the following year. Requirements for domestic flights are expected later, though policymakers appear reluctant to impose them before international blending takes hold.

European airlines, already required to use SAF, are seen as likely early customers for IOC’s output, particularly on flights operating in and out of India. Export markets are also under consideration, since demand is projected to surge worldwide once the CORSIA deadline kicks in.

What threatens the upcoming initiative is the cost. Producing SAF currently runs to about three times the price of jet fuel refined from crude oil. Airlines have warned that passing those costs through could inflate ticket prices, making widespread adoption politically fraught.

IOC is trying to reduce that dependence on used cooking oil by advancing work on an alcohol-to-jet pathway, where ethanol serves as feedstock. Rival refiners are pursuing their own technological bets, but every new facility must be certified before it can supply the market, as stated by the Indian Express.

For India, the Panipat launch by Indian Oil Corporation is not merely a showcase. It converts a low-value waste stream into a productive fuel, offers airlines a route to compliance with international obligations, and places the country on the map of an industry under intense pressure to decarbonise.

The main market for the product will be Europe, which has SAF blending mandates for airlines operating on its territory.

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from waste materials such as cooking oil and biomass, is believed to be a necessary element of the energy transition due to the amount of emissions from the aviation industry, which amount to 2.5% of the global total emissions of carbon dioxide.

However, sustainable aviation fuels are expensive to produce, which has made their transformation into a mainstream blending component for jet fuel problematic. The high costs are attributable to the complex process required to turn waste fats and oils into biofuel, but also to a more challenging problem: the lack of sufficient amounts of waste fats and oils.

Reuters recently published a detailed look into the present state of SAF production globally and its immediate outlook. The picture painted by that article was not an optimistic one. A number of large air carriers made commitments to buy significant amounts of sustainable fuels from startup producers only to change their minds later, likely when they realised the bill they would be facing. As a result, SAF producers are shutting down, and the availability of these fuels is shrinking instead of growing ahead of blending mandates.

Depending on the efficiency and sustainability of the feedstock and production process, SAF can reduce carbon emissions—one of the harmful greenhouse gases—by up to 80% over the course of a conventional jet fuel’s lifecycle.

Various studies have found that commercial aviation produces 2.5% of the world’s CO2 emissions. According to an Air Transport Action Group report, in 2023 alone, commercial aviation’s contribution to CO2 emissions wasat roughly 882 million tonnes. This makes it imperative to switch from traditional to more sustainable fossil fuels to bring down carbon emissions to optimal level and protect the environment.

Interestingly, the aviation industry estimates that more than 60% of the global aviation sector’s decarbonisation efforts will likely come from SAF alone.

What is ISCC CORSIA certification

The ISCC CORSIA certification, i.e., International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), validates that SAF meets the highest international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards.

SAF produced at Indian Oil’s Panipat Refinery has undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations. The certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production. This is in line with the government’s vision of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

Earlier this month, Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu announced that Indian Oil’s Panipat Refinery has been certified as the country’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel producer.

IOC’s Panipat Refinery to start SAF biofuel production at commercial scale

IOC has said that by end of this calendar year, its Panipat Refinery will start producing SAF from used cooking oil at a commercial scale. By December 2025, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil. This used cooking oil will be sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks companies like Haldiram’s. While these companies normally discard cooking oil after single use since it becomes unhealthy, now the same oil will be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Speaking about the significance of producing SAF and used cooking oil collected for the same, IOC’s Chairman Arvind Sawhney said, “The capacity (35,000 tonnes per year) will be sufficient to meet the country’s 1 per cent SAF blending requirement (for international flights) by 2027… For feedstock (used cooking oil), we will be engaging aggregators to collect it from big hotel chains and restaurants. There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households.”

SAF production, however, comes with its own challenges as despite offering a lower carbon footprint, SAF made from used cooking oil is currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fuel due to its higher production costs, which are caused by issues including feedstock constraints and evolving production technology.",https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/001-2025-08-18T113505.096.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 03:56:37.817614

This milestone, anticipated within weeks, underscores Airbus’s relentless ascent and Boeing’s recent stumbles, reshaping the dynamics of an industry that powers global travel.

According to data from aviation consultancy Cirium, as of mid-August 2025, Airbus has delivered 12,155 A320-series aircraft, trailing Boeing’s 12,175 737s by a mere 20 units. The European planemaker’s production ramp-up, coupled with Boeing’s supply-chain woes and regulatory hurdles, positions the A320 to claim the title of the most-delivered commercial jetliner in history, a record Boeing has held since the 737’s debut in 1968.

A Historic Rivalry Takes a Turn

The rivalry between the A320 and 737 dates back to 1981, when Airbus announced its challenger to Boeing’s single-aisle workhorse. Launched in 1984, the A320 introduced fly-by-wire technology and fuel-efficient designs that appealed to airlines seeking lower operating costs. Over the years, variants like the A320neo have boosted its appeal with advanced engines from CFM International, reducing fuel burn by up to 20% compared to earlier models.

Boeing’s 737, meanwhile, evolved through generations, from the Classics to the Next Generation and the troubled MAX series. But crises, including the 2018-2019 MAX groundings after two fatal crashes and ongoing production delays, have hampered deliveries. As reported in a recent article by Fortune, Airbus’s consistent output—aiming for 75 A320s per month by 2026—has allowed it to close the gap steadily since overtaking the 737 in orders back in 2019.

Boeing’s Challenges and Airbus’s Edge

Industry insiders point to Boeing’s internal turmoil as a key factor. Supply-chain disruptions, exacerbated by the pandemic and quality-control issues, have limited 737 MAX production to around 30 aircraft monthly, far below targets. A February 2025 report from Flight Plan highlighted how steel and aluminum tariffs further strained Boeing’s operations, delaying recoveries.

Conversely, Airbus has capitalized on its diversified supplier base and investments in automation. The A320 family’s backlog stands at over 8,000 units, driven by demand from low-cost carriers in Asia and Europe. Wikipedia’s entry on the Boeing 737 notes that while 17,037 have been ordered as of July 2025, deliveries lag due to certification delays for the MAX variants, allowing Airbus to pull ahead.

Market Implications and Future Outlook

This delivery milestone isn’t just symbolic; it reflects shifting airline preferences amid rising fuel prices and environmental regulations. The A320neo’s efficiency has secured massive orders, such as IndiGo’s 500-unit deal in 2023, outpacing Boeing’s commitments. Posts on X from aviation enthusiasts and analysts, like those from Aviation Facts, echo the sentiment that Airbus’s dominance in narrowbody jets is solidifying, with the A320 family now operating in more fleets worldwide.

Looking ahead, Boeing aims to stabilize with new leadership and FAA approvals, potentially ramping up to 50 737s monthly by 2026. Yet, Airbus’s lead could widen, especially with the A321XLR’s entry, enabling longer routes. As Simple Flying projected in March 2025, this overtake signals a new era where European innovation challenges American legacy.

Economic Ripples and Strategic Shifts

The economic stakes are immense, with each aircraft valued at around $100 million. Airbus’s triumph boosts Europe’s aerospace sector, supporting thousands of jobs across France, Germany, and the U.K. For Boeing, the loss intensifies pressure to innovate, possibly accelerating development of a 737 successor amid whispers of a clean-sheet design by 2030.

Analysts from IndexBox, in a blog post dated August 17, 2025, emphasize that this shift highlights Airbus’s strategic agility, from neo upgrades to sustainable aviation fuel compatibility. Meanwhile, Boeing grapples with reputational damage, as evidenced by IATA’s 2024 statistics showing both families as top-used types, but Airbus gaining ground in utilization rates.

Lessons from a Decades-Long Duel

Ultimately, this record-breaking moment teaches that in aviation, adaptability trumps tradition. Airbus’s focus on efficiency and reliability has paid off, while Boeing’s setbacks serve as a cautionary tale. As the industry eyes recovery from post-pandemic demand, the A320’s ascendancy may redefine competitive strategies for years to come.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-47d3ed47-2ad1-478e-afaf-3e7d7fe30533.jpeg,N,,2025-08-18 03:56:42.199975

Sustainable Aviation Fuel India Latest News

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India’s largest refiner and fuel retailer, is set to begin commercial production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at its Panipat refinery by December 2025. The facility recently received international certification to manufacture biofuel from used cooking oil (UCO).

By year-end, IOC will achieve a production capacity of 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually, with raw material sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and food companies, which typically discard cooking oil after one-time use.

This development marks a significant step in India’s green aviation push, contributing to cleaner energy transition and reducing dependence on conventional jet fuel.

About Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a bio-based alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, forestry waste, and non-edible crops.

SAF is a “drop-in fuel,” meaning it can be blended with existing jet fuel and used in current aircraft engines without modification.

International aviation bodies certify blending limits (usually up to 50%) to ensure safety and performance.

Benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Engine and infrastructure compatibility – SAF blended with conventional Jet A can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Fewer emissions – Compared with conventional jet fuel, 100% SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway.

More flexibility – SAF is a replacement for conventional jet fuel, allowing for multiple products from various feedstocks and production technologies.

Energy Security – It reduces dependence on imported crude oil.

Economic Opportunities – It Creates new markets for farmers (through non-edible crops and residues) and waste collectors (used cooking oil, biomass).

Exports: With Europe already enforcing SAF blending mandates, European airlines are seen as the first major buyers of IOC’s SAF when they land in India. IOC also plans to tap into global export markets as demand rises.

IOC’s First Commercial SAF Plant

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest refiner, will begin commercial production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at its Panipat refinery by December 2025.

The plant is certified under ISCC CORSIA standards.

IOC is the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification, a requirement under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

From 2027, airlines worldwide must offset emissions beyond 2020 levels, and using SAF blends will be a key compliance pathway.

It will produce 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually using used cooking oil (UCO).

UCO refers to edible oils and fats that have been used for frying, cooking, or food preparation in both commercial and household settings.

It is essentially leftover oil from cooking processes.

While UCO can be a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel and other products, its improper disposal can lead to environmental and health issues.

Meeting India’s SAF Targets

The initial production capacity will be sufficient to meet India’s 1% SAF blending target for international flights by 2027.

The National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set indicative targets of 1% blending in 2027 and 2% in 2028.

SAF blending for domestic flights is expected to follow, but only after international targets are in place.

Challenges Ahead

Collection bottlenecks: While UCO collection from big hotel chains is easy, creating systems to collect oil from small eateries and households remains difficult.

High cost: SAF is currently about three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, raising concerns for airlines about higher operating costs.

Feedstock Availability: Large-scale production requires a steady supply of sustainable feedstocks (used cooking oil, residues, waste).

Policy roadmap: Although the government had earlier considered early SAF mandates, cost concerns have pushed implementation to 2027 onwards.

Future Pathways

While IOC has started with the used cooking oil route, it is also working on alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology, which uses ethanol as feedstock.

Other Indian companies are exploring similar SAF technologies, but all pathways require international certification before commercial rollout.

The company’s SAF production unit, located alongside its refinery in Panipat, Haryana, will have an annual capacity of 35,000 tonnes. This output will be enough to meet the entire SAF blending requirement for international airlines in India by 2027, Sahney said.

India has adopted a phased approach to SAF, starting with a mandate for 1% blending in jet fuel for international flights by 2027, rising to 2% by 2028.

SAF will cost nearly three times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF), but finding buyers will not be an issue, Sahney said, as airlines must comply with the blending mandate. If the Panipat facility’s output is not fully absorbed domestically, Indian Oil will explore exports, he added.

Used cooking oil (UCO) will serve as the feedstock for SAF production. “Arranging feedstock is not a challenge. There is ample collection of UCO in the country, most of which is currently exported,” Sahney said.

With international targets aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the most critical pathways to reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. In this context, a significant development has taken place in Vietnam, where Petrolimex has introduced SAF to domestic operations. This milestone highlights both technological progress and the commitment of the aviation sector to embrace cleaner alternatives.

The Emergence of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Vietnam

Petrolimex has become the first enterprise in Vietnam to import synthetic blending components derived from renewable or bio-based sources. Through this move, the company has not only introduced SAF into the domestic market but also mastered blending technologies that meet internationally recognised standards such as EI 1533, ASTM D7566, DEF STAN 91-091 and Vietnam’s own TCVN 14414:2025.

This development represents more than a technical achievement. It lays the foundation for a sustainable aviation ecosystem in Vietnam, signalling the readiness of the sector to integrate SAF into daily operations while aligning with global standards.

Reducing Emissions by Up to 80 Percent

One of the most remarkable benefits of SAF is its potential to cut lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. This figure is not just symbolic; it represents tangible progress toward climate goals. By introducing SAF into commercial operations, Vietnam is aligning itself with international efforts to limit aviation’s environmental impact while maintaining the sector’s role as an economic driver.

Partnerships Driving Adoption

At the official launch in Hanoi, Petrolimex Aviation signed SAF offtake agreements with both Vietjet and Associated Energy Group (AEG Fuels). These partnerships are essential for creating demand and building trust in the new fuel source. For Vietjet, this collaboration translates into a practical way of reducing the emissions of its modern fleet, while for AEG Fuels, it represents an opportunity to connect Vietnam’s SAF supply to international markets.

By working with global and domestic partners, Petrolimex is not just offering a product but helping to establish a value chain that positions Vietnam as an active participant in aviation’s decarbonisation journey.

Technological Milestone at Nha Be Terminal

The SAF blending system installed at the Nha Be Petroleum Terminal stands as a flagship project. It represents a demonstration of how advanced infrastructure and technological expertise can converge to deliver innovative solutions. Recognition of this project during Petrolimex’s 70th anniversary underscores its symbolic importance as a milestone achievement for both the company and the broader aviation community in the country.

Strategic Significance for National Aviation

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, the launch of SAF holds significance that extends beyond commercial value. It signals the beginning of a domestic supply chain that is internationally compliant, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders including airlines, fuel providers, and regulatory authorities. This holistic approach ensures that Vietnam is not merely following global trends but actively contributing to the evolution of sustainable aviation practices.

Certification and Global Credibility

Petrolimex Aviation has achieved certifications under ISCC EU and ISCC CORSIA, two of the world’s most respected frameworks for sustainability and carbon reduction. These certifications provide assurance that the SAF being supplied is not only effective but also credible on a global scale. In practice, this means that international carriers and partners can confidently source SAF from Vietnam, integrating it into their sustainability strategies without concerns over compliance or quality.

Vietjet Leading the Way

The agreement with Vietjet to uplift the first 1,200 cubic metres of SAF blended in Vietnam illustrates the willingness of airlines to take a proactive role in emission reduction. Vietjet’s leadership in adopting SAF demonstrates how airlines can align their operational strategies with broader national and global sustainability goals. By doing so, Vietjet is positioning itself as a pioneer in the region’s transition toward cleaner air travel.

Global Expansion Through Strategic Alliances

The partnership with AEG Fuels creates a channel for Vietnam-produced SAF to reach international markets. This move enhances the role of the domestic industry in the global aviation supply chain, while also contributing to the international push for greener skies. By expanding beyond national boundaries, the initiative reflects a vision of interconnected sustainability, where innovation in one country can benefit the broader aviation ecosystem.

A Broader Perspective on Green Transition

The launch of SAF in Vietnam should not be seen as an isolated development but rather as part of a larger shift taking place across the global aviation sector. Countries and companies are racing to align with climate targets, and the availability of SAF is a critical enabler of this transition. For emerging economies, in particular, the ability to participate in and contribute to SAF adoption sends a powerful message of readiness and responsibility.

Subtle Lessons for Stakeholders

The progress made in Vietnam illustrates several valuable lessons for stakeholders across the aviation landscape. First, technological mastery combined with international certification builds confidence and credibility. Second, partnerships between fuel suppliers, airlines, and global distributors accelerate adoption and create stronger ecosystems. Third, investment in infrastructure, such as the SAF blending facility at Nha Be, ensures that commitments to sustainability are backed by tangible capabilities.

For professionals engaged in sustainability, these lessons highlight how collaborative strategies and systemic thinking can drive real progress.

The Role of Independent Expertise

Behind every transition to cleaner fuels lies the need for expertise in sustainability assessments, compliance with international standards, and long-term planning. Independent sustainability consultants and advisory firms play a crucial role in guiding such transitions. By helping organisations evaluate their carbon reduction potential, navigate evolving regulations, and optimise their green strategies, they act as a bridge between ambition and execution.

Conclusion

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel in Vietnam is more than a milestone for one company. It marks the beginning of a new chapter in aviation, where emissions reductions, global collaboration, and technological innovation converge. With SAF reducing emissions by up to 80 percent, Vietnam is sending a clear signal that it is committed to being part of aviation’s global green transition.

The road to net zero will be long and complex, but developments such as this demonstrate what is possible when ambition meets action. As more stakeholders across the aviation sector embrace SAF and strengthen partnerships, the vision of cleaner skies and a sustainable future becomes increasingly achievable.

The programme is designed to pay Ampol and fellow domestic company Viva Energy when refining becomes unprofitable. But Ampol has not received funds despite weak results in the first half of the year, especially during the January-March quarter, when the 109,000 b/d Lytton refinery near Brisbane was affected by a cyclone.

Active discussions with the federal Labor government are underway to improve the ""effectiveness"" of the FSSP for the remainder of its present period, running to 30 June 2027, Ampol said.

""As costs have escalated, the mechanism does not take that into account and that's a part of the decision we're engaged on as part of the review,"" chief executive Matt Halliday said on 18 August, with the firm expecting an outcome in the present half.

Ampol will work with Canberra for the post-2027 period to understand its objectives for refining. This includes potentially incorporating biofuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, before recommitting to keeping Lytton operational beyond that date.

Just one FSSP payment has been made since the July-September quarter of 2021. This was a A$25mn ($16mn) payment in July-September last year to Viva, which operates the 120,000 b/d Geelong refinery.

Ampol's Lytton refinery margin (LRM) for the January-June first half was $7.44/bl, down by 28pc from $10.27/bl a year earlier. Refiners become eligible for the FSSP when margin markers fall to A$10.20/bl, with a maximum of A1.8¢/litre available when the marker drops to a floor of A$7.30/bl.

The LRM firmed following the end of the half to $9.95/bl in July, while the alkylation turnaround at Lytton started in mid-July and the refinery will return to normal operations at the end of September.

Alkylation and crude distillation unit works underway will affect 130-150mn litres, or impact Ampol to the tune of A$15mn-20mn in opportunity costs, while next year's planned turnaround on the fluidised catalytic cracking unit will affect about 300mn litres of production.

This means volumes produced next year will be similar to 2025, chief financial officer Greg Barnes said.

Earnings before interest and tax at Ampol's Lytton refinery in Brisbane slumped to $1.1 million in the half, from $89.5 million a year earlier.

A spokesperson for Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) told news agency PTI that “a technical issue caused the Air India flight to abort the take off.”

Lok Sabha member and Congress leader Hibi Eden was among the passengers on board the flight, identified as AI504.

In a statement, an Air India spokesperson said, “Flight AI504 operating from Kochi to Delhi has been rescheduled to depart later this evening, necessitated by a technical issue detected during the take-off roll.”

“The cockpit crew decided to discontinue the take-off run following standard operating procedures and brought the aircraft back to the bay for maintenance checks,” the spokesperson added.

Live Events

According to the CIAL spokesperson, the airline later informed the airport that it was changing the aircraft. The rescheduled departure is now expected at 1 am on Monday.

Eden, the Ernakulam MP, described the incident in a Facebook post: “Something unusual with this flight AI 504... it just felt like the flight skid on the runway... and hasn't taken off yet...”

Air India said it regretted the inconvenience to passengers. “All passengers have disembarked and our ground colleagues in Kochi are extending support to them,” the spokesperson said.

Flight tracking website Flightradar24.com showed that AI504 was to be operated with an Airbus A321 aircraft.

The incident comes amid a spate of recent technical issues reported by Air India. On August 16, the airline cancelled its Milan-Delhi flight after a last-minute maintenance task was identified during pushback.

On August 3, a Delhi-bound flight from Bhubaneswar was cancelled due to high cabin temperature. On July 31, a Boeing 787-9 bound for London had to abort takeoff at Delhi airport and return to bay because of a technical snag.

Twelve has developed a groundbreaking solution to convert captured CO₂ into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—a potential game-changer for decarbonizing air travel. Despite early successes, Twelve now faces the “first deployment challenge” as it seeks capital to build its first commercial-scale production facility. The capital requirements and unique risk-return profile of Twelve’s facility fall directly in the gap between the smaller checks of high-risk high-return venture capitalists and the larger checks of risk-averse debt providers seeking predictable, if smaller, returns.

However, a refinery of Indian Oil Corporation has now won a certification to use the same oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the company chairman AS Sahney said.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil’s Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification - ISCC - developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to produce SAF from used cooking oil, he said.

“We are the only company in the country to get this certification,” he said.

“The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year.” The production will be enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027, he added.

Explaining the process, agencies will collect used cooking oil from large users, such as hotel chains, restaurants, and snacks and sweets producing companies like Haldiram, and supply it to Panipat refinery.

Panipat refinery will use this oil to produce SAF, he said.

Large hotels and restaurant chains normally discard cooking oil after one use. At present, this used cooking oil is collected by agencies and exported.

“There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,” he said.

Parallely, the company has also set up a Rs 5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce Butyl Acrylate (BA), which is used in making paints.

The 1,50,000 tonnes per annum Butyl Acrylate plant, only second in India after BPCL’s unit at Kochi refinery, will help end 3,20,000 tonnes of annual paint feedstock that the country currently imports, Sahney noted.

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has been at the forefront of innovations, particularly in the areas of green energy, sustainable solutions, and technological advancements. The firm is working on renewable energy sources, like 2G ethanol, fuel cells, bio-diesel, and energy storage devices.

“The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported. In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,” he said. Together with the Kochi plant, the new unit can substitute as much as 80-90 per cent of imports, he said.

On green hydrogen, Sahney said the company awarded a tender for the country’s largest green hydrogen plant to L&T.

“The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,” he said.

Green hydrogen, produced from splitting water using renewable energy, is a clean energy source that only emits water vapour and leaves no residue in the air, unlike coal and oil. It can be used in industries and automobiles as fuel, but the prohibitive production cost has been a stumbling block.

India has relatively cheaper renewable energy (electricity produced from sunlight and wind), which has helped keep green hydrogen production cost at less than $4 per kg, the chairman said, adding that IndianOil will use the fuel in its Panipat refinery. Refineries, currently, use grey hydrogen - hydrogen produced from fossil fuels - in hydrocracking units to produce fuels like petrol and jet fuels.

“IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics,” Sahney said. “A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature.”",https://www.millenniumpost.in/h-upload/2025/08/17/985004-3852j5uwipyzah4raye2vwsaz3oubrxxbqen7781119.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 16:56:24.747412

Toni Chaves President, President of the Hotel Association, says the categorization is a turning point for sargassum use.

“This recognition, supported by IMIPAS research and validated by Conapesca and Semarnat, represents a turning point in the transition of sargassum from an environmental threat to a valuable raw material. It is a decisive step toward its productive use,” said Chaves.

The Riviera Maya Hotel Association and the Mexican Caribbean Hotel Council reiterated their commitment to continue promoting a comprehensive model for the containment, collection, recovery and marketing of sargassum.

Ignacio Muñoz, CEO of The Seas We Love, said that for the first time in Mexico’s history, sargassum has ceased to be a waste product and has become an officially recognized resource within the national fisheries policy.

“This opens the door to a new marine economy that will generate green jobs, sustainable investment and legal certainty for its collection and processing ,” he stressed.

He said that the new categorization in the National Fisheries Charter will enable the issuance of commercial fishing permits for sargassum, moving from the current restricted “promotional fishing” scheme to a broader and more competitive regime.

Likewise, it will provide legal certainty for investors by establishing a clear legal and technical framework regarding its status, fishing zones, authorized vessels and management strategies, which will unlock industrial value-added projects such as those led by The Seas We Love.

Ignacio Muñoz added that its publication will facilitate fisheries management of the resource and pave the way for the development of the Sargassum Fisheries Management Plan with the participation of the productive, academic and government sectors.

Furthermore, its recognition as a strategic biomass validates its potential for the production of fertilizers, biogas, biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel and bioproducts such as construction materials, food supplements, and more, aligned with the circular economy model promoted by the federal government.

“This new recognition represents a major step forward for the Mexican Caribbean and a national milestone in sustainable ocean management,” he said.",https://riviera-maya-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sarlovewiio.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 12:56:33.962877

The failure of the plan highlights the difficulty green aviation has faced getting off the ground, made worse by a government push to force airlines to use more green fuels.
For BA’s partner Velocys – which is yet to sell any green jet fuel to any airline – it ran out of money last year and was taken over by a private consortium.
That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.
For sunseekers hoping to cleanse their conscience with green fuel, a guilt-free future still seems some way off.","For those flying south this summer, the prospect of “green fuel” one day powering their planes down to the south of France or the Med may mean a little less guilt over their climate-destroying air travel.

British factories pumping out climate-friendly aviation fuel have long been a pipe-dream for the aviation industry and some holidaymakers, and it seemed one step closer six years ago when British Airways announced plans for the UK’s first factory to convert waste into jet fuel.

The futuristic plant, to be built by fuels firm Velocys on a field near the Humber estuary, in north Lincolnshire, would see household rubbish destined for landfills turned into thousands of tonnes of green plane fuel, powering the airline into a sustainable future.

Alex Cruz, then-chief executive of BA, said the fuel – known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – would be a “game-changer for aviation”.

But six years after British Airways’ Velocys announcement – and a year after the SAF plant should have gone into production – that dream seems as far away as ever.

Velocys’ Humber estuary site remains as an empty field – a recent image shows that the only structure on it is a portaloo.

The failure of the plan highlights the difficulty green aviation has faced getting off the ground, made worse by a government push to force airlines to use more green fuels.

On the back of promises for airlines to use SAF, in 2022, then-prime minister Boris Johnson announced a new policy – known as “jet zero” – to enforce a minimum threshold of green fuel use.

By 2050, he claimed, flying would be zero-carbon, adding: “Sustainable fuels and fully electric planes will achieve guilt-free flying for years to come.”

Under the policy, still in force, British airlines must this year fuel their planes with a minimum of 2pc SAF, ratcheting up to 10pc by 2030 and 22pc by 2040.

That fuel should also be pumping out from a minimum of five new SAF plants, which, Johnson’s policy promised, would be operating by now, creating jobs and helping make the UK “a clean energy superpower”.

Barely any of that has come to pass.

For BA’s partner Velocys – which is yet to sell any green jet fuel to any airline – it ran out of money last year and was taken over by a private consortium. Its leadership team says its plans are only delayed, but similar promises by other UK would-be SAF producers have also so far come to nothing.

It means the only company making SAF in the UK is the Phillips66 refinery on Humberside – and its output is just 20,000 tonnes a year. That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.

So how are UK airlines meeting their obligation to add 2pc SAF to their fuel tanks?

Most of it is being imported, generating jobs not in the UK but mostly in Finland, the Netherlands, the US and Holland. That gap is set to worsen, says the Aviation Environment Federation.

It points out that by 2030, the UK’s SAF obligation will have soared to 10pc, or 1.2 million tonnes, of green fuel – all or most of which will be imported.

“While a number of plants are making progress, the expected amounts they will produce are insufficient to meet the mandate”, it says.

Those imports will not just dash the opportunity for more UK jobs, but also mean flight costs will take off, say experts.

Simone Burgin, a biofuels analyst with Argus Media, said SAF is already far more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

“The European price for SAF stood at $2,280 (£1,681) per metric tonne on Aug 13 – more than three times the price of conventional jet fuel.”

Those high costs are inherent to the way SAF is made – using vast amounts of heat at high pressure to break down waste cooking oil, animal fats, wood, plastics or other organic materials into the smaller molecules needed for jet fuel.

But inflated pricing is adding to that, says the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 340 global airlines.

It says fuel suppliers are stoking their profit margins with “compliance fees”.

“The fees being imposed on airlines are over twice the prevailing market price premium of SAF. In the EU, airlines face an additional $1.3bn in excess surcharges in 2025. The impact of the compliance fees in the UK is even higher.”

It all suggests Britain’s demand that airlines add SAF to their fuel is doing little to save the planet and nothing for UK jobs, while making aviation increasingly expensive.

Greenhouse gas emissions from UK-based international aviation are surging – equating to 37 million tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16 million tonnes seen in 1990, and set to grow even faster in the next two decades.

The 300 million passengers who pass through UK airports annually is expected to hit up to 500 million by 2050, with 10 airports planning major expansions.

And globally, aviation emits around a billion tonnes of CO2 and rising – so what difference can SAF really make?

Airlines and aircraft manufacturers point out that it’s still early days for SAF – and as manufacturing steps up, so prices and emissions may decline.

But they too are worried by the lack of realism from a Government that is telling them to use ever more SAF, but doing little to help ensure homegrown supplies.

Jonathon Counsell, sustainability director at IAG, which owns British Airways, said the current plans for boosting SAF output were too weak to meet UK and EU decarbonisation targets.

Airlines want some of the taxes they pay to be deployed to support SAF production.

“SAF is a critical lever to get to net-zero, and to achieve this, the industry needs increased Government support, as mandates alone are not enough,” he said.

“Greater support is essential to bridge the cost gap between SAF and traditional jet fuel, alongside stronger incentives to accelerate production at the scale required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

The Department for Transport, which is steering the policy, points out that next year will see the introduction of its “revenue certainty mechanism” under which companies that build SAF plants will get a guaranteed minimum price, funded by a levy on airlines.

But that levy would add to costs in an industry with a slim profit margin of 3pc to 4pc – and so would go straight on to ticket prices.

Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said global SAF supply had doubled last year to one million tonnes and was expected to double again this year.

“Like any brand-new industry, progress will be uneven, and there will be failures. There also remains much to do to ensure UK airlines have access to the growing volumes of ‘advanced’ SAF needed to meet the UK mandate.”

Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, puts it more bluntly: “SAF production needs to be incentivised by governments.” It said the environmental taxes it pays annually need to be reinvested to “accelerate the decarbonisation of the sector”.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “Not backing SAF is not an option – it is a core part of the global drive to decarbonise aviation.

“There are encouraging signs that the SAF mandate will be met, and we will continue to support the production and use of SAF as the technology matures.”

A Velocys spokesman said the company was seeking to licence its technology to SAF producers worldwide to help them produce more fuel.

He said the amount of money required for the Humber estuary plant was “beyond investment appetite” and investors “remained concerned about the pace of regulatory change” but that it hoped to bring the site to fruition in the “near term”.

The aerospace sector's 14-year backlog and $599 billion sustainable aviation fuel market present opportunities, but execution risks remain high.","The aerospace industry is at a crossroads. Airbus, once a symbol of manufacturing prowess, now faces a stark reality: its Q2 2025 delivery of 300 commercial aircraft—a 68% shortfall from its 820-unit target—has exposed systemic vulnerabilities in global supply chains and corporate execution. This crisis, driven by engine shortages, geopolitical tensions, and internal management challenges, is reshaping investment dynamics across the sector. For investors, the question is no longer whether Airbus can recover, but how the industry will adapt to a new era of volatility.

Supply Chain Constraints: A Perfect Storm of Engine Shortages and Geopolitical Friction

The root of Airbus's delivery crisis lies in its inability to secure LEAP engines for the A320neo program. Safran, the French-Japanese joint venture responsible for these engines, has struggled to meet demand, leaving 17 aircraft in Toulouse as non-functional “gliders.” June 2025 production of 46 A320neos fell short of the 50-unit target, with Forecast International projecting only 625 deliveries for the year—a 16% shortfall. This bottleneck is compounded by geopolitical tensions: U.S. supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which produces critical components for the A350, has seen production drop to one unit in May 2025 due to tariffs and certification delays.

The ripple effects are profound. Airlines are extending the lifespans of aging fleets, accelerating demand for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services. The MRO sector, already valued at $120 billion, is projected to grow to $290 billion by 2043 as operators prioritize cost efficiency over new purchases. Meanwhile, 65% of aerospace firms cite workforce shortages as a critical constraint, while 49% now view funding risks as a growing threat.

Management Execution Risks: Leadership, Strategy, and the Path to 75 Units/Month

Airbus's corporate governance structure adds another layer of complexity. The Executive Committee, tasked with consensus-driven decision-making, risks slowing responses to urgent production bottlenecks. While the CEO holds final authority, internal alignment remains a hurdle. For instance, the company's acquisition of $94 million in work packages from Spirit AeroSystems aims to reduce supplier dependency but hinges on seamless integration by Q4 2025—a tall order amid existing delays.

Strategic imbalances also persist. Narrowbody aircraft (A320 Family) account for 78% of deliveries but face headwinds from widebody demand in long-haul markets. The A350 and A330neo programs, critical for diversification, are lagging behind targets. Achieving the 2028 goal of 12 A350 units per month will require resolving supplier issues and aligning with operator replacement cycles. Meanwhile, Airbus's $3.6 billion R&D investment in hydrogen-powered aircraft and folding-wing designs, while visionary, remains speculative.

Investment Implications: Resilience in a Fragmented Sector

For investors, the aerospace sector's challenges highlight the importance of resilience and diversification. Key takeaways include:

Resilient Suppliers with Diversified Portfolios:

Rolls-Royce (RYCEF): Despite supply chain disruptions, Rolls-Royce reported a 50% surge in operating profits in H1 2025, driven by operational efficiency and low-carbon innovations. Its Small Modular Reactor (SMR) program and battery energy storage systems (BESS) contracts position it as a leader in energy transition.

GE Additive (GE): Advanced manufacturing firms like GE, with expertise in 3D printing and digital twins, are better equipped to navigate supply chain volatility.

MRO Providers Capitalizing on Aging Fleets:

Lufthansa Technik (LHTG.DE): Despite margin pressures from U.S. tariffs, LHT's expansion into engine maintenance (e.g., CFM Leap 1B) and VIP aircraft interiors signals long-term growth.

AAR Corporation (AIR): The used aircraft market and MRO demand create a tailwind for AAR, which offers comprehensive fleet lifecycle solutions.

Airlines Rebalancing Fleet Strategies:

Operators are increasingly favoring used aircraft and extended maintenance cycles, reducing reliance on new deliveries. This trend benefits MRO firms and used aircraft brokers.

The Road Ahead: Navigating Uncertainty

Airbus's long-term strategy—adding a second A320neo line in Alabama by 2027—signals ambition but requires immediate progress on engine shortages and Alabama facility readiness. For now, the focus should remain on companies with diversified supply chains, sustainable innovation, and scalable MRO capabilities.

The aerospace sector's 14-year backlog and $599 billion sustainable aviation fuel market present opportunities, but execution risks remain high. Investors must weigh near-term volatility against long-term resilience, prioritizing firms that adapt to a world where geopolitical tensions and workforce shortages are the new normal.

Not only is it revolutionizing the visitor experience, but also emerging as a leading player in sustainable tourism globally. This digital shift is leading the charge for Saudi tourism’s new age, providing a more streamlined, sustainable, and engaging experience for visitors.

Smart Tourism Enhances Visitor Experience with Personalized Services

The adoption of smart technologies in tourism goes beyond improving operational efficiency; it focuses on personalizing the traveler’s journey. As Nicholas Nahas, the partner and tourism & hospitality lead at Arthur D. Little, pointed out, the rise of cognitive tourism is giving way to intelligent systems that understand, anticipate, and adapt to traveler behavior in real-time. This includes using AI-powered platforms for trip planning, biometric systems for seamless travel, and AR/VR technologies that bring cultural heritage to life in an interactive way.

With AI leading the way in personalized itineraries, chatbots offer travelers immediate assistance, providing tailored recommendations based on their preferences. The growth of digital assistants helps tourists navigate local attractions with ease, elevating the overall travel experience.

The Role of Neom and the Red Sea Project in Shaping the Future of Tourism

At the forefront of this smart tourism revolution are Neom and the Red Sea Project, two flagship initiatives that are setting new standards in tourism infrastructure. Neom, a futuristic city planned along the Red Sea, aims to use AI-led personalization and immersive digital engagement to create unprecedented travel experiences. The project will integrate smart systems to monitor and manage visitor needs, from accommodation to transportation and entertainment.

Similarly, the Red Sea Project is leveraging smart infrastructure to create seamless and sustainable guest experiences. By deploying IoT sensors to monitor environmental indicators and utilities, the project is set to redefine eco-tourism while ensuring that guests enjoy luxury without compromising on sustainability.

These projects are designed not just for tourism but to support Saudi Arabia’s broader economic diversification by creating new job opportunities, attracting global investors, and advancing technological development in the country.

Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing Smart Tourism

While Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in smart tourism, experts acknowledge that there are challenges ahead. International collaboration is crucial, as many of the most advanced technologies in AI, AR/VR, and IoT are still primarily developed outside the Kingdom. The country must continue to build its local technological capabilities and invest in talent development to close the gap in tourism expertise.

Data governance, cybersecurity, and regulatory standards will also play a key role in ensuring the sustainability and security of these new technologies. Clear guidelines will be essential to facilitate smooth integration and maintain privacy and trust among visitors.

Moreover, the full rollout of essential smart infrastructure, such as 5G networks and cloud systems, is still underway. Delays in implementation could hinder real-time applications, including AI-powered tours and immersive experiences at major tourism sites like Neom and the Red Sea Project.

Sustainability: A Core Focus in Saudi Tourism’s Transformation

The integration of sustainability into smart tourism is a crucial element of Saudi Arabia’s strategy. The focus on regenerative models in tourism emphasizes environmental preservation while offering luxurious and memorable experiences. The use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), energy-efficient tourism infrastructure, and eco-friendly practices are embedded into major tourism projects, making Saudi Arabia’s tourism sector a model for sustainable travel.

The development of smart cities like Neom and sustainable resorts along the Red Sea underscores Saudi Arabia’s ambition to become a global leader in eco-tourism and innovation. As the country continues to develop its tourism sector, these sustainable tourism practices will play a vital role in maintaining a balance between growth and environmental protection.

Saudi Arabia’s Vision for Smart and Sustainable Tourism

“If done right, this will be a game-changer, unlocking demand across the entire value chain,” von der Leyen says.
Nonetheless, von der Leyen says the commission is “working closely” with member states and offtakers in steel, chemicals, transport and energy storage to identify priorities.","Investment in the European hydrogen sector is set to grow by 140% this year, claims European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

The president was speaking during a video message at the Renewable Hydrogen Summit in Brussels, Belgium on Thursday.

In the past year, Europe saw final investment decisions on green hydrogen projects reach over 2 gigawatts – around four times the region’s current installed capacity. Europe is leading in green hydrogen globally with 11 large-scale projects starting construction, while the US lags behind, she adds.

“To put that into perspective, the United States saw just two such decisions during the same period,” von der Leyen notes. “This illustrates European leadership in renewable hydrogen.”

“So why is Europe leading? We set clear targets,” she adds.

The EU has set a target of producing 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen by decade-end. The bloc also set renewable hydrogen binding targets, requiring a minimum use of 42% in industry and 29% in transport, by 2030. Member states are required to turn these targets into law by May 2025, Kallanish notes.

“If done right, this will be a game-changer, unlocking demand across the entire value chain,” von der Leyen says. Yet, she also admits that “big challenges” persist in the industry and “not every project on paper makes it to the construction phase.”

Recent months have seen several companies across Europe either pausing or stopping their hydrogen projects or scaling back their hydrogen ambitions. German energy company Uniper said it is delaying its green investments amid a “sluggish” development of the hydrogen market, having already shelved a 200-megawatt hydrogen-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in Sweden last month. Similarly, last week bp said it stopped 18 early-stage hydrogen projects.

Nonetheless, von der Leyen says the commission is “working closely” with member states and offtakers in steel, chemicals, transport and energy storage to identify priorities.

“We want to prioritise the infrastructure needed to connect large-scale hydrogen projects with end-users,” she adds. “We will tap into Europe’s vast renewables potential and bring it to our industries to help them decarbonise.”

The president also confirmed that the second round of the European Hydrogen Bank, with a budget of €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion), will be held in December.",https://media.kallanish.com/filer_public/91/f0/91f05193-b6d6-4c4f-a1e5-83611d2b70fb/hydrogen_investment.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 14:56:18.389920

SAF, an alternative to conventional jet fuel, is made from non-petroleum feedstocks and can cut emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent with traditional aviation turbine fuel (ATF), depending on supply. India has mandated 1% SAF blending in jet fuel supplied to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil’s Panipat refinery has secured the International Civil Aviation Organization’s ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), allowing it to produce 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually starting later this year. The output will be enough to meet India’s initial blending requirement in 2027, Sahney said.

The refinery will source used cooking oil through agencies collecting from major hotel chains, restaurants, and food companies such as Haldiram’s. While large establishments dispose of oil after one use, collection from small businesses and households remains a challenge. Currently, much of India’s used cooking oil is exported.

Parallelly, IndianOil has commissioned a ₹5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce 1.5 lakh tonnes per year of Butyl Acrylate (BA), a key ingredient in paints. This is only the second such unit in India after BPCL’s Kochi refinery. With the country importing around 3.2 lakh tonnes of BA annually, the new plant, together with the Kochi unit will substitute 80-90 per cent of imports, saving significant foreign exchange. The paint industry, growing at 13-14 per cent annually, is expected to benefit greatly.

In another major initiative, IndianOil has awarded a contract to Larsen & Toubro to build India’s largest green hydrogen plant at Panipat refinery. The 10,000-tonne-per-year unit, expected to be operational in 27 months, will produce hydrogen by splitting water using renewable energy. Unlike grey hydrogen, which is currently produced from fossil fuels for refinery use, green hydrogen is emission-free and seen as a critical element in India’s energy transition.

India’s relatively low renewable energy costs have brought down green hydrogen production costs to under USD 4 per kg, making it more viable for use in refineries and eventually in industries and automobiles.

Sahney stressed that IndianOil continues to innovate in sustainable energy, from biofuels and 2G ethanol to fuel cells, biodiesel, and energy storage technologies. He highlighted that SAF from Panipat had undergone rigorous lifecycle carbon emission assessments and traceability checks before certification.

Certifications such as ISCC CORSIA not only guarantee environmental and social standards but also create a benchmark for other refiners to scale up SAF production in line with India’s net-zero goal by 2070.

India plans to gradually mandate SAF blending in aviation fuel, beginning with 1 per cent for all international flights in 2027 and rising to 2 per cent the following year. The initiative builds on earlier trials, including SpiceJet’s 2018 test flight using a 75:25 mix of ATF and biofuel, and IndiGo’s 2022 international demonstration flight with a 10 per cent SAF blend.

,,2025-08-17 13:02:12+00:00,Simple Flying,How Many Miles Per Gallon Did Concorde Get? - Simple Flying,Luke Diaz,,,,,https://simpleflying.com/concorde-mpg/,"Looking at publicly available records, we can calculate that Concorde got an equivalent mile-per-gallon fuel burn at its cruising speed of 0.20 mpg.
As such, Concorde fell into a range comparable to a business jet but significantly worse than mainline commercial aircraft.
The data tells us that Concorde used about 5 gallons of aviation fuel for every mile that it flew.
Concorde By The Numbers Concorde pioneered technologies such as double delta-shaped wings, variable engine air intake ramp systems, and supercruise capability.
The Next Generation Of Commercial Supersonic Air Travel Boom Supersonic's proposed Overture airliner is marketed as a generational improvement on Concorde.","Looking at publicly available records, we can calculate that Concorde got an equivalent mile-per-gallon fuel burn at its cruising speed of 0.20 mpg. That is similar to what a Boeing 747 achieves while moving about 400 passengers compared to the Concorde’s 100. Of course, aircraft don’t calculate fuel burn the same way as land vehicles, so let’s get into the details behind these figures.

Concorde carried about 119,500 liters (31,569 gallons) of fuel and burned about 25,629 liters/hour (6,771 gallons/hour) in the air, according to PBS. Data recorded by British Airways indicates an average cruise fuel flow of around 4,800 kg per hour at a true airspeed of roughly 2,150 km/h.

Gallons To The Mile

Concorde’s retirement was often cited as being caused by its poor fuel efficiency, achieving only 17 passenger-miles per gallon. To put that in perspective, the average for airliners ranging from the Boeing 737 to Airbus A380 is 50-80 passenger-mpg. As such, Concorde fell into a range comparable to a business jet but significantly worse than mainline commercial aircraft.

The data tells us that Concorde used about 5 gallons of aviation fuel for every mile that it flew. Naturally, supersonic flight requires more fuel due to increased drag (somewhat negated by flying higher) and powerful engines, but its small capacity brings the number down in comparison. Given the high price of the tickets, the fuel burn didn’t factor into the economics of the supersonic transport as much as many assume.

Concorde was actually most inefficient while taxiing on the ground, when its massively powerful engines could burn up to 2% of the total fuel supply before liftoff. The use of afterburners during takeoff and supersonic acceleration further contributed to high fuel consumption, which led to a higher carbon footprint, raising environmental concerns. Furthermore, it was also extremely loud and prohibitively maintenance-intensive.

Concorde’s Fire-Breathing Heart

The Rolls-Royce Olympus turbojet was already under development when the program to build Concorde began. Developing a new engine for a single aircraft would have been costly, so the existing Olympus Mk 593 Mark 62010 turbojet engine with afterburner (reheat) was chosen. Surprisingly, it remains one of the most fuel-efficient Mach 2-capable powerplants ever made, to this day.

The Olympus 593 was produced as a joint project between Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited and Snecma (Société nationale d'études et de construction de moteurs d'aviation). It is still the only turbojet with an afterburner to power a commercial aircraft, since regular commercial flights by Concorde ceased in October 2003. The engine's overall efficiency in supersonic cruising flight was about 43%, which is still the best thermodynamic result recorded for any jet powerplant of its class.

Concorde By The Numbers

Concorde pioneered technologies such as double delta-shaped wings, variable engine air intake ramp systems, and supercruise capability. Mach 2.02 was determined to be the optimal cruising speed for the best fuel consumption rate possible, and Concorde’s four Olympus engines were based on those used in the Royal Air Force's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber.

It was designed with a tailless configuration, and it was the first airliner to have fly-by-wire flight-control systems and to employ hybrid circuits. The aircraft also featured a full-regime autopilot and autothrottle, fully electrically controlled analogue fly-by-wire flight control systems, a high-pressure hydraulic system, an air data computer for automated monitoring and transmission of aerodynamic measurements, and a fully electrically controlled analog brake-by-wire system.

Concorde was made of aluminum construction using a high-temperature alloy, allowing for conventional manufacture. At 50,000 to 60,000 feet, the airframe’s external skin heated to about 120 degrees Celsius, raising both skin-friction drag and structural weight. Concorde had no auxiliary power unit to save weight, as it only visited large airports with ground air start carts.

More Than Just Transportation

The status and social clout of flying on Concorde surpassed the cost for the supersonic passengers who were often high-net-worth celebrities and captains of industry. These high-flyers were rarely even aware of Concorde's ticket prices, as some didn't personally book them, and corporations were willing to reimburse a fare that avoided a protracted absence of most of their senior leaders. Average ticket prices hovered around $12,000 at the time, which is roughly $20,000 in today's money.

Robert van der Linden, a Curator at the Smithsonian Museum, described his ride on the final flight of the Air France Concorde that bore the registration F-BVFA. He rode along as the jet was delivered from Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG) to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles Airport (IAD) in Virginia. The aircraft was the first in service with Air France and had the highest operational hours, at 17,824. His experience upon check-in was recounted as follows:

“I checked in and received my ticket, along with a luggage tag and a special commemorative package. I had walked into a party; champagne was everywhere. Several French passengers stressed to me how honored they felt that the Smithsonian was accepting one of their Concordes. The aircraft had occupied a place in the hearts of the French people, and they felt both great pride and great sadness when the end had finally come.”

Concorde was so costly that the three-and-a-half-hour flying experience was more of an indulgent soiree with free-flowing champagne and caviar, as Luxury Launches describes it. The average passengers weren’t merely 'rich,' but often the ultra-wealthy, with royals and other leaders of the world among the jet's frequent flyers.

The extortionate fares that the plane's main operators, Air France and British Airways, charged passengers for three-hour transatlantic crossings were often paid by a corporate travel budget as an operating expense. For wealthy passengers, the ticket price was offset by the high value of time saved, 'bragging rights,' and networking advantages gained from an incredibly precious and finite luxury experience.

The Next Generation Of Commercial Supersonic Air Travel

Boom Supersonic's proposed Overture airliner is marketed as a generational improvement on Concorde. The program is focused on four broad dimensions, namely economics, environmental footprint, community noise, and operational robustness. The Overture will use a medium-bypass geared turbofan called Symphony, developed with Florida Turbine Technologies and GE Aerospace. Boom targets Mach 1.7 at 60,000 feet, a fast cruise but less than Concorde's Mach 2.02 speed.

The Overture's carbon-fiber composite structure allows higher specific strength, integral acoustic damping, lightning paths, and tighter tolerances for natural laminar flow. The cabin will have the capacity to seat between 65 and 80 passengers comapred to the 92 to 100 that Concorde offered, and Boom Supersonic has committed to certifying the jet with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Boom estimates that life-cycle CO2 emissions could drop by 80-90% compared with Jet A fuel if a sufficient SAF supply chain is established. The Overture would offer a 50% fuel-burn reduction per passenger, Stage 5 noise compliance, SAF-enabled near-net-zero life-cycle CO2 and a ticket price that would be within the existing business-class band rather than the ultra-luxury niche that Concorde occupied.

Operational resilience and certification are key design principles, as well as reduced maintenance costs. The company plans to produce 15 aircraft per year from a purpose-built facility in Greensboro, North Carolina, targeting a fleet of 300-500 by 2040. In the absence of the Concorde, a new SST may finally arrive.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mp3.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 11:57:18.760946

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil.

ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. According to IOC, the certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend. For instance, Airbus claims that all its aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50 per cent blend of SAF and conventional fuel. Various Indian airlines have already operated successfully a few test and demonstration flights using jet fuel doped with SAF in various proportions. According to aviation industry and energy experts, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

According to Sahney, given that Europe already has SAF blending mandates, European airlines could be the first potential buyers of IOC’s SAF, which they can buy when they fly into India.

The refiner is also exploring export opportunities, given that SAF demand is expected to shoot up globally over the coming years.

The year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

The government has been working on a roadmap for introduction of SAF in domestic flights and there were indications earlier that some sort of a blending mandate or recommendation could take effect over the next couple of years. However, given the high cost of production of the biofuel and opposition from airlines over apprehensions of fuel cost escalation, the government is now looking at introducing any such mandate only from 2027 or beyond. According to industry insiders, SAF currently costs around three times the price of regular jet fuel.

While IOC has received the certification for the used cooking oil pathway for SAF production, the company is also working on setting up units based on the alcohol-to-jet pathway, which involves using ethanol as a feedstock to make SAF. A few other companies in India are also working to build units based on the various SAF manufacturing pathways. All such technologies and units need to be certified before they can start commercial operations.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/08/aviation.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 11:57:31.234546

The airline aims to create amenity kits that passengers will repurpose after their flights.

Other airlines are also implementing sustainable practices, like fuel-efficient routes and electric ground vehicles.

Singapore Airlines wants you to reuse their amenity kit after your flight.

The company has many sustainability initiatives, including scaling its use of sustainable aviation fuel, optimizing its routes for fuel efficiency and reducing its energy usage in ground operations. But the airline said that making its amenity kits last past the flight is another way to keep its operations eco-friendly.

“One of the things that we see across the company now is that sustainability is top of mind, but we balance that with what our customers expect, with what they need.” Timothy Chua, Singapore Airlines’ Vice President of Lounge Development and Inflight Operations, told USA TODAY in an interview. “At all times, we deliver something that is helpful and well-considered.”

Across the industry, airlines have been making efforts to reduce their carbon footprints as well as their waste production in their operations. Companies try to strike a balance between minimizing waste from onboard services like amenity kits and food and beverages, while also making sure passengers have everything they need to stay comfortable, especially on long-haul flights.

Many U.S. airlines with long international routes also provide amenity kits on long-haul flights, most commonly overnight flights to overseas destinations. These are often available even in economy, though the specific kits usually vary by class of service

Sustainable amenity kits

Chua said Singapore works with its suppliers to make sure all the components in the amenity kit, like lotion bottles, are as recyclable or sustainable as possible.

“What we do is now, when we do our discussions with our vendors, we take a look at what materials they use and how easily recyclable they can be done,” he said. “One of the things that works for us is that it’s not just ask asking for it, they themselves are looking for it.”

In business class, Singapore Airlines provides amenity kits by Le Labo with lip balm, hand cream, and facial moisturizing mist. The airline also provides eye masks, ear plugs and other items on request, as well as toothbrushes, shaving kits and moisturizers in the lavatories.

But equally as importantly, the company wants to make sure the kit itself is appealing and versatile enough that passengers will want to take it off the plane to use the bag for other purposes.

“Could it be a travel pack for your passports, your tickets?” he said. “We want to make it attractive for people to reuse.”

The airline wouldn’t reveal specific data on how many of its amenity kits leave the plane. Chua said that, anecdotally, the company is satisfied that they are being reused at a good rate.

He added that the airline is experimenting with an amenity kit on demand model, in which passengers have to request one, rather than one being available at every seat when they board. He said that this can help improve sustainability by ensuring passengers who don’t need the amenity kit won’t soil one, and he said so far, customer feedback to the tests has been positive.

Re-using pillows, blankets

Singapore Airlines also boosts its sustainability in a number of other ways. According to the airline, keeping a young, fuel-efficient fleet is one of their top goals, but airline executives also do lifecycle analyses for things like pillows and blankets and other onboard products to ensure they are reusable for an extended period.

“When we work in the design we also talk about cycle time. We know how long a product will last, we want to make sure it will last a decent time,"" Chua said. Such reusability reduces the airline’s overall waste footprint.

What US airlines are doing

Across the industry, airlines are trying to go greener. As a whole, aviation has a goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, although that gets less likely by the year as sustainable aviation fuel development and scaling stalls.

Meanwhile, major airlines are taking other steps to improve their sustainability practices where they can.

American Airlines, for example, is working with the FAA to develop more fuel efficient routes for its flights.

“American is working with the FAA to design and execute more efficient descent procedures that allow aircraft to safely glide to airports from cruising altitude, instead of more traditional stair-step descents that require more thrust,” a graphic about the airline’s sustainability practices says. “It is estimated that these procedures could save up to 11 million gallons of fuel annually at our (Charlotte) and (Phoenix) hubs.” Delta has an initiative to electrify its ground vehicles as much as possible. According to the airline, 42% of its core fleet of ground vehicles is already electrified, and the company is on track to reach 100% electrification by 2035.

In 2024, United introduced more eco-friendly meal service items in its economy cabins, in an effort to reduce the amount of single-use plastics distributed on its flights. The new service items include 100% bamboo cutlery, napkins made from 70% recycled materials and more non-plastic packaging materials.

However, a refinery of IndianOil has now won a certification to use the same oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the company chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation.

It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil's Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification - ISCC - developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to produce SAF from used cooking oil, he said.

""We are the only company in the country to get this certification,"" he said.

""The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year.""

The production will be enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027, he added.

Explaining the process, agencies will collect used cooking oil from large users, such as hotel chains, restaurants, and snacks and sweets producing companies like Haldiram, and supply it to Panipat refinery.

Panipat refinery will use this oil to produce SAF, he said.

Large hotels and restaurant chains normally discard cooking oil after one use.

At present, this used cooking oil is collected by agencies and exported.

""There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection.

""While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,"" he said.

Parallely, the company has also set up a Rs 5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce Butyl Acrylate (BA), which is used in making paints.

The 150,000 tonnes per annum Butyl Acrylate plant, only second in India after BPCL's unit at Kochi refinery, will help end 320,000 tonnes of annual paint feedstock that the country currently imports, Sahney noted.

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has been at the forefront of innovations, particularly in the areas of green energy, sustainable solutions, and technological advancements.

The firm is working on renewable energy sources, like 2G ethanol, fuel cells, bio-diesel, and energy storage devices.

""The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported.

In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,"" he said.

Together with the Kochi plant, the new unit can substitute as much as 80-90 per cent of imports, he said.

On green hydrogen, Sahney said the company awarded a tender for the country's largest green hydrogen plant to L&T.

""The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,"" he said.

Green hydrogen, produced from splitting water using renewable energy, is a clean energy source that only emits water vapour and leaves no residue in the air, unlike coal and oil. It can be used in industries and automobiles as fuel, but the prohibitive production cost has been a stumbling block.

India has relatively cheaper renewable energy (electricity produced from sunlight and wind), which has helped keep green hydrogen production cost at less than $4 per kg, the chairman said, adding that IndianOil will use the fuel in its Panipat refinery.

Refineries, currently, use grey hydrogen - hydrogen produced from fossil fuels - in hydrocracking units to produce fuels like petrol and jet fuels.

""IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics,"" Sahney said.

""A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature.""

Explaining the SAF certification process, he said, ""SAF produced at IOC's Panipat refinery has undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations.""

Certifications like ISCC CORSIA ensure the fuel meets environmental and social standards.

The certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production, in line with the government's vision of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

With this recognition, IOC has once again reaffirmed its role as a trailblazer in India's energy transition, bringing India closer to a greener and cleaner aviation future.

India plans to mandate blending of SAF with conventional ATF in a staged manner.

One per cent SAF blending in ATF sold to all international flights is to start from 2017 and increase to 2 per cent in the following year.

SpiceJet had flown a test flight, using a blend of 75 per cent regular ATF and 25 per cent biofuel in August 2018.

Subsequently, IndiGo did a demonstration flight using a 10 per cent SAF blend on an international flight in February 2022.

While CORSIA is a key part of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) strategy to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international flights going ahead, Cotecna is a leading provider of testing, inspection and certification services.",https://im.rediff.com/money/2025/aug/17aug-used-oil.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 08:56:11.202173

This will be sufficient to meet India’s 1 per cent SAF blending requirement in jet fuel for international flights starting 2027,” Sahney said.

From kitchens to runways

SAF is derived from non-petroleum feedstocks and can be blended up to 50 per cent with conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF). To source raw material, agencies will collect used cooking oil from hotels, restaurant chains, and major snack producers such as Haldiram before supplying it to the Panipat refinery. Currently, much of this oil is exported, but IOC’s initiative aims to build a domestic supply chain.While collection from large establishments is manageable, Sahney noted that tapping into smaller users and households remains a challenge. “There is significant availability of used cooking oil in the country, but the issue lies in building an efficient collection system,” he added.

Expanding green energy portfolio

Alongside SAF, IOC has also commissioned a ₹5,000-crore Butyl Acrylate (BA) unit at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat — the country’s second such facility after BPCL’s Kochi plant. With a capacity of 1,50,000 tonnes per annum, the plant will substantially reduce India’s annual import of 3,20,000 tonnes of paint feedstock.The company is also investing in green hydrogen, with a 10,000-tonne-per-year plant coming up at Panipat in partnership with L&T. Expected to be commissioned in 27 months, the facility will be India’s largest green hydrogen unit, supporting the refinery’s shift from fossil-based “grey” hydrogen.

A step towards net-zero

According to IOC, SAF produced at Panipat has undergone rigorous lifecycle emission assessments, ensuring compliance with environmental and social standards. The certification paves the way for Indian airlines to adopt SAF as part of their decarbonisation strategies.India has already outlined a phased SAF blending mandate — beginning with 1 per cent in 2027 and gradually increasing thereafter. Airlines such as SpiceJet and IndiGo have conducted SAF test flights in recent years, underscoring the industry’s readiness for transition.“With this recognition, IOC reaffirms its role as a trailblazer in India’s energy transition,” Sahney said. “These innovations bring us closer to the government’s vision of net-zero emissions by 2070, while ensuring that Indian aviation contributes to global sustainability goals.”",https://www.newsinc24.com/uploads/news/India_Oil.jpg,N,,2025-08-17 10:56:28.242688

IndianOil’s Panipat refinery has received international certification to convert used cooking oil from homes and restaurants into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), company chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said. The refinery has obtained the ICAO’s ISCC CORSIA certification, developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, to produce SAF from used cooking oil, PTI reported. “We are the only company in the country to get this certification,” Sahney said. “The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year.” According to him, this production capacity will be sufficient to meet India’s requirement of blending 1 per cent SAF with conventional jet fuel by 2027. Under government rules, international airlines will need to use 1 per cent SAF-blended aviation turbine fuel (ATF) starting that year. SAF can be mixed with ATF up to 50 per cent. Collection agencies will source used cooking oil from large establishments such as hotels, restaurants, and companies including Haldiram, and supply it to the Panipat refinery. The facility will process the oil into SAF. “There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,” Sahney added. He explained that SAF produced at Panipat has “undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations.”Other initiatives IndianOil also commissioned a Rs 5,000 crore Butyl Acrylate (BA) unit at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat, used in paint manufacturing. The 1,50,000 tonnes per year facility is the second in India after BPCL’s Kochi unit. “The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported. In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,” Sahney said. He added that together with BPCL’s Kochi facility, the new unit can replace 80-90 per cent of India’s BA imports. Sahney also announced that L&T has been selected to construct the nation’s largest green hydrogen facility at Panipat. “The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,” he said. The fuel will replace grey hydrogen currently used at refineries, lowering the carbon footprint of operations. Green hydrogen, produced by splitting water using renewable energy, emits only water vapour. Despite high global production costs, Sahney noted that India’s comparatively low-cost renewable power keeps the price under USD 4 per kg. “IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics. A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature,” Sahney said. He added that IndianOil’s SAF certification sets a benchmark for other refiners to increase production, helping the aviation sector lower emissions and supporting India’s 2070 net-zero target.

However, a refinery of IndianOil has now won a certification to use the same oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the company chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney said.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IndianOil's Panipat refinery in Haryana has won the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification - ISCC - developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to produce SAF from used cooking oil, he said.

""We are the only company in the country to get this certification,"" he said.

""The refinery will start producing some 35,000 tonnes per annum of SAF from the end of the calendar year."" The production will be enough to meet the mandated 1 per cent blending requirement for the country in 2027, he added.

Explaining the process, agencies will collect used cooking oil from large users, such as hotel chains, restaurants, and snacks and sweets producing companies like Haldiram, and supply it to Panipat refinery.

Panipat refinery will use this oil to produce SAF, he said.

Large hotels and restaurant chains normally discard cooking oil after one use. At present, this used cooking oil is collected by agencies and exported.

""There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households,"" he said.

Parallely, the company has also set up a ₹5,000 crore plant at its Koyali refinery in Gujarat to produce Butyl Acrylate (BA), which is used in making paints.

The 1,50,000 tonnes per annum Butyl Acrylate plant, only second in India after BPCL's unit at Kochi refinery, will help end 3,20,000 tonnes of annual paint feedstock that the country currently imports, Sahney noted.

State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has been at the forefront of innovations, particularly in the areas of green energy, sustainable solutions, and technological advancements. The firm is working on renewable energy sources, like 2G ethanol, fuel cells, bio-diesel, and energy storage devices.

""The paint industry is growing at a CAGR of 13-14 per cent, and the bulk of the raw material they use is imported. In July, we commissioned the BA unit at Koyali refinery, which will eliminate the need to import, saving foreign exchange for the country,"" he said.

Together with the Kochi plant, the new unit can substitute as much as 80-90 per cent of imports, he said.

On green hydrogen, Sahney said the company awarded a tender for the country's largest green hydrogen plant to L&amp;T.

""The 10,000 tonnes a year green hydrogen unit at the Panipat refinery will be ready in 27 months,"" he said.

Green hydrogen, produced from splitting water using renewable energy, is a clean energy source that only emits water vapour and leaves no residue in the air, unlike coal and oil. It can be used in industries and automobiles as fuel, but the prohibitive production cost has been a stumbling block.

India has relatively cheaper renewable energy (electricity produced from sunlight and wind), which has helped keep green hydrogen production cost at less than USD 4 per kg, the chairman said, adding that IndianOil will use the fuel in its Panipat refinery.

Refineries, currently, use grey hydrogen - hydrogen produced from fossil fuels - in hydrocracking units to produce fuels like petrol and jet fuels.

""IndianOil remains agile and nimble in product innovation and meeting fast-changing energy dynamics,"" Sahney said. ""A lot of other innovations are in the works, which will be unveiled when they mature."" Explaining the SAF certification process, he said, ""SAF produced at IOC's Panipat refinery has undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations"".

Certifications like ISCC CORSIA ensure the fuel meets environmental and social standards.

The certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production, in line with the government's vision of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

With this recognition, IOC has once again reaffirmed its role as a trailblazer in India's energy transition, bringing India closer to a greener and cleaner aviation future.

India plans to mandate blending of SAF with conventional ATF in a staged manner. One per cent SAF blending in ATF sold to all international flights is to start from 2017 and increase to 2 per cent in the following year.

SpiceJet had flown a test flight, using a blend of 75 per cent regular ATF and 25 per cent biofuel in August 2018. Subsequently, IndiGo did a demonstration flight using a 10 per cent SAF blend on an international flight in February 2022.

While CORSIA is a key part of the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) strategy to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international flights going ahead, Cotecna is a leading provider of testing, inspection and certification services.

Petrolimex ra mắt nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF)

Petrolimex tiên phong pha chế và cung ứng SAF tại Việt Nam

SAF là nhiên liệu hàng không được sản xuất từ các nguồn nguyên liệu tái tạo, thay thế cho nhiên liệu hóa thạch truyền thống. SAF có khả năng giảm tới 80% lượng phát thải CO₂ so với nhiên liệu hàng không truyền thống. Đây được xem là giải pháp then chốt của ngành hàng không toàn cầu để giảm phát thải, hướng tới mục tiêu Net Zero - phát thải ròng bằng 0 - vào năm 2050.

Petrolimex là đơn vị đầu tiên tại Việt Nam nhập khẩu hydrocarbon được tổng hợp từ nguyên liệu có nguồn gốc sinh học/tái tạo (synthetic blending components - SBC). Petrolimex cũng là đơn vị đầu tiên tại Việt Nam làm chủ công nghệ pha chế SAF từ SBC tuân thủ các tiêu chuẩn quốc tế nghiêm ngặt như EI 1533, ASTM D7566, DEF STAN 91-091,... và Tiêu chuẩn Việt Nam – TCVN 14414:2025.

Sản phẩm SAF đã được Công ty Cổ phần Nhiên liệu bay Petrolimex (Petrolimex Aviation) cung cấp, tra nạp thành công cho các chuyến bay thương mại trong nước. Với ý nghĩa đặc biệt này, Hệ thống phối trộn nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững (SAF) tại Tổng kho Xăng dầu Nhà Bè được Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam ghi nhận là một trong các công trình tiêu biểu chào mừng kỷ niệm 70 năm thành lập Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam (12/01/1956 – 12/01/2026).

Phát biểu tại sự kiện, Ủy viên BCH Đảng bộ Chính phủ, Bí thư Đảng ủy, Chủ tịch HĐQT Petrolimex Phạm Văn Thanh cho biết: “Petrolimex chủ động đầu tư, nghiên cứu, làm chủ công nghệ pha chế SAF tại Tổng kho Xăng dầu Nhà Bè. Petrolimex cũng là đơn vị đầu tiên tại Việt Nam nhập khẩu SBC dùng để pha chế SAF.

Thành công này thể hiện cam kết mạnh mẽ của Tập đoàn trong hành trình chuyển đổi xanh, đồng hành cùng Chính phủ, các hãng hàng không và toàn xã hội hướng tới phát triển bền vững”.

Cục trưởng Cục Hàng không Việt Nam, ông Uông Việt Dũng, đánh giá cao Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam và Petrolimex Aviation đi đầu trong việc triển khai nghiên cứu, pha chế và cung ứng SAF. Lãnh đạo Cục Hàng không Việt Nam nhấn mạnh: “Việc ra mắt sản phẩm SAF không chỉ có ý nghĩa về mặt thương mại mà còn mang ý nghĩa chiến lược lâu dài, tạo tiền đề xây dựng chuỗi cung ứng SAF bền vững trong nước; đáp ứng yêu cầu của thị trường quốc tế; khuyến khích hợp tác giữa các hãng hàng không, đơn vị cung cấp nhiên liệu, cơ quan quản lý và các tổ chức tài chính nhằm mở rộng quy mô sử dụng SAF tại Việt Nam”.

Hệ thống cung ứng, tra nạp nhiên liệu hàng không của Petrolimex Aviation đạt chứng nhận quốc tế ISCC EU và ISCC CORSIA – các tiêu chuẩn hàng đầu về tính bền vững và giảm phát thải carbon, được công nhận tại hơn 130 quốc gia. Ông Nguyễn Văn Học – Tổng Giám đốc Petrolimex Aviation chia sẻ, việc được cấp chứng nhận quốc tế uy tín nêu trên là minh chứng cho năng lực và tính chuyên nghiệp của Petrolimex trong triển khai SAF. Petrolimex Aviation sẵn sàng đồng hành cùng các đối tác trong và ngoài nước hướng tới ngành hàng không xanh, an toàn và bền vững.

Ký kết thỏa thuận hợp tác tiêu thụ SAF với Vietjet và AEG Fuels

Tại sự kiện, Petrolimex Aviation ký kết thỏa thuận hợp tác tiêu thụ SAF với Công ty Cổ phần Hàng không Vietjet (Vietjet).

Theo thỏa thuận, Petrolimex Aviation sẽ tra nạp toàn bộ 1.200 m³ SAF đầu tiên được pha trộn tại Việt Nam cho các chuyến bay của Vietjet, đồng thời chuyển giao Bằng chứng Bền vững – Proof of Sustainability (PoS) theo tiêu chuẩn ISCC EU. Đây là dấu mốc quan trọng, khẳng định cam kết của hai bên trong việc giảm phát thải khí carbon và phát triển ngành hàng không xanh tại Việt Nam.

Ông Tô Việt Thắng – Phó Tổng Giám đốc Thường trực Vietjet cho biết: “Thỏa thuận hợp tác tiêu thụ SAF hôm nay giữa Vietjet và Petrolimex Aviation thể hiện cam kết của hai doanh nghiệp, ngành hàng không hướng tới các mục tiêu phát triển xanh, bền vững.

Với tổng cộng 576 tàu bay hiện đại đã đặt hàng, đội bay xanh của Vietjet sử dụng SAF sẽ góp phần giảm đáng kể lượng khí thải, bảo vệ môi trường, tiên phong sử dụng nhiên liệu sạch, góp phần hiện thực hóa khát vọng phát triển, vươn mình trong kỷ nguyên hội nhập toàn cầu của đất nước.”

Cũng trong khuôn khổ sự kiện, Petrolimex Aviation ký kết hợp tác với AEG Fuels – đối tác quốc tế chiến lược hàng đầu trong lĩnh vực cung ứng SAF.

Sự hợp tác này mở rộng mạng lưới kết nối của Petrolimex Aviation ra thị trường toàn cầu, tạo tiền đề để SAF sản xuất tại Việt Nam tiếp cận khách hàng quốc tế và thúc đẩy quá trình chuyển đổi xanh của ngành hàng không.

Originally scheduled to reach Incheon at 7.50pm on 13 August, AirAsia Flight D7 506 reportedly touched down at Gimpo, 35km from Incheon, at 8.08pm after circling in the air. Passengers on the flight said after the captain announced they had arrived at Incheon, people stood up to retrieve their bags from the overhead compartments, but some looked out of the windows and checked their phones, and realised they were at Gimpo.

“Everyone panicked. It seemed the cabin crew didn’t know we had landed at Gimpo until passengers told them,” Lee Mi-hyun, a passenger in her 40s who was returning from a trip to Malaysia with her husband and eight-year-old daughter, told The Korea Herald. “One crew member even said she needed to call her parents, who were waiting for her at Incheon International Airport.”

What caused the flight to divert to Gimpo was “turbulence” over Incheon Airport. The flight departed for Incheon about two hours later at 10.17pm after refuelling, according to the Korea Airports Corp.

“They appeared just as confused as the passengers. No water was offered and there was almost no food left on board, leaving passengers with children upset. Some even said they would rather get off at Gimpo before the plane departed for Incheon,” Lee said.

“During the two hours before we departed for Incheon again, there was no clear explanation of what caused the landing error or any effort to reassure passengers,” another passenger told The Korea Herald.

In a statement on Aug 14, AirAsia X clarified that the flight was diverted to Gimpo for refuelling following air traffic congestion at Incheon due to adverse weather conditions.

AirAsia X (AAX) said flight D7506 diverted to Gimpo International Airport (GMP) earlier in the evening for refuelling following air traffic congestion at ICN due to adverse weather conditions. The airline said “a miscommunication occurred in the cabin crew announcement upon landing, which the captain promptly clarified, confirming the diversion to Gimpo Airport due to adverse weather and refuelling. The captain also apologised to guests for the inconvenience, reassuring them that the landing at Gimpo was to to refuel and that the aircraft will proceed to its original destination.

Benyamin Ismail, the CEO of AirAsia X said: “This was an unforeseen situation caused by adverse weather in Incheon. Following the potential delay and the risk of landing with fuel below requirement, the aircraft was diverted to Gimpo International Airport in the interest of safety for refuelling. Upon completing all safety procedures, the aircraft subsequently took off for Incheon International Airport, where guests eventually disembarked. We will also review our internal announcements and onboard information-sharing processes to ensure greater clarity in such situations. We thank our guests for their understanding and cooperation during this operational adjustment, which was necessary to ensure the safety of everyone on board. As a good will gesture, AAX will be extending travel vouchers and will be reaching out to the affected guests directly.”

This is not the first time AirAsia has gotten the wrong airport. In 2015, an AirAsia flight from Sydney to Malaysia ended up in Melbourne instead when the pilot entered the wrong coordinates into the internal navigation system, an air safety investigation found. The Airbus A330 was scheduled to leave Sydney international airport at 11.55am on 10 March 2015, and arrive in Kuala Lumpur just under nine hours later. Instead, through a combination of data entry errors, crew ignoring unexplained chimes from the computer system, and bad weather in Sydney, it landed in Melbourne just after 2pm.

Melbourne airport is 722km southwest of Sydney. Kuala Lumpur is 6,611km northwest.

According to a report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) the problem occurred when faulty headsets prompted the captain and first officer to swap their usual pre-flight checks. Ordinarily, the report said, the captain would conduct an external inspection of the plane while the first officer stayed in the cockpit and, among other tasks, completed the position initialisation and alignment procedures.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/airasia-fly-2.jpeg,N,,2025-08-17 02:58:48.070827

For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express’s Asia Pacific network.
Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said: “This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network.","DHL Express and the Cathay Group have entered into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership that reinforces their shared commitment to reducing carbon emissions in the air cargo industry. Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights departing from three airports in Asia: Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.

Continuing through 2025, the partnership is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 tonnes — equivalent to the emissions of over 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore with an Airbus 330 freighter.

DHL Express Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation – Asia Pacific Peter Bardens said: “Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand. DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which recognises ‘green logistics of choice’ as one of the four bottom lines.”

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express’s Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said: “This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia.” 3

This collaboration makes DHL Express the latest strategic partner of Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme, an initiative launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight through the use of SAF. In 2024, the Corporate SAF Programme enabled the use of over 6,000 tonnes of SAF, with 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA and Standard Chartered.

Cathay has been steadily expanding its SAF efforts across the region. Earlier in 2025, the Group entered into an agreement with Sinopec to uplift SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland at Hong Kong International Airport, marking the first such export by Sinopec to Hong Kong. Additionally, Cathay has partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027. Apart from working closely with suppliers, the Group also co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) to collectively drive policy development and adoption of SAF locally. These initiatives reflect Cathay’s mission to expand the use of SAF within its network and foster a regional SAF ecosystem.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/cdn.uc_.assets.prezly-9.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 22:56:18.148018

Vertical Integration as a Natural Trade Shield However, promoter-led businesses can be vulnerable due to the same characteristics that make them strong.","By Dr. Neha Gosain, PhD, Assistant Professor, IILM New Delhi

While the world is going through a dramatic rise in geopolitical shifts and tariff battles, there is a class of shareholders in the Indian Inc. that is holding the ground for their firms. Corporations with promoter ownership of more than an average 50% are termed as promoter-owned firms. Indian firms like Reliance Industries Ltd., the Tata Group, Adani Group, and Bajaj Auto are among a few that have shown a surprising resilience against the global upheavals. These firms are seen to acquire many structural advantages compared to other firms, helping them ride the tariff shock waves. But can their defining advantages become their Achilles’ heel?

Due to their concentrated ownership and centralized decision-making, promoter-led companies are more agile in global crises. Tata Steel’s swift response to the US’s 25% steel tariff in 2018—selling its declining US arm and expanding in Europe in three years—is a good example. Reliance Industries also anticipated trade tensions by reducing dependency on Chinese petrochemical imports and building a large integrated petrochemical and refining complex in Jamnagar by 2023. Because they can make bold, long-term bets without the quarterly earnings pressures that publicly traded companies encounter, these businesses have a clear advantage in volatile tariff environments.

Geopolitical Shifts and the Resilience of Promoter-Led Firms

In India, many of the leading promoter-led businesses have established vertically integrated business models that act as natural trade barriers. This is best demonstrated by the Tata Group, whose power division supports manufacturing and whose automotive division sources steel from its own mills, protecting it from fluctuations in import prices. The Adani Group’s ownership of ports, power plants, and coal mines provides natural tariff protection throughout its infrastructure empire, while Sun Pharma’s in-house API production facilitated transitions during the trade tensions between China and India.

Instead of using quarterly reporting cycles, promoter-led businesses frequently follow generational timelines. This patience is demonstrated by Bajaj Auto’s decades-long effort to enter the high-end European motorcycle markets. The business continued with its internationalization strategy despite major import duties and trade barriers in essential markets, eventually becoming a major player in the two-wheeler market on a global scale.

Strategic investments that might be unpopular with more short-term-oriented competitors are made possible by this long-term orientation. For example, due to energy transition policies and possible carbon tariffs, Adani Green Energy made significant investments in renewable infrastructure, hoping these assets would eventually become priceless. Even though these wagers are risky, if trade policies develop as expected, they can result in significant competitive advantages.

Vertical Integration as a Natural Trade Shield

However, promoter-led businesses can be vulnerable due to the same characteristics that make them strong. Some groups have suffered due to their excessive devotion to outdated, less adaptable businesses and their resistance to necessary change. Vedanta Resources was particularly negatively impacted when trade restrictions and environmental regulations started to rise sharply because it relied heavily on mining and aluminum as its main revenue streams.

Promoter-led businesses thrive when they maintain flexibility while maintaining strong governance, as demonstrated by the Tata Group’s Chandrasekaran-led balance of professional management and family control and Bajaj Auto’s ability to withstand challenging trading conditions by combining family leadership with capable executives. Those who combine the flexibility and vision of family leadership with the discipline and openness of professional management will influence their futures and India’s place in the world economy in an era of growing trade barriers and economic nationalism.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/smstreet/media/media_files/2025/08/16/dr-neha-gosain-2025-08-16-13-36-37.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 18:56:13.690801
