United Airlines has deepened its commitment to decarbonizing aviation by investing in Twelve, a cleantech company that converts CO₂ into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using renewable energy. The investment was made through United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund℠, a $200M+ coalition including GE Aerospace, Google, and Embraer, focused on scaling commercially viable SAF technologies.

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures. “Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured.”

Founded in 2015, California-based Twelve has developed a process that mimics photosynthesis—transforming CO₂ and water into fuels, plastics, and chemicals, powered entirely by renewable electricity. Its SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

This funding follows Twelve’s recent $83M Series C round and the development of AirPlant™ One, its first commercial SAF production facility in Moses Lake, Washington. The plant will begin operations this year, producing 50,000 gallons of drop-in SAF annually.

Twelve also recently signed one of the largest SAF supply agreements to date—a 14-year contract with a major European airline group to deliver 260 million gallons of SAF across five carriers. The long-term deal positions Twelve as a serious contender in the commercial SAF market.

As we enter the last phase of session, we are negotiating budget bills with the Senate and the Governor in conference committees for final passage.

As co-chair of the Agriculture Committee, my focus will be on fighting for an Ag budget that centers people. Today, we had our first conference committee meeting on the Agriculture budget bill, walking through the differences in the House and Senate versions of the bill.

Whether it's helping those facing food insecurity, getting healthy local foods to our kids in schools, protecting workers from avian flu, or supporting small farmers buying their first farm, we want a budget that improves Minnesotans’ lives.

Protecting our Environmental Progress

This year, Republicans used their time on the Environment and Natural Resources Committee to hear legislation that would roll back the hard-fought progress we made in 2023 and 2024 to protect our environment. DFLers united to block those provisions from moving forward this year.

This week, we passed an Environment Budget that maintains our protection of Minnesotans’ land, water, and air from threats like PFAS, nitrates, and aquatic invasive species. While the bill didn’t make the new investments that I would have liked, it is a big win for Minnesotans that we stopped the worst of the GOP’s priorities from becoming reality.

In the News

This weekend is the Minnesota fishing opener, and I wish you all the best of luck out on the water! I spoke to MPR News about the push to ban lead tackle, which can harm fish and travel up the food chain to other wildlife.

As the author of legislation that would ban lead tackle in swan breeding areas, I believe we must do more to protect our wildlife. While that bill hasn’t made progress due to cost concerns from other legislators, I think eventually change will come as we see younger people and new anglers join the sport.

You can also read my response in this Minnesota Reformer article about the industry push for so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It’s clear this isn’t about sustainability, it’s about corn. Proponents of increasing tax credits for SAF are greenwashing a system with serious environmental and community impacts.

I believe that we should be prioritizing tax breaks for people, like renters and first-time homebuyers, not corporations producing sustainable aviation fuel that isn’t actually sustainable. I’ve introduced legislation to do just that, which you can find here.

Saturday, May 17, from 8am-4pm is the South St. Paul Garden Club Plant Sale, located at 1900 Burma Lane. Proceeds will be used to send kindergartners to Doge Nature Center, support Neighbors Inc., and go to other community projects. You can find more information here.

1. Power systems in the spotlight

Blackouts across Spain and Portugal have led to calls for governments to invest in resilient electricity systems as the energy transition progresses.

Late last month, the countries suffered a power outage that lasted for many hours, grounding planes, halting public transport and forcing hospitals to suspend operations.

The root cause of the incident remains unknown, but Spain lost around 60% of its power generation - and it took 23 hours until its grid was declared back to normal capacity.

Electricity demand is growing due to factors including economic development and the rollout of new technology such as artificial intelligence. At the same time, power generation is becoming more decentralized and variable. The outage highlighted how every area of modern society can be affected if power drops.

What can policy-makers do? At the World Economic Forum, a Power System Transformation initiative is working to enable a shift to a power system that balances supply and demand affordably and sustainably.

2. Carbon capture takes off

Last year was a “year of firsts” for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

In a new update to its CCUS Projects Database, the agency says in 2024 several first-of-a-kind projects went into the construction phase or started operations in sectors that had not used the technology before. These included the first natural gas power plant with carbon capture and storage reaching a final investment decision in the UK, and, in China, the world’s first project to capture carbon emissions from cement production.

Regions including Indonesia and Kenya also saw their first CCUS projects move to the construction phase, and milestones were also reached in financing the technology.

Many experts say CCUS will have a key role in helping to deliver a low-emissions, secure and affordable energy system. To get there, it is predicted global capacity of the technology needs to expand by more than 100 times in the long term.

3. News in brief: More energy stories from around the world

The US energy storage industry has made a $100 billion commitment to manufacture and buy US-made batteries. It wants to meet 100% of domestic energy storage demand by 2030.

A start-up in Switzerland is testing solar panels that can be installed between train tracks – and quickly removed to allow railroad maintenance.

A study using data from 26 countries over 15 years has said electric-vehicle adoption is “positively associated” with increased CO2 emissions because countries are still using fossil fuels to generate the electricity that powers them.

Taiwan has supplied a blend of sustainable aviation fuel to refuel planes owned by three domestic carriers.

Kazakhstan has said it will prioritize its national interests over those of OPEC+ when deciding oil production levels.

The UK’s energy secretary has called for countries to cooperate to reduce risk to energy supplies. Ed Miliband was speaking at an energy security summit in London attended by representatives from more than 50 governments.

The European Commission (EC) is set to present a roadmap for how it will phase out imports of fossil fuels from Russia. Imports of liquefied natural gas from the US and gas from Norway are of “strategic importance” to the European Union, EC President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Researchers in Singapore are testing a new type of hydropower that harnesses energy from raindrops.

Indonesia is planning a significant expansion in renewable energy by 2040, including the introduction of 10 gigawatts of nuclear power.

The UK has said it will fit almost all homes constructed by 2027 with solar panels. Housebuilders will be legally required to comply.

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) nuclear fusion project has reached a major milestone on the path to clean energy generation – assembling a powerful magnet that will help confine plasma particles.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

As demand for soybean oil grows, so does the availability of soybean meal, which is a key feed ingredient for livestock.
That growth is expected to generate an additional billion gallons of biodiesel and renewable diesel to meet rising demand.
Biodiesel and renewable diesel fit that bill perfectly with no engine modifications.” He pointed to emerging markets such as railroads and marine transport, as well as international interest in renewable diesel.
He added that renewable fuels not only offer environmental benefits but also support American agriculture.","Greg Anderson, a farmer near Newman Grove and at-large director of the Nebraska Soybean Board, continues to champion the impact of biodiesel and renewable diesel on both the state and national level.

His advocacy recently took him to Washington, D.C., where he worked on behalf of Clean Fuels Alliance America to raise awareness about the importance of renewable fuels in agriculture.

“We had a great opportunity with the National Association of Farm Broadcasters, a spring meeting out there,” Anderson said. “And we had an opportunity to talk about biodiesel and renewable diesel and the importance it plays in Nebraska agriculture as well as across the country… Biodiesel accounts for about 13% of the price of a bushel of soybeans, and that’s really, really important in these times.”

Anderson noted that in 2024, the clean fuels industry used over a billion pounds of soybean oil per month in fuel production. As demand for soybean oil grows, so does the availability of soybean meal, which is a key feed ingredient for livestock.

“That helps lower the cost for livestock producers, especially the poultry and pork sector,” he said. “So it’s a win-win for everybody and we’re seeing this great opportunity just accelerate as we go along.”

Soybeans Staying Closer to Home

Anderson highlighted how growth in the renewable fuels industry is helping keep more soybeans in Nebraska.

“With the crush expansion really taking place… we’re going to keep about one-fourth of our Nebraska soybeans at home right here,” he explained. “We’re gonna crush them. We’re gonna use the meal to feed our own domestic livestock… and the soybean oil coming off of those plants will be made into biodiesel and renewable diesel.”

Across the Midwest, about 20 soybean crushing facilities are newly built or undergoing expansion, which Anderson said will increase U.S. crush capacity by about one-third. That growth is expected to generate an additional billion gallons of biodiesel and renewable diesel to meet rising demand.

“Clean Fuels came out with a recent study that shows that biodiesel and renewable diesel account for over 107,000 good paying jobs, many of those in rural communities,” he said. “It comes back to the farm gate… increases the value of a price of a bushel of soybeans.”

Outlook for Renewable Fuels

Looking ahead, Anderson is optimistic about the long-term role of renewable diesel and biodiesel.

“We’re gonna need a drop-in fuel, a liquid fuel for decades to come. Biodiesel and renewable diesel fit that bill perfectly with no engine modifications.”

He pointed to emerging markets such as railroads and marine transport, as well as international interest in renewable diesel. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is also on the horizon.

“A lot of progress is being made here in the last year or two and a lot will happen in the future regarding this, that will command huge volumes of this fuel,” Anderson said.

He added that renewable fuels not only offer environmental benefits but also support American agriculture.

“It’s cleaner burning, higher cetane… and most important probably to me is it is using a product that we grow right here on the farm. It’s renewable,” he said. “Every fall when I harvest my crop… I’m harvesting a feedstock that is ultimately powering my combine.”

What’s Next

Anderson said the renewable fuels industry is closely watching for a forthcoming EPA announcement on Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs), which could further boost market confidence.

“We have capacity for 2 billion gallons of biodiesel and 4.5 billion gallons of renewable diesel in our country,” he said. “Everybody’s kind of looking forward to the EPA announcement… that will show that the nation is serious about using these fuels long term.”

He noted that while many feedstocks contribute to biodiesel production, soybean oil remains the primary one.

“Soybean oil is still the flagship feedstock used in these fuels.”

Spring Fieldwork in Full Swing

Back on his operation near Newman Grove, Anderson said planting progress has been strong this spring.

“Everybody is going full steam ahead with planting progress, and things are gonna wrap up pretty early,” he said. “The crop is going in the ground in good shape… but we’re very, very dry as well.”

He reported that soybeans from his earliest plantings are beginning to emerge, and corn is poking through the soil. However, timely rains will be needed for continued crop development.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/2025/05/Feature-Story-24.png,N,,2025-05-09 14:57:05.302095

(PRESS RELEASE) SINGAPORE, 2025-May-9 — /Travel PR News/ — The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group has taken significant strides in its sustainability journey by finalizing agreements with Neste and World Energy to acquire Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and SAF certificates, respectively. These agreements are part of the Group’s ongoing efforts to decarbonize its operations and gain valuable insights into the renewable fuel sector, including its standards and certification systems.

In its first transaction, the Group acquired 1,000 tonnes of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)-eligible neat SAF from Neste, produced at their Singapore refinery. The SAF was blended locally and uplifted at Singapore Changi Airport. This marks the Group’s second purchase of neat SAF from the Singapore refinery, contributing to the development of the SAF ecosystem in the region and enhancing the resilience of the supply chain.

In addition to the neat SAF purchase, the Group procured approximately 2,000 tonnes of CORSIA-eligible SAF in the form of emissions reductions from World Energy, a U.S.-based SAF producer. This was facilitated using the Book & Claim Chain of Custody model, enabling the Group to claim emissions reductions without the need for physical delivery of the fuel.

Both transactions were completed in the first quarter of 2025, and together, they are expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 9,500 tonnes. This aligns with the SIA Group’s ongoing efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

The Group is also an active participant in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, launched by the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, to promote SAF usage in the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative seeks to increase awareness and understanding of SAF and to drive its adoption by fostering partnerships between airlines and corporations across the region.

Ms. Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer of Singapore Airlines, stated: “These agreements are key steps in our broader strategy to scale up the use of sustainable aviation fuel. By collaborating with diverse suppliers and exploring various sourcing models, we are gaining valuable insights into the SAF landscape and its certification pathways. Our ongoing efforts support the long-term decarbonization goals of the aviation industry, and we are committed to meeting our medium-term target of 5% SAF use by 2030 and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

SIA continues to collaborate with global partners to implement sustainable solutions, further validating SAF demand and enhancing its technical expertise to support the airline industry’s long-term sustainability goals.

While this specific RFP focuses on next-generation SAF, SABA continues to support its members in purchasing high-integrity, commercially available SAF.","The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) has issued a request for proposal (RFP) aimed at significantly boosting the supply of next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This includes innovative power-to-liquids fuels and those derived from advanced biobased feedstocks. This unprecedented aggregated procurement effort is designed to provide a crucial impetus for the long-term, scalable production of SAF, reports Ethanol Producer Magazine.

By specifically targeting next-generation fuels in this RFP, SABA intends to direct investment towards SAF options that face fewer limitations in feedstock availability compared to currently commercialized SAF. This strategic focus aims to enable a more effective and sustainable long-term decarbonization of the aviation sector.

SABA’s membership comprises over 35 companies spanning diverse industries such as finance, technology, media and entertainment, and business consulting. These organizations are committed to reducing their aviation emissions through investments in sustainable aviation fuel. Through this RFP, SABA will facilitate 5 to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members, at volumes sufficient to support a final investment decision (FID) for a new, next-generation SAF production facility.

Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of the SABA Secretariat, emphasized the urgency of the situation. “The SAF market is growing rapidly, but the technologies we need to fully decarbonize the aviation sector are still in their infancy,” she stated. “Investment needs to happen now if we want these technologies to scale post-2030 and keep the aviation sector on track to meet its long-term net zero goals.”

SAF is recognized as the most promising near-term solution for decarbonizing aviation, as it can be seamlessly integrated into existing aircraft fleets. Despite recent significant growth, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of total aviation fuel usage. The market is predominantly supplied by SAF made from traditional feedstocks like waste oils, which face scalability challenges beyond 2030. SAF with the greatest potential for scalability, utilizing feedstocks such as renewable hydrogen, agricultural and forestry residues, and municipal solid waste, represents only a small fraction of the SAF currently available. Without focused investment today, these crucial fuels may not be available in the quantities required to meet global decarbonization objectives.

SABA is actively collaborating with its corporate partners to generate the necessary demand signal, providing advanced SAF producers with the confidence to scale up their production. Utilizing a “book and claim” model, corporate customers will purchase sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc). This mechanism allows them to invest in SAF and claim the associated environmental benefits, even if the physical fuel does not directly power the planes they use. This investment enables travelers to report greenhouse gas emission reductions in their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF is supplied to an aircraft operator.

Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at RMI, a co-founder of SABA, highlighted the importance of the “book and claim” model. “Book and claim is the bridge between the aviation industry’s sustainable fuel ambitions and scalable real-world production — and SABA is helping build it,” he said. “By mobilizing corporate demand and catalyzing investment in cutting-edge fuel production, we can fast-track innovation, expand high-integrity supply, and deliver the climate results the aviation sector urgently needs.”

Since its inception in 2021, SABA has facilitated approximately $200 million in total SAF investment. This includes a 2021 proof-of-concept pilot procurement for a short-term offtake period, followed by a groundbreaking multi-year procurement in 2023-2024 involving 27 participants and supporting roughly 50 million gallons of SAF. Through the RFP announced today, SABA is targeting longer-term offtake agreements to help advanced SAF production plants reach a final investment decision (FID) by 2026 and become operational by 2030.

Elizabeth Sturcken, Vice President at Environmental Defense Fund, another co-founder of SABA, emphasized the collaborative opportunity presented by this RFP. “This RFP is an opportunity for corporate leaders, forward-looking airlines, and next-generation fuel producers to work together toward a truly net-zero aviation sector,” she stated. “We must be strategic in how we grow the SAF market with environmental integrity so that we can decarbonize the aviation sector without placing new demands on limited feedstocks or land resources that may create new environmental problems.”

By participating in this next-generation procurement, SABA members will be able to achieve their emission reduction targets for air travel and air freight through advanced purchases of SAFc linked to next-generation SAF that meets SABA’s stringent sustainability criteria.

SAF suppliers interested in responding to the RFP are encouraged to download the RFP and supporting documentation for further details.

While this specific RFP focuses on next-generation SAF, SABA continues to support its members in purchasing high-integrity, commercially available SAF.

A fuel company plans a $5 billion SAF production facility in Moorhead, while the University of Minnesota researches new oil-producing crops for SAF.

SAF is viewed as a potential solution to reduce aviation's carbon footprint, but critics raise concerns about ""greenwashing"" and continued emissions.

Debate continues regarding the true sustainability of SAF, with some skeptics advocating for alternative transportation options like high-speed rail.

Sustainable aviation fuel is having a moment in Minnesota.

Lawmakers are considering a broad expansion of tax credits for producers of the fuels, in hope of positioning Minnesota as a leading manufacturer.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency recently awarded a grant to the University of Minnesota to study a new oil-producing field crop that holds promise as a chief component of the fuel.

And last fall, a fuel company announced a $5 billion investment in a production facility in Moorhead that’s expected to go online in 2030.

Like other types of lower-carbon fuels, including corn ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel has attracted its share of critics concerned about slapping a “green” label on products and practices that continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as well as farm pollutants into the ground and water.

But from an environmental perspective, air travel is a different, much dirtier beast than vehicle transit. It’s responsible for about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions. And the opportunity to shrink the carbon footprint of the airline industry has drawn support even from environmental groups that have been critical of the push for corn ethanol.

A comprehensive switch from traditional jet fuel to sustainable fuels could reduce total air transit emissions by 70% or more.

“Aviation is really hard to decarbonize,” said Trevor Russell, water program director of the Friends of the Mississippi River. “The best first thing we can do is bend the carbon intensity curve of the fuels we are currently using.”

Issues with ethanol

Ethanol derived from corn and other types of biomass has been promoted as a greener alternative to traditional fossil fuels, and over the past several decades state and federal lawmakers have enacted subsidies to support the farmers who grow the crops as well as the fuel companies mixing and refining the final product.

While the resulting fuel is less carbon-intensive than fossil gasoline, many researchers have argued that when you factor in the increased agricultural land use as well as the processing costs, it may actually produce even more carbon dioxide in the long run.

As a result, many advocates believe that it’s better to encourage a shift to fully-electric cars than to promote half-measures like ethanol.

The situation in aviation is different, however. Batteries are heavy, meaning there’s no realistic path to fully electric flight in the near term, especially not on longer routes. And air travel is incredibly carbon intensive, meaning that even modest changes to efficiency would yield major carbon benefits.

A half-measure like less carbon-intensive fuel, in other words, might be the best near-term option for the industry.

Sustainable aviation fuel boosters

Sustainable aviation fuel boosters in Minnesota are particularly excited about using winter cover crops, like camelina and pennycress, as sources of biofuel. Planting them as cover crops on existing fields doesn’t require tilling additional land and would provide farmers with an additional revenue stream that doesn’t interrupt their regular crop rotations.

“They can share the same acres — they grow in the fall and are harvested in the spring,” Russell said. “You get all of the environmental benefits of cover crops, but producers can actually harvest and sell that cover crop as a sustainable aviation feedstock.”

Preliminary research suggests that camelina-based jet fuel could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75%. But whether those gains could fully scale up to an industry-wide solution remains an open question. Hence, the need for tax credits.

In 2023, lawmakers passed a credit of $1.50 per gallon for producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel. In his 2025 budget, Gov. Tim Walz called for allocation of an additional $20 million toward the credits over the next decade. Lawmakers are currently negotiating final numbers in the ongoing budget discussions.

While support for sustainable aviation fuel is generally bipartisan, not everyone at the Capitol is sold on it. Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul, said “the effort to expand tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is greenwashing an existing production system that has serious environmental and community impacts.”

He added that “we should be prioritizing tax breaks for people, like renters and first time homebuyers, rather than corporations producing sustainable aviation fuel, which isn’t actually sustainable.”

Many skeptics of sustainable aviation fuel believe that boosters’ emission reduction estimates aren’t accurate, and that policymakers should emphasize alternative transit options like high-speed rail.

Advocates for the fuel, including Friends of the Mississippi River, the Nature Conservancy and Fresh Energy, have published a set of what they call “guiding principles” to ensure that any new fuels live up to their green promises. Those guidelines call for policies to measure lifecycle emissions properly; ensure no new cropland gets created; minimize impacts on water and air quality; and position winter cover crops like camelina, rather than corn or other sources of biomass, as the preferred feedstocks.

“There are some concerns with over-relying on summer annual or traditional biofuel feedstocks,” Russell said. “Those crops would be lower carbon but would not meet anyone’s definition of sustainable.”

Minnesota’s first camelina crops were planted in 2021, and producers plan to scale up to about 5,000 acres this year, according to the MPCA.

Advocates hope to push production up to 1 million acres by 2035.","https://www.sctimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/11/PDEM/75183152007-20231128-t-120327-z-1167169340-rc-2-bm-4-a-5-wmuj-rtrmadp-3-aviationsustainabilityvirgin.JPG?crop=3839,2161,x0,y133&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-09 12:56:45.793840

By investing now, SABA aims to support facilities that can reach FID by 2026 and start production by 2030.","The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) is stepping up efforts to unlock the next generation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), opening a request for proposals to ramp up supply and secure longer-term deals.

This fresh push is all about moving beyond today’s limited options and scaling up fuels that don’t rely on traditional feedstocks like waste oils, which face serious growth limits.

At the heart of the new request for proposals (RFP) is a sharp focus on future-proof SAF. That includes power-to-liquids, synthetic fuels made from captured carbon and renewable electricity, as well as advanced fuels made from agricultural and forestry residues, renewable hydrogen and municipal solid waste.

SABA’s plan is to pool purchasing commitments from its members into one large, aggregated procurement. This will back five- to 10-year supply contracts—long enough to support final investment decisions (FID) for building new production facilities.

""The SAF market is growing rapidly but the technologies we need to fully decarbonise the aviation sector are still in their infancy,"" says Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of the SABA Secretariat.

""Investment needs to happen now if we want these technologies to scale post-2030 and keep the aviation sector on track to meet its long-term net zero goals.""

The RFP is aimed at growing the entire supply chain around advanced SAF.

Long-term procurement deals create the kind of financial stability developers need to secure funding, design new plants and move projects forward. Without this, the risk is that next-gen fuels never reach viable production levels.

Corporate demand powers market certainty

SABA’s membership brings together more than 35 companies across finance, technology, consulting, entertainment and other industries. What unites them is a shared intent to reduce emissions from business air travel – not just by flying less but by putting money into cleaner fuel.

One key tool in their model is the book and claim system, where companies buy SAF certificates (SAFc), which represent the carbon savings from sustainable fuel use.

Even if that fuel doesn’t power their specific flight, they can still claim the emissions reduction for their climate reporting. The physical fuel gets blended into airport fuel supply chains where it's actually needed.

""Book and claim is the bridge between the aviation industry's sustainable fuel ambitions and scalable real-world production – and SABA is helping build it,"" says Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at RMI and Co-Founder of SABA.

By separating the environmental claim from the physical fuel, the system lets companies fund SAF without worrying about logistics, while still contributing to demand. In turn, this demand signal helps fuel producers justify the upfront capital needed to build production at scale.

It’s a model that’s already drawn substantial investment. Since SABA’s launch in 2021, it has facilitated about US$200m in SAF procurement, starting with a pilot project and followed by a multi-year deal in 2023–2024 involving 27 participants and 50 million gallons of fuel.

Making SAF a serious alternative to fossil jet fuel

Despite the growth of interest in SAF, it still accounts for less than 1% of global aviation fuel. Most of what’s produced today comes from waste oils and fats, which are limited in supply and won’t be able to scale with rising demand beyond 2030.

That’s why this RFP is geared toward feedstocks and technologies that can grow without competing with food systems or relying on land-use change. By investing now, SABA aims to support facilities that can reach FID by 2026 and start production by 2030.

Elizabeth Sturcken, Vice President at Environmental Defense Fund, another SABA Co-Founder, makes the point directly: ""This RFP is an opportunity for corporate leaders, forward-looking airlines and next generation fuel producers to work together toward a truly net-zero aviation sector.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/bd77eef4e7c4446566d5ddd6815d0482:7e92f993b325e2e37dbafcdfb0f1e811/airplane-flying-skyscrapers.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-09 12:57:25.351525

The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group has signed agreements with Neste and World Energy to acquire Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)[1] and SAF certificates[2] respectively, supporting its decarbonisation journey while gaining further valuable insights into the pathways, standards, and certification systems in the renewable fuel landscape.

The first transaction saw the Group acquire 1,000 tonnes of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)-eligible[3] neat SAF, sourced from renewable fuel producer Neste. The SAF was produced at Neste’s Singapore refinery, blended locally and uplifted at Singapore Changi Airport. This is the Group’s second purchase of neat SAF from the Singapore refinery, helping to develop the country’s SAF ecosystem and enhance supply chain resilience.

In addition, the Group purchased approximately 2,000 tonnes of CORSIA-eligible SAF in the form of emissions reductions from World Energy, a United States-based producer, utilising the Book & Claim Chain of Custody model[4]. This allows the Group to claim associated emissions reductions without physical fuel delivery.

Both deals were completed in the first quarter of 2025 and these transactions are projected to reduce more than 9,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

SIA also participates in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, an initiative designed to boost the demand for SAF in the Asia-Pacific region. Launched by the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, the campaign seeks to enhance awareness and understanding of SAF, while actively promoting its use and fostering strategic partnerships between regional corporations and airlines.

Ms Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer, Singapore Airlines, said: “These agreements represent important steps in the SIA Group’s broader strategy to scale up its use of sustainable aviation fuel. By working with different suppliers and exploring diverse sourcing models and certification pathways, we gain crucial insights into the SAF landscape and we can better understand the pathways towards a more sustainable aviation ecosystem.

“The SIA Group will continue to work with partners around the world to test and implement solutions that support the airline industry’s long-term decarbonisation goals. This will allow us to validate SAF demand, enhance our technical expertise in this area, and strengthen our ability to meet our medium-term commitment of 5% SAF use by 2030 and long-term goal net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

[1] SAF is a low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from renewable or waste-derived sources. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s life cycle. Blended with conventional jet fuel, it seamlessly integrates with existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure.

[2] SAFc represent the emissions reductions achieved from using SAF. Fuel suppliers record these certificates in a SAF registry and transfer them to airlines, who can then pass them on or sell them to corporate buyers. This enables airlines to claim environmental benefits without directly using the fuel, while supporting the growth of the SAF market.

[3] Developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), CORSIA is the first global market-based measure to address the climate impact of international aviation. It recognises certified SAF as CORSIA Eligible Fuel, which airlines can use to lower their carbon offsetting obligations under the scheme.",,N,,2025-05-09 12:57:32.385766

The interoperability between the SAFc Registry and Chooose’s environmental attribute management platform improves efficiencies, expands accessibility, and increases transparency in the SAF ecosystem. Alaska Airlines is the first airline to use the integrated SAFc Registry and Chooose solutions end-to-end, enabling the airline’s customers to track the impact of their environmental attribute purchases.

Sustainable aviation fuel — which can reduce the carbon intensity of flying by more than 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel and can be used in today’s aircraft without modifications — is the most effective technology to help lower aviation emissions. Despite growing demand, SAF adoption remains constrained by fragmented regulations, supply limitations, and the complexities of tracking environmental attributes. This collaboration between the SAFc Registry, Chooose, and Alaska sets a new industry benchmark by demonstrating that scalable, trustworthy SAFc transactions are not just possible, but also play a critical role in the aviation industry’s net-zero emissions trajectory.

Joseph Beaudin, CEO at Chooose commented: “Chooose is committed to building an open SAF ecosystem — in part by integrating with leading registries like SAFc to drive greater transparency and simpler workflows for our partners and their customers. This integration provides the infrastructure to connect key stakeholders across the value chain. Alaska Airlines — a frontrunner in SAF adoption — embracing this integration is demonstrative of their leadership in the industry as well as the role interoperability plays in airline SAF programs.”

Bryan Fisher, managing director at RMI stated: “Scaling the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel certificates requires trust, transparency, and seamless transactions across the value chain. This integration with Chooose represents a major step forward in ensuring that SAF environmental attributes are transferred, verified, and retired with integrity. By making these transactions more efficient and accessible, we are laying the foundation for broader industry adoption and helping accelerate the market for sustainable aviation fuel.”

Ryan Spies, managing director of sustainability at Alaska Airlines said: “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the most efficient lever to meaningfully lessen our carbon emissions, and we are delighted to partner with the SAFc Registry and Chooose to simplify access and accountability for our customers who share our commitment to do business more sustainably.”

The SAFc Registry was launched in 2023 by RMI, the Environmental Defense Fund, Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), and Energy Web, to create consistency, transparency, and auditability of the environmental attributes of SAF. By connecting to the Registry’s enterprise-grade solution, Chooose provides its aviation and logistics partners with access to robust environmental attribute tracking, while still allowing them to receive and retire SAFc directly from the Chooose platform and thus, centralizes their broader SAF program management.

The interoperability between the SAFc Registry and Chooose will address key barriers that have slowed engagement on SAF and deliver tangible benefits for stakeholders.

SABA members have already been using the SAFc Registry to track the environmental impact of SAF certificates procured through SABA. The alliance, which includes Alaska Airlines, represents some of the world’s most ambitious corporations collectively addressing the emissions of flight. The integration will expand corporate access to the Registry and bolster the extensive SAF environmental attribute management and distribution services that Chooose offers.

Alaska Airlines’ early adoption of this solution underscores its commitment to sustainability leadership. The integration will help the carrier enhance the efficiency and accessibility of its SAF program while increasing customer confidence in SAF environmental attributes and sustainability claims. Alaska Airlines offers environmental attributes to corporate, cargo, and commercial customers, meaning the integration will be an opportunity to democratize access to SAFc for their downstream buyers across multiple customer segments.

It has since extended its scope to the design, construction and operation of renewable hydrogen, renewable ammonia, e-SAF (a type of sustainable aviation fuel), e-methane and e-methanol production plants for a range of industries with plants located in Canada, South America, France, Germany and Norway, and plans to extend to other countries in the future.

Speaking to Impact Investor, Bernd Hübner, co-founder and CFO of Hy2gen, said: “Today we target a broad variety of use cases. This includes shipping using e-methanol or green ammonia and renewable hydrogen as a niche for the smaller ferries. We are also targeting the production of sustainable aviation fuel for passenger and cargo flights and ammonia in pure industrial sectors such as mining.”

Hübner explained the mining sector uses green ammonia as a key component in explosives.

Current projects

Current projects include the 300 MW ‘Courant’ project in Canada, which aims to produce renewable ammonia at a plant in Quebec for use in mining explosives, the ‘Atlantis’ project in Germany, which will extend the production capacity at a renewable hydrogen plant which has been operating under the Hy2gen banner since 2023, and the ‘Iverson’ project in Norway, which is targeting production of 200,000 tonnes of renewable ammonia annually using green hydropower to supply the shipping industry. The company is also collaborating with H2V on a 390MW project to produce 75,000 tonnes of e-SAF at a plant in the Fos-Marseille port area in France to support the decarbonisation of Europe’s aviation sector.

The construction of all four projects is expected to start by 2027. Hy2gen said these projects would represent a total installed electrolysis capacity of approximately 2GW of energy, and that an estimated capex of more than €5bn would be needed to start the construction phase.

“Hy2gen will hold further funding rounds with its existing and potentially new investors to finance the construction phase. For now, the goal is to reach FID for the most advanced projects such as Courant, Iverson and the project in Fos-Marseille, which is covered by Hy2gen’s €47 million raise,” said Hübner.",https://impact-investor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Atlantis-FOTOR.jpg,N,,2025-05-09 04:56:33.355648

Senate Bills 235-36, introduced by Sens. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) and Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), and House Bills 4424-25, introduced by Rep. Jerry Neyer, (R-Shepherd), would establish a $1.50 (€1.30) per gallon tax credit for the purchase, production, or blending of SAF starting in 2026.

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realise the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” Sen. Singh said.

“Decarbonising the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

By encouraging the use of Michigan-grown feedstocks such as corn and soybeans, the legislation is poised to open new markets for farmers, helping revitalise rural economies and reinforcing the vital connection between agriculture and energy innovation.

John Delmotte, president of the Michigan Corn Growers Association and Sen. Bellino’s constituent, said: “This legislation mirrors the successful strategy that made ethanol a staple of American energy—using smart tax credits to create a market-driven solution to benefit farmers, consumers, and our environment.

As there is a direct relation between CO2 emissions and Jet fuel consumption, the savings in CO2 emissions would also be 2.4%.","May 9, 2025, ©. Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

Since we started in October last year, we have looked at:

Alternative, lower emission propulsion technologies, ranging from electric aircraft with batteries as energy source, different propulsion hybrids, and new concepts for Jet-fuel and Hydrogen gas turbine engines.

We have also reviewed recent research on the role of CO2, NOx emissions, and Contrails generated by airliners in global warming.

Two weeks ago, we summarized the present situation around SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Last week, we listed some base data about the present situation for Global Air Transport. We will now use this data to calculate the effect of air transport on global warming from the three alternatives.

Emission-free airliners

Let’s start by imagining a scenario in which we are successful in producing CO2 and NOx emission-free airliners based on the different projects we examined. These projects can replace the existing 19, 30 to 50-seat, and 70 to 100-seat turboprops in the market.

We assume the 19 and 30 to 50 seat projects will result in Entry Into Service, EIS, of aircraft from 2030. The replacement of 70 to 100-seat turboprops starts in 2040 when we assume Airbus delivers its ZEROe fuel cell-based hydrogen airliner.

Aircraft production ramp is more challenging than most alternative propulsion projects realize. Here, we assume a best-case scenario where production in the first year is one aircraft per month. Then, this is doubled for year two, with a 50% increase in yearly production rate thereafter until a maximum production of 100 aircraft per year is reached.

This level is not the maximum these companies can ramp to; it’s what the market accepts in terms of new aircraft sales to replace older turboprops in these market segments. The resulting yearly output of emission-free airliners is shown in Figure 2.

From the table, we can see we replace a total of 1800 older 19 seaters and 1800 30 to 50 seaters. Finally, 800 70 to 100 seaters get replaced. These aircraft consume per year:

19 seaters around 1,000 tonnes Jet-A1 per year. In the year 2050, we have replaced 1,800 Turboprops in total. During 2050, these emission-free 19-seaters would save 1.8 million tonnes of Jet fuel from being consumed.

30 to 50 seaters, around 1,900 tonnes Jet-A1 per year. In the year 2050, we will have replaced 1,800 Turboprops in total. During 2050, these would save 3.4 million tonnes of Jet fuel from being consumed.

70 to 100 seaters, around 2,500 tonnes Jet-A1 per year. In the year 2050, we have replaced 800 Turboprops in total. During 2050, these would save 2 million tonnes of Jet fuel from being consumed.

In total, by 2050, the Jet-A1 consumption in these airliner segments would have reduced by 7.2 million tonnes.

Last week, we learned that the yearly consumption of Jet-A1 for Air Transport is around 300 million tonnes. If the market introduces more efficient jet aircraft up until 2050, which keeps consumption at about the same level, we will save 2.4% of Jet-A1 from being burned in gas turbines.

As there is a direct relation between CO2 emissions and Jet fuel consumption, the savings in CO2 emissions would also be 2.4%.

Over the next Corners, we will compare these savings to the other Global Warming mitigating measures we listed above.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-05-09 04:56:49.480843

St. Paul, Minn. – Senate Taxes Committee Chair Ann Rest (DFL-New Hope) said today that after months of listening to people from across Minnesota, the committee has passed a tax proposal that embraces policies to respond to the modern economy.

Chair Rest said the measure modernizes state tax policy, addresses challenges facing farmers and greater Minnesota, reduces property taxes, supports education, and protects Minnesota’s nation-leading Child Tax Credit (CTC) that has already lifted thousands of children out of poverty.

“This tax bill will be very good for Minnesota. It responds to our modern economy and is the result of months of the Taxes Committee listening to people from across the state, and then taking action on their behalf,” said Senator Rest. “It also protects our working families by maintaining Minnesota’s nation-leading Child Tax Credit, especially in this time of tight budgets. I make no apologies about this tax bill, because you have to be really wealthy, a multi-national corporation, or Elon Musk to complain about it, because no Minnesota individual will otherwise pay any of it. So I’m very pleased with this bill and the benefits it will bring to our state.”

Key Provisions

Senator Rest said the bill supports her push to make Minnesota a leader in production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with a nation-leading tax credit to help expand SAF production opportunities across the state. She said it opens up new markets for farm products and will create new Minnesota jobs as production facilities come on line.

The measure also contains a first-in-the-nation tax on the wealthy owners of social media companies who for years have made billions of dollars from selling Minnesotans consumer data that they have harvested for free. The provision will raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the state and leave Minnesota taxpayers untouched.

The Tax bill also:

Provides restitution for Defrauded MN taxpayers

Lower property taxes for Disabled Veterans

Helps Minnesotans who serve in neighboring states’ National Guard

Provides property tax relief for farmers

Makes it easier to keep family farms in the family

Reduces Property Taxes for Small Resort Owners

DevvStream's October 2024 acquisition of 50% of the common interests in Monroe Sequestration Partners directly connects the Company to one of the Gulf Coast's most strategic carbon storage and clean fuel sectors

Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - May 8, 2025) - DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS) (""DevvStream"" or the ""Company""), a leading carbon management firm specializing in the development, investment, and sale of environmental assets, today announced that Monroe Sequestration Partners (""Monroe""), in which DevvStream acquired a 50% common-interest stake in October 2024, has signed a Collaboration Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Southern Energy, a Wyoming-based clean fuels company proposing the development of a $1 billion (USD) methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") facility in Louisiana.

The Agreement outlines a strategic partnership in which Monroe would provide permanent CO₂ sequestration through its Class VI storage site, expected to be operational in 2027, while Southern Energy would capture emissions from its planned biomass-to-fuel facility, targeting production in 2028. The parties aim to generate high-quality carbon credits and support compliance with global decarbonization mandates in aviation and maritime transport industries. The Company anticipates entering into additional definitive binding agreements reflecting the terms outlined in the Agreement during Q2 of this year.

""Monroe's combination of Class VI storage readiness, local access, and commercial reach positions it among the most advanced carbon storage developers in the country,"" said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. ""Louisiana is quickly becoming the carbon capture capital of the U.S., and this agreement underscores Monroe's leadership in delivering durable, monetizable carbon removal solutions.""

About Southern Energy's Project

Southern Energy plans to build a biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana to produce low-carbon methanol and SAF with an anticipated project cost of approximately $1 billion. Using proven syngas technology and a large-scale regional feedstock strategy, the facility is designed to serve both maritime and aviation sectors. Integrated carbon capture is expected to drive exceptionally low lifecycle carbon intensity (""CI"") scores while generating 45Q tax credits and other monetizable environmental assets.

The facility is expected to benefit from Northern Louisiana's location within the Southern Wood Basket—the largest biomass-producing region in North America. According to market studies, the North Louisiana-South Arkansas corridor ranks among the top five U.S. markets for pulpwood and forest residual availability, providing secure, scalable access to sustainably sourced feedstock.

""Southern Energy's platform aligns directly with recent federal initiatives supporting clean energy infrastructure,"" added Sunny Trinh, CEO of DevvStream. ""The combination of permanent sequestration, proven fuel tech, and policy momentum makes this a standout project.""

Strategic Importance of Louisiana

Louisiana is emerging as a national hub for carbon capture and storage (""CCS""). As one of only four states with U.S. EPA-approved primacy over Class VI wells, it can independently permit carbon storage projects—potentially cutting years off timelines. According to Bloomberg (April 2025), over a dozen CCS projects are already underway across the state, backed by more than $4.5 billion (USD) in anticipated investment.

Recent federal policy changes have the potential to increase this momentum. The current administration's first 100 days brought a sweeping realignment around CCS—executive orders prioritized permitting, expanded 45Q incentives, and encouraged private-sector deployment. Monroe's early position and deep ties in Louisiana provide a unique potential advantage as demand for durable carbon removal grows.

Strategic Implications for DevvStream

For DevvStream, this Agreement has the potential to strengthen its infrastructure-backed carbon credit pipeline and to deepen its exposure to permanent sequestration revenues. As co-owner of Monroe, DevvStream is expected to support project development, credit packaging, and long-term monetization efforts.

This Agreement also reinforces DevvStream's broader investment strategy: leveraging partnerships with industrial emitters to scale environmental asset generation under favorable policy, geographic, and commercial conditions.

About DevvStream

Founded in 2021, DevvStream is a leading carbon management firm specializing in the development, investment, and sale of environmental assets, energy transition, and innovative carbon management solutions. The Company's mission is to create alignment between sustainability and profitability, helping organizations achieve their climate initiatives while directly improving their financial health.

The gas purification technology was supplied by Geo bio gas&carbono, which holds a 5% minority stake in the project.
Even without guaranteed demand under the Fuel of the Future law, Cocal sees a strong market for its biomethane.
As Copersucar’s only associated company producing biomethane, Cocal is the natural candidate to lead the initiative.","Cocal, one of Copersucar’s key partners, is advancing its renewable energy diversification strategy with the launch of its first solar energy plant in April and plans to inaugurate its second biomethane facility in July. Together, the projects represent a total investment of R$241 million.

According to André Gustavo Alves da Silva, Cocal’s commercial director for new products, the company’s current focus extends beyond sugarcane. “From 2017 to 2022, we focused on maximizing sugarcane’s energy potential. That led to ventures in yeast, biogas, and industrial CO₂. After completing that cycle, we realized we could combine sugarcane with other ecosystems,” he explained.

The new biomethane facility, built in Paraguaçu Paulista (São Paulo), is an extension of Cocal’s biogas operations, which convert vinasse and filter cake—byproducts of sugarcane processing—into electricity. The expansion enables the plant to extract purified methane for sale or internal use.

The R$216 million investment in the biomethane unit was fully financed by the BNDES’s Fundo Clima. The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 60,000 cubic meters of biomethane per day. The gas purification technology was supplied by Geo bio gas&carbono, which holds a 5% minority stake in the project.

Cocal submitted a biomethane supply offer earlier this year as part of a public call by Petrobras, which is preparing for Brazil’s new biomethane regulatory framework set to take effect in 2026. Under the “Fuel of the Future” law, natural gas producers and importers must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1% starting in 2026 by incorporating biomethane—a quota that will increase over time.

The Petrobras submission window has closed, and negotiations with selected suppliers are expected to take place this month. Mr. Silva confirmed that Cocal submitted offers covering 2026 through 2029. “We were one of the few players that made offers for 2026,” he said. Offer details remain confidential.

Even without guaranteed demand under the Fuel of the Future law, Cocal sees a strong market for its biomethane. “Demand currently far exceeds supply,” Mr. Silva noted.

Cocal already uses biomethane from its first plant in Narandiba, São Paulo, to power gas-fueled machinery, displacing diesel. Of the 30 million liters of diesel the company consumes annually, 2 million liters have been replaced with biomethane.

Still, field fueling logistics and safety limitations constrain wider use of biomethane in the company’s fleet. To address this, Cocal is working with engine manufacturer MWM on retrofitting diesel engines to run on ethanol.

Excess biomethane could also be sold to industrial clients. But the company sees even greater potential in a proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant using biomethane, a project under study through a partnership between Copersucar and Geo bio gas&carbono. As Copersucar’s only associated company producing biomethane, Cocal is the natural candidate to lead the initiative. The SAF-from-biomethane project remains in the research phase.

In its fourth quarter 2024 earnings call, Green Plains committed to achieving $50 million in cost reductions. Mapes said the company is on track to meet that goal and has already achieved $30 million in annualized cost savings.

Chris Osowski, executive vice president of operations and technology at Green Plains, said the company’s platform continues to perform operationally at a high level. Green Plains’ nine active ethanol plants operated at 100% capacity utilization during the first quarter—the highest rate on record, he said. Operational expenses (OpEx) has fallen by more than 3 cents per gallon since the fourth quarter of last year, he added.

The company’s 119 MMgy ethanol plant in Fairmont, Minnesota, remains idle. Total capacity utilization across Green Plains’ total assets was 87.7% during the first quarter, down from 92.4% during the same period of last year, according to Phil Boggs, chief financial officer at Green Plains. Boggs said total plant utilization is expected to be maintained in the mid-90% utilization range for the year, even with scheduled maintenance underway.

Imre Havasi, head of trading and commercial operations at Green Plains, reported that ethanol crush margins have improved moving into the second and third quarters. He noted Green Plains has secured more than half of its second quarter crush margins at favorable levels, consistent with the company’s new approach to hedging and margin management.

Green Plains’ ethanol segment sold 195.3 million gallons of ethanol during the first quarter, down from 207.9 million gallons during the same period of last year. Consolidated crush margin was negative $14.7 million, compared to negative $9.3 million.

Net loss attributable to the company was $72.9 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to a net loss attributable to the company of $51.4 million, or 81 cents per diluted share, during the same period of last year. Revenues were $601.5 million, down from $597.2 million, and adjusted EBITDA was negative $24.2 million, compared to negative $21.5 million.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Green_Plains_Q12025_3b29df92cc.jpg,N,,2025-05-09 02:57:22.923553

This first-of-its-kind aggregated SAF procurement is designed to deliver a much-needed boost to scalable long-term SAF production capacity. By focusing the RFP on next-gen fuels, SABA seeks to channel investment toward SAF with fewer feedstock constraints than today's commercially available fuels, enabling more effective long-term decarbonization of the aviation sector.

SABA members include over 35 companies from a broad range of sectors, including finance, technology, media and entertainment, business consulting, and others seeking to reduce their aviation emissions through investment in sustainable aviation fuel. Through this RFP, SABA will facilitate 5 to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final investment decision (FID) for a new next-generation SAF production facility.

""The SAF market is growing rapidly but the technologies we need to fully decarbonize the aviation sector are still in their infancy,"" said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat. ""Investment needs to happen now if we want these technologies to scale post-2030 and keep the aviation sector on track to meet its long-term net zero goals.""

SAF represents the best near-term opportunity to decarbonize aviation as it is a drop-in fuel that can be used in today's aircraft fleet. Despite significant recent growth, SAF still makes up less than 1% of total aviation fuels used today with the market dominated by SAF made from traditional feedstocks, such as waste oils, that face limitations to scale beyond 2030. SAF with the greatest scalability potential, using feedstocks such as renewable hydrogen, agriculture and forestry residues, and municipal solid waste, is only a small portion of the currently available SAF. Without focused investment today, these fuels may not be available in the quantities needed to meet global decarbonization objectives.

SABA is working with its corporate partners to generate the demand signal needed to give advanced SAF producers confidence to scale production. Through a book and claim model, corporate customers will be purchasing sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) that allow them to invest in SAF and capture the environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on. The travelers' investment allows them to make a greenhouse gas emissions reduction claim on their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF flows to an aircraft operator.

""Book and claim is the bridge between the aviation industry's sustainable fuel ambitions and scalable real-world production — and SABA is helping build it,"" said Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at SABA co-founder RMI. ""By mobilizing corporate demand and catalyzing investment in cutting-edge fuel production, we can fast-track innovation, expand high-integrity supply, and deliver the climate results the aviation sector urgently needs.""

Since SABA's launch in 2021, it has helped channel approximately $200 million total SAF investment: first through a 2021 proof of concept pilot procurement for a short-term offtake period, followed by 2023-2024's groundbreaking multi-year procurement involving 27 participants and supporting approximately 50 million gallons of SAF. Through the RFP announced today, SABA is targeting longer-term offtakes to help plants get to FID by 2026 and be operational by 2030.

""This RFP is an opportunity for corporate leaders, forward-looking airlines and next generation fuel producers to work together toward a truly net-zero aviation sector,"" said Elizabeth Sturcken, Vice President at Environmental Defense Fund, a SABA co-founder. ""We must be strategic in how we grow the SAF market with environmental integrity so that we can decarbonize the aviation sector without placing new demands on limited feedstocks or land resources that may create new environmental problems.""

By participating in this next-gen procurement, SABA members will be able to meet their emission reduction targets for air travel and air freight through advanced purchases of SAFc connected to next-gen SAF meeting SABA's rigorous sustainability criteria.

May 08, 2025 8:56 PM EDT | Source: DevvStream Corp.

Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - May 8, 2025) - DevvStream Corp. (NASDAQ: DEVS) (""DevvStream"" or the ""Company""), a leading carbon management firm specializing in the development, investment, and sale of environmental assets, today announced that Monroe Sequestration Partners (""Monroe""), in which DevvStream acquired a 50% common-interest stake in October 2024, has signed a Collaboration Agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Southern Energy, a Wyoming-based clean fuels company proposing the development of a $1 billion (USD) methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") facility in Louisiana.

The Agreement outlines a strategic partnership in which Monroe would provide permanent CO₂ sequestration through its Class VI storage site, expected to be operational in 2027, while Southern Energy would capture emissions from its planned biomass-to-fuel facility, targeting production in 2028. The parties aim to generate high-quality carbon credits and support compliance with global decarbonization mandates in aviation and maritime transport industries. The Company anticipates entering into additional definitive binding agreements reflecting the terms outlined in the Agreement during Q2 of this year.

""Monroe's combination of Class VI storage readiness, local access, and commercial reach positions it among the most advanced carbon storage developers in the country,"" said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. ""Louisiana is quickly becoming the carbon capture capital of the U.S., and this agreement underscores Monroe's leadership in delivering durable, monetizable carbon removal solutions.""

About Southern Energy's Project

Southern Energy plans to build a biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana to produce low-carbon methanol and SAF with an anticipated project cost of approximately $1 billion. Using proven syngas technology and a large-scale regional feedstock strategy, the facility is designed to serve both maritime and aviation sectors. Integrated carbon capture is expected to drive exceptionally low lifecycle carbon intensity (""CI"") scores while generating 45Q tax credits and other monetizable environmental assets.

The facility is expected to benefit from Northern Louisiana's location within the Southern Wood Basket—the largest biomass-producing region in North America. According to market studies, the North Louisiana-South Arkansas corridor ranks among the top five U.S. markets for pulpwood and forest residual availability, providing secure, scalable access to sustainably sourced feedstock.

""Southern Energy's platform aligns directly with recent federal initiatives supporting clean energy infrastructure,"" added Sunny Trinh, CEO of DevvStream. ""The combination of permanent sequestration, proven fuel tech, and policy momentum makes this a standout project.""

Strategic Importance of Louisiana

Louisiana is emerging as a national hub for carbon capture and storage (""CCS""). As one of only four states with U.S. EPA-approved primacy over Class VI wells, it can independently permit carbon storage projects—potentially cutting years off timelines. According to Bloomberg (April 2025), over a dozen CCS projects are already underway across the state, backed by more than $4.5 billion (USD) in anticipated investment.

Recent federal policy changes have the potential to increase this momentum. The current administration's first 100 days brought a sweeping realignment around CCS—executive orders prioritized permitting, expanded 45Q incentives, and encouraged private-sector deployment. Monroe's early position and deep ties in Louisiana provide a unique potential advantage as demand for durable carbon removal grows.

Strategic Implications for DevvStream

For DevvStream, this Agreement has the potential to strengthen its infrastructure-backed carbon credit pipeline and to deepen its exposure to permanent sequestration revenues. As co-owner of Monroe, DevvStream is expected to support project development, credit packaging, and long-term monetization efforts.

This Agreement also reinforces DevvStream's broader investment strategy: leveraging partnerships with industrial emitters to scale environmental asset generation under favorable policy, geographic, and commercial conditions.

The resulting SAF is a fully identical to fossil jet fuel with the same or, in some cases, better physical-chemical properties.
In addition, KBR is developing a SAF facility at Pittsburgh International Terminal to drive energy innovation based on KBR’s PureSAF technology.
With its feedstock flexibility and ability to fully replace fossil jet fuel meeting the ASTM specification, PureSAF is poised to make a major contribution towards decarbonizing the aviation industry.","With the demand expected to exceed 75 billion metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year by 2040, a massive supply challenge is emerging for the aviation industry. How can the aviation sector reduce its environmental footprint and move towards carbon neutrality, without curbing growth? KBR’s unique sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology, PureSAF ℠, is one solution.

Unmatched feedstock flexibility

KBR offers ASTM-certified (American Society for Testing and Materials) SAF technology through the alcohol-to-jet pathway, which processes multiple feedstocks like bioethanol, syngas, carbon dioxide, syngas and hydrogen. These feedstocks, from industrial sites, can be further converted to SAF, diesel, and gasoline.

“Multiple pathways for SAF production have been identified, utilizing a variety of feedstock sources. KBR’s PureSAF technology is an innovative process that produces a fully fungible military grade jet fuel, validated by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), at low cost and industrial scale. This, along with the ability to utilize CO2 and syngas, makes it a differentiated offering in the global SAF landscape,” said Hari Ravindran, SVP & Global Head, KBR Technology Solutions.

Equivalent replacement for fossil jet fuel

Developed by Swedish Biofuels AB and globally licensed exclusively by KBR, this advanced SAF technology contains the same distribution and types of hydrocarbons as those found in petroleum-derived aviation turbine fuels. The resulting SAF is a fully identical to fossil jet fuel with the same or, in some cases, better physical-chemical properties.

PureSAF’s feed flexibility significantly improves the overall cost competitiveness compared to alternate offerings, which require separate technologies for conversion of ethanol and gases.

Commercialization underway

In an effort to make farm-to-flight jet fuel a tangible reality, KBR’s PureSAF technology platform has been selected by Renewable Developments Australia (RDA), in collaboration with Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways to establish a SAF production facility. Here, bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite will be converted to 100% SAF utilizing the ethanol-to-jet pathway.

In addition, KBR is developing a SAF facility at Pittsburgh International Terminal to drive energy innovation based on KBR’s PureSAF technology. This will not only help airline partners to secure SAF effectively but also meet the SAF demands of Pittsburgh International and its nearby airports.

Last year, within the Liepaja Special Economic Zone (LSEZ), KBR signed an MOU with NorSAF (formerly GI Terminal) to support the production of renewable SAF, gasoline and diesel at their terminal site in Liepaja, Latvia.

PureSAF is a flexible and sustainable solution

By 2050, replacing fossil jet fuels with SAF is projected to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 2.5%. Many governments and airlines have made phased commitments to reduce emissions and predominantly via SAF. As a result, stakeholders, including governments, airlines, developers, and investors, are evaluating and selecting the most suitable pathways for SAF production. With its feedstock flexibility and ability to fully replace fossil jet fuel meeting the ASTM specification, PureSAF is poised to make a major contribution towards decarbonizing the aviation industry.",https://www.kbr.com/themes/custom/kbrcom/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-08 20:57:25.343876

“We’re very happy that he’s working on emerging markets and India is one of them markets that we need to really work on.” He says, “It’s also the largest biofuels market in the world. These are things that would be very, very positive for us when it comes to the corn growers.”

He says a new deal could remove current hurdles facing U.S. farmers.

“They do have a 50% tariff against corn imports right now and they have severe restrictions against biotechnology.” He says, “They basically are just working on, you know, domestic market protection for agriculture inputs going into that country.”

Hartman has hosted several Indian trade delegations on his southern Illinois farm, and he says the message he hears is they need American corn.

“They’re saying that their country and our country needs to work some of these things out because they need either ethanol coming in, or corn to produce ethanol.” He says, “And at the same time, their farmers cannot produce enough for their livestock folks that are, you know, in the dairy and the poultry business.”

Hartman says greater access into India would bring increased corn and ethanol demand and higher prices for corn farmers.

Through Wheels Up’s program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.
With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint.
This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.","Wheels Up Experience Inc. has announced the launch of its new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program. Now, Wheels Up charter customers who opt into this initiative will be able to book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF. Wheels Up will partner with Delta Air Lines to purchase SAF, allowing private fliers to participate in the program, regardless of their flight operator or departure airport.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks. It is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel’s lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel; it's also significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification. By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80 percent reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today—in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3 percent of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability. In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to “fly on SAF” has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights. Through Wheels Up’s program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up’s charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF. Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years. To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

The 86% utilization milestone isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to a business model in motion, driven by smart bets on the future of flight.","Willis Lease Finance Corporation (WLFC) has emerged as a key beneficiary of the aviation industry’s post-pandemic recovery, leveraging strategic acquisitions and infrastructure investments to push its portfolio utilization rate to a record 86.4% by March 2025. The milestone reflects the company’s success in capitalizing on airlines’ demand for cost-effective engine leasing and maintenance solutions, while positioning itself to capitalize on long-term trends in sustainable aviation.

The 86% Target: Drivers and Significance

WLFC’s portfolio utilization—the ratio of leased or under contract assets to total available inventory—has surged 10 percentage points in just six months, from 76.7% in late 2024 to 86.4% in early 2025. This metric is critical to the company’s “flywheel business model,” where higher utilization drives greater lease revenue, maintenance reserves, and parts sales, while also signaling strong demand for its services.

The jump coincides with robust performance in Q1 2025, which saw revenue hit $157.7 million, a 32.5% year-over-year increase, and a $25.3 million pre-tax income. While net income dipped 19.2% due to rising costs tied to its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project, the company’s core operations remain resilient.

Strategic Acquisitions: LEAP Engines and Market Expansion

At the heart of WLFC’s strategy is its acquisition of 30 new LEAP engines from CFM International. These fuel-efficient engines, designed for Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, are in high demand as airlines seek to modernize fleets and reduce emissions. By adding these engines to its portfolio, WLFC strengthens its ability to lease to operators of newer, more efficient aircraft, a segment critical to the industry’s decarbonization efforts.

The move also aligns with WLFC’s focus on asset specialization, reducing reliance on older engine models and ensuring its fleet remains competitive. This shift is reflected in its portfolio composition: while older CFM56 engines still dominate, newer models now account for a growing share, enhancing the company’s appeal to airlines prioritizing sustainability.

The Engine Test Facility: Solving an Industry Bottleneck

To address a critical shortage of engine test facilities in North America, WLFC formed a 50/50 joint venture with Global Engine Maintenance (GEM) to build a new test cell in West Palm Beach, Florida. The facility, slated to begin operations in 2026, will initially focus on testing CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B engines—workhorses of older narrowbody fleets—but will be adaptable for newer models like the LEAP series.

The project tackles a longstanding industry constraint: the lack of testing capacity has delayed engine repairs and increased downtime for airlines. By pooling resources with GEM, WLFC ensures a steady “base load” of testing needs from its own portfolio and partner’s assets, while also offering services to third parties. This dual revenue stream—$45.3 million in short-term lease revenue alone in Q1 2025—reinforces the facility’s economic viability.

Financial Fortitude and Sustainability Push

WLFC’s balance sheet remains robust, with $157.7 million in quarterly revenue and $32.36 million in cash, supported by a dividend of $0.25 per share for Q2 2025. However, rising expenses—particularly a $11.4 million increase in general and administrative costs for its SAF project—highlight the risks of over-investing in nascent initiatives.

The SAF project, while not yet revenue-generating, underscores WLFC’s long-term vision to integrate sustainability into its operations. Its subsidiary, Willis Sustainable Fuels (UK) Limited, is advancing plans for a power-to-liquid SAF refinery in the UK, signaling its commitment to reducing carbon footprints across its portfolio.

Conclusion: A Flywheel Model in Overdrive

Willis Lease Finance’s 86% portfolio utilization is no accident—it’s the result of deliberate moves to expand its asset base, address industry bottlenecks, and position itself as a leader in sustainable aviation. The LEAP engine acquisition and test facility joint venture not only boost near-term revenue but also future-proof the company against evolving market demands.

With $2.82 billion in total lease assets and a record quarter under its belt, WLFC’s financial strength and strategic agility suggest it can continue growing even amid macroeconomic volatility. While challenges like rising maintenance costs and SAF project risks linger, the company’s dividend payout and strong cash flow indicate confidence in its ability to navigate these hurdles.

For investors, WLFC’s blend of operational resilience, vertical integration, and sustainability focus makes it a compelling play on the aviation sector’s recovery—and its evolution.

The two-day event, which will be held at Farnborough International Exhibition & Conference Centre from 14-15 May will bring together stakeholders from across the aerospace, finance, sustainability and government to tackle one of the sector’s biggest challenges: how to decarbonise aviation at scale and, at speed.

From hydrogen-fuelled aircraft, electric propulsion and the scaling up of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to carbon markets and data transparency, the summit will help showcase real-time progress and the roadblocks of a sector in transformation.

Challenges and opportunities to decarbonising aviation

“The pace of innovation in and around aviation is incredible, and airlines have made significant progress on operational efficiency and advancing new technologies,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, SVP, Public Affairs and Sustainability at Alaska Airlines, speaking ahead of the summit. “But the technologies we need for our industry’s future are still being developed and matured. Forums like Sustainable Skies provide an opportunity to deepen shared understanding of the challenges and opportunities, and to further galvanise action.”

Rakow’s sentiment is echoed across the event with Nichola Bates, Head of Innovation at Boeing adding that as an industry, stakeholders have a responsibility to balance growth with environmental and social responsibility. The summit she said provides a platform for sustainable leadership, “with industry leaders, innovators and changemakers working together to build a more sustainable future in aviation.”

Alongside innovations in technology, financial frameworks are a key focus for ensuring the industry’s net zero goal is met. With compliance becoming increasingly complex, carbon markets are taking centre stage, according to Vertis Environmental Finance’s senior corporate carbon trader, Alexandra Harmatis.

Scaling SAF

Similarly, when it comes to scaling SAF production and supply, affordability remains a key challenge with leaders calling for stronger policy support. “While demand signals like SAF mandates are important, strong policy support is essential to help scale production and close the affordability gap,” stated Olan Ryan, VP SAF, UK & Ireland IAG. “The conversations at Farnborough,” he added, “will be crucial in helping align industry and government action to make SAF a commercial reality.”

Behind the scenes, firms like Estuaire are adding precision to the process, as the company’s CEO & Co-founder, Maxime Meijers, explained “Our goal is to bring clarity to aviation’s global footprint and demonstrate how actionable data can lead to better decisions today.”

As anticipation builds for the summit’s opening next week, one message rings clear: the goal to achieve net zero by 2050 is a shared imperative that requires long-term thinking, strong government policy and cross-industry collaboration.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), SAF production rose sharply between December 2024 and February 2025, contributing to a significant uptick in the broader “Other Biofuels” category.

SAF, a renewable alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel, is derived from agricultural and waste feedstocks and blended with conventional jet fuel. The recent expansion has been driven by enhanced federal incentives, including tax credits and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which have accelerated investments in SAF infrastructure.

By early 2025, U.S. SAF production capacity had reached approximately 25,000 barrels per day (b/d), a marked increase from the 2,000 b/d available at the beginning of 2024. Key facilities contributing to this surge include Phillips 66’s Rodeo, California site, World Energy’s plant in Paramount, California, Montana Renewables’ facility in Great Falls, and New Rise Renewables’ operation in Reno, Nevada. Additional contributions are expected from Par Pacific’s site in Kapolei, Hawaii.

SAF production currently accounts for a growing share of U.S. Other Biofuels, a category which also includes renewable diesel by-products such as naphtha and propane. The EIA estimates that although SAF will remain a small proportion of total jet fuel consumption—just under 2% by 2026—it will dominate the biofuels segment in percentage growth terms.

The broader Other Biofuels production reached a record 33,000 b/d in January and increased further to 44,000 b/d by February 2025, reflecting a 30% month-on-month gain.

Some eVTOL companies are happy just building aircraft, while others also want to operate them, offering passenger and freight services.","At last summer’s Farnborough Air Show, Klaus Roewe, chief executive of aviation industry hot prospect Lilium, gave a presentation entitled ‘Electric flying is almost there’.

He had justifiable grounds for optimism. Munich-based Lilium had built several electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, each capable of ferrying seven passengers distances of up to 50 miles. It had raised more than $1.5bn (£1.1bn) from backers including China’s Tencent (HK:0700), and its Nasdaq-listed shares were worth more than £2.5bn at their peak. Yet after the company failed to land a €100mn (£85mn) loan from the German government late last year, it filed for insolvency.

Europe’s other big eVTOL prospect, Volocopter, also ran out of money in December. It had received more than $700mn from backers including Mercedes-Benz (DE:MBG), BlackRock (US:BLK) and Saudi Arabia’s Neom. Its assets have since been snapped up by China’s Zhejiang Wanfeng Auto (CN:002085) for just €10mn.

According to McKinsey, $25bn has been invested in the ‘future air mobility’ market in recent years – mostly into eVTOL companies, but also into drones and supersonic flight projects. Funding peaked in 2021 but has tailed off as higher interest rates have weakened valuations.

That was the boom year for special-purpose acquisition companies (Spacs), which were used by several major players to gain stock market listings. eVTOL companies Joby Aviation (US:JOBY), Archer Aviation (ACHR) and Vertical Aerospace (US:EVTL) all listed on US exchanges via Spac mergers in 2021, while Eve Holding (US:EVEX) followed a year later.

The industry “is much further along than it would have been” without the Spac craze, which provided the capital, talent and strategic partners necessary for its development, says Savanthi Syth, an analyst at investment bank Raymond James.

As funding has eased, it has coalesced around the brightest prospects, says Robin Riedel, a partner at McKinsey. “There are fewer than two dozen companies with funding exceeding $100mn to date, and only a handful with funding of more than $1bn. We believe we will see an industry of about a dozen major eVTOL manufacturers emerge in the next decade globally,” he adds.

These companies have already attracted orders worth around $173bn for about 38,000 aircraft, Riedel says. Some have even closed their order books until they’ve made more progress towards deliveries.

The long haul

The story of a scaled-back industry has some parallels with attempts to make flying more environmentally friendly.

Aviation generated 2-3 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions last year but was responsible for half of the demand growth, according to the International Energy Agency. And the aviation industry’s attempts to find greener fuel for long-haul travel are not promising.

Efforts have thus far focused on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), described by RBC Capital Markets analyst Erwan Kerouredan as “the only viable option to decarbonise aviation”.

Its main advantage is that it is a ‘drop-in’ fuel, which can be used in existing engines without the need for modification. Yet even here there are challenges.

Although the demand for and supply of SAF had seemed well matched, this is still a nascent industry. Not all of the suppliers who had secured offtake deals from airlines – commitments to buy future output that help providers raise cash – had the “execution credentials” needed to deliver, Kerouredan says.

“The promised supply of SAF was much more fragile than we thought. Our main conclusion was that this was extremely bullish for companies that are credible in that space,” he adds.

The world’s biggest player in SAF is Finland’s Neste (FI:NESTE), but it has struggled recently due to a combination of falling oil prices (which correlate with SAF prices) and higher input costs – Neste declared a pre-tax loss of €113mn last year, compared with a profit of €1.6bn in 2023, and announced plans to cut around 600 jobs.

Although demand improved in the first quarter, chief executive Heikki Malinen said that “mandates and incentives continue to be crucial” in ensuring airlines continue to buy enough SAF to make operations viable.

Blue-sky thinking

While sustainable fuel has a clear target market, many potential use cases for vertical aircraft are untested. Some eVTOL companies are happy just building aircraft, while others also want to operate them, offering passenger and freight services.

The early focus appears to be on intracity travel – most notably shuttle services between airports and downtown locations. The helicopter hire business looks easiest to disrupt – eVTOLs are cheaper, quieter and more efficient. Theoretically, they should also be safer given they are powered by more than one main rotor.

HC Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal puts the cost of helicopter flights at $4-$11 per mile, but eVTOL companies argue their costs would be much lower – comparable to a premium limousine service such as Uber Black at about $1-$3 per mile.

The helicopter hire business looks easiest to disrupt – eVTOLs are cheaper, quieter and more efficient

Austin Moeller, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, argues that eVTOLs could have a total addressable market for shuttle trips of $58bn per year by 2032-33. He bases this on the fact that around a fifth of all Uber and Lyft rides in major cities are either to or from airports. “That’s what they’re competing against,” he argues.

The industry’s front runners are a pair of Silicon Valley start-ups that expect their aircraft to start carrying passengers this year, and a Chinese operator that has already rolled out limited domestic services.

The Silicon Valley duo, Joby and Archer, are the most highly valued in terms of market capitalisation. The former has attracted some high-profile UK backers: it accounts for a small portion of the Scottish Mortgage (SMT) portfolio, for example.

Joby, which is backed by car giant Toyota Motor (JP:7203) and has an aviation partner in Delta Air Lines (US:DAL), has an exclusive agreement with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority, through which it plans to offer piloted flights from the main airport to three locations around the city.

“By the middle of this year, we plan to have an aircraft in Dubai . . . to demonstrate our readiness to begin carrying our first passengers, which we target for later this year or early next year,” founder and chief executive JoeBen Bevirt said on an earnings call in February.

Archer, backed by Stellantis (IT:STLAM) and United Airlines (US:UAL), hopes to see its aircraft flying over neighbouring Abu Dhabi. The company has sold two of its aircraft to Abu Dhabi Aviation – a company co-owned by a pair of sovereign funds that operate helicopters, private jets and air cargo services for civilian and military use.

It is also providing personnel to allow the aircraft to “start operating this year”, chief commercial officer Nikhil Goel said on a recent earnings call.

Neither has yet received approval to fly from the UAE’s regulator, the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). “We continue to work with the GCAA to gain the required approvals necessary for us to offer passenger service in the UAE and are making great progress,” a Joby spokesperson said.

Archer may not need permission if Abu Dhabi Aviation decides to use the aircraft for military purposes – defence organisations tend to certify their own aircraft, and do not need processes to be as complex as those for carrying passengers.

Indeed, Archer raised a further $430mn in December to invest in a defence partnership with Anduril Industries to build hybrid-powered aircraft for military organisations. The funding round was backed by an investment arm of International Holding Co (AE:IHC) – a company chaired by the UAE’s national security adviser, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

‘Boeing, plus British Airways’

Although both companies profess a desire to be both aircraft maker and operator, Archer is more focused on the former in the short term, as it seeks to boost revenues to hit break-even.

Joby’s pitch to investors has been to become the vertically integrated player – or “Boeing, plus British Airways”, as Scottish Mortgage manager Tom Slater puts it.

It has been signing deals akin to the one in the UAE in other jurisdictions, including one in March to ferry Virgin Atlantic’s customers from hubs at Heathrow and Manchester. A shuttle from Manchester airport to Leeds would take 15 minutes, while one from Heathrow to Canary Wharf could take eight, the company said.

Joby has taken a similarly hands-on approach to building its eVTOLs. It has developed about 80 per cent of the parts on its aircraft in-house and bought in the remainder from the wider supply chain, according to HC Wainwright’s Dayal. For Archer, this ratio is reversed.

Joby’s approach is costlier, as it needs to certify all of its own parts, but this creates a “platform that we can develop further technologies on top”, chief product officer Eric Allison told the IC at last year’s Farnborough Air Show.

Joby has already converted one of its demonstration models to run off hydrogen, potentially giving it a range of more than 500 miles that would take it into the regional air market – capable of operating between London and, say, Barcelona.

Yet analysts are sceptical about whether, in the face of delays, it will stick with its grand vision.

At the time Joby and Archer listed, they had expected the Type Certification approvals needed from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) by 2023 and 2024, respectively. They are still waiting, and none of the analysts who spoke to the IC thinks approvals will come this year.

“We think it’s more likely to be a 2026 – [or, I] hope I’m wrong, but possibly 2027 – story,” says Andres Sheppard, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Joby chair Paul Sciarra said on the company’s recent earnings call that it “is supporting both models” of being both a vertical integrator and a manufacturer, and that outside the US the latter may be a more appropriate model.

All of the existing makers of large commercial aircraft seem to be playing catch-up

Regulatory prudence is understandable, as it would only take one incident to set the industry back, says Alan Lim, a director at Alton Aviation Consultancy. But there is an incentive for the FAA to speed up the process, given that the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) recently granted an operating certificate to Ehang (US:EH) – a Chinese maker of small, autonomous eVTOLs that has a listing on the Nasdaq exchange (for now).

“There’s a sense that China ran away with the electric vehicle side of things and they [the FAA] doesn’t want to lose ground with electric aviation,” Syth says. “There’s definitely a lot of bipartisan support to move this forward as quickly as possible.”

EHang’s two-seat, autonomous craft is so lightweight that “some people don’t consider it a true eVTOL certification”, Syth adds. The CAAC also placed several restrictions on Ehang – it is only allowed to fly in good weather, during the day and in less populated areas, meaning it is currently largely used for sightseeing by tourists.

Early riser

Still, it has gained an early-mover advantage in chalking up flying hours and establishing the necessary supply chains and infrastructure to support a wider rollout, Syth adds.

EHang’s aircraft are also being sold “at a materially lower price than comparable Western offerings and still generating a 60 per cent gross margin”, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu. The delivery of its first batch of aircraft also meant that revenue near-quadrupled last year to $63.4mn and it generated positive free cash flow. Analysts expect revenue to double again this year and for the company to be profitable from 2026 onwards.

Archer and Eve Holding are the only others that analysts expect to turn a profit before 2030, according to FactSet. Although it has its own listing and a separate headquarters in Florida, Eve is essentially a subsidiary of the world’s third-biggest plane maker, Brazil’s Embraer (BR:EMBR3). Its low cash burn (of $141mn last year) reflects the fact that it has kept overheads down by contracting the use of engineers, test rigs and airfields from its parent company, explains Canaccord Genuity’s Moeller.

Yet in terms of product development, Eve “is probably the furthest behind” of the listed players, given that it has yet to fly a working prototype, Syth says.

Indeed, all of the existing makers of large commercial aircraft seem to be playing catch-up. Boeing’s (US:BA) involvement in the sector has come via investments – principally in autonomous plane maker Wisk, which it acquired outright in 2023. The settlement of a lawsuit between Wisk and Archer in the same year also led to an investment in the latter.

Airbus (FR:AIR) had been developing its own eVTOL, CityAirbus NextGen, but halted the programme in January. Bruno Even, chief executive of Airbus’s helicopters arm, told reporters that battery technology needed to improve before it could take the project any further.

This leaves Europe’s eVTOL hopes largely pinned on Bristol-based Vertical Aerospace (US:EVTL). Its UK presence means it has much lower overheads than US peers, but like Eve it is further behind in the race and its finances look shakier.

Founder Stephen Fitzpatrick ceded majority ownership of the business in December as part of a rescue deal that saw funder Mudrick Capital take control of the business. Mudrick converted $130mn of existing debt into equity and provided a further $50mn of fresh funding. This was followed by a $90mn equity raise in January, but that only provides enough funding to get through this year.

Chief executive Stuart Simpson told investors in March that it had only spent $350mn on development over the past three years.

“This is approximately $1bn less than peers, yet . . . our progress is similar, if not better,” he said.

Yet the company is not expected to gain certification from authorities for its aircraft until 2028, and does not anticipate breaking even until 2030.

Vertical’s shares have lost 97 per cent of their value since they first listed. A reluctance to invest is understandable given its weak funding position, but it has “a really strong product, a good team and a good path forward”, argues Syth.

She credits Simpson with dragging Vertical from a “scrappy upstart” to a more mature organisation which, if it can secure more funding, could benefit from a re-rating.

Archer is probably in the strongest funding position following its recent raise, but all of the eVTOL companies sit at the risky end of the investment spectrum.

Analysts covering the sector are generally bullish, though. Canaccord’s Moeller argues that as neither Boeing nor Airbus has made much progress with eVTOLs of their own, the most prudent course of action for them would be to wait for leaders to establish themselves and then snap them up.

They may have to spend $5bn-$10bn to do so, but “this is pocket change”, says Moeller. “Joby has a 14-year head start on battery development. You can’t accelerate that in one or two years.”

Grounded

Although eVTOLs have the potential to revolutionise travel within and between cities, the battery problem flagged by Airbus highlights another inconvenient truth – electric-powered planes are only capable of covering short distances.

Airbus has been working with CFM International – the joint venture between engine makers GE Aerospace (US:GE) and Safran (FR:SAF) – on a smaller, 100-seat hydrogen-powered plane known as ZeroE, which it had planned to bring to market by 2035. However, its head of future programmes, Bruno Fichefeux, said in March that although the ecosystem for hydrogen production is evolving, “we are lagging 5-10 years behind the volume and prices that we would need to make an economically competitive aircraft”.

With SAF efforts struggling to get off the ground and requiring further subsidies in future, airline bosses, particularly in Europe, are increasingly resentful of having to pick up the bill.

Industry body Airlines 4 Europe (A4E) last month published a study which argued that European Union rules on environmental and consumer protection, as well as tax and corporate disclosures, cost the industry €15.5bn last year, and that environmental measures will add a further €6.2bn to this by 2030. The EU’s mandate, which requires the proportion of jet fuel that is sustainable to increase from 2 per cent this year to 6 per cent by 2030, is the main driver behind the rise, as SAF typically costs three times as much as kerosene.

The UK’s mandate is even tougher – SAF has to comprise 10 per cent of all jet fuel by 2030.

Global SAF supply has increased 12-fold over the past three years, to 1.25bn litres last year, but new facilities are not being built quickly enough to meet targets, according to Boston Consulting Group.

The consultancy said a “vicious cycle” of limited supply was keeping prices high, which in turn dampens voluntary demand, undermining the business case for new projects.

The UK’s transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, last week pledged to get around this by offering a “revenue certainty mechanism”, where a government-backed counterparty will agree a strike price for SAF with a developer. If a producer can’t achieve that price in the open market, the counterparty will pay the difference.

The GRAMM consortium – a group that includes France’s TotalEnergies (FR:TTE), refiner Axens, industrial gases specialist Linde (US:LIN) and Centrica’s (CNA) Spirit Energy – has applied for funding to carry out studies into building a major SAF plant at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.

The plant could supply more than half of the SAF required to meet the UK’s mandate. But GRAMM is not expected to take a decision on whether to build until the end of next year and would only reach capacity by 2032, chief executive Alexander Peschkoff says.

The industry association said “stagnant corn demand” has impacted biofuels’ impact on Iowa’s economy, and said the best way to increase demand is entry to the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets.

The industry association said “stagnant corn demand” has impacted biofuels’ impact on Iowa’s economy, and said the best way to increase demand is entry to the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets.

“That is the most cost-effective and impactful tool we can provide our farmers and producers,” Monte Shaw, IRFA executive director, said in a statement.

IRFA holds that the direct impacts of biofuels “remain strong” in the state, with another “record for fuel production.”

Overall, the report found the renewable fuel industry accounted for 2% of Iowa’s 2024 gross domestic product, or $5.7 billion. The industry also created more than 34,000 direct and indirect jobs across the state, which is down from 52,000 jobs in 2023.

Shaw said some of the change comes from completed construction projects and a closed facility, but the majority of that figure is from the indirect impacts of the stalled market.

“The bigger thing is those multiplier effects,” he said. “When you’re buying corn at $7, that income goes over in the economy and supports jobs and other aspects of Iowa’s economy … When farmers don’t have money, they’re not out buying new equipment, they’re gonna make stuff last another year, and so that is where those job losses have happened.”

Shaw said if the numbers are to increase across the economy, the overall demand for ethanol needs to increase.

Right now, he said the supply outweighs demand for corn and soybean commodities, which has led to decreasing corn prices over the past two years. The trend is projected to follow suit for the 2024-2025 crop year.

“Our farmers are very productive, very competitive … they’re producing more corn with fewer inputs on the same acres,” Shaw said. “But we have not been able to build demand fast enough.”

Ryan Sauer, vice president of market development for Iowa Corn Growers Association, said if the current trends continue and Iowa doesn’t branch into new markets to utilize corn, there could be “a bit of a repeat” of the farm crisis from the 1980s.

“You’ve got commodity prices that are going to stay stagnant, you’ve got input prices that will remain high, and I mean, there’s only so long that the banks can allow a farmer to do that,” Sauer said.

One route for increased demand could come from the congressional approval of nationwide, year-round, E15, or a blend of ethanol fuel with 15% ethanol.

According to studies from the National Corn Growers Association, a 5% increase in ethanol blends, which E15 would represent, equates to an increased demand of 2.3 billion bushels of corn annually. The IRFA study found that 62% of corn in Iowa is processed by the ethanol industry.

Sauer said the E15 market would be especially important for Iowa farmers if tariffs upset corn export markets.

“If we’re not going to be able to export it because of tariffs and all this, we need all the demand domestically we can get, and E15 will allow us to do that,” Sauer said.

Low carbon markets

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association has also been pushing for year-round E15, but Shaw called it a “near-term market.”

“All the other market growth opportunities that we see on the horizon are low carbon, ultra-low carbon markets,” Shaw said. “That’s why we’re fighting so hard … to make sure that our ethanol producers have the tools they need to produce ultra-low carbon ethanol.”

Shaw said sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is one of the ultra-low carbon fuels the industry hopes to expand to, but there is also demand for fuels in the marine industry, trains and for some construction and tractor equipment.

The study said ethanol producers would have to “lower the carbon intensity” of ethanol production in order to open up the market for SAF.

“This is most easily achieved through environmentally friendly feedstock production practices and access to opportunities for carbon capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide from ethanol production,” the study said.

The industries purchasing these fuels want them to be produced with lifetime greenhouse gas emissions below a certain level. Some iterations of guidance for sustainable aviation fuel, for example, required the fuel to be made from corn grown with carbon reducing farming practices.

Shaw said being able to reduce carbon emissions via carbon capture and sequestration, like the controversial Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, would equate to “tens of billions of gallons” of additional biofuel demand over the next 20 years.

“Do you want to be sitting here around $3.50 corn, and having a bad farm economy?” Shaw said. “Or, do we want to access these new markets that will literally say, ‘Give me every gallon you can?’”

The Summit pipeline, and the now terminated Wolf Carbon Solutions pipeline, has drawn opposition from landowners, some politicians and environmental groups like the Sierra Club.

Those opposed to the project believe carbon sequestration pipelines are dangerous for communities, often citing a rupture of a pipeline in Satartia, Mississippi. Landowners oppose the taking of easements in agricultural land for the pipeline, especially after the Summit project was conditionally granted the right of eminent domain in June.

The issues have been a prominent topic of discussion at the Iowa Capitol this session. The House voted to ban the use of eminent domain on carbon sequestration pipelines, and more recently a group of senators vowed to stand their ground on budget negotiations until the pipeline issue is debated in the chamber.

Emma Schmit, pipeline fighters director with Bold Alliance, said the “unyielding commitment to carbon capture pipelines” is what’s holding the biofuels industry back.

“To imply stagnation suddenly has the industry on death’s door unless a risky carbon capture pipeline is allowed to destroy over 1,000 miles of prime Iowa farmland is a stretch,” Schmit said in an email.

She referenced figures in the study showing another high year for ethanol production, and that corn utilization by the industry has remained consistent.

“If expanding markets via decarbonization is the goal, there are a multitude of options available that don’t depend on the destruction of thousands of parcels or the misuse of eminent domain,” Schmit said.

According to Summit Carbon Solutions, the project has already secured easement agreements for more than 75% of the route for the first phase of the pipeline.

Construction on the pipeline cannot begin until the company has secured permit approval in South Dakota, a process which has been complicated by the state’s recent ban on eminent domain for CO2 pipelines and subsequent denial of the permit application from Summit. The company has pledged to reapply with reduced scope in the state.

The project could face a similar situation in Iowa if lawmakers advance the bill passed from the House, though substantial amendments to the bill have been proposed in the Senate.

Shaw said without carbon sequestration capabilities, Iowa could lose its title as “most cost-effective place to turn corn into ethanol,” in favor of nearby Nebraska, where a roughly 400-mile carbon dioxide sequestration pipeline through the state is set to be operational by the end of 2025.

“People are treating this like it’s some sort of political board game, and they’re ignoring the very real ramifications that are happening around us,” Shaw said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/USDA-photo-of-Elite-Octane-from-Rollins-visit-e1746719369195.jpg,N,,2025-05-08 12:56:31.640584

SABA membership comprises more than 35 companies from a variety of sectors – including finance, technology, media and entertainment, business consulting and others seeking to reduce their aviation emissions through investment in sustainable aviation fuel.

Through this RFP, SABA will facilitate five- to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final investment decision (FID) for a new next-generation SAF production facility.

""The SAF market is growing rapidly but the technologies we need to fully decarbonise the aviation sector are still in their infancy,"" says Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat.

""Investment needs to happen now if we want these technologies to scale post-2030 and keep the aviation sector on track to meet its long-term net zero goals.""

Breaking the 1% barrier

The SAF market represents an immediate opportunity to decarbonise aviation through drop-in fuels compatible with existing aircraft fleets.

Despite recent growth, SAF constitutes less than 1% of total aviation fuel consumption today, with the market primarily consisting of SAF produced from traditional feedstocks like waste oils, which face scaling limitations beyond 2030.

SAF with the highest scaling potential—derived from renewable hydrogen, agricultural and forestry residues and municipal solid waste—currently represents only a small fraction of available SAF.

Without targeted investment now, these fuels may not reach the production volumes necessary to meet global decarbonisation goals.

Innovative book and claim system drives industry transformation

SABA collaborates with corporate partners to create the demand signals necessary for advanced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers to confidently scale their operations.

Through a book and claim system, corporate customers purchase sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc), enabling them to invest in SAF and claim the environmental benefits, regardless of whether the fuel directly powers their flights.

This investment allows travellers to report greenhouse gas emissions reductions in their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF is delivered to aircraft operators.

Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at SABA co-founder RMI, adds: ""Book and claim is the bridge between the aviation industry's sustainable fuel ambitions and scalable real-world production, and SABA is helping build it.

""By mobilising corporate demand and catalysing investment in cutting-edge fuel production, we can fast-track innovation, expand high-integrity supply and deliver the climate results the aviation sector urgently needs.""

Since launching in 2021, SABA has facilitated approximately $200 million in total SAF investments.

This began with a 2021 proof-of-concept pilot procurement for a short-term offtake period, followed by a landmark multi-year procurement in 2023-2024 that engaged 27 participants and supported roughly 50 million gallons of SAF.

The newly announced RFP aims to secure longer-term offtake agreements to help production facilities reach Final Investment Decision (FID) by 2026 and become operational by 2030.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/bd77eef4e7c4446566d5ddd6815d0482:7e92f993b325e2e37dbafcdfb0f1e811/airplane-flying-skyscrapers.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-08 12:56:59.319545

The ethanol industry can be a continued success story if the policies are kept or put in place to help it grow—no matter where the biofuel is produced in the U.S.","Aemetis Inc. has always known how to operate on the edge. From its Keyes ethanol plant in California’s Central Valley well outside traditional U.S. ethanol country, to its non-stop efforts to install, upgrade or test cutting-edge technologies across its renewable energy portfolio, Aemetis has proven how comfortable it is with navigating unique challenges. For the company’s leadership team, that also includes figuring out how to capitalize on or keep up with California’s one-of-one policy and regulatory framework designed to prioritize low-carbon energy through the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). In February this year, the company announced it had surpassed $2 billion in revenue from the Keyes plant, operating since 2011. In a state with hot and dry weather conditions most of the year, along with a regulatory system that ties the value of every ounce or watt of energy produced and consumed to an intricate carbon calculation scheme, Eric McAfee, Aemetis CEO, believes he knows why his team has thrived on the edge from day one.

“I think that the core of our success is in our understanding of the regulatory environment here, and knowing that we always have opportunities to keep innovating to improve production and economics across our business.”

Innovation Is the Keyes

Andy Foster, president of Aemetis North Americas, is always busy with new innovations, he says, because the company is focused on thinking ahead. Foster has led the tech upgrades and expansion work for Aemetis at the plant, the company’s growth into dairy renewable natural gas production, working to create a carbon capture and sequestration system through injection wells, and also the recent permitting of a SAF and renewable diesel facility.

The 65 million-gallon-per-year corn ethanol plant delivers wet distillers grains to more than 80 California dairy operations. Corn oil is made for animal feed or as feedstock for renewable fuels. Through his work with Aemetis RNG, Foster has established a dairy and biogas capture network that could soon make Aemetis one of the largest producers of dairy RNG.

Even when he laughs about being busy, he doesn’t laugh for long. In the past few years, the Aemetis team has performed several efficiency upgrades in Keyes. In 2023, the team shut down the plant to perform the most extensive upgrades since purchasing the facility in 2011. Upgrades have included everything from converting to electric ethanol dehydration to adding more than 1,100 sensors.

Working with PG&E through a special program designed to incorporate modern, energy-efficient tech, the plant has been analyzed inch by inch, Foster says. The team has added variable speed drives, energy-efficient pumps, and electrified anything possible, all the way down to changing out light bulbs. Foster says the plant’s financial operations depend on a constant push to be more efficient and to work within the framework of the state. In 2023, the plant added high-efficiency heat exchangers and, in 2024, a solar microgrid with battery storage.

“On average, we pay about 50 % more in natural gas costs than most of our Midwest peers,” Foster says. “We just pay a lot higher utility rates in California.”

To combat the high costs incurred through the plant’s cooling towers running during high external temp conditions, Aemetis installed a solar microgrid system. The main purpose of the system is to capture energy and store it for later use. According to Foster, temps in the Central Valley can regularly reach and stay at 110 degrees Fahrenheit. During the peak hours of the day when pulling power off the grid is most expensive, the plant uses roughly 2 MW of solar-generated power stored in on-site batteries. The stored power helps to run the fans on the cooling towers when the plant is load shedding, which helps the plant avoid peak power rates during high-usage times.

Solar panels situated above large storm water storage ponds and parking areas provide low-carbon electricity that is integrated with a distributed control system equipped with artificial intelligence. Through a grant from the California Energy Commission, Aemetis was able to install an entirely new Allen-Bradley distributed control system system that can switch the power sources for the plant back and forth throughout the day.

The next big project at Aemetis will involve mechanical vapor recompression (MVR), a process that replaces steam boilers with electrical compressors that can reuse vapors generated during evaporation. MVR systems are starting to appear across the ethanol industry, and Foster and his team are excited to add the energy efficiency and carbon reduction system to its operation.

Foster plans to link AI with the MVR once the unit is up and running next year. “We’ll go from big natural gas boilers to using efficient electric turbo fans,” he says. “The design will give us an opportunity to preprogram a lot of the parameters of how the plant operates.”

Praj Industries is designing the MVR and fabricating a good portion of the build. Piller, a commercial fan and compressor provider from Germany, will supply the fans.

Outside the confines of the plant, Foster is also overseeing the construction of a carbon capture well that, once complete, could store 1.4 million tons of CO2 7,000 feet below ground in a saline formation. A characterization well is already under construction and will form the basis for the Class VI well permit required by the EPA. Aemetis is currently working to line up additional CO2 customers as the CO2 volumes from the plant and the RNG production sites that will be connected to the well won’t fully use its annual capacity. Foster is always busy.

Baker Hughes, an oil and gas drilling company, is leading the underground engineering and drilling work, including consultation and project design. ATSI, an EPC and project management firm, is helping on the project as well.

McAfee and team are also continuing work on the renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel project they began circa 2021 by buying a former 125-acre Army ammunition plant. To date, the company has completed an Environmental Impact Report, obtained California Environmental Quality Act permits and received the Authority To Construct air permit. The design plan for the future plant is to utilize non-edible oils as feedstock, ranging from distillers corn oil to used cooking oil. At the plant, Foster says the design produces renewable SAF, propane, naphtha, and hydrogen.

At the Keyes plant, the team has also explored alternative feedstock options. Because the plant is surrounded by orchards, the team is continually looking at utilizing orchard debris or almond-based biomass as a feedstock, explains Foster.

“If there is a way to take orchard wood and turn it into ethanol, you better believe we are going to do it.”

Foster believes that Aemetis’ willingness to evaluate, assess and regularly adopt cutting-edge tech or new operational processes is, in part, linked to the physical location of the plant. “We’ve lived near Silicon Valley for a long time and the culture here encourages that innovation,” he says

The state’s unique LCFS and other regulatory frameworks also mean the team has to monetize anything and everything it can. Sometimes that includes adding more projects or products, or running existing operations more smoothly.

“We are ever vigilant in lowering the CI score,” he says.

As the chief visionary behind Aemetis’ evolution, McAfee never shies away from learning about new tech. According to Foster, he’s been in thousands of meetings over the years with McAfee and tech providers pitching or educating their team about the newest offerings.

Aemetis runs several pilot programs and tests at the Keyes facility. When a company approached Aemetis about testing out radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensors to detect vibrations on pumps and other equipment throughout the plant, Foster agreed. Today, the Keyes plant still uses the technology to help with preventative maintenance. A different company trying to develop a new coating for the inside of tanks has also worked with Aemetis. Many of the tests don’t pan out, but that doesn’t stop the team from keeping an open mind.

“We really try to be early adopters,” Foster says.

Policy Players

Both Foster and McAfee can talk at length on biofuel technology. And the same can be said of biofuel policy and regulatory issues at both state and federal levels. Through March of this year, McAfee had already traveled to D.C. multiple times. And Foster and McAfee are both active in the state’s policies on biofuels, carbon and most recently, E15. California is the only state left that hasn’t allowed the adoption of E15.

“If we adopt E15 in California, it’s major news for the entire ethanol industry,” McAfee says.

The 600 million-gallon increase in the size of the ethanol market by adopting E15 in California is significantly larger than the annual production at Keyes, he adds.

The Aemetis team dedicates significant time speaking with members of the state legislature, in part because of term limits. There are always new people to educate. McAfee focuses on informing state agencies such as CARB about the impact of their policies, as well as meeting with Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“Our job is to bring them the message of how these policies work in the real world,” McAfee says.

The Aemetis CEO believes the current administration has a significant opportunity to put America in a leading place for energy generation, biofuels and more, starting by administering the 45Z tax credit. Aemetis’ MVR project shows the impact of such policy on biofuel producers working to expand domestic energy production and reduce their CI score. The MVR would reduce the CI score at Keyes by roughly 15 points and improve the plant’s cash flow by an estimated $0.50 per gallon, the company projects, or roughly $32 million per year.

LCFS credits are expected to increase over time, the company believes. The MVR, through the generation of LCFS credits, could increase revenues at the plant by another 10 cents per gallon. Changes to the LCFS program, which were approved last November, should be adopted in 2025, which will help as the program requires more carbon-intensity reductions for producers that participate and supply energy into the program. Such a change could reduce the supply of LCFS credits on the market and reward those that invest heavily in CI-reduction tech. Should LCFS credits reach $150 per metric ton, Aemetis estimates it could generate another $12 million per year from the addition of its MVR system.

Installing or continuing on with E15 mandates, LCFS revisions, the 45Z (incentivizes new fuel with low CI) or 45Q (incentivizes carbon capture and sequestration) tax credits isn’t just about revenue generation—it’s also about access to markets.

Through a greater opportunity to access more markets or maybe just more of the markets it already serves, the ethanol industry can help the country unleash its energy dominance, McAfee states.

Investments should come to the renewable energy sector, including ethanol production, Foster adds.

“Now is the time to be aggressive. This is an American-made industry,” Foster says. “Of any industry that you can point to that has grown from the ground up, this industry really touches all parts of the economy.”

Both Foster and McAfee agree with the idea that their work at Aemetis is often on the edge—in location, through new strategies, and as reflected in their willingness to adopt or try new technologies. They may not always have a blueprint to follow in their new ventures, but they can talk with the greater biofuels industry to share ideas or go over options. In today’s industry, everyone talks and shares insights. They believe that right now the Aemetis story isn’t just about them and their unique and ever-expanding operations in California’s Central Valley. The ethanol industry can be a continued success story if the policies are kept or put in place to help it grow—no matter where the biofuel is produced in the U.S. The real takeaway from what they are doing, from what the entire ethanol and renewables industry is or can do in the future, they agree, is actually central to unleashing American energy dominance.

This new project will establish one of the first biomass-to-SAF production facilities in North America.

“Project Avance represents a pivotal moment in sustainable aviation,” said Darren Fuller, chief commercial officer, Alder Renewables.

“By converting underutilized and sustainably sourced forest residuals into high-value renewable fuels, we’re creating a solution that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Our technology creates a novel viable pathway to help aviation meet its ambitious decarbonization goals, maximizes optionality for our refiners, and supports job growth in regional Québec communities.”

Project Avance will deploy Alder Renewables’ proprietary technology to convert bio-oil currently produced at the Port-Cartier Bioénergie AECN plant which is a joint venture between sawmill operator Arbec Forest Products and integrated forestry operations company Groupe Rémabec.

The project will demonstrate the entire pathway from certified sustainable forest residuals into low-carbon Alder Renewable Crude (ARC), which will then be refined into SAF — and other low carbon transportation fuels. Production is

expected to begin in 2027.

This new project embodies Canada and Québec’s commitments to developing innovative clean energy solutions from forest residues and will create high-paying jobs in the sustainable energy sector. It leverages existing forestry infrastructure and aligns with

Canada’s Aviation Action Plan, which calls for 1 billion litres of SAF by 2030.

“This partnership is another important step forward for Arbec Forest Products and Groupe Rémabec’s vision and strategic plan to transform the forestry industry.

Project Avance will be located at Arbec Lumber’s integrated plant, which currently supports sustainable technologies to produce both renewable fuel oil and biochar,” said Serge Mercier, CPA, president of Bioénergie AECN.

“Our facility in Port-Cartier already converts forest and sawmill residuals into bio-oil renewable products — Project Avance will take this to the next level. The technology that we will utilize with our friends at Alder Renewables has the potential for full commercial deployment across Québec’s forest regions, creating new revenue streams for a legacy industry, and helping to decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate sectors: aviation.”

The project team is currently working to secure additional support from both the Canadian federal and Québec provincial governments.

The research project, called the Hydrogen Advanced Design Engine Study (HyADES), uses a modified variant of the PW127XT regional turboprop that burns pure hydrogen.

“Hydrogen is an important part of our strategy for enabling alternative fuels for aviation, including sustainable aviation fuels (SAF),” said Robert Peluso, the company’s executive director of systems engineering.

“We are focused on staying at the cutting edge of technologies that meet the current and future needs of our customers.”

Led by P&WC, HyADES is one of several new projects supported by Canada’s federally funded Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technology (INSAT). Other INSAT projects, first announced in November 2024, involve Bell Textron Canada, Bombardier, CAE, De Havilland Aircraft Canada, and Certification Center Canada, among other industry partners.

In this specific case, P&WC is collaborating with Toronto-based Next Hydrogen Solutions, which develops the high-efficiency, low-cost electrolyzers needed for the project’s success.

“Due to having relatively shorter ranges and payloads, regional aviation clearly offers an attractive use case for employing these technologies to reduce emissions and environmental impact,” said Peluso. “We believe adapting proven turboprop technology to operate with hydrogen fuel could provide a stepping stone towards enabling hydrogen-fuelled aviation.”

HyADES began in 2024, and the first phase focused on rig tests of a PW127XT engine with its single fuel nozzle and combustor adapted for hydrogen fuel. That work is targeted for completion in 2026, potentially followed by a full-scale demonstrator in future phases.

In the meantime, P&WC continues to weigh the merits and demerits of multiple fuel sources.

Peluso noted hydrogen burning in a turbine engine or powering a fuel cell does not produce carbon dioxide emissions. This compares to burning SAF, which does produce CO2 emissions, but can still create a net emissions reduction, depending on the types of feedstocks used in its manufacture.

Still, even in its cooled liquid form, hydrogen has a much lower energy density per unit volume compared to conventional jet fuel or SAF, which creates challenges for accommodating the fuel within an aircraft design.

This latest project builds on P&WC’s history of hydrogen propulsion testing, which stretches back to the 1950s, as part of its larger parent company, RTX.

At the time, the company said, Pratt & Whitney’s U.S. business developed and tested a hydrogen-burning engine for a secret Lockheed Skunkworks high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft project that was later cancelled.

In 2022, Pratt & Whitney also launched the Hydrogen Steam Injected, Inter-Cooled Turbine Engine (HySIITE) project, which aims to reduce nitrogen-oxide emissions by up to 80 percent, and to improve fuel efficiency by up to 35 percent, compared to today’s most advanced single aisle aircraft.

Aviation fuel to bloom from wastewater

S. Himmelstein | May 08, 2025

Source: Northumbrian Water

A botanical effort to benefit both the wastewater treatment and aviation sectors is underway in the U.K. Northumbrian Water is pioneering the Green Machine project to transform algae grown in domestic sewage into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This approach offers an alternative to conventional jet fuel while enhancing wastewater treatment processes.

The goal is to use algae to extract nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater, recover it and then convert it into sustainable fuels. Additional benefits include reductions in the environmental impacts of waste treatment and up to £1m ($1.2 million) annually in operational costs.

The research is underway in collaboration with U.S.-based BrightWave, which is providing the photobioreactors that are used to cultivate algae, and Ligoflux, a specialist filtration company that provides products for algae harvesting.

The Green Machine is expected to undergo trials at the Bran Sands Treatment Works, a major sludge treatment center, industrial effluent treatment site and gas-to-grid facility, in Teesside by the summer of 2025. Currently, the treatment process generates a challenging effluent that is costly to manage and contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions of the plant. Northumbrian has tested the remedial properties of microalgae to reduce treatment costs and the plant’s carbon footprint, and is looking to scale up the concept to provide full treatment of digested sludge liquor to yield biogas and SAF.

Cop 30 president-designate Andre Correa do Lago today called for ""innovative governance approaches"" and for the aggregation of ""currently fragmented"" efforts. This would reinforce the decision-making process for UN climate body the UNFCCC and support the implementation of the Paris agreement, he noted.

Climate advocates including former UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon last year wrote an open letter to the UN calling for a reform of the Cop climate change summits as they said they have failed to deliver change at the speed and scale required.

""Climate change will increasingly supervene and disrupt political and socioeconomic agendas"", Correa do Lago wrote in a second letter outlining his priorities for the summit, which will be held in November in Belem, Brazil. The president-designate has previously set out his hopes for Cop 30 to be ""a Cop of action"".

Correa do Lago acknowledged ""serious geopolitical, socioeconomic, and environmental challenges"", calling for reinforced multilateralism. And he set out his vision for a ""Global Mutirao"" — an ""unprecedented"" global mobilisation of ""self-driven"" climate action.

Climate finance dominated Cop 29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, last year, where countries agreed that developed nations would provide at least $300bn/yr to developing nations by 2035, for climate action and their energy transitions. Countries will this year discuss a promised ""roadmap"", intended to forge a path to climate finance of $1.3 trillion/yr, but this will likely lie outside formal negotiations.

The agreement comes as Google and its tech giant peers increasingly turn to nuclear energy to help address the growing emissions impact of their rapidly expanding data center footprints. While Google has set 2030 goals to reach net zero emissions across its operations and value chain, and to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 absolute emissions, on a 2019 basis, the company recently reported that its emissions increased by 13% in 2023, and are up by 48% since 2019, as its growing data center electricity consumption has outpaced its ability to bring carbon free energy projects online. Google has also set a goal in 2020 to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030, matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.

Last year, Google signed its first advanced nuclear agreement with nuclear technology company Kairos Power aimed at deploying a fleet of small advanced nuclear power projects across the U.S. to provide up to 500 MW of carbon-free energy.goals.

As part of the new agreement with Elementl, Google will commit early-stage development capital to advance the development of three projects, each of which will be able to generate at least 600 MW of power capacity.

Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy at Google, said:

“Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy. Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation.”

Earlier this year, Google and Meta joined a group of major companies pledging to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The pledge notes that “energy demand in many industries is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” adding that tripling nuclear capacity will “help achieve global goals for enhanced energy resiliency and security, and continuous firm clean energy supply.”

Established in 2023, Elementl Power develops, finances, and manages nuclear power projects, using next-generation technology that it claims is the safest form of energy generation.

With the support of Google, Elementl said that it is advancing its goal to bring more than 10 gigawatts online in the U.S. by 2035, working collaboratively with regulated utilities, independent power producers and technology suppliers.

Elementl Power Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Colbert said:

“Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals. We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Google3.jpg,N,,2025-05-08 08:56:07.503902

Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2025

Total revenues during the first quarter of 2025 were $42.9 million compared to $72.6 million for the first quarter of 2024. Delays with the receipt of contracts in India from the government-owned Oil Marketing Companies accounted for the decline in revenue. New OMC letters of intent for $31 million were issued in April 2025 and we started shipments in April. Our Keyes ethanol plant increased revenues by $1.7 million due principally to an increase in the average price of Ethanol from $1.79 during 2024 to $1.98 during the first quarter of 2025. Our Dairy Natural Gas segment sold 70,900 MMBtu of renewable natural gas, an increase of 10,100 MMBtu from the same quarter last year.

Gross loss for the first quarter of 2025 was $5.1 million, compared to a $0.6 million loss during the first quarter of 2024.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.6 million to $10.5 million during the first quarter of 2025 compared to $8.9 million during the same period in 2024, driven primarily from legal and other transaction costs associated with receiving $18 million of cash proceeds from tax credit sales during the first quarter.

Operating loss was $15.6 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to operating loss of $9.5 million for the same period in 2024.

Interest expense, excluding accretion of Series A preferred units in the Aemetis Biogas LLC subsidiary, increased to $13.7 million during the first quarter of 2025 compared to $10.5 million during the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, Aemetis Biogas recognized $2.3 million of accretion of Series A preferred units during the first quarter of 2025 compared to $3.3 million during the first quarter of 2024.

Income tax expense included a benefit from the sale of $7.0 million of Investment Tax Credits during the first quarter of 2025.

Net loss was $24.5 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared to net loss of $24.2 million for the first quarter of 2024.

The jet fuel that the company, Twelve, plans to create is projected to produce up to 90% less emissions than traditional aviation fuel.

Twelve’s fuel plant is not yet operational, but its concept shows promise. The startup captures carbon from the air and extracts hydrogen from water, then, using renewable energy, it puts the elements through an industrial version of photosynthesis to create the building blocks for sustainable fuels. It recently secured funding to build its fuel plant in Moses Lake, Washington, where it plans to produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel a year.

""United's Sustainable Flight Fund's investment reinforces our momentum at a pivotal moment as we move from innovation to implementation,"" said Nicholas Flanders, co-founder & CEO of Twelve.

The company got a major endorsement in 2024 when it inked a historic deal with International Airlines Group, parent company to five European airlines, including British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, Level. Under the deal, which is one of the largest sustainable aviation fuel contracts on record, Twelve will provide 260 million gallons of their low-carbon fuel to IAG’s five airlines for 14 years.

""Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,"" said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures®. ""Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured, providing them with the flexibility to commercialize their technology and grow their operations expediently.""

The investment in low-carbon fuel is one in a flurry of recent partnerships that United’s investment arm, United Airlines Ventures, has bought into recently. The firm has also launched agreements with electric air taxi company Archer and JetZero’s futuristic blended wing body aircraft with lower fuel emissions.

This standard is now approved for the production of JetA1, globally.

The Defence Standard milestone was achieved through collaboration with industry stakeholders, including OEMs, IATA, fuel producers and airline companies, to help lower lifecycle carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Co-processing is a method where vegetable oils, waste oils and fats, or similar sustainable feedstocks are processed along with conventional feedstocks in existing refineries. It is a SAF production method that can be activated quickly and use existing fuel distribution infrastructure, important especially during the early scale-up of SAF.

This achievement allows bp and other fuel producers to accelerate SAF production at higher concentrations using existing refinery process units. Refinery co-processing is a crucial step towards reducing aviation industry emissions. Bp already produces SAF via co-processing at its refineries and plans to increase its renewable feedstock content from 2025 onwards.

Federica Berra, senior vice president, Air bp said: “Defence Standard approval for co-processing SAF is a significant milestone for the industry and I’d like to thank our partners for their support and input in achieving this. Co-processing produces high-quality fuel that meets stringent aviation standards, while helping to increase the volume of SAF available to customers.”

Colonel Pete Skinsley, MoD Operational Energy Authority (OEA) Deputy Head Operations said: ""I’m delighted that the updated Def Stan 91-091 has been published, demonstrating our continued commitment to sustainable aviation fuel. The co-processing of SAF is a major step toward reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector while sustaining operational demands. This achievement is a great example of a collaborative effort with our industry partners and the wider aviation industry.”

The inclusion of co-processing into the aviation fuel standard, Def Stan 91-091, continues to build on the work done by MoD to reduce the carbon footprint of Defence by increasing the availability of SAF, which has been used for routine operations from RAF Lossiemouth since 2024.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist: “This is a long-awaited and welcome development that will bring immediate results. Co-processing is possible with only limited additional capital investments, and it should be maximised — the example of bp and the UK Ministry of Defence is one we wish many countries and SAF producers will follow.”

This project is the result of a three-year programme of work at bp's Bochum technology centre, utilising pilot plant and analytical testing facilities to develop these capabilities. The project involved synthesising data and engaging with stakeholders, including OEMs, IATA, fuel producers and airline companies and is a great example of what can be achieved when the industry works together.",,N,,2025-05-08 08:56:24.713153

Spanning nearly two decades, the dataset offers the clearest global picture yet of how forest carbon stocks have changed over time.

Developed through ESA’s Climate Change Initiative, this new long-term record integrates data from multiple satellite missions – and will soon be further enhanced by data from the Biomass mission itself.

It tracks the carbon-rich woody parts of vegetation, mainly trunks and branches, across the globe for different years between 2007 and 2022, at resolutions ranging from 100 m to 50 km.

Importantly, it is tailored to support climate and carbon modelling, forest management, and national greenhouse-gas reporting activities as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement.

ESA’s Frank Martin Seifert, noted, “The new release, version 6, is a pivotal moment for climate science as it provides an unprecedented level of consistency and timeliness in the provision of above-ground biomass estimates globally.

“This empowers researchers and policymakers alike to track carbon dynamics with the temporal precision necessary for meaningful climate action.”

Trees play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, storing large amounts of carbon as biomass. While this carbon stock increases as forests grow, it can be rapidly released back into the atmosphere through deforestation and wildfires – contributing significantly to rising carbon dioxide levels and, therefore, driving climate change.

The dataset draws from different Earth-observing satellites including ESA’s Envisat and Europe’s Copernicus Sentinel-1, Japan’s ALOS PALSAR, and NASA’s ICESat and GEDI lidar missions.

Thanks to close international collaboration, particularly with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, this latest release significantly improves on the accuracy of biomass estimates and corrects long-standing underestimates in high-biomass regions.

Refinements to the biomass retrieval algorithm have resulted in a dataset that delivers more consistent and reliable information across the world’s forest biomes – though it remains most accurate up to 400 tonnes of biomass per hectare.

Richard Lucas of Aberystwyth University, who leads ESA’s Climate Change Initiative Biomass Project, said, “The new dataset provides a much more accurate representation of global forest biomass, particularly in regions where earlier versions underestimated high-density forests.”

However, Prof. Lucas added that challenges remain in capturing the most carbon-rich ecosystems.

“Detecting biomass densities above 400 tonnes per hectare is considerably more difficult because the relatively short wavelengths of current radar sensors don’t fully penetrate or interact with the larger woody components of dense tropical forests.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ESA_May25_508a96fefc.jpg,N,,2025-05-08 06:56:49.868544

Influenced by international policy frameworks such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (ICAO CORSIA), several ASEAN member states such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines have developed or are exploring SAF policies and production, leveraging the region’s abundant agricultural resources. SAF demand is growing.

Forty-three international airlines are committed to using 13 million tonnes of SAF by 2030 to meet their regulatory and voluntary targets, and the corporate sector is also showing interest in purchasing SAF to reduce business and cargo travel (Scope 3) emissions through book and claim approaches.

This growing demand is mostly linked to SAF’s sustainability performance, with a preference for fuels certified by schemes like the RSB.

A hydrogen system is under construction in the port of Rotterdam, combining production and use primarily in industry, as well as the import and transit of hydrogen to other parts of Northwest Europe. Despite challenges posed by increased costs and economic uncertainties, the system is steadily taking shape. Here is a look at the key hydrogen projects from the past year, in no particular order:

Holland Hydrogen 1 under construction

Announcement second green hydrogen plant ELYgator

Production and storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel

Successful bunkering ammonia

Porthos: CO2 transport and storage under the North Sea

Offshore wind park Zeevonk II

Brazilian green hydrogen for Germany via Rotterdam

Fertiglobe: first delivery of green ammonia for EU via Rotterdam

CO2next: temporary storage and transhipment of CO2

Ammonia terminal and cracker VTTI

Construction hydrogen network

Delta Rhine Corridor

Holland Hydrogen 1

Holland Hydrogen 1 is taking concrete form. Shell is constructing Europe’s first major renewable hydrogen plant, with a capacity of 200 MW. Last year, Shell and TenneT signed a connection and transport agreement for the high-voltage grid, and the plant is now linked to it. A hydrogen pipeline, which will also be part of the national hydrogen network, connects the hydrogen plant to the port of Rotterdam.

ELYgator

Earlier this year, the French company Air Liquide announced its plans to develop, construct and operate a 200 MW electrolyser at the first conversion park on the Maasvlakte. This hydrogen plant, named ‘ELYgator’, produces low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy and is expected to be operational by the end of 2027. Air Liquide will harness power from the OranjeWind and Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) wind farms off the Dutch coast to produce hydrogen for the TotalEnergies refinery, among others.

Production and storage of sustainable aviation fuel

At the end of 2024, Power2X and Advario announced the joint development of a large-scale production and storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) with a capacity exceeding 250,000 tonnes of e-SAF per year. This facility will produce enough environmentally friendly fuel for approximately 7,000 flights between Amsterdam and New York each year, while the demand for hydrogen continues to rise.

Succesful ammonia bunkering

In April 2025, Trammo, OCI, and James Fisher Fendercare successfully conducted an ammonia bunkering pilot between two vessels in the port of Rotterdam. This represents an important step in preparing the port for the bunkering of green ammonia. During the pilot, 800 cubic metres of liquid ammonia at -33°C were transferred, validating the port’s safety framework. The first vessels capable of using ammonia as bunker fuel are expected in 2026 or 2027.

The first vessels capable of using ammonia as bunker fuel are expected in 2026 or 2027.

Porthos

Porthos is the first large-scale CO2 transport and storage project in the EU, comprising a 30 km land pipeline, a compressor station on the Maasvlakte, and an injection platform located 20 km offshore in the North Sea. Meanwhile, 80% of the land pipeline has been completed. With the arrival of the Valaris drilling platform, offshore work for the construction of the Porthos infrastructure has clearly begun. From here, CO2 is pumped to a depleted gas field, a sealed space of porous sandstone at a depth of over 3 km beneath the North Sea bed. An important step in the development of low-carbon hydrogen production in Rotterdam.

Offshore wind park Zeevonk II

The Zeevonk II project involves the development of a 2 GW offshore wind farm, a 50 MWp floating offshore solar farm, and an electrolyser with a capacity of up to 1 GW at the second conversion park on the Maasvlakte. It will make it possible to convert wind farm energy into green hydrogen. Zeevonk II is a joint venture of Vattenfall and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), which won the government tender for an offshore wind farm with integration systems. The wind farm is expected to be commissioned in 2029.

Green hydrogen from Brazil to Germany via Rotterdam

The ports of Pecém (in Ceará, Brazil), Rotterdam, and duisport (Germany) are collaborating to facilitate the transport of alternative fuels. CEO Port of Rotterdam Authority, Boudewijn Siemons: ‘We recognise Brazil’s potential as a supplier of green hydrogen. We are pleased to welcome duisport to this collaboration aimed at establishing an end-to-end supply chain for green hydrogen.’ In the short term, transport from Rotterdam is possible via inland shipping and will be facilitated by pipelines from 2032.

Fertiglobe

Fertiglobe has been awarded the tender for the first H2Global pilot auction for green ammonia. The product will be imported via the port of Rotterdam and sold by Hintco in standardised volumes through annual auctions. In this capacity, Hintco acts as a ‘market maker’, stimulating new markets for green hydrogen and low-emission fuels.

CO2next

The CO2next project for the temporary storage and handling of liquid CO2 at the Maasvlakte in Rotterdam is entering the FEED phase. Shell and TotalEnergies have partnered with Gasunie and Vopak in this collaboration. The terminal will be supplied with liquid CO2 by vessels and will be connected to empty North Sea gas fields via the Aramis pipeline. With an initial annual capacity of 5.4 million, it has the potential to grow to 15 million tonnes per year. The investment decision is scheduled for 2025. Commercial activities are anticipated to begin in 2028.

Ammonia terminal and cracker VTTI

VTTI aims to develop an ammonia terminal and cracker in both Rotterdam and Antwerp. The European Commission has designated the project as a Project of Common Interest and is providing an €11.6 million EU contribution for Rotterdam. Given the significant market interest in the open season, VTTI is now starting the Heads of Agreement Phase with interested parties to further advance the project.

Construction hydrogen network

The construction of the national hydrogen network commenced in 2023 in the port of Rotterdam. Hynetwork is rolling out the network in phases, with the first section in Rotterdam expected to become operational in 2026. By 2030, the infrastructure will be available in industrial clusters along the Dutch coast. Simultaneously, connections to Germany and Belgium will be established. Between 2031 and 2033, all industrial clusters will be fully interconnected. The west-east connection of the national hydrogen network (the hydrogen pipeline from the Delta Rhine Corridor) will also be completed by that time.

Delta Rhine Corridor

The government has decided to prioritise the development of hydrogen and CO2 infrastructure within the Delta Rhine Corridor (DRC). The hydrogen pipeline needs to be constructed quickly to get the hydrogen market going. This is significant news for companies contemplating investments in the production, storage or purchase of hydrogen. It is important not only for Rotterdam, but also for other industrial clusters in the Netherlands, Germany, and Northwest Europe. The hydrogen pipeline is projected to be completed between 2031 to 2032. The development of an ammonia pipeline between Rotterdam and Germany is no longer included in the DRC scope but will proceed as a standalone project.

“Pitch Day at the Fuel Ethanol Workshop & Expo showcases the cutting edge of our industry—from breakthrough technologies to bold new startups redefining what is possible in biofuels,” said John Nelson, chief operating officer at Ethanol Producer Magazine. “This platform not only connects innovators with decision-makers, but also helps accelerate the future of ethanol through collaboration, investment, and fresh ideas.”

Each company applied to participate and was selected by a panel of experienced industry individuals.

The six companies selected to give an in-person pitch at the International Fuel Ethanol Workshop & Expo are:

Skyven Technologies

Skyven Technologies works with industrial manufacturers by recovering waste heat to produce clean, emissions-free steam using their Arcturus steam generating heat pump. Skyven’s proven Energy-as-a-Service model allows industrial manufacturers to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs without the upfront capital expenditure.

XTS Energy

XTS is currently developing a project using alcohol-to-jet technology (“ATJ”) to meet the growing demand for clean transport fuels by building, owning and operating the infrastructure to produce 30 million gallons per year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) and Renewable Diesel using ATJ technology with low carbon ethanol as a feedstock.

As SAF is critical to aviation’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050, XTS’s project will help bridge supply gaps while meeting carbon reduction targets in a market projected to demand 120 billion gallons of SAF per year. Strategically positioned to leverage U.S. economic incentives and comply with the strictest regulations in the EU, U.S., and Asia, XTS presents a compelling investment opportunity in clean fuel solutions for sustainable aviation and regulatory compliance.

Terragia Biofuel, Inc.

Terragia is developing innovative biotechnology to convert cellulosic biomass (the parts of plants that have evolved over time to be recalcitrant and hard to break down) into ethanol. Terragia’s novel approach, a combination of better biology and consolidated processing, unlocks that potential, providing a liquid fuel alternative that is not only more sustainable than fossil fuels but cost competitive as well. Integration of Terragia’s technology in corn ethanol plants will increase ethanol yields and enhance coproduct value while improving sustainability metrics.

Celluol

Waste biomass, such as agricultural residues, has unrealized potential to be a critical feedstock in the production of net-zero fuels and chemicals. Current solutions for the conversion of these residues have faced technical challenges due to the difficulty and cost in the crucial step of degrading this biomass into utilizable free sugars. Celluol has engineered a bacterium that can directly degrade and ferment waste biomass into ethanol using a one-step process similar to how we make beer or wine.

This breakthrough directly addresses the challenges encountered by current cellulosic conversion technologies, simplifying the process and making it significantly less expensive.

Celluol’s simpler and cheaper process can be rapidly deployed, starting by co-locating at first-generation ethanol plants that currently use corn or sugarcane and have abundant biomass wastes. By further capturing and converting the CO2 produced during the fermentation process into ethanol, Celluol’s technology has the potential to decrease the amount of land required for sustainable biofuel production by up to three times.

The Pennycress Company

The Pennycress Company bioengineers and sells pennycress seeds so farmers and biorefineries can increase profits and ecosystem health. They connect the supply chain from farmers to commodity traders who process the seed to be used in numerous products from cooking oil to sustainable aviation fuel. While growing on farmers' fields, pennycress sequesters carbon, increases biodiversity, and protects topsoil.

Climate change is a topic of much debate by governments and industry alike. Views are largely split along political lines in the U.S. Under the current administration, regulations to slow global warming are being supplanted. Nonetheless, many companies across virtually all industries, from airline operators to global service corporations, remain committed to reducing their carbon footprint.

Companies with direct means of production, such as factories, generally have multiple options to reduce their carbon footprint. But what of consulting firms, banks, and technology companies whose carbon footprint isn’t directly tied to their everyday activities? How are emissions generated by these types of corporations and how can they reduce their emissions?

The primary source of emissions for “corporates” is business travel; further, approximately 90% of travel emissions come from air travel. But most corporations do not own airplanes or directly influence the carbon intensity of the fuel that goes in them, leaving them with limited options for achieving their carbon reduction goals.

A leading solution for these firms is to buy scope 3 emissions credits, commonly referred to as SAF certificates or “SAFc.” SAFc is an emerging product that corporations are leveraging to reduce their carbon footprints. For business aviation, the emergence of SAFc offers a rare opportunity to lower their carbon footprints without pushing operating costs through the roof. Innovative business aviation operators see this opportunity and are quickly capitalizing on it.

3 Products In 1

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, comes from non-fossil feedstocks that are converted to fuel through a technology pathway which ultimately has a lower carbon footprint than conventional jet fuel production and use. Examples of these pathways include production of SAF from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal tallow via the well-established Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process, and emerging routes such as volatile fatty acids-to-synthetic paraffinic kerosene (VFA-SPK), Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Power-to-Liquids (PtL). Each of these processes yields a jet fuel with a lower carbon footprint than conventional jet fuel.

Scope 1 emissions are the emissions from the direct activities of a company. For aviation operators, the burning of jet fuel constitutes a scope 1 emission. A business traveler, such as a consultant flying to a customer meeting, riding on an aircraft burning that jet fuel also accrues emissions, but they are classified as scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are based on the indirect activities of a company, such as business travel. When SAF is used instead of conventional jet fuel, the difference in carbon intensities equates to the abatement of scope 1 emissions for the aviation operator and abatement of scope 3 emissions for the traveler. This has value.

The carbon abatement achieved with SAF can be packaged into separate products: scope 1 emissions abatement and scope 3 emissions abatement, or SAFc. These credits can be sold into voluntary markets to “inset,” or lower, the carbon footprint for the buyer. In essence, SAF is 3 products in 1: a physical fuel, a scope 1 emissions credit for aviation operators, and a scope 3 emissions credit for travelers. While the physical fuel is sold at commodity price, the abatement value is sold in voluntary markets for additional value. This additional value helps to offset the increased cost of producing SAF.

A Unique Tool

Global companies are under the microscope for their environmental impact, typically measured in terms of carbon intensity. By purchasing scope 3 emissions credits via SAFc on the voluntary market, corporations can claim the “green benefit” of the abated carbon from using SAF rather than high-carbon intensity jet fuel. This, in turn, reduces their scope 3 emissions and the overall carbon footprint of their business, enabling them to meet their sustainability targets.

With few other options to lower their carbon footprints, many corporations have the desire and the ability to pay the “green premium” that often hinders green product adoption. To date, many global corporations have engaged in SAF transactions to lower their scope 3 emissions, including Deloitte, Microsoft, and JP Morgan Chase, among others. A recent survey by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) found that the average “willingness to pay” by corporations for SAFc is approximately $300/ton of CO2 abated. There is clear market demand for the value this product brings.

A Value For Business Aviation

It is well established that fuel is one of the largest operating expenses for airlines. In countries across the globe, fuel contributes 20-30% of the total cost of operations. Hence, airlines are challenged to accept any increase in fuel prices. Today, SAF is more costly to produce than conventional jet fuel from fossil sources. Options to reduce the net cost of SAF will be most welcome by airlines seeking to lower their carbon footprint.

Recall that a gallon of SAF can be viewed as 3 products in 1. The operator can burn the physical fuel to operate their aircraft, retain the scope 1 credit, and monetize the scope 3 credit to corporate travelers who are showing a strong willingness to pay. Some SAF technologies, including VFA-SPK, are able to offer physical fuel and scope 1 abatement close to cost parity with Jet-A coupled with competitively priced scope 3 abatement.

The aviation operator can then “separate” the scope 3 benefit, via SAFc and sell the certificate to corporate travelers. Doing so effectively brings the operator’s SAF fuel price to near parity with Jet-A. For the business aviation operator, engagement in SAF yields fuel that is sustainable without increasing costs, two concepts rarely found together.

A Win-Win

For business aviation, the purchase of SAF creates the opportunity to reduce carbon footprint without increasing net fuel price. Who knows, as SAFc demand grows, it may serve to reduce net fuel costs.

Business aviation is uniquely placed for the decoupling of physical fuel and sustainability benefit. Operators are concerned with controlling cost and corporate travelers are concerned with carbon footprint. Innovative business aviation companies are recognizing that SAF satisfies both.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f53542_c7e74b0ffb5e4049b51ef8581ea21e25~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f53542_c7e74b0ffb5e4049b51ef8581ea21e25~mv2.webp",N,,2025-05-07 23:56:08.895921

Skyven Technologies

Skyven Technologies works with industrial manufacturers by recovering waste heat to produce clean, emissions-free steam using their Arcturus steam generating heat pump. Skyven’s proven Energy-as-a-Service model allows industrial manufacturers to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs without the upfront capital expenditure.

XTS Energy

XTS is currently developing a project using alcohol-to-jet technology (“ATJ”) to meet the growing demand for clean transport fuels by building, owning and operating the infrastructure to produce 30 million gallons per year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) and Renewable Diesel using ATJ technology with low carbon ethanol as a feedstock.

As SAF is critical to aviation’s net-zero emissions goal by 2050, XTS’s project will help bridge supply gaps while meeting carbon reduction targets in a market projected to demand 120 billion gallons of SAF per year. Strategically positioned to leverage U.S. economic incentives and comply with the strictest regulations in the EU, U.S., and Asia, XTS presents a compelling investment opportunity in clean fuel solutions for sustainable aviation and regulatory compliance.

Terragia Biofuel, Inc.

Terragia is developing innovative biotechnology to convert cellulosic biomass (the parts of plants that have evolved over time to be recalcitrant and hard to break down) into ethanol. Terragia’s novel approach, a combination of better biology and consolidated processing, unlocks that potential, providing a liquid fuel alternative that is not only more sustainable than fossil fuels but cost competitive as well. Integration of Terragia’s technology in corn ethanol plants will increase ethanol yields and enhance coproduct value while improving sustainability metrics.

Celluol

Waste biomass, such as agricultural residues, has unrealized potential to be a critical feedstock in the production of net-zero fuels and chemicals. Current solutions for the conversion of these residues have faced technical challenges due to the difficulty and cost in the crucial step of degrading this biomass into utilizable free sugars. Celluol has engineered a bacterium that can directly degrade and ferment waste biomass into ethanol using a one-step process similar to how we make beer or wine.

This breakthrough directly addresses the challenges encountered by current cellulosic conversion technologies, simplifying the process and making it significantly less expensive.

Celluol’s simpler and cheaper process can be rapidly deployed, starting by co-locating at first-generation ethanol plants that currently use corn or sugarcane and have abundant biomass wastes. By further capturing and converting the CO2 produced during the fermentation process into ethanol, Celluol’s technology has the potential to decrease the amount of land required for sustainable biofuel production by up to three times.

The Pennycress Company

The Pennycress Company bioengineers and sells pennycress seeds so farmers and biorefineries can increase profits and ecosystem health. They connect the supply chain from farmers to commodity traders who process the seed to be used in numerous products from cooking oil to sustainable aviation fuel. While growing on farmers' fields, pennycress sequesters carbon, increases biodiversity, and protects topsoil.

U.S. production of “other biofuels,” the category the U.S. Energy Information Administration uses to capture SAF in its Petroleum Supply Monthly, approximately doubled from December to February.

Investments in SAF have increased, according to EIA, because of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, federal tax credits and state programs and tax credits incentivizing use of the fuel.

In addition to SAF, EIA’s “other biofuels” category includes renewable heating oil, renewable naphtha, renewable propane, renewable gasoline and other emerging biofuels that are in various stages of development and commercialization.

Prior to 2025, renewable naphtha and renewable propane, which are byproducts of renewable diesel production, made up most of the “other biofuels” production and was increasing because of growing renewable diesel production.

SAF made up only a small portion of “other biofuels” production because of limited production capacity.

At the beginning of 2024, U.S. SAF production capacity was only around 2,000 barrels per day, with just two plants capable of producing SAF: World Energy’s plant in Paramount, California, and Montana Renewables’ plant in Great Falls, Montana.

U.S. SAF production capacity increased by about 25,000 barrels per day in late 2024.

Phillips 66 completed its 10,000-barrel-per-day SAF project in Rodeo, California, in the third quarter of 2024, before temporarily halting production in the fourth quarter.

Diamond Green Diesel completed its 15,000-barrel-per-day SAF project in Port Arthur, Texas, in the fourth quarter.

A couple of smaller projects will bring additional SAF production capacity online in 2025.

New Rise Renewables announced it began SAF production at its plant in Reno, Nevada, in February, adding up to 3,000 barrels per day of SAF production.

Par Pacific plans to begin SAF production at its plant in Kapolei, Hawaii, in the second half of the year, adding about 2,000 barrels per day of SAF production capacity.

With SAF production capacity now around 30,000 barrels per day and growing in 2025, SAF will likely drive significant growth in “other biofuels” production and make up most of the fuel in that EIA category.

In January, U.S. production of “other biofuels” reached 33,000 barrels per day, nearly 30 percent more than the previous record high set in September.

Production increased another 30 percent in February to 44,000 barrels per day.

In EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, it forecasts that U.S. production of “other biofuels” will more than double between 2024 and 2025 and increase by about another 20 percent in 2026.

Although EIA does not publish a forecast for each fuel that makes up the category, it expects increased SAF production to drive most of that growth.

Despite strong growth in SAF on a percentage basis, the absolute volumes will remain relatively low, making up less than 2 percent of about 1.7 million barrels per day of U.S. jet fuel consumption in 2025 and about 2 percent in 2026.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_aad2a0d202174beeae582293b683333c~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_925,h_537,al_c,q_85/80995f_aad2a0d202174beeae582293b683333c~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-07 23:56:22.375814

Aaron Karp:

Hello, and thank you for joining us for Window Seat, our Aviation Week Air Transport podcast. My name is Aaron Karp, and I'm a Senior Editor with Routes and Air Transport World.

My guest today really needs no introduction: David Neeleman, the CEO and Founder of Breeze Airways. He has been involved in founding five airlines, starting with Morris Air in 1984, which was eventually bought by Southwest Airlines. He was involved in founding a Canadian carrier, WestJet in the late '90s. And then I think what you're most well known for is JetBlue in the year 2000. You then went on to found Azul Brazilian Airlines in Brazil, and in 2021 founded Breeze Airways, a startup US carrier that already has a network of more than 70 cities and 280 routes. So David, thank you so much for joining us.

David Neeleman:

Sure, great. Thanks for having me on, Aaron.

Aaron Karp:

We'll start with the big picture view. How do you view the US airline market right now in this post-pandemic time? We've moved past the immediate post-pandemic time. How do you view the market right now?

David Neeleman:

I think you could probably sum it up as the haves and the have-nots. COVID just changed some things. I think it was maybe coincidental too, because I think the big airlines, Delta, United, American, you can even put Alaska in that category, they're doing really well. They had a plan. I think over the years they looked at JetBlue and said, ""Wow, it's pretty cool to have TVs on your airplane."" Well, yeah, I mean, giving free wifi seems to make a lot of sense. Let's go with leather seats. Let's add 20, 30 seats on those airplanes, not because we're going to squish people in, but let's go to an Airbus A321. Let's bag the A319s, let's go to the Boeing MAX-9s and if we can get MAX-10s, all the better. And then let's really focus on our hubs, but let's really step up our game and really focus on our credit cards, our frequent flyer miles. And it's been in the works for a long time.

I think about what these big guys were during, and there were more of them obviously before the mergers. Before, when I started JetBlue, they were just not good. And today they're good, they're really good, they've really got their act together and they're doing a really great job. So I think you've got to really distinguish yourself. You’ve got to be a little bit different, you got to do something different. You can't just be flying the same routes, doing the same things.

And on the ULCC side, Spirit and Frontier, and to a lesser degree, Allegiant, thought, well, if we can just put more and more seats in an airplane and we can get bigger and bigger and bigger, there's just no way that anyone can compete with this. And then we can just have the lowest fare, that'll always win, it doesn't really matter. But then those two things collided, and all of a sudden you had incremental seats on the big guys and they said, ""Hey, I've got these 20 or 30 seats cheaper than you do on yours. I don't care how many seats you put on an airplane, and we can match you and create basic economy."" And so there's been a divergence really, since COVID.

And I think obviously there was a lot of money passed out during COVID as well, which certainly would've caused more bankruptcies had that not happened, had not the $57 billion been given out by the US government. So yeah, it's interesting times for sure in the US business. And I talk to Europeans and they say, ""Well, Ryanair's still doing great. Why are these other guys not doing great? Why is it different in the US?"" And I think it has to do with overlap. When you're flying wingtip to wingtip, you're just more susceptible to competition.

Aaron Karp:

And Breeze ultimately is going to have 90 A220-300s in its fleet, and so you're taking a lot of new aircraft. Right now there's a lot of concern about the supply chain and delivery delays for aircraft. How do you see that right now? Are you confident in your deliveries? And more broadly, how do you see how the manufacturers are doing in getting these airplanes out to airlines?

David Neeleman:

Well, it's a challenge. Again, last time I checked we're four years beyond COVID and we still have supply chain issues. It's what happened during that time. But we're getting new deliveries, they're not on schedule, but we're getting them. Maybe two to four to six to eight weeks late, and we see it coming so we can adjust the schedules for that. And obviously the bigger issue is the engines. We do have geared turbofan engines and our tech ops team does a great job of taking care of our engines. We're in a fairly benign environment compared to some of the other environments that planes fly in.

So right now, knock on wood, we're hanging in there with the engines, we're working really close with Pratt, they're being really supportive. And so I think planes keep coming, engines keep going to the shop and coming back. And so, we don't have any parked airplanes like some of the others, but for now we're just out doing our own thing and controlling what we can control.

Aaron Karp:

And do you think the supply chain issues will get better, particularly with the tariff issue now, now a big deal? Do you see improvement coming or is this a problem we're stuck with for a while?

David Neeleman:

Well, the tariff issue is interesting because I was in Washington last week and had some really good meetings back there. And one thing I didn't realize as I got educated from others in the industry, and as I had the ability to tell the story, not only of Breeze but also of the industry, one of the focuses of the administration is trade imbalance. We first saw those tariffs come out and we're like, wait a second, why are we tariffing Vietnam? 45%, 40%? Because they don't have a 40% tariff on our stuff and we learned that it was because of a trade imbalance. It wasn't reciprocal, it was reciprocal in the imbalance. And then we hear a lot about China's six to one trade imbalance with us. Obviously a lot more Chinese stuff coming in than we export to China.

Well, it's just the opposite for aviation. The United States of America is the greatest exporter of aviation-related parts and planes and engines and avionics in the world. We have a 6 to 1 ratio to the rest of the world. We exported $124 billion worth of goods last year to the world and only imported $20 billion. So, I think when that word gets out and if that's really the goal of the administration, and there has been this understanding since 1980, 1979, there was an agreement that aviation was the economic driver of the world. We contribute about 7% of the world GDP. And so you don't want to tax that, because this creates a lot of movement of goods and services and people and business and all that kind of stuff.

So the industry's telling the story and saying look … there could be some really bad consequences for American products and companies, especially Boeing, if there were reciprocal tariffs from the other side. So hopefully, got my fingers crossed, that that gets worked out and aviation, it goes back where it was prior to Liberation Day.

Aaron Karp:

And given that Breeze is taking Airbus aircraft, is this something you're worried about or are your aircraft being actually manufactured in Alabama?

David Neeleman:

Yeah, our planes are manufactured in Alabama. There is potentially some tariffs because their parts come in from other places, but the engines come from the United States, more than 51% content. Our flight deck, all the most expensive parts on the airplane, are done by US companies.

Aaron Karp:

And another issue that has cropped up is air traffic control and some of the shortages of controllers. Do you see an issue now, in terms of the efficiency of the system and being able to fly everywhere you want to fly and on time and just generally the US market and how air traffic control is affecting the efficiency of the airline system?

David Neeleman:

Well, thank goodness. Thank goodness we don't go flying to congested airports and congested airspace. That's part of our business plan, is that we don't go to JFK or LaGuardia or Newark. We go to Islip, we go to White Plains, we go to Stewart. We go to these secondary airports that are outside of this metro area, but we are affected by it. I'm not saying that we aren't, because there is flow control coming from the Jacksonville Center, and it's concerning, and especially since it takes so long to create an air traffic controller. We've read over the weekend about the issues of Newark and one person working in the tower and walkouts and all that kind of stuff.

But I am hopeful, because I have had the opportunity to meet with Secretary Duffy at the Department of Transportation, he's very good and he's very solicitous to the industry. What can he do? He's focused on getting the money together to fix the technology from the air traffic control system, but he's also dealing with the personnel issues. He's been to Oklahoma City, he's upped the wages, the training pay wages. He's including other schools in the training. And so, he's got a plan and we're here to support him as an industry and we're really confident and happy that he's in that position.

Aaron Karp:

And before we get into Breeze specifically, one other issue that's really talked about these days is the environment and whether airlines can grow efficiently and lower their carbon emissions. There's been some concern lately that there's no new aircraft coming online, that sustainable aviation fuel, there's just not enough of it, it's too expensive. Where do you see all that and whether the industry will continue to grow and will be allowed to grow by governments?

David Neeleman:

I don't know about what's going on in Europe, but this whole thing has been a facade for so long, this SAF thing, it's all just fake. It's billions of dollars wasted on fake solutions. It's not a solution at all. It's just window dressing. It's basically politicians trying to feel good about themselves. And industry leaders, particularly in Europe, kind of mimicking and parroting and saying they'll be carbon-neutral by 2050 when none of them will be working at those airlines. It's all just BS. I'm not a climate denier and I obviously think it's something that we have to think about as we make a next step to hydrogen or whatever, or maybe we can do some things at a much smaller scale.

I was at a conference with Willie Walsh, who's head of IATA, in Amsterdam last year, and he said that to convert the whole industry to SAF, it would be $167 billion a year in extra costs, and we only make $20 billion as an industry worldwide. So basically, when he got through saying that and he was sort of pushing it, I just said, ""Well, no one in this room is going to have a job. You might as well shut down aviation because there's no way to pay for that."" And then you’ve got to worry about food supply and making sure people have food to eat. So, it's all just nonsense and I'm happy to see the veneer is just falling off it now and people aren't really talking about it anymore. Not to say that we shouldn't come up with something. Like I said, the next generation, but SAF is not the answer, it is not the answer.

Now, I do believe that as we go more and more electric with cars and gasoline goes away, because diesel is just one cut of the barrel of oil, it's like 30%. So if all the gasoline goes away, we're going to get refineries going out of business and then our fuel will go up in cost if there's no refineries. So, maybe we do something as an industry to help other industries. Maybe I propose a $5 tax per ticket worldwide that would go into a fund that would only go to offset other people who use distillates, power plants … trucks that use diesel. And get rid of everybody else using diesel so we can have it all to ourselves, and I think that'd be a much smarter path.

Aaron Karp:

Let's get into Breeze. You founded Breeze in 2021. What motivated you? Why did you think Breeze was necessary in the market and what led you to found this new airline?

David Neeleman:

We actually started and launched it before COVID, and obviously it took us a while to get going because of COVID, and this has accelerated since then. But before COVID, what we saw was this thing that I started with, where planes were getting bigger and bigger and bigger. You basically had the regional jets that were capped at 74 seats, the A319s, which were very inefficient airplanes because they were shrunk down A320s. And 737-700s and-500s, and all of that was going away. People were going to the 737-800, MAX-8, MAX-9, getting rid of A321s, even moving away from A320s and going to A321s. And it just left this wide open area right in the middle where people were just abandoning.

And I looked at this amazing map that showed, there were 123 airports in the United States that lost at least 25% of their air service over the last 10 years. So I'm like, okay, well let's dig through the database of the DOT … and there was also this migration of people that were leaving the Northeast and were going to smaller cities. Where people usually would go from New York to Miami, or then moved from New York to LA, they [instead] were moving to places like Charleston and they were going to Raleigh and they were going to Greensboro, Spartanburg, South Carolina, and they were going to Huntsville, Alabama. And all of these places, Pensacola, Florida, people were moving and spreading out and finding cheaper real estate. So we really thought that there was a place for a lower-trip cost airplane that was new technology instead of old technology. So using the Airbus A220 with the newest technology and using the E-jets that we started with that were basically stretched versions of the 74-seaters, we got more seats for basically the same price, and then we could do some point-to-point service.

And so today, four years in, we'll have our four-year anniversary of flying, we will be in about 280 city pairs. We're … coming up at 70 cities today. By the end of the month we'll have about 72. We’re the sole carrier on about 87% of our routes, we fly twice a week in some markets, we fly twice a day in other markets, so it just depends on which market it is. But this is really the key for us. We generate, I would say eight or 10 times more traffic than we steal, if we steal any at all. We're really just generating traffic.

I remember I was in Charleston for [a route] announcement and there was a lady that worked at the Charleston Airport and she said, ""My mother lives in New Orleans and I only go visit her once or twice a year, but now, with tears in her eyes she told me this, ""I'm going to go and see her every month because now I can."" It's not just the cost, it's being able to get over there, see her mother and then come back and stay a weekend. And so, it's just taking the friction out of travel by [eliminating] making a connection. And we're finding a lot of people buying second homes between places where we fly down into Fort Myers or Vero Beach or into these other cities where people will go and buy a second home because it's just easier to get back and forth. And so generating all this traffic in these markets and getting people to fly more often or fly when they wouldn't have flown otherwise, is really our business.

Aaron Karp:

And you mentioned that on 87% of your routes, they're noncompetitive. Do you have a concern about the majors coming in and trying to steal some of your traffic and push you out of these markets, or do you think they're essentially going to ignore you?

David Neeleman:

Like I said, we have lower trip costs with the airplane and we have a premium section. So, we're kind of doing the same thing that everyone else is doing, where we have 12 first class seats, we have 45 extra legroom seats, we have wifi. And our plan, we think depending on what airline it is, it's about a 20% to 30% advantage on trip costs. And they can try and come with a regional jet with 74 seats, but the economics aren't that great on that airplane.

I think where the ULCCs have gotten into trouble is that they went right into the heart of [the majors’} business and started really just taking business away that was on an existing route. Where we create most of our traffic, we're not really hurting anyone, we're just generating new traffic. And also, we have this lower trip cost airplane, but if they want to come into a route, we've identified 1,500 routes that we can serve and we're flying 280 of them. And if someone comes into five or 10, we're not building office buildings, we've got mobile assets we can pick up and go anywhere we want to. And that flexibility is really important in this business.

Aaron Karp:

And how about flying internationally? When do you expect that that could occur?

David Neeleman:

We do fly internationally today. We have a charter authority, so we do charters internationally … but we really want to do scheduled service. And so there's a process you go through with the FAA once you get your regular certificate, you get what's called flag status so you can fly international. And so it's revising the manuals and we've submitted all that to the FAA and they're reviewing it. And then once they check off on all that, you do proving flights, you do 50 hours of flying. And once we get that, we'll be certified to fly international, and we're hoping that by this winter we'll be able to add some international destinations.

Aaron Karp:

And what kind of range will you have with the A220 to go international?

David Neeleman:

The plane has about a 3,000-mile range, 3,200 miles, so seven hours of range. So yeah, we can get into South America, all through Central America, if we go from Florida. We can't go too far over the ocean like to Hawaii or anything yet until we get the ETOPS certification. But there's a lot of things we can do from going south and hopefully going west, and even some destinations going east at some point in time.

Aaron Karp:

And you mentioned South America, that's a good segue to talk about Azul. Well, you've had a real success in breaking into the Brazilian market and the South American market. How do you see the South American market right now, in terms of where it stands and how much growth potential there is down there?

David Neeleman:

We believe there's a lot. I mean, Azul is a great story. It's got a little sad chapter in it, and that was COVID. Unlike the US carriers, the Brazilian government did not support [airlines]. It's not a rich government to be able to give billions to industry, they were more worried about feeding their people. So Azul was one of the most profitable airlines in the world prior to COVID, and then came out of COVID with a significant amount of debt. And so all of our competitors, pretty much, LATAM, GOL, Aeromexico, with the exception of Copa, filed for bankruptcy. And so we're in the midst of a restructuring now. The core business, it does very well. It's more profitable than it's ever been, but it's laden with a lot of debt. And so we're restructuring all that and converting that to equity, that's really the goal.

To answer your question directly, there's a lot of growth, especially in Brazil. The amount of people that travel in Brazil compared to even Mexico or Chile or even Colombia is far less, so we think there's a huge opportunity there. And Azul's a little bit like Breeze in a sense, because we patterned Breeze a little bit after Azul. Azul serves 150 cities in Brazil, more than double what our competitors do. We have 1,000 flights a day and a wide-ranging fleet. There's growth opportunity, especially in the developing areas of Brazil and agribusiness and other areas. So, we're really positive on the futures of Brazil and the growth potential there.

Aaron Karp:

And it seems like one thing in South America is there's so many people that haven't flown before or are flying once every two or three years. Do you see that more people will be able to fly and does that drive growth in Latin America?

David Neeleman:

Absolutely, yeah. I mean, the more you can be efficient and offer fares and the more the economies develop and people move into the middle class and they can afford to buy airline tickets, then that's what helps the market growth.

Aaron Karp:

And do you see any potential tie up between Breeze and Azul, in terms of connecting passengers?

David Neeleman:

Absolutely, yeah. Breeze is growing our Orlando operation world now, something with Azul in the not too distant future where people can come from all the cities we serve from Orlando and make a pretty good connection and head off to Brazil. Azul serves four cities, I think, four cities from Orlando into Brazil. So yeah, with the cities we serve, with the 20 or so cities, combining with Brazil, there'll be lots of options for people to go visit Brazil or go visit family if they're from there.

Aaron Karp:

Well, we really appreciate your time. One final question. How is Breeze doing in terms of finances, and is there any thought of taking it public?

David Neeleman:

Well, every airline talks about going public. And I think the really good thing about Breeze, when you're growing quickly, and we grew about 50% this year, the markets that you fly in your first six months, you always lose money because you have no repeat business, and nobody knows who you are. They got to come back and fly again and layer on top of it, and that's the maturity of the market. So as we get more and more mature markets, then obviously we move to profitability. So we didn't actually make money in the fourth quarter last year. The first quarter is always not the best quarter because of January, but we're doing good in the second quarter. Still hoping, knock on wood, to make a little money in the second quarter. And then if we can do that, then we got a really good shot of making money for the year. So that's really the key for us, is getting the profitability and even in this really tough environment and people struggling, it could always be better but we feel very fortunate to be in a position we're at.

by Jim Giles (Trellis) Environmental group and aviation industry disagree on how to assess the full climate impact of fuel made from corn and soybeans. -- Key Takeaways: Scaling the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from corn and soybeans is the focus of U.S. plans to decarbonize aviation, but researchers at the World Resources Institute are urging a rethink.

The U.S. produces around just 1 percent of the quantity of SAF needed to hit a government target of 3 billion gallons of domestic production by 2030, according to the Department of Energy.

SAF made from corn and soybean is a core part of plans to scale.

But when land-use change is considered, corn and soybean-based SAF creates more emissions than fossil jet fuel, the WRI concluded in a report released last week.

The crops “are not a viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation,” said Audrey Denvir, a WRI research associate and author on the report.

Industry figures questioned key details of the analysis.

“Context is everything,” said Adam Klauber, who oversees sustainability and digital supply chains at World Energy, a SAF producer. Klauber argued that the WRI analysis relied on global averages for the impacts of biofuel crops and overlooked the higher performance of crops grown in the U.S.

...

World Resources Institute urges U.S. policymakers and businesses to exclude corn and soybean fuels from plans to decarbonize aviation.

Industry places both sources at the heart of expansion of sustainable aviation fuel use.

State and federal regulators will likely be the key arbiters that shape company decisions.

...

Almost all SAF is currently produced from used cooking oil and other inedible biomass, and is broadly agreed to lead to real carbon savings when it displaces fossil jet fuel. But current production is tiny: The U.S. produces around 1 percent of the quantity needed to hit a government target of 3 billion gallons of domestic production by 2030, according to a 2024 Department of Energy report.

...

“Purpose-grown crops could constitute the majority of the supply within six to 10 years,” estimated Adam Klauber, who oversees sustainability and digital supply chains at World Energy, an SAF producer.

To qualify as SAF, fuels produced from these crops need to emit no more than 50 percent of the emissions from fossil jet fuel.

...

In a report released last week on how biomass can be used to decarbonize the U.S. economy, the researchers used a metric called “carbon opportunity cost” to calculate spillover impacts of fuel crops. As global demand for food grows, dedicating land for this purpose leads to forests and other native ecosystems being converted to agriculture, releasing additional emissions in the process.

...

Industry figures questioned key details of the analysis. Klauber argued that relying on global averages for the impacts of biofuel crops overlooks the higher performance of crops grown in the U.S. “Context is everything,” he said. In the case of soy production, for example, Klauber said the researchers used a carbon intensity figure that was several times higher than the one other academic and environmental organizations use.

Specific farming practices are also critical, he added. For example, biofuels can be grown either alongside and simultaneously with food crops, or during the shoulder season on either side of them. “That is broadly accepted as a sustainable practice, but it’s not yet at commercial scale,” said Klauber. “We’re working to increase that, because that really will be a way to increase the productivity of land without impacting food.”",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-05-07 17:57:04.859357

Google parent Alphabet announced a 24/7 CFE ambition in 2020, aiming to run its entire business on carbon-free energy by 2030. Operating on 24/7 CFE means matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates. Google said that PPAs signed in recent years have helped support over 1 gigawatt of clean energy generation capacity in the Netherlands. That includes a series of Google PPAs signed in 2024 for more than 700 MW of clean energy.

That has been, I think, the hallmark of what has driven so much of American energy [innovation] over the years.” Gordon spoke to about 350 attendees of the Next Frontier Energy Summit, an annual event organized by the Wyoming Energy Authority, at the University of Wyoming on Tuesday.
The two-day conference featured speakers representing utility giant PacifiCorp, nuclear energy manufacturer BWXT Advanced Technologies, and leaders in the oil and gas and uranium mining industries.
“It is elevating education and job training for Wyoming, as well as a future U.S. workforce,” Crane said.
However, Crane noted, PacifiCorp isn’t giving up on Wyoming coal.","LARAMIE—Wyoming is on the cusp of a nationwide nuclear power resurgence with the backing of a presidential administration that also promises to overhaul federal regulations to ensure the state’s coal, oil and natural gas are positioned to meet booming electrical demand while lowering carbon emissions, Gov. Mark Gordon told an audience of energy enthusiasts.

In Wyoming, he said, “We talk about what’s practical, what’s good and what can we accomplish if we really put our minds to it. That has been, I think, the hallmark of what has driven so much of American energy [innovation] over the years.”

Gordon spoke to about 350 attendees of the Next Frontier Energy Summit, an annual event organized by the Wyoming Energy Authority, at the University of Wyoming on Tuesday. The two-day conference featured speakers representing utility giant PacifiCorp, nuclear energy manufacturer BWXT Advanced Technologies, and leaders in the oil and gas and uranium mining industries. The governor suggested that, after decades of visionary work by state leaders to create regulatory pathways and boost investor confidence to scrub carbon from fossil fuels, markets and national policies are finally beginning to align with Wyoming’s attitude to “find a way forward.”

In fact, Gordon said, he’s recently modified his long-touted mantra of an “all-of-the-above” energy and environmental strategy: “Now, we need to talk about the best of all-of-the-above.”

“We have opportunities to innovate,” he said, “to make mistakes, to correct from those mistakes and to really drive through to a future that is efficient, that is environmentally sound, that has a mix in the energy portfolio — everything from renewables in the appropriate place to fossil [fuels] done right to nuclear done right.”

Faith in Wyoming nuclear, natural gas and coal

As evidence of Wyoming leading on the next generation of energy, PacifiCorp CEO Cindy Crane noted the utility’s tentative agreement to take on TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear power plant under construction near Kemmerer. Not only will Natrium — among the first “advanced small modular reactors” in development in the nation — help the six-state utility secure reliable, low-carbon electricity, it fits within PacifiCorp’s penchant for proven technologies over more speculative endeavors and political favor.

“We don’t shift our strategy based on who’s in the White House,” Crane said. “We don’t manage our business on politics. We manage our business for our customers, first and foremost, and for our states and their energy policies, not the federal government’s policies.”

A big part of what makes advanced nuclear attractive to PacifiCorp, according to Crane, is the partnerships between the utility, TerraPower, the state, federal agencies and the University of Wyoming to build a domestic nuclear energy supply chain and workforce to back it up.

“It is elevating education and job training for Wyoming, as well as a future U.S. workforce,” Crane said. “It is building a transition for our existing and experienced workforce, and it is positioning Wyoming to continue and grow its electrification and supply of power throughout the western U.S.”

After burning more than $5 billion worth of Wyoming coal at its power plants over the decades, PacifiCorp is making the shift — although critics say too slowly — to not only renewables backed by energy storage, according to Crane but to nuclear and natural gas.

In fact, PacifiCorp has converted two of four coal-burning units at its Jim Bridger power plant outside Rock Springs to natural gas, and will convert the final two coal-burning units at the Naughton power plant near Kemmerer to natural gas in 2026. However, Crane noted, PacifiCorp isn’t giving up on Wyoming coal. The company is still evaluating whether it makes sense to retrofit coal units at its Jim Bridger and Dave Johnston power plants with carbon capture, use and sequestration technologies.

Despite a steep price tag for such retrofits, if they move forward — estimated at over $1 billion — the efforts would create thousands of construction jobs and sustain hundreds of existing jobs in the state, Crane said.

“This is truly an example of planting the seeds for long-term jobs and economic prosperity in the state,” she said.

Gordon noted that such efforts to push new commercial-scale technologies are expensive, including for customers, but suggested it is worth the investment.

“The technologies that have come along over the last couple of years are remarkable,” Gordon said. “Yes, some of them are very expensive. First-generation stuff generally is. But we’ve all had the benefit of lessons of time to develop the technologies and see what can be done better.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mark-gordon-laramie-energy-conf-may-6-2025-dbleizeffer1746638790.jpeg?h=af4ce5f3&itok=Tgaf52Ls,N,,2025-05-07 20:57:00.287861

The United Investment

This investment by United Airlines Ventures is not an unpredictable one, as it comes from their designated Sustainable Flight Fund, allied with contributions from partners such as GE Aerospace, Embraer, Google, and several airlines.

The fund’s sole purpose is to invest and support companies focusing on the production, research and technological advancements needed to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and more importantly, scale it for the industry as a whole.

United have set clear commitments and goals to help the aviation industry go green. Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, said:

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels. Twelve has differentiated themselves through the capital they have raised and the SAF contracts they have secured, providing them with the flexibility to commercialize their technology and grow their operations expediently.”

Why Twelve?

This new investment by United, follows an impressive period of growth and investment for Twelve. Twelve’s $83 million Series C funding round and project financing will see them now build their first SAF production facility which, once production begins this year, will produce up to 50,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Nicholas Flanders, Twelve’s co-founder and CEO, highlighted the partnership’s significance:

“United’s investment accelerates our transition from innovation to implementation. With AirPlant One launching soon, we’re creating a scalable pathway to carbon-neutral aviation that meets both operational and environmental goals.”

This exciting collaboration underscores United’s commitment to creating sustainability in the aviation industry and an investment in Twelve’s mission of decarbonisation could go a long way to change the state of the aviation fuel industry for the better.

A lack of policy for sustainable aviation fuel has created some industry challenges.

David Cobb with Clean Fuels Alliance America says SAF production is taking shape.

“It’s underway, but it’s very small,” he says. “Once we get policies right, and I think we will eventually, that will help to get things going.”

He tells Brownfield the Renewable Volume Obligations from 2023 has resulted in industry setbacks.

“The levels that they set were way below what our industry could do,” he says. “Certainly it has created some challenges. We have some members that have gone out of business, others are idled. The damage is done. The one good thing one is they have actually hard data to back up the assertion that we need to get those volumes up.”

Cobb says the organization is expecting a final decision from the EPA by the end of the month.

Commercial Engines

Our engines power the widebody aircraft that underpin international trade and travel, ensuring that the world remains within reach for everyone.

Overview

Innovation is in our DNA

In a world that increasingly thrives on connectivity, the need to bridge distances—both for people and products—has never been greater.

Long-haul travel is on the rise after the pandemic. This is thanks to several long-term trends: a growing middle class in developing countries, increased need for connection around the world, and products from all over the globe that need to be transported to long-distance markets quickly.

GE Aerospace’s widebody engines – CF6, GEnx, GE90, and GE9X - represent the pinnacle of aviation technology.

Translating into lower operating costs for airlines, reduced environmental impact, and an overall enhanced passenger experience.

Powering flight in the most extreme conditions and across the longest distances, the durability and reliability of our engines, and the unmatched breadth and flexibility of our maintenance services have given GE Aerospace a market leading position: 57% of all widebody aircraft departures are powered by a GE Aerospace engine.

Lawmakers are considering a broad expansion of tax credits for producers of the fuels, in hope of positioning Minnesota as a leading manufacturer.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency recently awarded a grant to the University of Minnesota to study a new oil-producing field crop that holds promise as a chief component of the fuel.

And last fall, a fuel company announced a $5 billion investment in a production facility in Moorhead that’s expected to go online in 2030.

Like other types of lower-carbon fuels, including corn ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel has attracted its share of critics concerned about slapping a “green” label on products and practices that continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as well as farm pollutants into the ground and water.

But from an environmental perspective, air travel is a different, much dirtier beast than vehicle transit. It’s responsible for about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions. And the opportunity to shrink the carbon footprint of the airline industry has drawn support even from environmental groups that have been critical of the push for corn ethanol.

A comprehensive switch from traditional jet fuel to sustainable fuels could reduce total air transit emissions by 70% or more.

“Aviation is really hard to decarbonize,” said Trevor Russell, water program director of the Friends of the Mississippi River. “The best first thing we can do is bend the carbon intensity curve of the fuels we are currently using.”

The problem with ethanol

Ethanol derived from corn and other types of biomass has been promoted as a greener alternative to traditional fossil fuels, and over the past several decades state and federal lawmakers have enacted subsidies to support the farmers who grow the crops as well as the fuel companies mixing and refining the final product.

While the resulting fuel is less carbon-intensive than fossil gasoline, many researchers have argued that when you factor in the increased agricultural land use as well as the processing costs, it may actually produce even more carbon dioxide in the long run.

As a result, many advocates believe that it’s better to encourage a shift to fully-electric cars than to promote half-measures like ethanol.

The situation in aviation is different, however. Batteries are heavy, meaning there’s no realistic path to fully electric flight in the near term, especially not on longer routes. And air travel is incredibly carbon intensive, meaning that even modest changes to efficiency would yield major carbon benefits.

A half-measure like less carbon-intensive fuel, in other words, might be the best near-term option for the industry.

A better jet fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel boosters in Minnesota are particularly excited about using winter cover crops, like camelina and pennycress, as sources of biofuel. Planting them as cover crops on existing fields doesn’t require tilling additional land and would provide farmers with an additional revenue stream that doesn’t interrupt their regular crop rotations.

“They can share the same acres — they grow in the fall and are harvested in the spring,” Russell said. “You get all of the environmental benefits of cover crops, but producers can actually harvest and sell that cover crop as a sustainable aviation feedstock.”

Preliminary research suggests that camelina-based jet fuel could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75%. But whether those gains could fully scale up to an industry-wide solution remains an open question. Hence, the need for tax credits.

In 2023, lawmakers passed a credit of $1.50 per gallon for producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel. In his 2025 budget, Gov. Tim Walz called for allocation of an additional $20 million toward the credits over the next decade. Lawmakers are currently negotiating final numbers in the ongoing budget discussions.

While support for sustainable aviation fuel is generally bipartisan, not everyone at the Capitol is sold on it. Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul, said “the effort to expand tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel is greenwashing an existing production system that has serious environmental and community impacts.”

He added that “we should be prioritizing tax breaks for people, like renters and first time homebuyers, rather than corporations producing sustainable aviation fuel, which isn’t actually sustainable.”

Many skeptics of sustainable aviation fuel believe that boosters’ emission reduction estimates aren’t accurate, and that policymakers should emphasize alternative transit options like high-speed rail.

Advocates for the fuel, including Friends of the Mississippi River, the Nature Conservancy and Fresh Energy, have published a set of what they call “guiding principles” to ensure that any new fuels live up to their green promises. Those guidelines call for policies to measure lifecycle emissions properly; ensure no new cropland gets created; minimize impacts on water and air quality; and position winter cover crops like camelina, rather than corn or other sources of biomass, as the preferred feedstocks.

“There are some concerns with over-relying on summer annual or traditional biofuel feedstocks,” Russell said. “Those crops would be lower carbon but would not meet anyone’s definition of sustainable.”

Minnesota’s first camelina crops were planted in 2021, and producers plan to scale up to about 5,000 acres this year, according to the MPCA.

Advocates hope to push production up to 1 million acres by 2035.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2171429907-2048x1357.jpg,N,,2025-05-07 13:57:06.180595

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Chief Executive Officer

Budapest Airport

Chris Dinsdale has worked at Budapest Airport since 2015, originally as CFO until March 2021, where he was nominated for the position as CEO. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dinsdale, as CFO of the airport at the time, fought relentlessly to make sure that the company survived the crisis and worked with great commitment to secure the funding of the airport. For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport. This will also mean that we come out stronger of the pandemic and have a clear focus. Dinsdale is an inspiring true leader who helped us all to cope with the very difficult times of the pandemic and I am convinced that he truly deserves this award.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2510038881.jpg,N,,2025-05-07 13:57:09.299880

Policies, regulations and initiatives have been put in place to provide encouragement and impetus to make the energy transition a reality. At the same time, technology innovators have developed various state-of-the-art solutions to address challenges across all stages of the energy transition value chain.

The path to net zero involves a combination of short-term and long-term initiatives, such as improving energy efficiency; adopting renewable energy sources; and electrification, among others. One of the most impactful initiatives to date is the shift toward sustainable or renewable fuels.

Hydrogen opportunity

Hydrogen, being a carbon neutral molecule, produces zero emissions when burned or used as fuel. When produced using fossil fuel free process, green hydrogen, a compelling option in the push to achieve net-zero emissions.

The direct use of hydrogen has matured in some sectors while several other sectors are still under development.

Currently, these sectors are considered challenging for decarbonisation through direct use of hydrogen due to various operational and safety aspects. Hard-to-abate sectors, such as the maritime sector, can achieve decarbonisation through hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia or methanol, while the aviation sector can benefit from sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for its decarbonisation efforts. However, due to hydrogen’s extremely low molecular weight, handling it safely can be challenging – especially in terms of transportation and storage.

The industry has explored several options for low-risk transport, with converting the gas into a liquid found to improve its ability to be transported, especially across border or over long distances. Cryogenic liquefaction, carriers such as ammonia, or utilisation of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), are proving attractive. Carriers are then converted back into hydrogen for direct use through specific technologies. However, significant energy is lost during this conversion process from hydrogen carriers back to hydrogen, negatively impacting the economics.

Economics

The production of hydrogen and its derivatives is facing significant economic challenges, and as the economic viability of producing hydrogen derivatives depends on the cost-effective production of hydrogen, derivative production facilities are complex and capex intensive. Overall facility optimisation is crucial for economical production alongside other key drivers, such as supply chain optimisation.

A typical hydrogen and derivatives production plant is shown in Figure-1.

Production challenges

The following challenges and constraints should be addressed when harnessing renewable power through electrolysis technology to produce green hydrogen and its derivatives:

Identifying the optimum capacity utilisation factor (CUF) and addressing the intermittency of renewable power.

The CUF for solar or wind is fixed for a given location. However, for a combined solar and wind facility, achieving a satisfactory CUF requires identifying the optimal mix. It is important to note that these facilities are highly capex intensive.

Energy storage is essential to address the renewable energy production intermittency, therefore identifying optimal capacity is crucial. The storage requirement is often large and represents another capex intensive element. While costs have reduced significantly in recent years, energy storage still contributes heavily to overall capex and production costs.

Identifying the optimum CUF of the electrolyser. The CUF of the electrolyser depends on the upstream and downstream facilities, as well as the overall economics of the integrated facility. Therefore, identification of CUF is complex and requires thorough investigation.

Identifying the optimum capacity of a hydrogen derivative production plant. Although hydrogen derivative production facilities are not capital intensive, overcapacity in such facilities directly leads to overcapacity in front-end systems, such as electrolysers, power and hydrogen storage, and other feedstock units such as nitrogen or carbon-dioxide (CO2) capture plants, and balance of plant (BOP) systems. This in turn, significantly increases the overall capex meaning identifying the optimum CUF of hydrogen derivative plants is crucial.

Optimisation and integration of BOP systems. The BOP system contributes significantly to the overall capex, therefore optimisation and further enhancements through integration become crucial for reducing capex and improving production economics.

All the above factors influence the economics of production greatly. Additionally, other technical challenges also persist which further impact the overall production economics:

Integration strategy of electron-to-molecule production facilities.

Managing the intermittency of renewable power across the entire facility.

Managing the capability boundaries and limitations of each unit, such as the electrolyser, hydrogen storage, hydrogen derivative plant, nitrogen generation plant or CO2 capture plant, and BOP systems.

The dynamic capability of technologies and their susceptibility to fatigue, meaning design and integration of the system respecting fatigue cycle is crucial for optimisation. This aspect may vary from one technology licensor to another.

Balancing the production eco system

The operational strategy of an integrated process facility – starting from the electron and progressing to the molecule – will facilitate optimisation. The concept of plant design, integration and optimisation should be practicable and implementable to ensure this reflects how the overall plant is designed to be operated and controlled, with each unit of the integrated complex having its own operating boundaries. The integration of every unit must respect the individual capabilities and limitations.

There is an opportunity to incorporate innovation into optimisation to make the business case more attractive and economically favourable. An integrated dynamic model with sufficient capability and flexibility can effectively facilitate various optimisation strategies for the integrated plant, from the electron to the molecule.

Typically, derivative production plants are a catalytic conversion process. The processes involved in molecule production normally operate under high temperature and high-pressure conditions. The overall technology is built on multiple units of operations and processes with limited operational flexibility, particularly when addressing intermittency. Therefore, understanding their capabilities and limitations is essential for effective integration with upstream processes. Expanding these capability boundaries through innovation presents the most sensible approach to achieving further optimisation.

Configuring the process: integrated dynamic model

Typically, the following key units are involved in a hydrogen derivative production plant. An ammonia production facility is considered here as an example, however the same principles can be applied to e-methanol, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants as well.

Typical key units

• Renewable facility

• Energy storage system

• Hydrogen production using electrolysis technology

• Hydrogen storage and compressor

• Ammonia production facility (ammonia loop)

• Nitrogen generation unit to supply ammonia production

Worked example: ammonia

The operations of these units can be envisioned under various options for the following operating modes, as detailed in table 1:

Operating mode: Option-1

Operating mode: Option-2

Operating mode: Option-3

Hydrogen production Dynamic Stable Staged Hydrogen derivative production (ammonia) Dynamic Stable Staged Hydrogen storage Dynamic Dynamic

A visual representation of the above combinations is presented in Figure 2, below:

Multiple combinations of integrated operating scenarios are possible; three straight options are shown in the table, which are:

Option 1: Complete dynamic operations of all the units, which facilitates minimal storage requirements

Option 2: Complete stable operations of all the units, except renewable power, this scenario requires maximum storage capacity

Option 3: Staged operation of major units, except renewable power and hydrogen storage

Combining these options across all the units results in numerous possible scenarios. An integrated approach along with insights of all units across the value chain will identify the most practical solution. Some combinations can be eliminated qualitatively, after which quantitative evaluations are necessary to determine the optimal solution.

Optimisation objective

A particular project may encompass various optimisation objectives, such as:

Best combination of solar and wind energy generation

Targeted production of hydrogen or its derivatives

Minimum hydrogen storage

Minimum power/energy storage

Minimum Capex of the overall facility

Minimum levelised cost of energy/hydrogen/hydrogen derivatives

One targeted objective should be prioritised to obtain a unique solution from all possible scenarios. However, a quantitative analysis can be carried out which combines multiple objectives and illustrates the optimal solution.

For instance, objective (b) can be grouped together with (a), (c), and (d), with one objective fixed and the other elements treated as variables. To understand the sensitivity of each objective, separate scenarios should be modelled with comparisons drawn that identify the optimal approach.

Modelling approach

In the integrated dynamic model, the typical key units (as listed above) are included due to their significant economic contribution to the overall capex and, consequently, the production cost.

The aim is to develop a solution for an integrated production facility that accounts for all the challenges and constraints, such as technology, the capability boundaries of each unit, capital costs, product capacity and desired product specifications.

The integrated dynamic model has the capability to review production scenarios, perform sensitivity analysis, and help in identifying optimal solutions that can be practically implemented.

Insights that deliver confidence

The valuable exercise of integrated dynamic modelling is performed to identify the unique and implementable solution while satisfying the optimisation objective. The output of the model will identify the following:

Configuration of the integrated facility,

High-level operation and control strategy of the integrated facility,

Possible innovation opportunities in the process configuration and integration

Optimum capacity of units within the integrated facility,

The final output of objective functions, such as levelised cost, and Capex

Understanding the sensitivity of each major unit in relation to the objective function.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks.
Through Wheels Up’s program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.
Commitment to Sustainability With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint.
Jill Greer, Wheels Up’s executive vice-president, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented: “We are delighted to launch our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.","Wheels Up Experience Inc. has announced the launch of its new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.

Now, Wheels Up charter customers who opt into this initiative are able to seamlessly book a private jet or group charter flight and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Wheels Up will partner with Delta Air Lines to purchase SAF, ultimately allowing private fliers to participate regardless of their flight operator or departure airport.

What is SAF?

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, derived from more sustainable feedstocks.

SAF is developed through advanced processes that significantly reduce its carbon footprint over the fuel’s lifecycle, as compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

SAF is significant in its drop-in capability, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without modification.

By using SAF in this immediate and practical way, airlines can achieve up to an 80 percent reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.

How does this SAF Program work?

While SAF is expected to play a critical role in decarbonizing aviation, it remains scarce today – in 2024, it only accounted for 0.3 percent of global jet fuel production, and it has very limited availability.

In this context, it is impractical to ensure that every customer wishing to ‘fly on SAF’ has physical SAF at their airport, much less loaded into their specific flights.

Through Wheels Up’s program, charter customers determine the amount of SAF they wish to support, and Wheels Up coordinates with Delta to direct customer contributions through the Delta SAF Program.

By integrating SAF into Wheels Up’s charter infrastructure, Wheels Up and its customers have the opportunity to help increase the demand for SAF.

Such market frameworks are anticipated to play a critical role in scaling SAF production and use in the coming years.

To support this initiative, Wheels Up has partnered with Chooose, a leading software platform specializing in lower-carbon aviation solutions.

Commitment to Sustainability

With the launch of this SAF program, Wheels Up is taking a proactive step towards helping to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint.

This introduction empowers customers to make more sustainable travel choices and contribute towards decarbonizing aviation by supporting SAF.

Jill Greer, Wheels Up’s executive vice-president, Investor Relations and Sustainability, commented:

“We are delighted to launch our sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program. As demand for ESG-conscious travel options grows, this initiative allows our customers to take meaningful steps toward reducing their carbon footprint, while reinforcing Wheels Up’s commitment to sustainable aviation.”

Charlotte Lollar, director of sustainable aviation fuel at Delta Air Lines, added:

“We are pleased to collaborate with Wheels Up to provide access to Delta’s SAF supply. Through this new partnership, we’re able to offer charter customers a traceable and scalable way to contribute to reducing aviation emissions—even when traveling in locations where SAF is not readily available. We are excited to continue to propel the industry forward toward more sustainable aviation solutions.”

This investment by United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund follows Twelve’s $83 million Series C funding round and project financing for its first SAF production facility, AirPlant One, located in Moses Lake, Washington.

The facility is expected to begin production this year and plans to produce 50,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Last year, Twelve secured a SAF purchase agreement with a large European airline company.

Under the 14-year contract, Twelve will supply 260 million gallons of SAF to support five airline brands.

The sustainable aviation fuel Twelve plans to produce once its plant becomes operational, is expected to be a lower-carbon alternative fuel with the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90%.

“Scaling the SAF industry is the major hurdle air travel needs to clear in order to increase the supply and reduce the price of lower carbon fuels,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures.

“United’s Sustainable Flight Fund’s investment reinforces our momentum at a pivotal moment as we move from innovation to implementation,” said Nicholas Flanders, co-founder & CEO of Twelve.

Fuels derived from petroleum have long been the cornerstone of the transportation sector providing a reliable energy source for more than a century. However, increasing global concerns over climate change, air quality, and environmental degradation have intensified the need for clean and sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. (1,2) In this context, synthetic fuels─commonly referred to as e-fuels─are gaining prominence as they are produced through the utilization of captured CO2 and green hydrogen. This innovative approach not only contributes to carbon neutrality but also aligns with global efforts to mitigate climate change. (3,4)

One of the main advantages of e-fuels is their compatibility with existing infrastructure and internal combustion (IC) engines, which allows them to potentially replace fossil-fuels without significant modifications. This characteristic positions e-fuels as a practical solution for transitioning away from conventional petroleum-based fuels. However, it is important to note that the physicochemical properties of synthetic fuels can differ significantly from those of traditional petroleum-derived fuels. (4,5) These disparities necessitate the incorporation of specific additives to ensure that synthetic fuels meet stringent engine performance and emission standards.

Fuel additives play a crucial role in optimizing combustion processes, enhancing fuel stability, preventing deposits, and reducing harmful emissions. (6,7) They serve various functions, acting as catalysts for combustion, lubricity improvers, corrosion inhibitors, and boosters of octane or cetane levels (Table 1). (8−13) Furthermore, it is essential to utilize renewable-source-based synthetic (green) fuel additives to achieve an overall reduction in the carbon footprint associated with these fuels. (9,10) As the demand for low-carbon transportation fuels continues to grow, synthetic fuel additives are likely to become an increasingly important component of the sustainable energy basket.

Recent advancements in sustainable fuel additives underscore their relevance in addressing current energy transition challenges. Innovative technologies such as Power-to-X (PTX) are revolutionizing fuel production by converting excess renewable energy into synthetic fuels. This process not only facilitates the integration of intermittent renewable resources into the energy system but also provides a pathway for reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. PTX technologies enable the conversion of renewable electricity into hydrogen via electrolysis, which can then be combined with CO2 captured from industrial processes or directly from the atmosphere to produce various hydrocarbons. This not only helps in achieving carbon neutrality but also addresses energy storage challenges associated with renewable energy sources.

Additionally, biofuels derived from biomass are emerging as viable alternatives that not only lower greenhouse gas emissions but also enhance energy security by utilizing locally available resources. Recent studies have demonstrated that integrating biobased additives can significantly improve combustion efficiency and reduce emissions in various engine types. For example, research has shown that incorporating fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) can enhance fuel properties while mitigating particulate matter emissions in diesel engines. (14−16)

The incorporation of environmentally friendly additives is critical for ensuring that synthetic fuels meet established quality and performance standards while adhering to stringent environmental regulations. Recent findings indicate that biobased additives can effectively improve fuel stability and performance while minimizing negative environmental impacts. Moreover, ongoing research is exploring novel additive formulations derived from agricultural residues and waste materials, which could further enhance sustainability in fuel production. (17−20) However, their widespread adoption faces significant challenges including high production costs, limited infrastructure, and the need for technological advancements. The economic viability of alternative fuels is often hampered by high production costs. Second-generation biofuels, derived from nonfood feedstocks such as agricultural residues and waste, face challenges due to complex processing techniques. For instance, enzymatic hydrolysis, which is required to convert lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars is energy-intensive and expensive making these fuels less competitive against fossil fuels. (21) Similarly, hydrogen production can be costly particularly when derived from the electrolysis of water by using renewable energy sources. The initial investment in electrolyzers and associated infrastructure can be substantial leading to higher overall costs for hydrogen fuel compared to conventional fuels. (22−25)

Additionally, the logistics of collecting and transporting biomass feedstocks contribute significantly to high costs. The need for specialized equipment and transportation for agricultural residues can make biofuel production economically unfeasible in certain regions. (26−28) Furthermore, producing synthetic fuels from captured CO2 and renewable energy (power-to-liquid technology) involves high capital expenditures and operational costs. These processes are still in their infancy and require further technological advancements to reduce cost effectively. (21,29−31)

The widespread adoption of alternative fuels is also hindered by a limited infrastructure. In many regions, the availability of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations is inadequate. For instance in India, existing CNG stations are concentrated in few states with demand significantly outpacing supply nearly three times higher than the available stations. (32) The lack of blending facilities for biofuels further limits their availability in the market as many gasoline stations are not equipped to handle biofuel blends, restricting consumer access and acceptance of these fuels. (21) Moreover, the infrastructure required for hydrogen storage and distribution is still underdeveloped. High costs associated with building hydrogen refuelling stations deter investment in this area limiting the market penetration of hydrogen as a fuel. (33−36) As e-fuels gain traction, the need for compatible refueling infrastructure becomes critical. Nevertheless, the current network of refueling stations may not support the anticipated demand for vehicles powered by these alternative fuels. (37−40)

Technological limitations further impede the progress of alternative fuels. Current conversion technologies for producing biofuels from biomass are often inefficient and require further development to enhance the yield and reduce costs. For example, traditional fermentation processes may not effectively utilize all available sugars in biomass feedstocks. (21,26−28) While algal biofuels are touted as a sustainable alternative significant technological advancements are needed to improve cultivation methods and extraction processes to make them commercially viable. (41−43)

Additionally, many existing vehicle engines are not optimized for alternative fuels necessitating significant modifications or the development of new engine technologies that can efficiently use these fuels without compromising performance. (44,45) Finally, there is a need for comprehensive lifecycle assessments to better understand the environmental impacts of various alternative fuels. Current methodologies may not fully account for emissions associated with production processes which could undermine their sustainability claims. (46−48)

To overcome these economic hurdles and enhance sustainable advanced technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology hold significant potential for revolutionizing biofuel production. Biotechnology for instance, offers pathways to optimize biofuel production through the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). (49) For example, researchers have engineered yeast strains to enhance ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, a low-cost and abundant feedstock, thereby reducing production costs. (50,51) Nanotechnology can significantly improve catalysis and separation processes, critical steps in biofuel production. For instance, the use of nanoscale catalysts can enhance the efficiency of transesterification in biodiesel production, reducing reaction times and improving product yields. (52,53) Moreover, nanomaterials offer the potential for developing more efficient membranes for biofuel separation and purification, leading to lower energy consumption and reduced environmental impact. (54−56) The development of these and other effective technologies is crucial to boost productivity, reduce environmental impact, and meet the growing demand for biofuels.

Achieving large-scale deployment of sustainable fuels and their additives by 2050 will require not only technological breakthroughs but also new regulatory frameworks that ensure cost-effective production methods. For example, specific alternative fuels, such as synthetic natural gas (SNG), methanol, and ammonia, present unique challenges and benefits. While these fuels can reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels they also raise safety concerns and require careful management of their environmental impacts. (57)

It is essential to acknowledge that while biofuels can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions they may also lead to other environmental issues such as acidification, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss if not managed sustainably. (58,59) Additionally, even nonrenewable alternative fuels still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions throughout their lifecycle. The role of alternative fuels and their additives in logistics─across air, land, and sea─also presents commercial, environmental, and operational challenges. For instance, the integration of alternative fuels into existing transportation systems requires addressing infrastructure gaps and ensuring compatibility with current vehicles. Potential solutions include developing hybrid systems that utilize both conventional and alternative fuels to ease the transition. The transition to these fuels and additives necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their potential benefits and the hurdles that must be overcome. This article proposes potential green additives for synthetic and biofuels, which upon meeting the required fuel properties and performance criteria can be considered for use as effective and sustainable fuel additives thereby contributing to the urgent need for cleaner transportation fuels and aligning with global imperatives to achieve net-zero emissions targets.

1.1. Exploring Sustainable Fuel Additives

Sustainable fuel additives derived from renewable resources are crucial in the transportation sector offering environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional fuels. For example, Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) improve combustion efficiency and decrease particulate matter emissions, (60,61) while plant-based antioxidants enhance fuel stability. (62,63) Sustainable fuel additives encompass a diverse range of compounds each tailored to specific functions that improve fuel properties and engine performance Table 1 outlines these additives and their purposes.

Sustainable fuel additives optimize fuel characteristics by enhancing combustion efficiency, stability, and engine performance, while reducing harmful emissions. They facilitate clean combustion, improve lubrication, and elevate octane or cetane levels, which are vital for maintaining high fuel quality. Additionally, sustainable fuel additives improve fuel economy by optimizing vehicle performance allowing engines to achieve better results with less fuel consumption this reduction in fossil fuel usage contributes to a lower carbon footprint without requiring extensive modifications to existing internal combustion engines.

As industries seek environmentally friendly solutions to combat climate change, integrating sustainable fuel additives into current fuel systems offers a viable pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing operational efficiency. Advances in additive technology promise further innovation in sustainable fuels, contributing to a cleaner energy future. The development of sustainable fuel additives is driven by innovative technologies and collaboration among academia, industry, and research institutions. Bioengineering advances have enabled novel production methods using waste biomass as feedstock for additive synthesis. Catalytic processes convert agricultural residues into high-performance additives reducing reliance on fossil resources. (64,65) Studies, such as those represented in Figure 1, have demonstrated that the use of green fuel additives can lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions during combustion, while also contributing to enhanced fuel economy by optimizing combustion processes and minimizing energy losses. (66) As regulatory standards become more stringent globally the integration of sustainable additives will be essential in meeting these requirements while advancing toward net-zero emissions goals. (67)

Despite being a rapidly developing field the sustainable fuel additives industry remains in its early stages with widespread adoption still underway. To address this, this Perspective aims to bridge existing gaps by exploring the potential of sustainable fuel additives derived from renewable resources. The primary objective is to ensure that these additives effectively fulfill their functions without compromising the inherent properties of sustainable fuels thereby laying the groundwork for further advancements in sustainable energy solutions.

2.1. Synthetic Fuels and the Need for Additives

Additives are chemical compounds added to a base fuel during manufacturing or through aftermarket supplements to enhance the desirable properties of a particular fuel for specific applications or protect the engine. Fuel additives play a crucial role in enhancing various aspects of engine performance. They contribute to improved fuel economy, overall engine efficiency, and cleanliness. By employing fuel additives, engines can experience a boost in performance metrics such as horsepower, torque, and a quicker response during acceleration. (14,15) These additives effectively prevent the accumulation of deposits in the fuel system, reducing wear and tear, while facilitating smoother acceleration. Moreover, fuel additives enhance the lubricating properties of the fuel, providing protection against wear and potential damage to engine components and thereby reducing instances of fuel pump failure. Additionally, their use helps in reducing carbon deposits on injectors ensuring the consistent and proper spraying of fuel which is essential for maintaining optimal engine performance. (1−5) They are used in both conventional and synthetic fuels but their specific roles may vary. Synthetic fuels, (16,17) also known as alternative or renewable fuels, are gaining prominence as viable alternatives to traditional petroleum-based fuels in the quest for a sustainable energy future. They are classified with respect to their production pathway, scalability, and sustainability as per the following.

Biofuels further can be divided under two categories. (18−60)

a)

Oxygenated biofuels (Bioalcohols and bioesters). (76,77)

b)

Deoxygenated biofuels (namely Bio-ATF, Green LPG, SNG, green gasoline and diesel). (78,79)

Synthetic fuels differ from their traditional petroleum-based counterparts in terms of composition and molecular structure. These variations can have a significant impact on combustion behavior and overall efficiency, posing challenges when using synthetic fuels in engines designed for petroleum-based fuels. Sustainable additives play a pivotal role in bridging this gap, tailoring the properties of synthetic fuels to ensure seamless integration with engines and optimize performance. (14,15) By acting as performance enhancers, additives refine the combustion process and adeptly address specific issues associated with the unique attributes of synthetic fuels.

The significance of additives in synthetic fuels is underscored by their capacity to customize fuel properties to the requirements of modern automobile engines.

Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize the different fuel additives which, when used conventionally in transportation fuels result in soil, water, and air pollution, affecting ecosystems and posing health risks. Detergents, oxygenates, and diesel additives have potential carcinogenic effects and can harm aquatic life. The integration of alternative renewable additives is crucial to alleviating these detrimental impacts, ensuring a sustainable approach that safeguards ecosystems, human health, and efficient fuel production while maintaining optimal engine performance. Considering the aforementioned facts, it is of utmost importance to develop green additives for use in synthetic fuel to achieve net-zero emission targets.

Green advances in transportation fuel additives typically focus on reducing emissions and improving the overall environmental impact of vehicles. When comparing them to conventional fuel additives, these eco-friendly alternatives aim to utilize renewable sources, decrease harmful emissions, and promote sustainable transportation fuels. Green additives often involve biobased or renewable additives, such as bioethanol, biodiesel, or synthetic fuels derived from organic waste or renewable resources, aiming to reduce carbon footprint and reliance on fossil fuels. (128,129) The main goal is to contribute to the transition to sustainable transportation by offering cleaner, more efficient, and renewable alternatives for powering vehicles. These innovations tend to focus on decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing pollutants, and promoting a more sustainable energy future.

2.2. Evolution of Fuel Additives: From Lead to Sustainable Solutions

Each stage has presented unique innovations and challenges, driving the pursuit of eco-friendly options in the transportation sector.

2.3. Challenges and Preparations for Transition

The transition from conventional fuel sources to sustainable alternatives necessitates meticulous consideration of diverse challenges and preparatory measures. The paradigm shift toward sustainable alternatives demands a comprehensive understanding of both the obstacles inherent in the adoption process and the requisite groundwork for a successful transition. The ensuing (Table 5), featured above, offers a systematic comparative analysis, delineating the intricate web of challenges and the requisite preparations associated with both conventional fuel sources and emerging sustainable alternatives, aiming to facilitate an informed and strategic approach toward this critical energy transition. This table outlines the key challenges faced in transitioning from conventional to sustainable fuels alongside the necessary preparations for improvements between conventional and sustainable fuel alternatives.

There are several advanced characterization techniques continually evolving for assessing sustainable fuel additives (165−167) some of the cutting-edge methods are included below.

Beyond conventional techniques, newer methods and in situ and operando analyses have emerged, offering enhanced surface analysis and real-time monitoring capabilities. However, when these additives are blended into fuels, the need for new analytical methods and specialized equipment arises. Altered properties in blended fuels require specialized devices for real-time in-line monitoring during the blending processes. Innovative mass spectrometry techniques, portable field-deployable devices, and sensor-based systems have become imperative for continual quality assessment, ensuring optimal performance and compliance with regulatory standards in fuel applications.

These advanced techniques offer more comprehensive insights into the chemical, physical, and structural properties of sustainable fuel additives, enabling a deeper understanding of their behavior and performance. The characterization of renewable additives earmarked for integration into both current and forthcoming sustainable fuels holds paramount significance in the realm of eco-friendly energy solutions. As the landscape of sustainable fuels continues to evolve, thorough analysis of these additives becomes increasingly imperative. The comprehensive characterization serves as a linchpin for understanding, fine-tuning, and guaranteeing the efficacy, safety, and regulatory adherence of these additives within fuel formulations.

2.5. Environmental Benefits of Using Sustainable Fuel Additives

Sustainable fuel additives offer a range of environmental benefits including reduced emissions, improved fuel efficiency, and a lower environmental footprint. These additives play a crucial role in making transportation fuels to combat climate change and reduce pollution. The environmental benefits of using sustainable fuel additives are the following. (168)

While both conventional and sustainable fuels benefit from sustainable additives, the extent of emissions reduction and fuel efficiency improvement varies due to inherent fuel properties, compatibility with engines, and their impact on emissions and engine deposits (Table 8). Sustainable fuels often exhibit lower emissions and higher efficiency as a starting point, and the addition of sustainable additives further reinforces their eco-friendly attributes.

3. Green Additives for Synthetic Gasoline

Click to copy section linkSection link copied!

Petroleum gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons that includes alkanes, alkenes, isoalkanes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes, and aromatics. The calorific value of gasoline is 45–48 MJ/kg. Alkenes and aromatics provide traditional gasoline with the desired octane number. However, clean synthetic fuels, which lack aromatics and alkenes, require octane boosters for improvement in fuel efficiency. Table 9 gives an overview of the properties of fossil and synthetic gasoline. (170−174) Oxygenates, such as ethanol, methanol, MTBE, and ETBE are used as octane boosters. However, MTBE has been banned in some countries due to its potential to pollute groundwater.

The following important fuel characteristics need to be considered when oxygenated substances are to be evaluated as gasoline additives: (76,77,99)

Miscibility with gasoline: Oxygenates are generally polar in nature, which may lead to compatibility problems when blended with gasoline.

Energy density: The energy content of oxygenates is lower than gasoline, which may require modifications to fuel injection systems to achieve desired range.

Viscosity: Low viscosity of fuels may cause leakages, while high viscosity may overload the injection system.

Octane number: High octane numbers generally lead to increase ignition delays and higher combustion temperatures, which may increase NOx emissions.

Oxidation stability: Fuel degradation by autoxidation can lead to the formation of insoluble products and deposits in fuel storage tanks, combustion systems, and injection systems. The presence of additives should not reduce oxidation stability of blended gasoline.

Engine load and emission control characteristics: Conventional gasoline emissions mainly comprise of hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The use of oxygenates can reduce HC, CO, and NOx emissions.

Unlike fossil fuels, alcohols used as gasoline blend components pose corrosion due to their hygroscopic nature. To mitigate this issue, corrosion inhibitors are added, depending on the gasoline-alcohol blend ratio.

For dehazing and demulsifying gasohol blends, popular choices include nonionic detergents such as polyethers and sugar-fatty acid esters (Figure 4), formulated in optimized hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) ratios. Among nonionic surfactants, ethylene oxide condensates and polyoxyalkylenepolyols are particularly favored as demulsifiers for fuels. These molecules can be designed with specific molecular weights and solubilities to control the demulsification processes. By reacting ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or butylene oxide with compounds like alkyl phenols, sorbitol, glycerol, or glycol, the desired products can be obtained. The ratio of alkylene oxide in the molecule influences the solubility of the resulting product in water or hydrocarbon.

Anionic surfactants such as alkyl- and dialkylsulfosuccinates also play an important role in achieving effective water separation. Careful selection of a suitable surface-active compound is crucial to ensure adequate water separation in fuel blends. It is convenient to incorporate these additives (typically at concentrations of 5–20 mg/kg) into a multifunctional package containing other performance additives.The effectiveness of demulsifiers in fuels can be evaluated using ASTM D 1094 method. (169) This test method provides a means of assessing the performance of demulsifiers and their ability to separate water from fuel blends. When a demulsifier is introduced into a fuel blend containing water, it adsorbs onto the interface between water and the fuel phase, thereby disrupting the interfacial tension between water and the fuel phase. This action weakens the emulsion stability, causing the water droplets to coalesce. It is important to note that the specific mechanism of demulsification can vary depending on the type of demulsifier used and the composition of the fuel blend. Different demulsifiers may have varying affinities for the water-fuel interface and different abilities to reduce the interfacial tension. This can impact their effectiveness in separating water from fuel blends. (175)

3.1. Biocides (176)

In water-contaminated fuels, the presence of moisture provides a favorable environment for the growth of fungi and bacteria in storage tanks. To prevent such microbial growth, biocides are commonly used as additives. These biocides are compatible with fuels and help to inhibit the proliferation of microorganisms. Some of the most commonly used fuel-compatible biocides include (Figure 5):

Thiazoles: Thiazole compounds, such as benzothiazole and methylbenzothiazole, are effective biocides used to control microbial growth in fuel systems. They exhibit antimicrobial properties and help prevent the formation of biofilms.

Thiocyanates: Thiocyanate compounds, such as sodium thiocyanate, potassium thiocyanate, or ammonium thiocyanate, possess biocidal activity against a wide range. of microorganisms. They are often employed as fuel additives to inhibit microbial growth.

Isothiazolins: Isothiazolin compounds, such as methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and benzisothiazolinone (BIT), are commonly used as biocides in various applications, including fuel systems. They exhibit strong antimicrobial properties and help control microbial contamination.

Cyanobutane: Cyanobutane is a biocide that acts against bacteria, fungi, and algae. It is frequently utilized to prevent microbial growth in water-contaminated fuels and storage tanks.

Dithiocarbamates: Dithiocarbamate compounds, such as sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate, are effective biocides used to inhibit microbial growth in fuel systems. They possess broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and are particularly useful in controlling bacterial growth.

It is important to note that the selection and use of biocides should adhere to regulatory guidelines and industry standards to ensure safety, efficacy, and compatibility with the fuel system. The appropriate concentration and application method of biocides may vary depending on the specific fuel type, storage conditions, and extent of microbial contamination.

3.2. Octane Booster Additives (80,81)

When an unburned fuel/air mixture beyond the boundary of the flame front is subjected to a combination of heat and pressure, detonation occur. Detonation is characterized by an instantaneous, explosive ignition of at least one pocket of fuel/air mixture outside of the flame front, producing an audible sound also called “knock”. Operation on fuels of inadequate octane quality produces unwanted noise from detonation and may result in engine damage. Octane booster additives prevent ignition of unburned fuel during the engine’s expansion stroke and therefore prevent knock. Modern spark ignition engines have a typical octane requirement in the range of 90–98 research octane numbers (RON). In general, synthetic gasoline has a higher octane rating than conventional gasoline. This means that they are less likely to knock, which is a harmful preignition phenomenon that can damage an engine. Some renewable octane booster additives that can be blended with conventional gasoline or synthetic gasoline to enhance its octane rating are listed below (Figure 6, Table 10), along with their mode of action.

Renewable octane boosters work by chemically modifying the fuel to improve its combustion characteristics, reduce engine knocking, and enhance overall engine performance, while potentially reducing emissions.

Examples: Ether-based additive for gasoline octane boosting

Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), tert-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) from biobased isobutene can be used as octane booster additive for gasoline. Ethers have high octane values and can be added to gasoline as octane enhancers. Ethers are free of sulfur, olefins, and aromatic molecules. The type of oxygenate, blending ratio, operating circumstances, characteristics of the engine, and many other factors affect emissions reductions.

3.3. Soot Emissions Compression and Antiknock Additives

Soot formation is a major concern of petroleum derived fuels. Soot formation occurs through polymerization of unburnt carbon, and PM 2.5 is designated as potential carcinogen by WHO. Thus, soot emission reduction is becoming important. Presence of oxygenated additive can aid full burning of carbon, reducing soot formation. Transportation liquid fuel components, such as 5-(Ethoxymethyl) furan (5-EMF) and ethyl levulinate (EL) can play a significant role in synthetic gasoline. Figure 7 shows that the etherification reaction between furfural (FA) and ethanol (EtOH) takes place in the presence of a mild acidic catalyst, resulting in the formation of 2-EMF. 2-EMF possesses excellent properties for reducing soot emissions in compression ignition engines. Among them, 2-EMF demonstrates superior antiknock qualities compared to the reference Euro 95 gasoline. (177−182)

4. Green Additives in Synthetic Diesel

Click to copy section linkSection link copied!

Synthetic diesel, also known as renewable diesel or green diesel, is produced through a synthetic process, Gas-to-Liquid (GTL), and Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) technology. This process involves converting feedstocks like biomass, or waste materials into synthesis gas, followed by catalytic polymerization of CO and H2 molecules known as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, resulting in liquid hydrocarbons that mimic the properties of diesel fuel. (183,184) Conventional diesel and synthetic diesel are two distinct types of fuels with notable differences in their compositions (Table 11). Synthetic diesel has similar chemical composition to conventional diesel, but with potential differences in carbon chain lengths and specific hydrocarbon distributions. Synthetic diesel has lower sulfur and aromatic content, resulting in reduced emissions and air pollution. It has a higher cetane number and better ignition quality. Additionally, synthetic diesel offers environmental benefits as it can be produced from renewable feedstocks, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint.

It is important to note that synthetic diesel is still a hydrocarbon-based fuel, and its combustion process and engine compatibility are similar to those of conventional diesel. However, the differences in production methods and fuel composition can result in varying environmental impacts, performance characteristics, and potential for renewable content. For MTBE, ETBE, TAME, and TAEE blending research, the octane number (RON) is 105–123 and motor octane number (MON) 95–105. Renewable diesel can further be broadly classified into three main types (Table 12) each with distinct production processes and feedstocks. FAME-based diesel, also known as biodiesel, is produced through the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats, such as soybean oil, canola oil, and cooking oil. This type of diesel can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel in diesel engines with little or no modification. Green diesel, on the other hand, is produced through hydrotreating, which involves the hydrogenation of triglycerides and other biomass-derived feedstocks, including vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste fats and greases. It has properties very similar to petroleum diesel and can be used interchangeably without engine modifications. Lastly, Fischer–Tropsch (FT) diesel is produced through the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis process, converting carbon-rich feedstocks, such as natural gas, coal, biomass, or municipal solid waste, into liquid hydrocarbons. FT diesel is noted for its high energy density and excellent combustion characteristics. These renewable diesel types offer significant environmental benefits over petroleum diesel, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particulate matter emissions, and other pollutants while also promoting energy independence by utilizing domestic feedstocks. The choice of feedstock often depends on regional availability, production facilities, and environmental and economic considerations.

Table 11 shows that synthetic diesel may have a lower density, higher cetane index, and lower sulfur content than fossil diesel. Additives can help optimize certain properties, such as improving lubricity, enhancing stability, reducing emissions, cloud point or improve its cold filter plugging point (CFPP) and ensuring compatibility with existing fuel infrastructure and engine requirements. By carefully selecting and incorporating appropriate additives, synthetic diesel can meet the required fuel standards and specifications while performing well in engines.

4.1. Cold Flow Improvers (CFI)

Cold flow additives help prevent the formation of wax crystals and improve the low-temperature operability of diesel fuel. Renewable additives derived from biomass sources, such as biodiesel or renewable diesel, can enhance the cold flow properties of synthetic diesel, preventing fuel gelling and improving fuel flow in cold weather conditions. (185,186)

Renewable cold flow improvers for diesel fuels, whether synthetic or conventional, employ similar modes of action to address the formation of wax crystals and improve the low-temperature performance. Here is an overview of the mode of action of renewable cold flow improvers in diesel.

4.2. Emission Reducers

Certain renewable additives, such as biodiesel and renewable diesel, have been found to reduce emissions of particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and other pollutants. These additives can help improve the environmental performance of synthetic diesel by lowering harmful emissions and promoting cleaner combustion.

Here are a few examples of renewable emission reducers for use in synthetic diesel with their mode of action and a scheme:

(a)

Methoxy ethyl acetate (MEA) and Diethyl ether (DEE): MEA and DEE are renewable oxygenated compound that can be used as an emission reducer in synthetic diesel (Figure 8). It works by reacting with NOx to form nitrogen and water reducing the formation of NOx emissions. (187)

This reaction is very efficient and can reduce NOx emissions by up to 90%.(b)

Oxymethylene ether (OME): Oxymethylene ether (OME) is a low-sooting organic additive for improving the efficiency and reducing the emissions of NOx in alternative diesel fuel. Oxymethylene dimethyl ethers (OMEn) are potential compression ignition fuels or blend components that enable drastic reductions in pollutant formation. OME does this by reacting with NOx to form nitrogen and water, and by forming a protective film on engine components. By combining multiple conversion steps, OMEn can be produced from captured carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) produced using renewable electricity. They can also be produced using methanol from waste biomass. (188−192)

4.3. Anti-Oxidants and Stabilizers

Biobased antioxidants and stabilizers are required to be added to B100 to improve its stability and inhibit oxidation. This helps extend the fuel’s shelf life, prevent degradation, and maintain fuel quality over time.

Here are some examples of renewable antioxidants and stabilizers, along with their mode of action:

It is important to note that the selection and effectiveness of renewable antioxidants and stabilizers can depend on factors such as the specific composition of the synthetic diesel, operating conditions, and desired storage lifespan. Proper formulation and testing are necessary to determine the optimal concentration and combination of these additives for effective antioxidant and stabilization performance.

4.0d. Lubricity Enhancers

Lubricity enhancers are additives that improve the lubricating properties of diesel fuel, reducing wear and tear on engine components. Biobased lubricity enhancers derived from vegetable oils or renewable sources can be added to synthetic diesel to enhance its lubrication performance and protect the engine.

Here are a few examples of renewable lubricity enhancers (Figure 12) with their structure and mode of action that can be added to synthetic diesel:

4.4. Pour Point Depressant

Renewable pour point depressants are additives used in synthetic diesel to lower the pour point temperature, which is the lowest temperature at which the fuel can flow. These additives help to improve the low-temperature operability of the fuel by reducing its viscosity and preventing wax crystal formation.

Here are some examples of renewable pour point depressants along with their mode of action. (197)

The mode of action of renewable pour point depressants involves disrupting the formation, growth, and aggregation of wax crystals that can lead to fuel thickening and poor flow characteristics at low temperatures. (197,198) By modifying the wax crystal structure or inhibiting their growth, these additives allow the fuel to remain fluid and pumpable under cold conditions, enhancing its cold-weather performance (Figure 14).

5. Green Additives in Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Click to copy section linkSection link copied!

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or alternative aviation fuel refers to aviation fuel that is produced from nonpetroleum-based renewable feedstocks. These fuels are designed to be more environmentally friendly compared to conventional aviation fuels, which are typically derived from fossil fuels. Some key differences between synthetic aviation fuel and conventional aviation fuel are given in Table 13. It is important to note that the properties of synthetic aviation fuel can vary depending on the specific production process and feedstock used. Additionally, advancements in technology and ongoing research may lead to further improvements and refinements in the properties of synthetic aviation fuel. SAF needs the addition of certain additives in order to meet the specifications and improve its performance.

5.1. Static Dissipator Additives (SDAs)

When a liquid flows through a pipe, friction between the liquid and the pipe can generate static electricity. This static charge can build up and potentially discharge as a spark, which could ignite fuel vapors or cause other safety hazards. SDAs work by reducing the surface tension of the fuel, which helps to dissipate any static charges that may be present. SDAs are used in aviation fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to reduce the buildup of static electricity during fuel handling and transfer processes. The additives help dissipate static charges and prevent potentially hazardous situations. Here are some examples of potential renewable static dissipator additives for sustainable aviation fuel. (199−202) Some of the most common additives include the following:

One example of a biobased surfactant that can be used as an SDA in SAFs is alkyl polyglucoside (APG) is a type of nonionic surfactant that is derived from glucose and fatty alcohols. (203) The structure of APG consists of a hydrophilic glucose headgroup and a hydrophobic alkyl tail. The length and branching of the alkyl tail can be varied to tune the properties of the surfactant for different applications. APGs have been shown to be effective at reducing the surface tension of fuel and dissipating static charges, making them a promising alternative to SDAs.

5.2. Corrosion Inhibitors

Corrosion inhibitors help to prevent the corrosion of the engine components.

The utilization of biopolymers (Figure 15) as a promising alternative to toxic corrosion inhibitors is regarded as a new trend and an innovative approach for preventing metallic corrosion. One of the primary advantages of these biomacromolecules is their ability to provide an increased number of attachment sites to the metallic substrate, leading to the formation of high-quality films and improved adhesion compared to small molecule inhibitors. This capability can be further enhanced by incorporating additional adsorption sites, such as functional groups, into the backbone of the biopolymers.

On the other hand, these biopolymers possess several desirable characteristics, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, affordability, and nontoxicity. Furthermore, they are readily available and are derived from renewable sources. These remarkable qualities make them well-suited for effectively mitigating metallic corrosion, while also being environmentally friendly.

5.3. Fuel System Icing Inhibitors

Recent guidance issued in January 2025 by the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Agriculture outlines the compliance requirements for claiming and maximizing the credit, highlighting the critical role of third-party verification to ensure accuracy and traceability. Additionally, the guidance provides pathways for producers to increase their credit value through further reductions in carbon intensity.

This article unpacks the verification requirements based on the IRS guidance for transportation fuel and the USDA’s Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) program as they relate to the 45Z tax credit.

Verification for Transportation Fuel Under 45Z

For transportation fuels other than sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), third-party verification is not required to claim the 45Z tax credit. However, voluntary market demands—such as buyers requiring assurance under transferability provisions—may lead producers to seek verification.

For non-SAF fuels utilizing the 45ZCF-GREET model, a Safe Harbor provision is available for those claimants who choose to substantiate their emissions rates. To qualify for this provision, taxpayers must provide the certifier with all inputs into the 45ZCF-GREET model, along with the specific fuel type and category from the applicable emissions rate table and supporting data consistent with SAF certification requirements.

For SAF claimants, third-party certification is mandatory. The IRS requires certification from an independent, qualified certifier to ensure compliance, traceability and accurate lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assessments. The SAF certification process includes:

Production and Sales Statements:

• A statement confirming the accuracy of the SAF production process and inputs used to determine lifecycle GHG emissions.

• Verification of the number of SAF gallons sold in a qualifying sale.

Conflict of Interest Declarations:

• The certifier must confirm they have no financial interest in the value of the 45Z credit, no involvement in SAF transactions and no familial or employment ties to the taxpayer.

Qualified Certifier Statement:

• This includes the certifier’s name, contact information, qualifications and a description of their accreditation. If the certifier acts as part of an organization, additional organizational details are required.

Facility Information:

• Information about the qualified facility, including data on metering devices and confirmation of their calibration and accuracy.

• Emissions rate accuracy must be within ±5% or 2 grams of CO2e per mmBTU, whichever is higher.

Supporting Documentation:

• Any additional documentation required by the certifier’s accrediting body and circumstances of the facility.

45Z Transportation Fuel Certifier Accreditations

While certification is mandatory for SAF producers utilizing the 45ZCF-GREET model to determine their emissions rate, non-SAF producers who opt for certification must also use entities accredited by the American National Standards Institute National Accreditation Board or the California Air Resources Board Low Carbon Fuel Standard (CARB LCFS) program.

Alternatively, SAF producers using the CORSIA or CORSIA Actual model to determine their emissions rate must engage a certifier accredited by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), or other International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)-approved sustainability schemes.

USDA’s Interim Rule On Climate-Smart Agriculture

The USDA’s interim rule provides guidelines for quantifying, reporting and verifying GHG reduction benefits from CSA practices. By integrating third-party verification into the biofuel feedstock supply chain, renewable fuel producers can unlock new opportunities to reduce the fuel’s overall carbon CI, resulting in greater value from the 45Z tax credit.

Verification standards for CSA practices ensure the authenticity of net GHG emissions reductions, bolstering credibility and trust, expanding market opportunities for U.S. farmers cultivating biofuel feedstocks.

Verification Requirements

The USDA’s CSA guidelines aim to establish a transparent and accountable system that rewards sustainable practices, further driving the adoption of climate-smart agricultural methods in biofuel production.

Under these guidelines, third-party verification is required at every stage of the supply chain once feedstock leaves the farm. The responsibility for initiating the audit process falls on the first point of aggregation—the first location where the crop is collected after leaving the farm. This could be a storage facility, a processing facility (such as a soybean crushing plant) or a biofuel refinery. From that point onward, audits are mandated at every subsequent transfer of ownership.

Annual Audits:

• All first points of aggregation, intermediary entities and biofuel refiners must undergo annual audits by accredited third-party verifiers.

Farm Audits:

• Farms supplying reduced-CI crops may be selected for audits by the first point of aggregation’s verifier. Selection criteria includes geographic location, crop type, quantity supplied and associated CI values.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cont2_Soil_Sample_4ffa3e0058.jpg,N,,2025-05-07 13:58:13.645342

Beginning this month, the US has implemented a 125% import tariff on Chinese UCO, a move that has already halted most shipments.

China exported a record 3 million metric tons of UCO last year, according to Chinese customs data.

“For now, US arbitrage is shut, and we expect it to stay that way in the medium term,” said Richard Dickinson, head of trading at Shanghai-based Amarus Trading, one of the largest players in the Chinese UCO market.

“Some volumes are being redirected to Europe, as well as to new markets in Asia, including South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and India.”

Industry sources noted that at least four new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plants — relying on UCO as a key feedstock — have recently launched or will come online this year in Thailand, Malaysia and Japan, with a combined annual capacity of over 700,000 metric tons.

UCO exports to the US had already begun to decline late last year after Beijing scrapped export tax rebates and the US introduced a new clean fuel tax credit structure that disincentivises imports.

The services group reported a 6.6 percent increase in revenue, with earnings rising from $5.15 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to $5.49 billion in Q1 of 2025. Company officials attributed the climb in part to the aviation segment, where revenue rose by 10.4 percent as a result of growth in the firm’s shared aircraft ownership programs and an increase in flight hours across NetJets’ programs. The gains were partially offset by higher costs for flight crews, maintenance, and fuel, as well as depreciation.

Growth also came from subsidiary Integrated Project Services, which specializes in construction management.

NetJets provides a range of aviation services, including private jet leases and charters, security, acquisition services, and financing of whole and shared aircraft. It owns the largest private aircraft fleet in the world.

Both countries, as well as Indonesia, also saw the total private green investments they attracted shrink in 2024.
The country, which leads the bloc’s energy transformation agenda, also saw a fourfold increase in its solar power investments through solar energy systems.
Last year, private green investments into solar doubled, while investment into improving waste management increased by 60 per cent from 2023.
Scaling up blended finance While climate investments increased in 2024, Southeast Asia has an annual investment gap of US$50 billion by 2030 to reach its decarbonisation goals, noted the report.","Malaysia and Singapore together drew over 60 per cent of the US$8 billion in green investments made in Southeast Asia in 2024, according to a study released on Tuesday by consultant Bain & Company and Singapore state investor Temasek.

The outlay was a 43 per cent increase from 2023’s US$5.6 billion, due to the rise in investments in solar projects as well as spend on renewables-powered data centres.

Malaysia and Singapore have seen sizeable increases in green investments and are on track to meet national targets, but progress has been uneven in other parts of the region, said researchers of the annual Southeast Asia’s Green Economy report.

According to the latest data, although the Philippines’ solar and wind financing expanded and Vietnam saw at least 95 per cent of all its green investments directed to renewable energy, both Southeast Asian nations are lagging in terms of how their national climate goals drive sustainable investment-friendly policies. Both countries, as well as Indonesia, also saw the total private green investments they attracted shrink in 2024.

The Philippines is the only country in the region which has yet to announce a net zero goal, although it has pledged to the United Nations that it will reduce harmful greenhouse gases by 75 per cent by 2030. Vietnam vowed to achieve net zero by 2050, through a conditional emission reduction target of 27 per cent by 2030.

“Over the past decade, the region has demonstrated growing ambition toward sustainable development. Yet, progress has been uneven, and with only five years remaining to meet the critical 2030 climate targets, Southeast Asia s not yet on track to fulfill its climate pledges,” said Dale Hardcastle, partner for Asia Pacific, Bain & Company.

“The opportunity to alter this trajectory is narrowing rapidly, underscoring the urgency for bold, coordinated action at this moment of inflection.”

Malaysia secured financing of US$900 million last year for the initial operation of a 98-megawatt (MW) data centre in the southern state of Johor. Johor has come up with guidelines to encourage future data centres to use renewable energy; it has also rejected applications that do not meet green standards.

The country, which leads the bloc’s energy transformation agenda, also saw a fourfold increase in its solar power investments through solar energy systems. The scheme incentivises property owners to invest in rooftop photovoltaic systems and offset their electricity bills and potentially earn revenue from surplus energy generation.

Private deals in the country into green hydrogen also totalled US$400 million, up from zero in 2023. The particular project in Perak focuses on hydrogen production using solar power technology.

Singapore attracted new funding of about US$320 million for a solar panel manufacturer, along with fuel substitution, hydrogen and waste-to-energy plants investments.

The report authors observed that Indonesia experienced a slowdown in green investments due to a lack of investment in fuel substitution measures, which typically involve replacing a more dirty fuel like gasoline or diesel with a lower-emissions alternative such as natural gas.

Indonesia, one of the world’s biggest emitters, fell behind in meeting its climate targets last year as it was unable to receive favourable funding terms from foreign financiers to phase out coal power, and did not acquire any new clean energy investments, according to the report. But it rebounded before the close of 2024 by attracting funds for a 5GW wind power plant and another 5GW for rooftop solar to be completed by 2030.

The Phiippines was one of those that lead the region in attracting green investments in 2023 but last year, its standing took a plunge when waste management financing it pulled in dropped from US$600 million to none in 2024.

Last year, private green investments into solar doubled, while investment into improving waste management increased by 60 per cent from 2023.

Scaling up blended finance

While climate investments increased in 2024, Southeast Asia has an annual investment gap of US$50 billion by 2030 to reach its decarbonisation goals, noted the report.

Blended finance, which refers to investment funds that combine public or philanthropic capital with private, is emerging as one of the solutions to augment this gap, but it remains constrained by small deal sizes, red tape, and investor mismatch, found the study.

The report authors suggested that blended finance could be scaled through national policy development such as the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate in Indonesia or Singapore’s announcement of its intention to import 6GW of low carbon electricity by 2035. Indonesia had earlier said that SAF needs to be used for all international flights departing from the country from 2027.

Complex transactions and long negotiations due to the involvement of multiple stakeholders can be prevented if standards are harmonised, the authors added. For instance, the Asean Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance has been gaining ground as it serves as a framework for mobilising capital and prioritises high-impact projects that align with global standards.

The gap between investors and local realities must also be addressed. Commercial investors and lenders require regulatory certainty and bankability, while concessional lenders need additional reporting such as impact reporting, which adds to the expenses of projects, said the authors.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/3_MWp_Penang_Bosch_e3YK8Ao.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-05-07 00:57:08.391571

According to Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, U.S. output of “other biofuels”, a category including SAF, nearly doubled from December 2024 to February 2025.

U.S. SAF output averaged only 2,000 bbl/d at the beginning of 2024. “Other biofuels” production was mainly coming from renewable naphtha and renewable propane.

But by February 2025, SAF production had grown to around 30,000 bbl/d.

New projects are fueling the rising production. Phillips 66’s SAF project at its refinery in Rodeo, California, came online in third-quarter 2024 and added 10,000 bbl/d of capacity.

In Port Arthur, Texas, Diamond Green Diesel completed a 15,000 bbl/d SAF project in fourth-quarter 2024.

New Rise Renewable’s SAF plant in Reno, Nevada, came online in February, adding 3,000 bbl/d.

Par Pacific plans to start production from its SAF plant in Kapolei, Hawaii, in the second half of the year, adding 2,000 bbl/d.

EIA forecasts that production of “other biofuels”, including SAF, will more than double by the end of 2025 and increase another 20% next year.

However, SAF adoption remains limited. SAF is expected to still make up less than 2% of the 1.7 MMbbl/d of U.S. jet fuel consumption this year.
