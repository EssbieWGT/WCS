(BDF) sieht im neuen Koalitionsvertrag von CDU/CSU und SPD eine wichtige Weichenstellung für die Zukunft des Luftverkehrs in Deutschland.

In einer Mitteilung teilte der Verband jetzt mit:

Dr. Michael Engel, Geschäftsführer des BDF, erklärt: „Der Koalitionsvertrag von CDU/CSU und SPD markiert eine wichtige Weichenstellung für den Luftverkehrsstandort Deutschland. Die Rücknahme der Luftverkehrsteuererhöhung ist ein erster Schritt in die richtige Richtung und sendet ein wichtiges Signal an die Branche. Doch um wirklich effektive Wachstumsimpulse für die Luftfahrt zu setzen und die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit Deutschlands auf europäischer Ebene zu sichern, bedarf es weitergehender Maßnahmen. Nur mit einer spürbaren Reduzierung der staatlichen Standortkosten und einer echten Entlastung der Luftfahrtunternehmen können wir langfristig den Luftverkehr stärken und die Position Deutschlands als attraktives Luftverkehrsdrehkreuz sichern.“

Positiv bewertet der BDF die Ankündigung der neuen Bundesregierung, die wettbewerbsverzerrenden Sonderbelastungen abzubauen. Insbesondere die geplante Abschaffung der über die europarechtlichen Vorgaben hinausgehenden PtL-Quote (Power-to-Liquid) noch im Jahr 2025 sowie das angekündigte Gleichbehandlungsprinzip bei Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) schaffen Planungssicherheit und entlasten deutsche Fluggesellschaften im internationalen Vergleich.

Zudem begrüßt der BDF die angestrebte Modernisierung in der Luftfahrtindustrie und des Luftverkehrs im Sinne der Dekarbonisierung und des fairen Wettbewerbs.

„Diese Maßnahmen weisen in die richtige Richtung“, so Dr. Engel. „Jetzt kommt es darauf an, die angekündigten Vorhaben zügig und ambitioniert umzusetzen. Der Luftverkehr ist Rückgrat der deutschen Exportwirtschaft, fördert den Tourismus und verbindet Menschen weltweit. Nur durch verlässliche und wirtschaftsfreundliche Rahmenbedingungen kann der Luftverkehr in Deutschland wieder durchstarten.“

Der BDF wird diesen Weg konstruktiv begleiten und sich weiterhin für eine starke Luftfahrt in Deutschland einsetzen.

The findings of the Project Willow study highlight several options that can drive the development of a new hub for sustainable industries. Split into three areas – waste and recycling projects, bio-feedstock initiatives and renewable energy – this collection of projects are anticipated to create up to 800 skilled jobs, offering potential new avenues for the current workforce, as well as creating additional economic opportunities. A recent appearance at the Scottish Affairs Committee by the report’s authors suggests the preferred priority project is the production of sustainable aviation fuel, with others to follow.

One of the perennial challenges, however, in terms of translating small-scale innovation to manufacturing on a commercial scale must be tackled head-on. At its core, Grangemouth has always been a manufacturing site, rather than a research and development facility, so there will need to be some adaptation to help these ideas come to fruition.

Infrastructure, funding and skills must all be part of the plan, but it could be a valuable opportunity to provide an additional injection of drive into the ecosystem, with innovative biotechnology companies and the Grangemouth manufacturing operations working together to carve out the next chapter and deliver change.

Importantly, the new opportunities for the site should not rely on one single technology, as has been the case with petrochemical refining, but the challenging incorporation of a range of sustainable processes at significant scale. The plans for using bio-feedstocks are particularly exciting. We have existing biotechnology skills and expertise that can play a significant role in the transition, while also being integrated with the renewable energy and recycling projects. Scotland has a vibrant cluster, which the Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre has supported over the last decade alongside other partners, laying the foundations for an economy that can eventually move away from fossil fuels.

The Scottish Bioresource Mapping Tool developed by IBioIC, Scottish Enterprise and Zero Waste Scotland, for instance, helps to identify the availability of different feedstocks for new products and processes, from agriculture and forestry waste to food and drink co-products, industrial carbon dioxide and seaweed.

We also have a network of more than 300 organisations that can feed into the new projects, depending on what is required for each of the three focus areas, as well as the capabilities to support skills development – including involvement with the Skills Transition Centre at Forth Valley College already kicked-off. With some reskilling, the people who have prior experience at Grangemouth could become the powerhouse we need for implementing new sustainable technologies.

Defossilising Grangemouth as an enormous undertaking and collaboration is perhaps the most critical element in making that happen. Scaling-up to establish new industries and supply chains is full of complexity and hurdles, and in this case, we cannot afford for that to be the barrier that halts progress before it has gained any momentum.

It will take years to transition away from petrochemicals to bio-based processing but the scale of the task requires immediate action. The legacy of Grangemouth may have impacted Scotland’s carbon footprint so far, but its reinvention could make a significant contribution to reaching net zero before it is too late.","https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmQ3Yzc3Yzk3LTMzZWQtNGE2Yy05ZmQxLTc0NGI1YzhiN2I2ZDo5MWY1OGU0NC05M2YwLTQ2OWItODcyMS05OGFjNDJkNWRmNmY=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-04-14 01:56:41.436289

Letalski promet je po podatkih mednarodnega združenja letalskih prevoznikov IATA lani dosegel nove rekordne ravni.
Letalski prevozniki so se leta 2021 zavezali, da bi leta 2050 dosegli ogljično nevtralnost.
Postavili so tudi vmesni cilj, da bi do leta 2030 emisije zmanjšali za pet odstotkov.
Navedli so tudi poročilo analitične družbe Boston Consulting, ki napoveduje, da bo do leta 2030 primanjkljaj teh sintetičnih goriv 45-odstoten.","Letalski promet se je lani po vseh kazalnikih robustno povečal, podobno statistika kaže letos. Ob tem pa predsednik svetovnega panožnega združenja opozarja, da tej transportni panogi v prizadevanjih za ničelne emisije ne gre dobro, da so zelo negotovi tudi vmesni cilji na tej poti, s prstom pa kaže predvsem na dobavitelje goriv.

Letalski promet je po podatkih mednarodnega združenja letalskih prevoznikov IATA lani dosegel nove rekordne ravni. »V letu 2024 je postalo popolnoma jasno, da želijo ljudje potovati. Povpraševanje po poletih se je povečalo za deset odstotkov, njihovo število je doseglo rekord tako na področju poletov med državami kot znotraj njih. Kar 83 odstotkov vseh ponujenih sedežev je bilo zapolnjenih, kar je rekord, je v poročilu o lanskem letu dejal prvi mož IATA Willie Walsh in dodal, da se rast (sicer nekoliko manjša) nakazuje tudi za letošnje leto, kar so potrdili podatki za januar in le nekoliko manj za februar.

Manj zadovoljen je Walsh z izpolnjevanjem okoljskih zavez letalskega prevoza. Dejal je, da so letalske družbe vložile rekordne zneske v nakup trajnostnega goriva, ki pa so ga dobavitelji dobavili komaj kaj, lani manj kot 0,5 odstotka vsega potrebnega. V pogovoru za agencijo Reuters je dejal, da dobavitelji s tovrstno dobavo zavlačujejo.

V letalski industriji se že dolgo uporablja kerozin, pridobljen iz nafte, trajnostno letalsko gorivo (angleška kratica SAF – sustainable aviation fuel) pa je mešanica običajnih fosilnih goriv in sintetičnih komponent, izdelanih iz vrste obnovljivih »surovin«, kot so rabljena jedilna olja, maščobe, rastlinska olja, komunalni, kmetijski in gozdarski odpadki.

Letalski prevozniki so se leta 2021 zavezali, da bi leta 2050 dosegli ogljično nevtralnost. Z uporabo celostnega pristopa, ki upošteva vse emisije v življenjski dobi goriva, naj bi se emisije toplogrednih plinov v celotnem življenjskem ciklu z uporabo trajnostnih letalskih goriv zmanjšale za kar 70 odstotkov ali več kot 90 odstotkov v primerjavi s fosilnim letalskim gorivom.

Postavili so tudi vmesni cilj, da bi do leta 2030 emisije zmanjšali za pet odstotkov. Walsh, ki je tudi nekdanji direktor British Airways, je za Reuters dejal, da je ta vmesni cilj nedosegljiv, predvsem pa da preostali udeleženi v izpolnjevanju tega cilja ne prevzemajo svoje vloge. Vse skupaj malo spominja na avtomobilizem, kjer so bile dane prav tako velike tovrstne zaveze, ki se zdaj majejo.

»Vsi so za stvar, dokler mi plačamo račun, kar je preprosto nesprejemljivo,« so bile Walsheve besede. Dvom, da je vmesni cilj dosegljiv, pomeni precejšen preobrat glede na mnenje s srečanja IATA pred komaj desetimi meseci, ko je Walsh dejal, da je ta cilj »eksistenčno nujen«. Zdaj je drugače, prst je uperil predvsem v dobavitelje goriva, češ da ignorirajo dane obljube, pa čeprav bodo za goriva, ki bodo imela manj emisij, letos letalske družbe namenile 3,8 milijarde dolarjev. Reuters je za komentar prosil panožno združenje proizvajalcev goriv Fuels Europe, a od njih ni dobil dogovora.

Razogljičenje letalstva

Evropsko združenje letalskih prevoznikov A4E (Airlines for Europe) je v zapisu konec marca navajalo, da sicer ostajajo popolnoma zavezani razogljičenju letalstva, zmanjševanju emisij in doseganju ogljične nevtralnosti do leta 2050, a so tudi oni dodali, da so za doseg tega cilja ključna cenovno dostopna trajnostna goriva. Kot so zapisali, so globoko zaskrbljeni, da zakonodaja s tega področja ne ustvarja cenovno dostopnega trga tovrstnih goriv. Navedli so tudi poročilo analitične družbe Boston Consulting, ki napoveduje, da bo do leta 2030 primanjkljaj teh sintetičnih goriv 45-odstoten. A4E dodaja, da morajo zdaj odgovornosti prevzeti evropska komisija in države članice, ker dobavitelji ne dostavljajo goriva. Brez nujnega ukrepanja v prihodnjih mesecih bo tudi po njihovem mnenju verodostojnost zaveze močno omajana – in potrebna ponovna presoja.

IATA pač še navaja, da jih v smeri manjšega okoljskega odtisa ovira dejstvo, da dobave novih letal zamujajo. Predstavniki proizvajalcev so menda Reutersu odgovorili, da so povsem zavezani k proizvodnji bolj učinkovitih letal, a da jih bremenijo stalne težave v dobavnih verigah sestavnih delov. Pri tem le omenimo, da ima evropski konzorcij Airbus v načrtu, da bi do sredine prihodnjega desetletja na trgu uvedel naslednika svojega najbolj prodajanega modela 320 neo, ki naj bi imel od 20 do 30 odstotkov manjšo porabo goriva, kar naj bi med drugim dosegli z izdelavo drugačnih kril, motorji z odprtim rotorjem in lažjimi materiali trupa.

Kritike Walsha, da ne prispevajo dovolj k skupnem cilju, sta za Reuters zavrnili tudi krovni združenji letališč (ACI Europe) in kontrolorjev zračnega prometa (CANSO). Prvi so dejali, da prispevajo »več kot pravičen delež pri razogljičenju letalstva, in obtožili IATA, da ona prelaga odgovornosti. Tudi krovna skupina za nadzor zračnega prometa CANSO je dejala, da je močno zavezana k razogljičenju in povečanju učinkovitosti zračnega prostora, da bi pripomogla k manjši porabi goriva.",https://www.delo.si/media/images/20250409/2070005.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.format-webp.webp?rev=1,N,,2025-04-13 23:56:30.616186

Business travel, a sector historically associated with significant environmental impact, is now at the forefront of this change. With growing awareness of the ecological footprint caused by excessive travel, companies like BCD Travel are exploring ways to make business travel more sustainable. BCD Travel’s 2024 Survey on Reimagining Corporate Travel Policies, which surveyed 211 travel buyers, highlighted that sustainable travel is now a significant theme, with 64% of travel buyers incorporating it into their policies. Flexibility is also gaining traction, as companies adapt to hybrid work environments and evolving traveller needs. However, issues like managing local regulatory differences and balancing global consistency remain hurdles. This article explores the impact of traditional travel practices, highlights the importance of mindful travel, and outlines some sustainable options for business travellers.

The Environmental Impact of Business Travel

Business travel contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions. Air travel is a significant source of global emissions and is predicted to account for 12 to 27 per cent of 2050 global emissions. Air travel emissions are increasing 70 per cent faster than initially expected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is estimated that business travel represents about 15 to 20 per cent of that global travel. Not only does excessive travel affect the environment but also increases carbon emissions. Furthermore, hotel stays, rental vehicles, and meals on the go all add to resource consumption, while single-use plastics and disposable items at airports, hotels, and meeting spaces exacerbate waste issues.

The 2024 BCD survey also highlights several specific strategies that organisations are implementing to promote sustainable travel. Around 59% of companies reporting reduced travel budgets, cost control is critical. Popular measures include encouraging virtual meetings, optimizing trip lengths, and limiting luxury travel perks. Despite these constraints, there is recognition that well-structured travel policies can enhance talent retention and satisfaction.

Among the many measures is public transportation, wherein rather than relying on taxis or ride-hailing services, companies are encouraging the use of public transportation, which not only reduces carbon emissions but also cuts down on travel costs. Business travellers can consider travelling light and reducing luggage weight. Travelling without checked-in luggage or reducing its weight minimizes the fuel burden on flights, making air travel slightly more eco-friendly. Or even, opting for hybrid or electric vehicles is gaining traction. Many companies now prioritise electric or hybrid vehicles for ground transportation, marking a shift towards renewable energy use in business travel. Other practices include carpooling to reduce individual vehicle use, encouraging economy class over business class, and choosing direct flights over connecting routes to cut down on unnecessary emissions.

Being Mindful

With sustainability now a critical consideration, business travellers and companies need to adopt mindful travel practices. Implementing more strategic travel planning and opting for greener options can reduce the negative impact of travel on the environment.

Companies committed to sustainability enhance their brand image, appealing to eco-conscious clients and partners with specific eco-conscious campaigns. Increasingly, organizations are choosing to participate in carbon offset programs that fund projects like reforestation, renewable energy, or conservation to offset the carbon footprint of their travel.

Beyond individual travel choices, travel managers are also rethinking how they organise meetings. Sustainable group activities, focusing on low-impact or eco-friendly experiences, are increasingly part of the meeting agenda.

The Shift toward Sustainable Travel Programs: Insights and Innovations

In an industry first, BCD has developed a comprehensive sustainability solution for corporate travel programs. This innovation, developed with climate-tech partner SQUAKE and experts at global corporate travel consultancy Advito, helps businesses set sustainability goals, manage carbon emissions, and encourage greener travel choices. Key features include automated carbon tax applications, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) procurement, and compliance tools for regulations like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Piloted with Siemens, the solution will be available in early 2025, offering consistent sustainability guidance and reporting across booking platforms. It aims to simplify integrating sustainability into corporate travel processes and reduce travel-related emissions.

The future of corporate travel is increasingly dependent on innovative initiatives that prioritise sustainability while ensuring operational efficiency. A notable example is Microsoft’s collaboration with Advito, which centred around limiting the growth of their Scope 3 emissions and aligning their travel team with this objective. Advito’s Sustainable Collaboration team analysed Microsoft’s travel footprint to identify opportunities to transition from air to rail travel, along with quantifying the potential savings in carbon emissions. The analysis uncovered numerous opportunities for Microsoft to make significant changes; specifically, by shifting 50% of travel from air to rail on viable routes, the company could achieve a reduction of approximately 4,438 tons of CO2 emissions annually.

Another pioneer in building a sustainable travel program was global fintech firm Finastra, who sought reduce internal travel, enhance employee productivity, and optimise their program savings. In early 2019, Finastra announced an ambitious sustainability initiative to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. With the guidance of experts from Advito, the Finastra Travel Team worked to reduce internal travel from 43% at the beginning of the campaign to just 9.8% in just four months, reducing travel spend by 50% in the process.

What Lies Ahead for Sustainable Business Travel?

BCD Travel and other industry leaders are expected to innovate further, encouraging the use of low-emission flights, promoting sustainable suppliers, integrating dynamic meeting location choices and encouraging the use of train travel over air where applicable. The rise of eco-certifications, regulations on sustainability, such as the EU’s CSRD, and ongoing research into sustainable travel technologies will likely make sustainable travel the norm in the corporate world.

While business travel is essential, it doesn’t have to come at the cost of our planet. Companies and travellers have a role to play in making more sustainable choices. By being mindful of travel impacts and embracing green practices, we can pave the way for a more sustainable, responsible future in business travel. Furthermore, sustainable travel is no longer a niche concern, but a growing priority for organisations worldwide. As more companies adopt these practices, the travel industry will likely witness a shift towards more sustainable and responsible travel solutions. For organisations still on the fence, adopting even a few of these initiatives could lead to substantial benefits for both the environment and the bottom line.

As businesses worldwide adapt to a new travel paradigm, the message is clear: sustainable travel is not just a responsibility—it’s an opportunity to lead.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/03/e17118a5-annie-spratt-iqwnr00mfqm-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 22:56:07.831956

“With SAF blending mandates expanding, demand is rising rapidly,” said Jeong Ho-seung, head of SK Innovation’s Sustainable Fuel Technology Team.
Jeong emphasized the challenges of meeting stringent safety standards: “Aviation fuel is heavily regulated, and SAF must meet one of eight ASTM standards.
We’re also developing technologies that allow us to use lower-grade, cost-effective waste oils.” SK has now established a full SAF value chain—from feedstock procurement to production and global distribution.
The United States has set a goal to fully replace conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050.","DAEJEON, South Korea, April 14 (Korea Bizwire) — At SK Innovation’s Environmental Science & Technology Institute in Daejeon, a powerful scent of used cooking oil hangs in the air, signaling an ambitious transformation: converting waste oil into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Within the facility’s pilot plant, dark brown waste oil is refined through high-temperature, high-pressure reactors into a clear liquid—an eco-friendly fuel that can cut carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The shift comes as SAF gains momentum globally, driven by regulatory mandates and growing pressure on the aviation sector to decarbonize.

“With SAF blending mandates expanding, demand is rising rapidly,” said Jeong Ho-seung, head of SK Innovation’s Sustainable Fuel Technology Team. “The global SAF market is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 46%, reaching 108 trillion won ($80 billion) by 2034.”

SK Energy, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, began commercial SAF production last September at its Ulsan Complex, marking a domestic first.

The facility, with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons, uses a co-processing method that integrates bio-based feedstocks into existing petroleum production lines. This dual-input system allows for continuous SAF output alongside other low-carbon products like bio-naphtha.

Much of SK’s progress is underpinned by its in-house R&D. Engineers at the Daejeon institute developed the co-processing technology and validated it through pilot testing before scaling it to commercial operations.

Jeong emphasized the challenges of meeting stringent safety standards: “Aviation fuel is heavily regulated, and SAF must meet one of eight ASTM standards. We’re also developing technologies that allow us to use lower-grade, cost-effective waste oils.”

SK has now established a full SAF value chain—from feedstock procurement to production and global distribution. The company became the first Korean refiner to export SAF to Europe in January.

In March, it signed a bulk supply deal with Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, and has since begun supplying domestic carriers including Air Busan and Korean Air.

Governments worldwide are tightening SAF mandates. The European Union now requires a minimum 2% SAF blend in jet fuel, with targets rising to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The United States has set a goal to fully replace conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050. Korea, meanwhile, announced last August that all international flights departing the country must blend SAF starting in 2027.

Still, industry insiders warn that Korea’s policy support lags behind other nations. The EU offers carbon credits to airlines using SAF, while the U.S. provides tax credits of up to $1.75 per gallon for SAF producers. Japan also offers tax deductions of up to 40% for SAF-related investments and sales.

“To meet growing market demand, multi-trillion-won investments are required,” said one industry source. “Without government support, such investments are unfeasible. Proactive policy measures are essential to advance this strategic industry.”

Myanmar 7.7 Earthquake Recovery

Myanmar is grappling with the aftermath of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck on March 28, devastating its central region. The disaster claimed over 3,600 lives and caused widespread destruction, toppling everything from modern condominiums to historic pagodas.

More than nine million people across 58 townships have been impacted, with thousands of buildings, including schools and hospitals, reduced to rubble. The situation remains unstable as aftershocks continue to shake the worst-affected areas, worsening an already critical humanitarian crisis.

In response, UN agencies are requesting an additional $241.6 million to support those in the hardest-hit areas. They are also reallocating $134 million from Myanmar’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan, published in December 2024.

The updated plan highlights two million newly affected people in urgent need of aid. This adds to the 4.3 million who had already been relying on assistance before the earthquake struck.

Even before this tragedy, Myanmar faced severe challenges. Nearly 20 million people—about a third of the population—were already in need of humanitarian support. The ongoing civil war between the military junta, which seized power in February 2021, and opposition groups has only deepened the crisis.",https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5.9-Magnitude-Earthquake-in-Myanmar.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 19:56:26.227161

Listen to a recent interview with corn grower Randy Hughes about SAF tax credits:","Legislation seeking to create a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production tax credit is looking for cosponsors.

SAF is jet fuel, of which at least 90 percent is derived from synthetic, renewable, and nonpetroleum sources. Beginning in tax year 2028, the credit is equal to $1.50 for each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel produced by a claimant in this state during a taxable year.

For purposes of this legislation, SAF only includes feedstocks grown or sourced domestically from within the U.S. While there’s currently no production of SAF occurring in Wisconsin, the state is in a prime position to become a hub for SAF production, according to bill authors Rep. David Steffen and Sens. Romaine Quinn and Patrick Testin. Lawmakers believe Wisconsin has an edge both geographically and because of its strong agricultural output.

The anticipation from bill authors is that SAF will produce a new market for the farming and timber industries.

At a time when the agricultural sector is facing a myriad of challenges, Wisconsin can support its farmers and timber producers by seizing opportunities for our growing biofuels industry, the authors wrote in a memorandum.

Wisconsin’s biofuels industry adds $4.2 billion to the state’s economy and directly employs over 19,000 people. The SAF tax credit is on the priority lists for both the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation and the Wisconsin Biofuels Association for this legislative session.

In a shocking and dramatic turn of events, American Airlines Flight AA154, en route from Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW) to London Heathrow (LHR), was forced into an emergency diversion to Memphis International Airport (MEM) on April 10, 2025, after smoke mysteriously began to fill the forward cabin just an hour into the flight. The Boeing 777, a massive and normally reliable aircraft, became the center of an unexpected emergency, sending waves of panic throughout the cabin as flight attendants and crew scrambled to handle the crisis. The fact that the plane was less than an hour from its scheduled destination raised significant concerns over the safety of the aircraft and the airline’s preparedness for such incidents.

A Nightmarish 40 Minutes in the Sky

This incident unfolded with all the drama of a high-stakes thriller. After taking off from Dallas at 2:31 UTC, everything appeared to be running smoothly for the 200 passengers aboard the Boeing 777. But the calm was short-lived. Just over an hour into the flight, smoke began seeping into the forward cabin, sending the crew into action mode. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the pilots made the quick decision to divert the flight to Memphis International Airport, a move that may have been a matter of life or death.

As the aircraft made its descent into Memphis, passengers were left on edge, unsure of what was happening in the chaos above them. According to reports from FlightRadar24, the aircraft made a safe but urgent landing at runway 36C in Memphis, touching down at 4:22 UTC—nearly 40 minutes after the initial diversion was initiated. The plane was met with emergency vehicles on the ground, and the passengers’ long ordeal finally came to an end, but not before sparking alarm bells across the aviation world.

The Boeing 777’s Age and Reliability Under Scrutiny

The plane involved in this heart-stopping emergency was a Boeing 777-200ER, registered N761AJ, a 23.1-year-old aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. While these aircraft are usually considered reliable, their age and potential for mechanical wear-and-tear could be a factor in this terrifying scenario. Despite American Airlines’ claims of ensuring “top-notch” maintenance, this incident raises alarm about the true safety of older aircraft in the fleet, especially when faced with unexpected mechanical failures mid-flight.

A History of Alarming Similar Incidents

This emergency landing isn’t the only high-profile incident involving American Airlines aircraft recently. On April 1, 2025, a different American Eagle flight, AA5406, operated by PSA Airlines, was forced into a dramatic evacuation at Augusta Regional Airport (AGS) after smoke filled the cabin following its landing. Passengers were forced to evacuate via the aircraft’s wings, while footage captured by one of the passengers quickly went viral.

The similarities between these incidents are disturbing—both flights involved a smoky cabin and swift actions by the crew to mitigate a major crisis. What’s even more unsettling is the fact that both incidents involved aircrafts operated by American Airlines, raising the question: How many other flights are at risk of similar problems? Could this be a sign of systemic issues within American Airlines’ maintenance protocols?

The FAA’s Investigation: A Deep Dive into Safety Standards

In the aftermath of the dramatic Memphis diversion, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) swiftly launched an investigation into what went wrong with American Airlines Flight 154. Was this simply an isolated mechanical malfunction, or does it point to a deeper problem with the airline’s maintenance practices? As the FAA probes further, the airline’s reputation is at stake, especially with passengers now questioning the airline’s commitment to ensuring flight safety.

This FAA investigation will not only examine the cause of the smoke in the cabin but also scrutinize American Airlines’ overall safety and maintenance procedures. The findings of this investigation will surely have significant implications for the airline industry as a whole—particularly for major carriers like American Airlines, which faces mounting pressure to maintain their safety record after such incidents.

Passenger Panic and Airline Accountability

While the airline’s crew responded swiftly and efficiently to the smoke-filled cabin emergency, it’s hard to ignore the panic and fear passengers experienced during this harrowing ordeal. Many passengers on board have recounted their terrifying experiences, with some saying they could smell something burning as the cabin quickly filled with smoke. “It felt like a scene from a disaster movie,” one passenger said in an interview after landing. Others noted that the cabin’s air was becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, exacerbating their anxiety.

It will supply the fuel to Japanese airline companies for a cleaner alternative to traditional air travel.

As Reuters reported, Cosmo planned production at its Osaka-based Sakai refinery earlier this year. It aimed to produce 30,000 kiloliters of sustainable aviation fuel per year by April.

The company supplies eco-friendly fuel to Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. This commitment is significant because it is Japan's first domestically produced green fuel for airlines.

Cosmo's sustainable fuel is made from cooking oil and is the first large-scale production of its kind in the country. The refiner worked with two other companies to produce it but declined to provide details about the fuel's price and volume.

The news from Japan is encouraging worldwide because of how sustainable aviation fuel can reduce the harmful air pollution associated with traditional plane travel.

The aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global energy pollution. This contribution impacts our planet's overheating and leads to public health risks and extreme weather events.

In other parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel companies like LanzaJet have been creating millions of gallons of alternative fuel to offset air travel pollution. That company's fuel is made from low-carbon intensity ethanol, or grain alcohol, using corn.

Another company, OXCCU, has been creating jet fuel from air pollution using renewable energy and a combination of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

As a traveler, you can look into flying on planes powered by sustainable fuel and support airlines' efforts to embrace fuels with lower carbon impacts. For example, Delta has been actively working to use sustainable fuels to reduce the environmental impact of its flights.

Until sustainable fuel flights become more readily available, you can change the way you travel by embracing train travel and vacationing close to home in places that don't require a flight. When you do fly, consider eco-friendly travel destinations to help minimize your adventures' overall environmental impact.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sustainable-aviation-fuelimage-reci36GfcI80PaIDy.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 13:56:07.584302

Three of the Port Authority of NY & NJ’s major airports may have gotten there before us!

Most travelers are aware that air travel is a major contributor to carbon emissions, and airports themselves can also be massive hubs of energy use with in- and out-going vehicle traffic, bright lighting 24/7, air conditioning and heating, as well the production of vast amounts of waste. The aviation industry, including airports themselves and the planes actually flying, contribute around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, some airports are taking steps to reduce these emissions and become a part of the solution.

All over the planet, airports are embracing sustainability and recognizing the need to make more eco-friendly choices. This includes three of the major airports in the United States’ largest and most famous city, New York – John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), all operated by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.

These three airports are going through major redevelopment projects to embrace renewable energy, move away from fossil fuels where they can, and strategically reducing the volume of waste they produce.

NY Metropolitan Airports Cleared for a Green Landing

JFK and LaGuardia airports collectively serve over 90 million travelers annually — JFK alone handles 63.3 million passengers, and LaGuardia sees 33.5 million. And at Newark Airport, 49 million travelers were served in 2023.

In 2024, a total of 145.9 million air passengers flew through JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, and New York Stewart airports, according to initial estimates. That total surpassed the previous record of 143.8 million set in 2023. To support this level of traffic, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey is responsible for managing a significant portion of the region’s transportation infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, seaports, and airports, all within its designated geographical area. Spanning 1,500 square miles and centered around New York Harbor, it covers parts of 17 New York and New Jersey counties, making it the largest employer in New York State. The Port Authority’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

One of the most exciting projects helping them get there is the recently upgraded electric charging station at JFK. This station has added 24 brand-new EV chargers, bringing the total number of chargers at JFK to 46, open 24/7 to the public to quickly charge their passenger vehicles.

Even better, the chargers are being used for the airport’s own ground fleet of EV vehicles at the airport as well. This aligns with the Port Authority’s net-zero emission goals, which have seen it commit to electrifying its entire light-duty fleet by 2028 and its ground service equipment fleet by 2035.

Gas-powered ground operations and light-duty fleets require enormous amounts of fossil fuel, but by transitioning all their vehicles to electric, that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Imagine, if you will – security vehicles, concessions, baggage carousels, kiosks – all run on electricity generated by renewable energy like solar. That is what New York is working towards. Here’s how: solar-powered terminals.

Running on Sunshine

A brand new, solar-powered sustainable terminal at JFK is already underway and is due to open in 2026.

“The development of the New Terminal One is rooted in resiliency and sustainability, extending from our design and construction to operations and maintenance after we open our doors in 2026. We are building the terminal to withstand challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events, so we remain fully operational no matter the environmental conditions,” says Uzoamaka N. Okoye, Chief of Staff, The New Terminal One (NTO) at JFK.

Okoye explains that NTO is committed to reducing its environmental impact through innovative energy systems. Their state-of-the-art microgrid, built in partnership with AlphaStructure, is key to these efforts. Featuring the largest solar array in New York City and on any U.S. airport, the microgrid will enable them to function independently of the power grid with locally generated and lower carbon energy.

Reducing Waste, Elevating Sustainability

Vehicle carbon emissions are where our minds go when we think of waste at airports. Unfortunately, that is just one part of the problem. Airports also generate huge amounts of waste every single day, from plastic food packaging to lavatory water, uneaten food to deplaned waste to oil, grease spills to single-use plastic bottles. This list is long and daunting. When was the last time you made it through an airport without throwing something away?

But for most travelers, sustainability is not top of mind when we are rushing to a gate or trying to fill up on food between flights. For most of us, convenience is always going to win out over reducing waste.

Fortunately, the Port Authority is taking steps to mitigate this and make it easier to dispose of our trash properly. Revamping their recycling policy is the first step, by having clear and separated receptacles for different recyclable items helps to make sure waste is at least handled properly at the airport and “to get the most use out of waste-bound materials as possible in order to avoid landfilling,” says Alexandria Cassidy, lead on zero-waste at the Port Authority.

She is absolutely right!

One of the more significant issues with our recycling system in the United States is improper waste sorting and insufficient facilities to handle the waste, especially plastics. These clearly labeled bins are a start in helping to keep the waste in the right place while maintaining convenience for passengers. Ultimately, EARTHDAY.ORG would like to see a drastic reduction in the use of single-use plastics at airports, across the U.S., and globally, and a move towards more eco-friendly alternatives like water refilling stations, bamboo cutlery, paper, and reusable glass bottles.

With the redevelopment of the new Terminal 6 at JFK, “Sustainability is a top priority for us and has been built into the design of T6, with floor-to-ceiling windows, over 6,000 rooftop solar panels, energy-efficient baggage systems, and graywater collection and reuse throughout the terminal,” said Rishali Chaplot, Manager, Environment and Sustainability at JFK Millennium Partners. “Both during the construction of T6 and its operation in 2026, we aim to divert as much waste as possible by implementing various waste recycling and composting guidelines across all our products and vendors. Through January of this year, our waste diversion rate at the construction site was 98.87% — a figure we are very proud of.”

Doing the Right Thing = Saving Money

LaGuardia Airport’s newly developed $5.1 billion Terminal B stands as a prime example of sustainable design that ultimately is good for the bottom line as well. The Terminal earned a LEED v4 Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). This recognition makes it the world’s first airline terminal to meet these advanced environmental standards, highlighting the airport’s commitment to sustainability.

Its design has allowed LaGuardia to save more — reducing its water bills by 43% and its energy costs by 18%. This has been achieved through reduced window glazing, installation of a specialist roof that reflects solar heat, using solar water heaters, and light-sensitive artificial lighting control. Every aspect of Terminal B is designed to maximize efficiency and minimize waste. This ambitious project reflects LaGuardia Airport’s ongoing efforts to lead in both eco-conscious infrastructure and innovation.

In November 2023, the Port Authority announced that Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal A achieved LEED Gold certification by the USGBC for leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the most widely used green-building rating system in the world and an international symbol of environmental responsibility.

The one-million-square-foot Terminal A at Newark Airport features a variety of sustainable design elements, including the largest solar rooftop installation at any U.S. airport atop the terminal’s parking deck, new electric buses to support shuttle operations, water-efficient fixtures reducing potable water demand by more than 45 percent, a cool roof designed to reflect sunlight, absorbing less solar energy and reducing the heat gain on the building, and energy-efficient indoor lighting and controls. In achieving LEED Gold, the project meets the Port Authority’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing annual energy costs by an estimated 30 percent.

“The LEED Gold designation exemplifies the agency’s commitment to environmental sustainability and being a good neighbor,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “By establishing rigorous building standards and adopting aggressive measures to reduce our carbon footprint, we are creating a healthier environment and striving to improve the quality of life for those in the region we serve.”

Newark Liberty also provides charging and electrical infrastructure to enable airlines to transition to electric ground-support equipment (GSE) across the terminal. The agency’s 2022 Zero Emission Airside Vehicle Rule mandates the conversion of all GSE to electric models by 2030, where commercially available. It’s satisfying to see major airports taking responsibility and recognizing their role in cutting carbon emissions and reducing waste.

Like the Port Authority, we see the shining benefits of renewable energy—whether through solar, wind, or other sustainable sources. Beyond their environmental impact, renewable energy helps to lower operational costs, proving that sustainability and financial savings go hand in hand. As more airports and industries embrace these green technologies, they not only contribute to a healthier planet but showcase that renewable energy is both a smart financial decision and a critical step toward a sustainable future for all.",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Creating-a-Green-Sky.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 15:56:33.314719

MOPCO has also recorded a 7.2% increase in working capital, reaching EGP 12.360 billion. Total investment has increased by 6.5%, amounting to EGP 53.840 billion.

In addition, the company’s equity saw notable growth, reaching EGP 45.380 billion, a 4.9% rise from 2023 and an astounding 800% increase since 2015.

The results were announced during the company’s general assembly meeting, held in the presence of the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Karim Badawi, along with officials from the petroleum sector.

In the meeting, Badawi underscored the importance of the petrochemical industry for the petroleum sector, given its added value to natural resources. He pointed out that investors’ interest in petroleum projects is a true reflection of the attractiveness of its investment climate.

For his part, Ahmed Mahmoud, the Chairman and Managing Director of MOPCO, reviewed the company’s primary results in line with the pillars of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources (MoPMR). He highlighted the company’s commitment to occupational safety and health standards, boosting production efficiency, and adopting sustainable practices to achieve Egypt’s vision in sustainable development goals.

The company recorded four million hours of work with no injuries during 2024, increasing total number of safe working hours to 19 million since 2018.

Mahmoud said that MOPCO was able to increase 10% of the production capacity of its MOPCO 3 plant, located in the Damietta Industrial Complex. Coming earlier than expected, the increase was the result of replacing the HPCC unit, leading to a $2 million boost in the company’s revenues.

In the area of urea and ammonia production, MOPCO has surpassed its targets, with sales amounting to 1,741,000 tons and 116,000 tons respectively. The company exported 947,000 tons of urea and allocated 795,000 tons to the local market. Notably, the European market is the largest destination for MOPCO’s urea exports, accounting for 89%. For ammonia, the company exported 48,000 tons and allocated 68,000 tons to the local market.

Mahmoud explained that MOPCO is currently implementing several projects, including a project focused on upgrading and developing its plants’ efficiency to increase production and rationalize natural gas consumption. The company has also started its production of ADBlue–a urea-based solution to reduce diesel engine emissions.

Moreover, MOPCO is developing a green ammonia production project in cooperation with the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (EGPC) and the Norwegian company Scatec, collaborating with Damietta Green Ammonia Company, and holding 25% of the shares. It has also signed a 15-year purchase agreement with the Norwegian company Yara Clean Ammonia.

MOPCO also holds 20% of the shares in the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel (ESAF) Company. Additionally, it is implementing a carbon dioxide recovery unit from the smokestack of plant 1–the first project of its kind in Africa and the Middle East to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

The company will be taking part in two projects in El Alamein: one of them to produce soda ash and its derivatives, and another to produce silicon products. It is also expected to produce technical-grade urea to help reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. In addition to that, it is installing solar panels that generate 4 megawatts by 2026, Mahmoud said.

In respect of social responsibility, MOPCO allocated EGP 39 million throughout the year to supporting numerous initiatives and projects across Egypt, particularly in Damietta, where it implemented a range of infrastructure development projects, and participated in initiatives supporting education, health, and civil society. MOPCO has also been awarded the ISO 26000 certification for social responsibility.

MOPCO places a strong emphasis on developing human capital, offering a total of 1,710 training opportunities annually across a wide range of fields, as highlighted by Mahmoud.

It is worth mentioning that the Company’s general assembly has approved the Board of Directors’ proposal to distribute cash dividends to shareholders at EGP 3.5 per share.

정부 ""SAF 의무화 비율 및 R&D 준비 중""

10일 찾은 대전 SK이노베이션 환경과학기술원. 식용유보다 맑고 노란 빛의 기름병을 여니 주유소 기름 냄새가 코를 찔렀다. SK에너지가 만든 지속가능항공유(Sustainable Aviation Fuel·SAF). 폐식용유 같은 바이오원료를 석유 원료와 섞어 뽑아낸 비행기용 연료다. 환경 보호를 위해 전 세계적으로 SAF 도입 의무화 바람이 불면서 정유사 간 시장 선점 경쟁이 치열한데 SK에너지가 출사표를 던졌다.

치킨 튀긴 식용유가 비행기 연료가 된다... SAF가 뭐길래?

SAF로 항공유 전체를 대체하기에는 무리가 있어 현재는 SAF를 항공유와 섞어 쓴다. 두 가지 방법이 있는데 하나는 100% SAF를 만든 다음 항공유에 원하는 만큼 물리적으로 섞는 것이고 또 하나는 생산 설비에 바이오원료와 석유 원료를 함께 넣고 공정을 거쳐 원하는 비율의 SAF를 생산하는 식으로 '코 프로세싱(Co-processing)'이라 불린다.

이를 커피에 비유하면 전자는 원두(바이오원료)로 에스프레소(100% SAF)를 만든 다음 물(항공유)을 섞어 아메리카노를 만드는 식이라면, 후자는 원두(바이오원료)와 물(석유원료)을 시작부터 한 번에 넣고 우려내 콜드브루를 제조하는 식에 가깝다.

SK에너지는 자체 코 프로세싱 방식으로 시장에 뛰어들었다. 대전 기술원에서 연구개발(R&D)을 통해 공정을 설계하고 2024년 9월 국내 최초로 울산에 150억 원을 들여 전용 생산 라인을 갖췄다. 폐식용유를 중국·인도 등에서 들여와 연간 10만 톤 수준의 5% SAF를 만들고 있다. 이 SAF는 유럽·캐세이퍼시픽항공·에어부산·대한항공 등에 보내진다.

정호승 SK이노베이션 지속가능Fuel 기술팀 팀장은 ""바이오원료를 섞으면 불순물 종류나 함량, 촉매 반응 결과, 저장 안정성 등이 달라져 R&D가 필요했다""며 ""바이오원료의 저장, 반응, 제품 생산까지 밸류 체인을 단계별로 연구했고 생길 수 있는 문제의 해법을 만들어 대량생산을 해냈다""고 설명했다.

에쓰오일·HD현대오일뱅크·GS칼텍스 등 다른 정유사들도 기존 생산 설비에서 코 프로세싱 공정으로 SAF를 만들어 국내외로 판매 중이다.

시장 커지는데 국산 100% SAF 생산은 언제쯤

탄소중립 움직임에 발맞춰 SAF 시장은 연 평균 46.2%씩 크게 성장해 2034년 746억 달러(108조 9,600억 원) 규모가 될 것이란 예측이 나온다. 특히 유엔 산하 국제민간항공기구(ICAO)의 국제항공 탄소상쇄·감축제도(CORSIA) 의무화에 따라 2027년부터 한국 등 193개 회원국은 국제 항공 온실가스 배출량을 2019년의 85%로 줄여야만 해 SAF가 필수적이다.

유럽연합(EU)은 올해 의무 비율을 2%로 시작해 2050년에는 70%까지 올린단 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 전체를 SAF로 대체한다는 목표다. 아시아에서는 일본이 2030년부터 10% 의무화를 로드맵을 발표했다.

업계에서는 전통 항공유 수출 1위 국가인 한국이 100% SAF 생산 설비를 갖추는 등 시장 경쟁력을 키워야 한다는 목소리가 나온다. 하지만 정유사들은 조 단위 투자가 필요해 적극 뛰어들기를 망설인다. 정부 지원이 필요하다는 얘기가 나오는 이유다. 일본은 석유화학기업인 이데미쓰고산의 생산 설비에 2,570억 원을 투입하고 생산 세액 공제 제도도 마련했다.",https://newsimg-hams.hankookilbo.com/2025/04/10/f701202c-6bab-438a-a4bf-2ef6b5ff09c3.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 12:56:25.706343

Qantas and Airbus have jointly committed $15 million to the fund to be managed by Sydney and Melbourne firm Climate Tech Partners.

The fund will focus on innovations in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) but will also invest in other technologies which will help decarbonise the aviation sector. The fund will mainly invest in Australia but will have capacity to invest globally.

According to a joint announcement by Qantas and Airbus on April 7, the new fund will offer early-stage technology companies mentorship and strategic support as well as investment capital.

Qantas chief sustainability officer Fiona Messent said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool we have to decarbonise aviation and, with Airbus, we’re investing significantly in ways to make it more available and accessible.

“As well as funding, this partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated into the SAF supply chain while also providing companies with access to Qantas and Airbus as they develop and test their solutions.”

The investment capital will be drawn from the 2022-established $US200 million ($318 million) Qantas-Airbus SAF partnership fund.

“For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit, so it’s fantastic to be collaborating across industries to accelerate local production,” Messent added.

Airbus chief sustainability officer Julie Kitcher said: “Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors; from airlines, manufactures and airports to regulators, governments and investors.”

She said she believed Australia was well positioned to be a leader in low carbon fuels and investment in the sector could generate new jobs.

Co-founder of Climate Tech Partners Patrick Sieb said: “Working with global leading aviation and aerospace companies allows us to not only make more deeply informed investment decisions in this complex area but attract and support the best companies by helping them accelerate through industry engagement.”

Sydney and Melbourne firm Climate Tech Partners was set up Sieb and Tom Kline last year. The pair previously raised a Climate Tech Fund for Investible.

The project aims to establish a fully integrated Ethanol to Jet (EtJ) facility that converts bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite into 100% SAF, using proprietary PureSAF technology supplied from KBR, while also generating all of the project’s energy requirements from renewable sources. This unique vertically integrated and energy self-sufficient approach sets it apart from other SAF and EtJ projects globally.

It is anticipated that the facility will annually produce up to 96 million liters of SAF, which will be delivered to nearby airports. Early modelling indicates a potential lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 70 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.

This project is in line with the larger Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that Qatar Airways and Virgin Australia signed in October 2024. The MoU cemented their intent to collaborate on sustainability initiatives that aim to reduce carbon emissions in air travel and advance the use of SAF and Low Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) in Australia.

Commentary from Renewable Developments Australia

Tony D’Alessandro, managing director of Renewable Developments Australia, stated that the partnership with Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways is a significant step toward the establishment of a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. “We are pleased to collaborate with two well-known airlines worldwide who share our goal of establishing a domestic supply of sustainable aviation fuel. This project is designed to deliver real, long-term emission reductions while building a new industry in regional Queensland.

“Our ethanol-to-jet SAF facility in the Charters Towers Region will be a fully integrated production site, generating sustainable fuel from bioethanol derived from locally grown sugarcane. Additionally, we are establishing a new standard for sustainability in the production of aviation fuel by reusing SAF byproducts to generate on-site renewable power. “This initiative is more than just a step toward decarbonizing air travel; it represents a significant investment in Australia’s energy security and regional economic development,” according to the initiative’s website. Virgin Australia’s perspective Virgin Australia Chief Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer Christian Bennett said the project had close alignment with the priorities in the Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways MoU.

He stated, “The commercial aviation sector in Australia, and indeed the entire world, faces an enormous task in working towards a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, which we cannot do alone.” “Working together with industry partners and government to establish a domestic SAF industry in Australia will be essential — not only to achieve these shared emissions goals but to strengthen Australia’s liquid fuel security by reducing reliance on global supply chains and creating new, secure jobs for those living in regional Australia.

“We are delighted to be working with our strategic partner, Qatar Airways, and the team at RDA to try and bring this project to life. Our Memorandum of Understanding with Qatar Airways strongly aligns this task with advancing SAF and LCAF certification, production, and commercial adoption through strategic collaborations, with an emphasis on investing in Australia.

Abang Johari who is also Minister for Finance and New Economy was delivering his ministerial winding-up speech at DUN yesterday (May 24).
Abang Johari believed that microalgae is an industrial crop that could help to expand and grow the state’s economy and serve as a model to achieve our aspirations while preserving the environment.
“Microalgae offer great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is crucial to the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
“I believe microalgae is a renewable source that can offer us a sustainable solution that does not compete with food sources.","THE Sarawak government will continue to pursue research on microalgae on its nutritional and medical benefits, and is looking into other algae species for their potential medical applications.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg said the microalgae offers potential for innovative and sustainable product development in the food industry.

“There are many algae species that have been found to have tremendous health benefits, and spirulina is a good example of a superfood. Spirulina is packed with essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which make it a popular supplement for health-conscious individuals.

“But beyond spirulina, we are also looking into other algae species for their potential medical applications. For instance, some algae have been found to have antibacterial and antiviral properties, which can help in the fight against infectious diseases,” he said.

Abang Johari who is also Minister for Finance and New Economy was delivering his ministerial winding-up speech at DUN yesterday (May 24).

He said, additionally algae may be used to reduce inflammation, detoxify the body, boost the immune system, and even aid in weight loss.

He told the august House that there are two facilities cultivating algae with different technologies, with the first facility, on solar platform, which is a collaboration between Sarawak Energy, Sarawak Biodiversity Centre, Eneos Corporation and Chitose Group from Japan at Sejingkat.

“The other facility is employing the use of tanks and sea water. This is a collaboration between Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) Energy and Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) in Demak Laut,” he said.

Sarawak, he said, has also taken a progressive step to explore microalgae as a potential source of renewable energy, where Sarawak Biodiversity Centre, in collaboration with Sarawak Energy Berhad as well as Chitose Laboratory and Eneos Corporation from Japan has established the world’s largest mass microalgae biomass production facility, Chitose Carbon Capture Central (C4), spanning about five hectares in Sejingkat, Kuching.

“The C4 will tap into the exhausted gas containing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Sejingkat Coal Power Plant to grow algae in a carbon circular economy.

“This is the first of its kind in Malaysia to demonstrate the industrial-scale utilisation of flue gas to enhance algae production. This 5-hectare facility will act as ‘liquid trees’ to capture CO2 while functioning as a natural purifier by releasing oxygen through photosynthesis,” he said.

Abang Johari believed that microalgae is an industrial crop that could help to expand and grow the state’s economy and serve as a model to achieve our aspirations while preserving the environment.

“This facility will also serve as part of net zero emissions efforts with an expected 700 tonnes of CO2 that can be absorbed by the algae biomass, and will produce around 350 tonnes of algae biomass annually. This will be transformed into high- quality products such as food and feedstock, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical ingredients,” he said.

He added the commercialisation of algae has only just begun.

“We anticipate significant growth in this industry with the planning of the Chitose group to expand the farm to 100 hectares in the next three years and to achieve 2,000 hectares by 2030 in Sarawak.

“We expect to create up to 5,000 new job opportunities and decarbonisation of about 200,000 tonnes of carbon annually,” he said.

On a related note, he said Sarawak has the capacity to provide a green fuel solution from a sustainable source.

“Microalgae offer great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is crucial to the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

“I just came back from Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) exhibition using aircraft powered by SAF, from a joint venture between PETRONAS and SEDC Energy. It is the world’s first SAF produced using algae. This clearly proves Sarawak is able to produce safe and reliable SAF for commercial use.

“I believe microalgae is a renewable source that can offer us a sustainable solution that does not compete with food sources.

“Here in Sarawak, there is enough sunlight, warm tropical climate and abundance of seawater that provides the right conditions to continuously farm the oil source sustainably,” said Abang Johari.",https://www.sarawaktribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8adeb426-f85a-4e2e-8570-85e3755c3237.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 11:57:59.530303

항공유 1위 한국도 100% SAF 생산 시급

막대한 투자 규모에 정유사 선뜻 못 나서

정부 ""SAF 의무화 비율 및 R&D 준비 중""

10일 찾은 대전 SK이노베이션 환경과학기술원. 식용유보다 맑고 노란 빛의 기름병을 여니 주유소 기름 냄새가 코를 찔렀다. SK에너지가 만든 지속가능항공유(Sustainable Aviation Fuel·SAF). 폐식용유 같은 바이오원료를 석유 원료와 섞어 뽑아낸 비행기용 연료다. 환경 보호를 위해 전 세계적으로 SAF 도입 의무화 바람이 불면서 정유사 간 시장 선점 경쟁이 치열한데 SK에너지가 출사표를 던졌다.

치킨 튀긴 식용유가 비행기 연료가 된다... SAF가 뭐길래?

SAF로 항공유 전체를 대체하기에는 무리가 있어 현재는 SAF를 항공유와 섞어 쓴다. 두 가지 방법이 있는데 하나는 100% SAF를 만든 다음 항공유에 원하는 만큼 물리적으로 섞는 것이고 또 하나는 생산 설비에 바이오원료와 석유 원료를 함께 넣고 공정을 거쳐 원하는 비율의 SAF를 생산하는 식으로 '코 프로세싱(Co-processing)'이라 불린다.

이를 커피에 비유하면 전자는 원두(바이오원료)로 에스프레소(100% SAF)를 만든 다음 물(항공유)을 섞어 아메리카노를 만드는 식이라면, 후자는 원두(바이오원료)와 물(석유원료)을 시작부터 한 번에 넣고 우려내 콜드브루를 제조하는 식에 가깝다.

SK에너지는 자체 코 프로세싱 방식으로 시장에 뛰어들었다. 대전 기술원에서 연구개발(R&D)을 통해 공정을 설계하고 2024년 9월 국내 최초로 울산에 150억 원을 들여 전용 생산 라인을 갖췄다. 폐식용유를 중국·인도 등에서 들여와 연간 10만 톤 수준의 5% SAF를 만들고 있다. 이 SAF는 유럽·캐세이퍼시픽항공·에어부산·대한항공 등에 보내진다.

정호승 SK이노베이션 지속가능Fuel 기술팀 팀장은 ""바이오원료를 섞으면 불순물 종류나 함량, 촉매 반응 결과, 저장 안정성 등이 달라져 R&D가 필요했다""며 ""바이오원료의 저장, 반응, 제품 생산까지 밸류 체인을 단계별로 연구했고 생길 수 있는 문제의 해법을 만들어 대량생산을 해냈다""고 설명했다.

에쓰오일·HD현대오일뱅크·GS칼텍스 등 다른 정유사들도 기존 생산 설비에서 코 프로세싱 공정으로 SAF를 만들어 국내외로 판매 중이다.

시장 커지는데 국산 100% SAF 생산은 언제쯤

탄소중립 움직임에 발맞춰 SAF 시장은 연 평균 46.2%씩 크게 성장해 2034년 746억 달러(108조 9,600억 원) 규모가 될 것이란 예측이 나온다. 특히 유엔 산하 국제민간항공기구(ICAO)의 국제항공 탄소상쇄·감축제도(CORSIA) 의무화에 따라 2027년부터 한국 등 193개 회원국은 국제 항공 온실가스 배출량을 2019년의 85%로 줄여야만 해 SAF가 필수적이다.

유럽연합(EU)은 올해 의무 비율을 2%로 시작해 2050년에는 70%까지 올린단 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 전체를 SAF로 대체한다는 목표다. 아시아에서는 일본이 2030년부터 10% 의무화를 로드맵을 발표했다.

업계에서는 전통 항공유 수출 1위 국가인 한국이 100% SAF 생산 설비를 갖추는 등 시장 경쟁력을 키워야 한다는 목소리가 나온다. 하지만 정유사들은 조 단위 투자가 필요해 적극 뛰어들기를 망설인다. 정부 지원이 필요하다는 얘기가 나오는 이유다. 일본은 석유화학기업인 이데미쓰고산의 생산 설비에 2,570억 원을 투입하고 생산 세액 공제 제도도 마련했다.",https://newsimg-hams.hankookilbo.com/2025/04/10/f701202c-6bab-438a-a4bf-2ef6b5ff09c3.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 11:58:06.192737

Stephen Murphy, CEO of AV AirFinance, said: “We are delighted to be a long-term strategic partner of Vietjet. This new commitment reflects our strong relationship and willingness to support Vietjet’s resurgent growth in the Asia-Pacific region via new generation aircraft.”

In 2025, Vietjet will begin taking delivery of the first batch of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from its landmark order of 200 aircraft, valued at over US$24 billion. The deal was originally announced on February 27, 2019, in Vietnam, in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. As part of its global growth strategy, the airline is currently in discussions to further expand this historic order.

In addition to its collaboration with Boeing, Vietjet has established long-term strategic partnerships with several major U.S. corporations, including GE, Pratt & Whitney, and Honeywell, with total contract values reaching approximately US$50 billion. Ongoing negotiations are expected to add a further US$14 billion. Notably, Vietjet’s engine and technical service agreements with GE and Pratt & Whitney alone now exceed a combined value of US$10 billion. The airline is also deepening its technology partnerships with leading U.S. firms such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google, while exploring collaboration with SpaceX to integrate advanced technologies across its fleet. These high-value contracts are poised to contribute significantly to reducing the trade imbalance between Vietnam and the United States in the near future.

Dr. Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, Chairwoman of Vietjet, congratulated the signing event and affirmed: “I am steadfast in my commitment to working tirelessly and fostering global partnerships that help bridge cultures, economies, and technologies between Vietnam, the United States, and the wider world.”

With a strategic focus on developing a modern fleet and a global flight network, Vietjet currently operates a fleet of over 115 new, fuel-efficient aircraft, with more than 400 additional aircraft on order.

The company noted it secured the best financing terms in its history for the first 25 MAX 8s on order.","As spotted by ch-aviation, Norwegian Air has announced plans to transition to an all- Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet by 2030, according to its 2024 annual report released on April 10. The low-cost airline aims to meet its climate goal of reducing CO₂ emissions by 45 percent by that year, a target that hinges on using a fleet of exclusively MAX 8 aircraft powered by a 20 percent blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The 737 MAX 8s are an important part of Norwegian's long-term sustainability and cost-cutting plan since they are more fuel-efficient than the older 737-800 NGs that are already in service.

The shift to a single aircraft type supports operational efficiency, environmental performance, and financial flexibility, the carrier said. Norwegian began ordering the MAX 8s in 2022, with 50 aircraft on the way between 2025 and 2028 and options for 30 more, according to the report. The transition marks a move toward owning more of its fleet rather than leasing, which helps lower costs over time. The airline says SAF and fleet modernization are critical to reaching climate goals, assuming an 80% reduction in life-cycle emissions from SAF.

Sustainability Drives Fleet Strategy

Norwegian's decision to focus solely on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is primarily driven by sustainability goals. According to the airline's annual report, ""Norwegian's 737 aircraft can fly on up to 50 percent certified SAF today,"" with a 20 percent blend needed to meet its 2030 emission reduction target. That goal assumes the entire fleet is composed of MAX 8s, thanks to the model’s lower fuel consumption and emissions.

These planes are equipped with advanced LEAP-1B engines and winglets that significantly improve fuel efficiency compared to older models, according to Norwegian's website. The B737 MAX 8 also offers Norwegian operational benefits such as lower fuel costs, better environmental performance, and improved passenger experience.

In response to Simple Flying's inquiry, the airline referred inquiries back to the investor relations webpages for additional details.

Fleet Expansion Slows Due To Boeing Delays

While Norwegian is committed to growing its fleet, delivery delays from Boeing have impacted short-term expansion plans. The airline now expects to operate 88 aircraft by summer 2025, slightly below its earlier estimate of 90, according to FlightGlobal. Despite this, CEO Geir Karlsen remains optimistic, noting that three new MAX 8s have already been delivered this year, and production rates appear to be improving.

""We do anticipate to take delivery of 11 to 13 aircraft during 2025,"" Karlsen said in a recent earnings call in February, which would bring the total fleet size to between 94 and 96 aircraft by the end of the year. Most of the MAX 8s are set to replace older Boeing 737-800 NGs, which currently make up the majority of Norwegian's mainline fleet.

Karlsen has stated that the production rate at Boeing is improving, allowing Norwegian to better plan for the peak travel season. Despite slower deliveries, the fleet upgrade remains on track, with the MAX 8s gradually replacing older 737-800 NGs, the carrier said.

Financial Stability Supports Long-Term Goals

In Q1 2025, Norwegian acquired 10 Boeing 737-800s previously on lease, furthering its plan to own more of its aircraft, according to the annual report. The company noted it secured the best financing terms in its history for the first 25 MAX 8s on order. Even with capacity growth slowing to 4 percent in 2025, compared to 13 percent the year before, Norwegian is prioritizing profitability and fleet efficiency over rapid expansion. A profitability program is also underway to manage rising costs, currency impacts, and prepare for the future.

With an operational profit of NOK 1.87 billion in 2024, the second-highest in the company's history, Norwegian maintained a strong financial position. Revenues grew to NOK 35.3 billion, a 38 percent increase year-over-year, supported by the integration of Widerøe, Norwegian's regional subsidiary. The group's total fleet at the end of 2024 was 135 aircraft, including 49 from Widerøe and 86 from Norwegian itself.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/se-rtj_737_max_norwegian_vby_01-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 17:56:06.583901

US President Donald Trump tariffs are now threatening to significantly impact the premium inflight offerings of major U.S. carriers, Delta and United Airlines. With the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European goods, including luxury French Champagne, passengers flying in premium cabins may soon find that their favorite bubbles are no longer available at 35,000 feet. Both airlines, known for their investment in high-end passenger experiences, have long relied on prestigious French Champagne to elevate their service in business and first class. This shift in policy could redefine luxury travel for high-end passengers, forcing airlines to reassess their premium service offerings.

Delta and United Airlines have cultivated their reputation by offering premium products, such as Taittinger Brut Reserve and Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée, to attract affluent travelers. These signature brands have helped distinguish these carriers in a competitive market, where service quality is paramount. However, the proposed tariffs threaten to increase costs, potentially forcing both airlines to swap these renowned labels for more cost-effective alternatives, such as domestic sparkling wines. If the tariffs proceed as planned, this could alter the premium travel landscape, challenging the airlines’ ability to maintain the luxury experience that high-end travelers expect.

Delta Air Lines (DL) and United Airlines (UA), two of the largest US carriers, are facing a challenge to their premium inflight service offerings, specifically regarding the high-end Champagne served in their business and first-class cabins. With the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European imports, including luxury French Champagne, Delta and United might be forced to rethink their inflight beverage offerings. These tariffs, which initially set at 20% before being temporarily paused, have raised significant concerns in the aviation industry. For airlines that have invested heavily in their premium cabins to attract affluent international travelers, the tariff-induced price increases could threaten partnerships with prestigious Champagne houses and undermine the luxury experience they offer to premium passengers.

Impact of Trump’s Tariffs on Luxury Inflight Offerings

The tariffs on French wines, including Champagne, come as part of the broader economic policies promoted by the Trump administration, which seeks to reduce dependence on foreign imports while boosting domestic production. However, these tariffs threaten to disrupt one of the key selling points for premium cabins on international flights — luxurious inflight dining experiences. For Delta and United, whose business models rely on offering an upscale experience to attract high-value international travelers, the removal of premium Champagne could affect their competitive positioning.

In February 2025, Delta introduced Taittinger Brut Reserve Champagne in its Delta One cabins, and United Airlines followed suit in January 2025 with Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée in its Polaris Business Class. These Champagne selections are associated with European sophistication and elegance, helping to differentiate these airlines from their competitors in a highly competitive market. Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Qatar Airways, all major players in the luxury travel segment, have long been known for their exceptional inflight service, including fine wines and Champagne. By serving renowned French Champagne, Delta and United positioned themselves as rivals in the luxury market, catering to travelers who value exclusive in-flight experiences.

Tariffs on European Goods and Potential Consequences

The tariff proposals, which initially imposed a 20% duty on European products, threaten the very foundation of the high-end service that both airlines have worked to develop. Although the 20% tariff was paused for 90 days, a potential 10% tariff remains a significant concern. If the tariffs move forward as planned, Delta and United may face cost increases on the French Champagne they serve, which could lead to substantial financial strain. These price hikes may force the airlines to reconsider their premium drink offerings, particularly as they balance profitability with customer satisfaction.

Airlines like Delta and United may have negotiated favorable deals with Champagne producers in the past, securing reduced prices in exchange for brand exposure to affluent passengers. However, the introduction of tariffs could unravel these partnerships, as the price increase would make it difficult for the airlines to absorb the added cost. As the cost of serving luxury French Champagne rises, the airlines may look to more cost-effective alternatives, such as domestic sparkling wines from California’s Napa Valley. While wineries like Schramsberg and Domaine Carneros produce high-quality sparkling wines, they lack the same global recognition and allure as prestigious Champagne brands like Taittinger and Laurent-Perrier.

Luxury Inflight Service and Airline Competitiveness

The decision to serve premium Champagne is not simply a matter of taste; it is a critical differentiator for airlines looking to attract premium-paying customers. Business and first-class passengers are not just paying for a seat; they are purchasing an experience. The inclusion of French Champagne has long been seen as a symbol of luxury, class, and international sophistication. In a crowded marketplace where airlines compete to offer the best service, losing such a signature luxury offering could diminish the perceived value of an airline’s premium cabins.

For Delta and United, the stakes are particularly high. Both airlines have made significant investments in their premium services in recent years, hoping to capture more of the lucrative international business market. Delta’s Taittinger Brut Reserve and United’s Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée have been central to their efforts to create a luxurious, world-class inflight experience. However, with the tariffs in place, the airlines may be forced to reduce their focus on high-end, international luxury, shifting towards more affordable domestic products. This shift could dilute the premium experience, impacting brand perception and potentially alienating loyal passengers who expect top-tier offerings.

Economic Impact and Cost-Cutting Measures

Delta and United Airlines are already grappling with cost-cutting measures due to softer demand for domestic travel. The broader economic environment, marked by inflation and changing consumer behavior, has created additional pressure on airlines to remain profitable while maintaining their premium services. Although international premium travel remains relatively stable, the uncertainty in global economic conditions has led both carriers to assess their inflight offerings carefully.

A major concern for both airlines is the broader impact of the tariffs on inbound international traffic. In recent months, data has shown a significant decline in the number of visitors to the United States, with a 17% decrease in visitors from Western Europe in March 2025 compared to the previous year. This reduction in inbound travel, coupled with high tariff costs, could make it more difficult for airlines to maintain profitability on their international routes, particularly in premium cabins.

For United, the situation is even more pressing. The airline is expected to release its Q1 financial results soon, which will shed more light on how tariffs and changing travel patterns are impacting revenue from its high-margin Polaris business-class product. With fewer international passengers traveling to the US and higher operational costs, airlines may need to rethink their pricing strategies and make tough decisions about how to balance luxury service with financial sustainability.

Policy Impacts on Airline Strategy

The Trump administration’s policy of imposing tariffs on European goods, including Champagne, could have long-lasting consequences on the competitive positioning of US airlines. Premium cabin passengers—corporate travelers, frequent flyers, and affluent tourists—are often willing to pay a premium for the added luxury and comfort of international flights. By removing the prestige of French Champagne from inflight service, US carriers like Delta and United risk losing a key differentiating feature in a market where Middle Eastern and Asian carriers offer unparalleled luxury experiences.

In this context, the tariffs are not just an economic issue but a branding challenge for US airlines. For Delta and United, the presence of luxury French Champagne is part of their strategy to appeal to high-spending international travelers who expect top-tier service. Removing these signature items could lead to a decline in brand perception, especially among travelers accustomed to exceptional service and luxury offerings. Without these distinctive touches, these airlines may find it harder to justify their premium fares, particularly on international routes where competition is fierce.

Looking Ahead: Strategic Decisions for Delta and United Airlines

As both Delta and United evaluate the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, they face a strategic dilemma: should they absorb the cost increases associated with tariffs or redefine luxury for the post-tariff era? The future of luxury inflight service hinges on how airlines choose to respond to these challenges. While serving domestic sparkling wines may be a viable cost-saving solution, it is uncertain whether it will meet the expectations of discerning passengers who value European sophistication.

In the coming months, both airlines will likely need to make critical decisions about how to balance the cost of premium products with the overall luxury experience they offer. The tariffs have forced airlines to reevaluate their offerings and adjust to a new economic reality. As Delta and United adapt, they must continue to innovate and offer an exceptional travel experience to retain their competitive edge in the global aviation market.

Conclusion

The proposed Trump tariffs on European goods present a significant challenge to the luxury inflight offerings of Delta and United Airlines. With the potential removal of premium French Champagne from business and first-class cabins, these airlines face tough choices regarding how to maintain their competitive edge in the premium travel market. As they navigate these challenges, their ability to balance cost-efficiency with luxury service will be critical to maintaining their standing in the global aviation sector. The coming months will be crucial as these carriers evaluate how to adapt to a post-tariff world and continue to attract high-value passengers.

Delta Airlines and United Airlines: A Comparative Analysis of Two Aviation Giants

Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are two of the largest and most influential carriers in the global aviation industry. With extensive networks, a focus on premium services, and a strong presence in both domestic and international markets, these airlines have shaped the evolution of modern air travel. However, despite their shared prominence, Delta and United have followed distinct strategies to maintain and grow their businesses, especially in an increasingly competitive landscape marked by economic challenges, changing consumer preferences, and evolving industry regulations.

Delta Airlines: A Focus on Customer Experience and Operational Excellence

Delta Air Lines, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, has long been recognized for its operational excellence and customer-centric approach. The airline, which traces its origins back to 1924, has consistently ranked highly in terms of customer satisfaction and service reliability. Delta operates a massive domestic network, but its international reach is also impressive, with key hubs in cities like New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), and Atlanta (ATL).

One of the cornerstones of Delta’s strategy is its focus on improving the passenger experience. The airline has made substantial investments in its fleet, with modern aircraft featuring advanced amenities such as larger cabins, more comfortable seating, and in-flight entertainment. Delta’s premium services, particularly in its Delta One business class, have been key to attracting high-value international passengers. For example, the recent introduction of Taittinger Brut Reserve Champagne in Delta One is a testament to the airline’s commitment to offering a premium travel experience for its business-class customers.

Delta has also been a leader in customer loyalty programs, particularly with its SkyMiles program. By offering a wide range of benefits for frequent flyers, such as access to exclusive lounges and priority boarding, Delta has solidified a loyal customer base. Additionally, the airline has focused on improving its operational efficiency, with a strong emphasis on on-time performance, a critical factor in maintaining customer satisfaction.

In terms of sustainability, Delta has set ambitious goals, including a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030. The airline has invested in more fuel-efficient aircraft, adopted sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, and implemented various eco-friendly practices within its operations.

United Airlines: Global Expansion and Market Leadership

United Airlines, based in Chicago, Illinois, is another aviation powerhouse with an extensive global network. Like Delta, United has deep roots in the American aviation industry, tracing its origins to 1926. However, United’s approach to growth has often been more focused on strategic alliances and global expansion.

One of the major strengths of United Airlines is its international network. The airline operates more transatlantic flights than any other US carrier, with key hubs in Chicago (ORD), Newark (EWR), and San Francisco (SFO). United’s presence in Europe, Asia, and Latin America has been bolstered through numerous codeshare agreements and partnerships, such as those with Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. This global reach makes United a strong contender in the international market, particularly among corporate travelers and international tourists.

United’s premium cabin, Polaris Business Class, is another area where the airline has worked to compete with top-tier carriers. The introduction of high-end Champagne like Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée in Polaris was a key move to attract luxury travelers and set the airline apart from its competitors. This premium service, paired with newly designed cabins featuring flat-bed seats, luxury bedding, and state-of-the-art entertainment options, has been a significant part of United’s strategy to regain market share in the lucrative international business class market.

United Airlines also places a strong emphasis on technology and innovation. The airline was one of the first to integrate mobile check-ins, in-flight Wi-Fi, and biometric screening at select airports. United’s commitment to improving its digital infrastructure and providing more convenience for passengers has made it a leader in the tech-driven transformation of the airline industry.

In terms of environmental initiatives, United has been a vocal advocate for sustainability. The airline has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% by 2050 and has made significant investments in fuel-efficient aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel. United also partners with various sustainability-focused organizations to explore alternative technologies, such as electric aircraft.

Challenges Faced by Both Airlines

While Delta and United have been successful in many areas, both airlines face their own unique set of challenges. The aviation industry as a whole is dealing with rising fuel costs, fluctuating demand for air travel, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For Delta, the challenge lies in balancing its premium service offerings with cost-cutting measures in response to economic uncertainty. Similarly, United has had to contend with its reputation for service reliability, as issues with delayed flights and overbooked planes have occasionally tarnished its customer service record.

Moreover, both airlines are facing the fallout from the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European goods, which threaten to disrupt the premium service they offer, including the possibility of removing luxury French Champagne from inflight menus. These tariff-induced price increases could force both airlines to reconsider their premium offerings, particularly in business and first-class cabins, where luxury and high-end service are key to attracting affluent travelers.

The Future: A Competitive and Evolving Industry

As the airline industry continues to recover and evolve, Delta and United will need to adapt to the changing demands of passengers and the realities of global competition. Both airlines are working hard to maintain their strong positions in the market, with a focus on premium service offerings, digital innovation, sustainability, and global expansion. Their success will depend on how well they navigate challenges such as rising costs, shifting consumer preferences, and new regulations.

In the coming years, Delta and United will need to focus on retaining their premium customers while attracting new ones. For Delta, continuing to invest in customer service and loyalty programs will be crucial. For United, its global expansion and tech innovations will be key to sustaining its competitive advantage. Both airlines will also need to place a greater emphasis on sustainability, both to meet environmental goals and to appeal to increasingly eco-conscious travelers.

In conclusion, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are two giants in the aviation industry, each with its own strengths and strategies. While Delta focuses heavily on customer experience and operational excellence, United has carved out a competitive edge with its global reach and technological advancements. As the airline industry faces continued challenges and transformation, both carriers are likely to play a critical role in shaping the future of global air travel.

In recent years, private air travel has experienced a striking surge in demand. Once viewed as an exclusive luxury for celebrities and top executives, private aviation is now more accessible and appealing to a broader audience of high-net-worth individuals and businesses. One major development is the notable increase in interest in private jets for sale, as more travelers decide to invest in ownership rather than rely on chartering.

The shift from renting to owning is being driven by multiple factors, including changing perceptions of luxury travel, concerns over health and convenience, and the increasing ease of finding planes for sale through trusted online platforms. These changes have transformed how people approach private aviation, making it a functional, cost-effective solution instead of a mere status symbol.

A Pandemic-Driven Shift in Travel Habits

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a significant turning point in the private aviation industry. With global travel restrictions and mounting health concerns, many travelers who had never flown privately began exploring safer, more flexible alternatives to commercial airlines. Private jets offered a controlled environment, personalized service, and the ability to avoid crowded airports—attributes that quickly attracted a new wave of users.

While many of these users initially opted to rent or charter jets, their experiences often revealed limitations such as scheduling issues, high seasonal demand, and limited customization. This exposure planted the seeds for long-term commitment to private travel, leading many to explore ownership opportunities.

Ownership as a Smart Investment

One of the most compelling reasons people are purchasing private jets today is the realization that ownership is often more practical and financially sound in the long run—especially for frequent travelers. Owning an aircraft eliminates the recurring costs of rentals, gives complete scheduling freedom, and adds a layer of flexibility that’s hard to match with charter services.

For businesses, the time saved and productivity gained from seamless air travel justifies the initial investment. Executives can travel between multiple cities or countries in one day, conduct meetings in privacy, and remain productive throughout. Jet ownership is increasingly seen as an essential tool for business efficiency rather than an extravagant expense.

Personalization and Prestige

Owning a private jet offers unmatched customization. From cabin layout and interior design to in-flight menus and entertainment, owners can curate every detail of their flying experience. This level of control and consistency is impossible to achieve with rented jets, which often vary in quality and features.

Beyond the practical benefits, ownership also carries a strong sense of prestige. For many affluent individuals and companies, having a branded aircraft reflects their success, attention to quality, and commitment to excellence.

Supply Chain and Aircraft Availability

Another trend fueling the increase in purchases is the tightening supply of charter jets and growing backlogs with manufacturers. As more buyers enter the market, demand is outpacing supply, especially for popular aircraft models. Pre-owned jets are selling faster than ever, often within days of being listed.

This urgency has led prospective buyers to act quickly and decisively. Many are turning to digital marketplaces where they can easily compare prices, configurations, and specifications, allowing for informed purchases with minimal delays.

Global Wealth and New Buyers

The world is witnessing a significant expansion of global wealth. New millionaires and billionaires are emerging not just from traditional financial hubs like the U.S. and Europe, but also from fast-growing economies in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. These buyers, particularly younger entrepreneurs and tech-savvy investors, are bringing new energy into the private aviation space.

Unlike older generations who may have preferred renting, these younger buyers are more inclined toward ownership, driven by a combination of practical needs and lifestyle aspirations. For them, having a private jet is not just about luxury—it’s about control, flexibility, and being able to operate on their own terms.

Evolving Business Needs

Companies are also becoming major players in the private jet ownership boom. In a competitive global marketplace, time-sensitive decisions often require face-to-face meetings, sometimes in remote or underserved areas where commercial flights are limited. Private jets allow teams to travel efficiently and execute deals faster, helping businesses maintain an edge.

Moreover, many organizations are now viewing private aircraft as a strategic asset. Aircraft management services have made ownership easier than ever by handling maintenance, staffing, logistics, and compliance, making it a turnkey experience for busy professionals.

A Greener Future for Private Aviation

Sustainability concerns are beginning to shape private aviation as well. Newer aircraft models are more fuel-efficient and compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Environmental responsibility, once a concern for critics of private flying, is becoming a focal point for manufacturers and owners alike.

Tech innovation is also leading to developments in hybrid and electric propulsion, suggesting a future where private jet travel could be both luxurious and eco-conscious. Buyers today are more informed and are selecting jets with better emissions profiles, advanced avionics, and quieter engines.

Final Thoughts: The Future of Jet Ownership

The increase in private jet ownership marks a significant evolution in how people view air travel. What was once reserved for the elite few is now a realistic option for a wider group of high-net-worth individuals and businesses. With safety, convenience, efficiency, and control being top priorities, ownership delivers where renting often falls short.

As platforms continue to make the acquisition process more accessible and options easier to compare, the private aviation market is only expected to grow. Buyers are no longer simply investing in a mode of transportation—they’re investing in autonomy, opportunity, and an enhanced way of life.

Whether it’s the dream of avoiding commercial airport chaos, building a personalized luxury travel experience, or maximizing business potential, private jet ownership offers unmatched value. The sky isn’t the limit—it’s just the beginning.

Entre les détracteurs du transport aérien et ses farouches défenseurs, la guerre des arguments est ouverte.
L’empreinte carbone ne doit pas être calculée sur la base d’un avion mais sur la base de nombre de passagers.
La solution la plus rapide serait d’utiliser du carburant vert compatible avec les moteurs actuels mais qui émettent moins de CO2.
Imed Dérouiche","L’enjeu est de taille avec un choix cornélien qui prévaut : Faut se soucier du développement du tourisme avec son impact sur l’économie et les emplois ou se préoccuper de l’ampleur du trafic aérien avec la multiplication des vols et les conséquences sur le climat et l’environnement ? Peut-on concilier essor touristique et préservation écologique ? Existe-il une alternative à l’avion, moyen de transport énergivore et extrêmement polluant ?

Autant de questions qui interpellent les climatologues qui prônent un SAF avec des carburants d’aviation durables et les acteurs du tourisme mondial dont le transport aérien est un pilier incontournable et indispensable pour la pérennité et le développement de l’activité.

Entre les détracteurs du transport aérien et ses farouches défenseurs, la guerre des arguments est ouverte. Et si les premiers avancent l’empreinte carbone élevée du transport aérien comme argument irréfutable de sa grande pollution, les climato sceptiques rétorquent que le calcul de l’empreinte carbone est calculée sur la base d’un trajet d’un point A à un point B sans pour autant tenir compte du nombre de passagers. L’empreinte carbone ne doit pas être calculée sur la base d’un avion mais sur la base de nombre de passagers.

L’équation est certes, inextricable mathématiquement entre un développement croissant du transport aérien avec ses répercussions économiques d’un côté et les aspirations écologiques et environnementales qui appellent à une taxation de l’aérien pour réduire le trafic, décongestionner les autoroutes du ciel et purifier la planète.

La tendance générale est à un allégement du trafic aérien et d’ailleurs plusieurs propositions sont à l’étude comme celle de l’ONU qui préconise de réduire de 20 % le trafic aérien afin de diminuer les émissions de CO2 ou de certaines ONG écologistes qui proposent une sur–taxation du transport aérien avec pour conséquence immédiate une augmentation exponentielle du prix des billets d’avion et la disparition de facto des compagnies Low-Cost qui ont, certes démocratisé les voyages mais aussi et surtout augmenté le trafic et par conséquent l’émanation de CO2.

La mobilité aérienne risque de devenir inaccessible et j’invite les amoureux des découvertes à faire le plein des voyages avant 2030 car au-delà de cette date, nous allons avoir une flambée des prix et une disparition pure et simple des compagnies Low-cost qui vont se transformer en High -cost exclusives à une niche comme ce fut le cas dans les années 70.

L’autre conséquence de cette tendance verte du transport aérien est l’impact sur le tourisme et j’appelle les professionnels du secteur à anticiper avec une refonte totale de la stratégie réceptive et au modèle économique car avec des prix d’avion élevés, le tourisme de masse et l’hôtellerie simple ne seront plus viables et l’alternative serait un tourisme de qualité basé sur l’excellence du service, la qualité des prestations, les découvertes patrimoniales et culturelles et l’aventure.

Pour atténuer l’empreinte carbone de cette mobilité aérienne, les alternatives au kérosène paraissent complexes et difficile à atteindre car électrifier les moteurs des avions est domaine de l’impossible à l’heure actuelle et les remplacer demanderait des années de recherche et de développement. La solution la plus rapide serait d’utiliser du carburant vert compatible avec les moteurs actuels mais qui émettent moins de CO2.

Et parmi ces carburant l’alternatif , le SAF ( Sustainable Aviation Fuel) et j’appelle les avionneurs et compagnies aériennes à opter pour ce carburant dont l’avantage est double : il est issu de matières premières renouvelables comme l’huile de cuisson, résidus de biomasse, déchets agricoles et algues et il ne nécessite pas un changement ou une transformation de moteur et d’ailleurs la compagnie Virgin qui s’est inscrite dans le programme SAF a réalisé un vol transatlantique New-York-Londres 100% SAF pour montrer l’exemple et en faire des émules même si la production de ce fuel propre soit encore limitée et incapable de répondre aux besoins des compagnies.

Le eSAF pourrait à mon avis représenter une opportunité pour la Tunisie, si nous décidons d’en créer une unité pour fournir tous nos Aéroports et ceux de nos voisins pour en faire un Hub du carburant Vert comme point de ravitaillement pour notre compagnie aérienne et les compagnies étrangères qui desservent nos aéroports et aussi comme fer de lance pour notre tourisme qui pourrait se prévaloir du Label Vert.

Tout est réuni pour faire de la Tunisie le Hub du eSAF avec comme point d’ancrage la transformation de la raffinerie STIR de Bizerte dont les équipements sont obsolètes avec un rendement insuffisant qui entrave ses équilibres financiers, en une unité de production de Green Fuel qui pourrait générer des millions de Dollars de bénéfices et servir comme exemple de l’engagement de la Tunisie pour l’environnement et une planète verte.

Ainsi le eSAF parait la réponse idoine à cette équation inextricable et une réponse à ce choix cornélien entre liberté de mouvement, démocratisation des voyages et préservation de la planète en offrant à la fois cette latitude de se déplacer librement, ce besoin de se développer, cette appétence à de nouvelles aspirations et ce droit inaliénable de l’humanité à un environnement sain et propre.

Dat bevestigt een Schiphol-woordvoerder na publicatie van een opiniestuk in Het Parool, waarin de activisten de maatregel hekelen.
Het gebiedsverbod komt de facto neer op een vliegverbod vanaf de luchthaven, omdat activisten niet langer de terminal mogen betreden.
Wel mogen ze nog op het plein voor Schiphol en op Schiphol Plaza komen, het publiek toegankelijke winkelcentrum van de luchthaven.","De activisten namen op 8 maart deel aan een Exctinction Rebellion-demonstratie tegen het Flying Blue-spaarplan van KLM. Via dit ‘frequent flyer’-programma sparen reizigers met elke vliegreis punten, die vervolgens kunnen worden ingeruild voor kortingen of extra’s. Het spaarprogramma, dat populair is onder zakelijke reizigers, beloont ‘veelvliegen’ en is volgens de actievoerders daarom ‘hét symbool van een industrie die weigert de klimaatontwrichting onder ogen te zien’.

Exctinction Rebellion kreeg toestemming om te demonstreren voor de deur van Schiphol, een van de grootste luchthavens van Europa. Desalniettemin betraden tientallen activisten de terminal. Dat deden ze naar eigen zeggen met een vliegticket dat zij konden annuleren en waarvan de boardingpass meermaals kon worden gescand. Daardoor konden meerdere activisten op één ticket de vertrekhal in, de ruimte achter de paspoortcontrole. Daar demonstreerden ze onder meer bij de KLM-lounge.

Gebiedsverbod

Schiphol wil uit veiligheidsoverwegingen niets zeggen over het voorval. Ook zegt het niet hoeveel activisten destijds zijn binnengekomen. Wel stelt de luchthaven dat de beveiliging inmiddels is aangescherpt. De koninklijke marechaussee, die de orde handhaaft op de luchthaven, hield uiteindelijk 67 mensen aan. Dat waren activisten die waren gevraagd om de luchthaven te verlaten, maar dit weigerden.

Uiteindelijk werd aan 38 activisten een gebiedsverbod opgelegd. Dat bevestigt een Schiphol-woordvoerder na publicatie van een opiniestuk in Het Parool, waarin de activisten de maatregel hekelen. Sommigen kregen een verbod van 5 jaar opgelegd, anderen kregen een verbod van 10 jaar aan de broek, omdat zij ‘meerdere andere personen zouden hebben geholpen om ongeoorloofd toegang te krijgen’.

Het gebiedsverbod komt de facto neer op een vliegverbod vanaf de luchthaven, omdat activisten niet langer de terminal mogen betreden. Wel mogen ze nog op het plein voor Schiphol en op Schiphol Plaza komen, het publiek toegankelijke winkelcentrum van de luchthaven.

Demonstratierecht

Extinction Rebellion noemt de straf in het opiniestuk bij monde van Simone Wiegman een ‘gevaarlijke onderdrukking van het demonstratierecht en een disproportionele beperking van de bewegingsvrijheid’. Wiegman is oud KLM-werknemer en nu klimaatactivist. ‘Het demonstratierecht houdt in dat je mag demonstreren op een afstand binnen zicht en gehoor van het onderwerp van je demonstratie, ook wanneer dat zich op privéterrein bevindt. In dit geval is de Frequent Flyer Lounge – waar KLM ‘elite’-passagiers die veel vliegen verwent met gratis hapjes en drankjes – de meest logische plek om te demonstreren.’

De klimaatclub noemt de maatregel disproportioneel, maar daar is Schiphol het niet mee eens. ‘Je demonstreert in beveiligd gebied, en dat is niet de bedoeling. Je overtreedt de huisregels, en als je geen eigen ticket hebt ook gewoon de wet.’ De luchthavenwoordvoerder kon zaterdagmiddag niet zeggen of activisten nog in beroep kunnen gaan tegen het verbod.

Gratis tickets

Exctinction Rebellion zegt een advocaat in de arm te nemen, maar liever ziet de organisatie dat de luchthaven zich bedenkt. ‘Het zou Schiphol sieren als het de toegangsverboden intrekt en in plaats daarvan de huurcontracten van de KLM-lounges opzegt.’",https://image.volkskrant.nl/208214966/feature-crop/1200/630/een-blokkade-van-extinction-rebellion-voor-de-centrale-ingang,N,,2025-04-12 12:57:51.255316

Le carburant SAF à base de biocarburant coûte 2,5 fois le prix du kérosène.
Les avions peuvent, en effet, voler avec 50% de carburant durable, sans doute davantage d’ici 10 ans…","Les compagnies aériennes doivent voler, depuis cette année, avec un kérosène contenant du biocarburant. Elles demandent à revoir ces contraintes en avançant le coût élevé de ces fuels durables et leur disponibilité aléatoire. Ce que contestent les producteurs.

Comme certains constructeurs automobiles, le monde de l’aérien cherche à revoir les obligations environnementales qui le touchent. Depuis cette année, une directive européenne, ReFuelEU, oblige les fournisseurs de carburant à distribuer du kérosène contenant au moins 2% de carburant durable, ou SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), pour tous les vols partant de l’UE.

La directive prévoit une proportion de 6% en 2030, et de 70% en 2050. En outre, elle impose qu’une part minimale de 1,2% de carburant de synthèse, ou e-fuel, fabriqué au départ d’hydrogène produit avec de l’électricité renouvelable, soit incorporée à partir de 2030, pour monter à 35% en 2050.

Pas d’autres solutions que les carburants durables

Les carburants durables sont la seule manière de réduire les émissions des vols. Avec l’achat d’avions de dernière génération dont les émissions peuvent être 15% inférieures à celles d’avions plus anciens. Les projets de vols électriques, avec des batteries ou via la production d’électricité au moyen d’hydrogène, sont lointains et improbables. Les autres solutions consistent à restreindre fortement les vols.

Les avions représentent environ 5% des émissions globales de CO2, un niveau qui pourrait doubler d’ici 2050.

Si l’on en croit les déclarations des compagnies aériennes et des aéroports, de grands efforts sont fournis. Ryanair multiplie les communiqués sur les achats de carburants durables. En janvier dernier, la compagnie Wizzair et l’aéroport de Charleroi conviaient la presse pour parler des vols recourant à ces carburants au départ de Gosselies. Déjà, en janvier 2023, Brussels Airport et Brussels Airlines avaient annoncé la première livraison de carburant SAF via un pipeline de l’Otan.

En coulisse, les transporteurs sont plus réticents. Ils avancent que l’offre est insuffisante et les prix trop chers. Le carburant SAF à base de biocarburant coûte 2,5 fois le prix du kérosène. Les carburants synthétiques, qui ne sont pas encore produits industriellement, pourraient arriver à 10 fois.

“La Commission européenne et les États membres doivent désormais prendre leurs responsabilités : les fournisseurs de carburants ne tiennent pas leurs engagements, écrit l’association A4E. Sans action urgente dans les mois à venir, la crédibilité du mandat sera gravement compromise, et une réévaluation des mandats sera nécessaire.” Soit, en fait, une révision des obligations imposées par la directive ReFuelEU. L’A4E met en avant une étude du Boston Consulting Group qui parle d’un déficit de l’offre à l’horizon 2030 (- 30% pour les SAF, – 45% pour les carburants synthétiques).

Neste regrette la timidité des compagnies

Les fournisseurs de carburants durables parlent plutôt d’une demande insuffisante, qui n’encourage pas à investir. L’an dernier, Shell a ainsi gelé un projet dans une usine qui devait produire 800.000 tonnes de SAF par an, à Rotterdam. Le raffineur finlandais Neste, champion européen des carburants durables, se plaint que la demande soit trop tiède. “La demande volontaire de SAF de la part des compagnies aériennes fixant leurs propres objectifs ou en offrant aux passagers la possibilité de payer plus pour compenser le coût supplémentaire du vol avec SAF ne s’est pas matérialisée en 2024 comme prévu, à l’exception de quelques compagnies”, explique Alexander Kueper, vice-président renewable aviation business. Neste ne réduit pas ses investissements mais traverse une période de restructuration pour devenir plus compétitif.

Les producteurs de carburants durables espéraient que les achats “volontaires” donneraient un coup de pouce à la demande et réduiraient davantage les émissions, car les 2% obligatoires cette année n’ont encore qu’un impact environnemental symbolique.

Les illusions des “green fares”

Officiellement, de nombreuses compagnies, comme Brussels Airlines, proposent un “green fare“, un supplément via lequel le passager finance l’achat volontaire de carburant SAF, en plus du minimum réglementaire. Souvent, la majorité de la somme va à une compensation d’émissions par le biais du financement de projets visant à capter du CO2 (notamment par des plantations d’arbres).

“La part de ces achats volontaires de SAF est très modeste. Quand on dissèque les accords annoncés par les compagnies, les volumes ne sont pas là”, confirme Camille Mutrelle, aviation policy officer au sein de l’ONG Transport&Environment.

Même quand une aide publique est fournie, les compagnies ne se précipitent pas forcément. Brussels Airport avait annoncé un petit budget de 1,345 million d’euros, financé par le gouvernement fédéral, pour contribuer à l’achat de carburants durables pour des vols au départ de Bruxelles. “Il n’a pas été entièrement dépensé en 2024, nous continuons à proposer l’aide cette année avec l’argent qui reste”, affirme Ihsane Chioua Lekhli, porte-parole de l’aéroport.

Transport&Environement a établi un classement des compagnies qui prend en compte les actions qu’elles accomplissent pour réduire les émissions de CO2. Ni Ryanair ni le groupe Lufthansa ne figurent dans le top 10. Le groupe le plus “vertueux” est Air France-KLM. “Leurs vols s’opèrent avec 5% de carburant durable sur la base des accords conclus”, relève Camille Mutrelle. Elle précise qu’au sein de la fédération A4E, “Ryanair et Lufthansa figurent parmi les compagnies qui sont les plus demandeuses d’un report des contraintes de la directive ReFuelEU.”

Les passagers payent des surcharges

À court terme, pourtant, les 2% de carburant SAF imposés ne représentent pas un coût énorme. Plusieurs transporteurs font payer une surcharge à leurs passagers. Le groupe Lufthansa, auquel appartient Brussels Airlines, facture, depuis janvier dernier, un supplément de 1 à 72 euros par ticket, selon la destination et la classe, à ne pas confondre avec le supplément “green fare” proposé en option. Air France-KLM facture, depuis 2022, 2 à 24 euros par ticket.

Les compagnies pensent à long terme, quand les obligations seront plus importantes et impacteront davantage le prix du billet. Le carburant constitue généralement une part substantielle des coûts, de 25% à plus de 30%.

Alors, les arguments avancés pour revoir les objectifs se multiplient. Outre le prix, il y a la difficulté à trouver des matières premières pour les biocarburants SAF. Neste, l’un des producteurs les plus importants, dément. “Il existe suffisamment de SAF disponible à l’échelle mondiale pour atteindre l’ensemble des objectifs annuels de ReFuelEU de 2025 à 2029, ainsi que suffisamment de bio-SAF pour respecter l’objectif de 6% de SAF fixé par ReFuelEU en 2030, affirme Alexander Kueper. Par exemple, la capacité de production de SAF de Neste atteindra 1,5 million de tonnes en 2025, ce qui suffirait à respecter l’objectif de 2% de SAF dans l’UE et au Royaume-Uni, estimé à environ 1,1 million de tonnes de SAF par an.”

Et Neste n’est pas le seul fournisseur. Il est même mis sous pression par la concurrence chinoise, qui propose des carburants durables moins chers. Une concurrence qui fait reculer les tarifs, sans toutefois rejoindre celui du kérosène.

“Ce qui préoccupe le plus les compagnies aériennes, ce sont les carburants synthétiques, dont l’incorporation sera obligatoire à partir de 2030”, pointe Camille Mutrelle. Leur surcoût, plus élevé que pour le biocarburant, les effraye.

“Le secteur pétrolier est aux abonnés absents”

L’experte de Transport&Environment convient, avec les compagnies aériennes, qu’il y a un souci pour les e-carburant. Qui va les produire ? “Le secteur pétrolier est aux abonnés absents, il porte une lourde responsabilité dans le manque d’investissements, ce sont surtout des start-up qui s’intéressent à ce marché en devenir, ainsi qu’Engie ou EDF”, poursuit Camille Mutrelle.

Pour produire à grande échelle, ces start-up ont besoin de contrats fermes à long terme. Mais les compagnies aériennes n’en signent guère. “Hormis IAG (British Airways), qui a signé des accords d’achat à long terme, et Norwegian. Aucune compagnie ne s’est vraiment engagée”, regrette l’aviation policy officer de T&E. Il est vrai que pour l’achat de carburant, les accords sont plutôt annuels. Les compagnies répugnent à signer des accords à long terme, à 10 ans. Avec un prix fixé, sans savoir si elles bénéficieront de la meilleure technologie.

La Commission européenne est consciente de ce problème d’œuf et de poule et cherche des solutions. Sinon, le secteur risque le même scénario que pour les voitures électriques et les batteries, les Chinois étant très actifs. “Ils ont de gros projets de production de carburants synthétiques dans le cartons”, confirme Camille Mutrelle.

Cela étant, même si des solutions étaient trouvées pour respecter les objectifs de la directive ReFuelEU, son impact resterait limité. La croissance attendue du trafic aérien, de 3,6% par an jusqu’en 2043, selon Airbus, devrait effacer les gains d’émissions qu’apporteraient les obligations d’incorporation de carburants durables, même avec l’achat d’avions dernier cri.

Pour obtenir une véritable réduction des émissions, il faudrait encore augmenter significativement la part des carburants durables, non pas la diminuer, et développer leur production. Les avions peuvent, en effet, voler avec 50% de carburant durable, sans doute davantage d’ici 10 ans…","https://img.static-rmg.be/a/view/q75/w1600/h836/f50.00,50.00/7160975/carbu-1-jpg.jpg",N,,2025-04-12 12:57:58.462086

SAS collaborates with a wide range of aviation and energy industry leaders to advocate for the widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), placing a special emphasis on the development of e-SAF (Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

“The shift away from fossil-based aviation fuels is not only necessary—it is essential. At SAS, we believe in driving progress through partnership and collaboration. A shared understanding of the pathway ahead is crucial for making real and lasting change while supporting the transformation of the industry,” says Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President Public Affairs at SAS.

E-SAF (electro-synthetic aviation fuel) is a type of fuel generated from renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, or hydropower. This fuel is considered carbon-neutral, as it releases only as much carbon as was absorbed during its production process.

The Bodø Declaration was introduced following the international SAF seminar held in Bodø on April 9–10. The seminar brought together stakeholders from various sectors, including industry leaders, researchers, NGOs, and representatives from the European Commission. The event emphasized the need for stable regulatory frameworks, secure investments, and collaborative efforts across sectors to enable a genuine transition to sustainable aviation fuels.

The declaration builds on initiatives like Project SkyPower, a letter sent to the European Commission in February 2025, spearheaded by SAS, with the support of a diverse coalition of aviation and energy professionals.

Through the Bodø e-SAF Declaration, key stakeholders — including producers, technology providers, aircraft and engine manufacturers, airports, policymakers, and researchers — have come together with a shared goal: to ensure that aviation continues to fulfill its essential role in society while reducing its environmental footprint.

Strategic partnerships play a crucial role in SAS’s sustainability strategy, and the Bodø Declaration is a testament to the cross-industry collaboration needed to drive progress and meet the rapidly growing demand for sustainable aviation solutions. This commitment also traces back to November of the previous year, when SAS entered into an agreement with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Copenhagen Airport, and Aalborg Airport to support the production of e-SAF in Denmark.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said an emergency law aimed at saving the Lincolnshire site from closure was an ""exceptional situation"".

SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn challenged Reynolds over similarities to the closure of the Scottish refinery on the Firth of Forth - with the loss of 400 jobs.

It came during a rare Saturday sitting of parliament to pass legislation to save the the British Steel plant, opening the door for full nationalisation.

Reynolds told the Commons: ""I understand that some have asked about precedent or referenced other troubled industrial situations.

""To be clear again, this is an exceptional situation, a unique situation.

""The question for all members is whether we as a country want to continue to possess a steel industry, do we want to make the construction steel and rail we need here in the UK, or do we want to be dependent on overseas imports?""

Flynn asked Reynolds whether the Labour party would back a similar bill for Grangemouth.

Scotland's only oil refinery has been marked for closure by owner Petroineos

About 400 of the 2,000 jobs that are based at the industrial complex will be lost.

The Aberdeen South MP said: ""Many minds right now will be very much focused on the situation in Grangemouth, where we know that hundreds of jobs are going to be lost directly, thousands of jobs in the supply chain.

""Would the Labour Party back it in the same way as it is backing this Bill today?""

But Reynolds said the UK government had pledged £200m to secure Grangemouth's ""long-term future"".

He added: ""It is not a comparable situation and the behaviour of the company is not comparable to the situation in this case.""

A report published last month said up to 800 jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site

The Project Willow study, funded jointly by the Scottish and UK governments, sets out nine areas where there are potential opportunities for green industries.

It said jobs could be created in areas like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production and plastics recycling but it would require £3.5bn of private investment.

Brian Leishman, Labour MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, has also called for nationalisation of the Scottish refinery.

He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland there were ""striking similarities between Scunthorpe and Grangemouth"".

He said: ""The government should intervene at Grangemouth to extend refinrery operations until the new energy industies of the future that we are going to need are ready.

""That is the only way that we can really, truly, achieve a just transition for workers and communities.

Aside from keeping the slender, pointed design, Boom distances itself from Concorde, which Scholl calls “a false start” to a supersonic age.
“I’m not convinced the current team assembled has the experience or depth or capability to develop a supersonic engine,” Foley says.
The first American-built civilian supersonic jet is likely to be welcomed by a protectionist federal administration gung-ho on US manufacture and deregulation.
Today, Gratton says it’s “irresponsible” for a supersonic jet that burns two to three times more fuel to be launched in a full-fledged climate crisis.","When I call Blake Scholl from New York, he says it’s a shame we couldn’t have met at his office in Colorado. If only there were a supersonic jet that could cruise at 1.7 times the speed of sound, and get me there two hours quicker than the typical JFK-to-Denver route.

There soon might be. Scholl is the CEO of Boom Supersonic, a company betting that ordinary civilians want to shoot across the sky at 1,100 miles (1,700 kilometres) per hour. After the pandemic brought a slump to the skies, air travel has returned to its former levels, and in-person business events are back on track. As a faster option for these travellers, Boom is developing its breakneck jets to be operational by 2029 – nearly a quarter century after Concorde landed its last plane.

Aside from keeping the slender, pointed design, Boom distances itself from Concorde, which Scholl calls “a false start” to a supersonic age. In Boom’s revived version, its 64-seater airliners could whizz across the Atlantic in three-and-a-half hours, at least twice as fast as commercial carriers, and check off hundreds of new routes such as Madrid to Miami, or Tokyo to Seattle. They would lean into software and algorithms to tweak speed and altitude based on real-time conditions. Boom is already “a darling of the bros at Silicon Valley,” says Brian Foley, a US-based aviation industry analyst and former aerospace engineer, pointing to investors including OpenAI’s Sam Altman.

But sceptics will compare Boom to Concorde, and question whether it can overcome the list of issues that led to its predecessor’s decline, including price, demand, safety, regulation and the environment – all of which may remain stubborn barriers.

To its credit, Boom has appeared to solve one of Concorde’s major hurdles: the sonic boom, the ear-splitting thunderclap heard on the ground when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound. When an aeroplane moves, molecules ahead have to get out of the way; as it breaks the sound barrier, the craft catches up and drags the molecules along with it. The sudden disruption causes a shock wave, felt as a deafening roar.

Concorde couldn’t escape the boom as it flew at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound. “When they got it wrong, it was smashing greenhouses and scaring little old ladies,” says Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire. The sheer sound forced noise regulations in Europe, and in the US an outright ban on supersonic flight in 1973, relegating Concorde to oceanic routes such as London to New York.

That isn’t enough for Boom, which wants to capture the domestic business market and fly above land at Mach 1.7. So, in quite the physics feat, Boom has eliminated the sonic boom.

It has put into practice a longstanding theory of refraction known as “Mach cutoff”, which works via the same law that makes a pencil appear to bend in a glass of water in the classic school lab experiment. As the plane flies, the sound wave refracts towards colder temperatures, curling upwards. It keeps turning upwards until it reaches space.

During two supersonic test flights in January and February, with a specially built craft a third of the proposed size, Boom demonstrated the Mach cutoff six times, without an audible boom on each occasion.

Boom’s planned aircraft, Overture, is still in early development and will be a different beast, especially because Boom is making its own engine. That’s rare in an industry where commercial craft invariably use engines from the established giants such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce. “I’m not convinced the current team assembled has the experience or depth or capability to develop a supersonic engine,” Foley says.

If they can do it, their timing is opportune. The first American-built civilian supersonic jet is likely to be welcomed by a protectionist federal administration gung-ho on US manufacture and deregulation. In the Oval Office in February, Donald Trump posed with an Overture model, and Elon Musk pledged to overturn the supersonic ban. The $600m infusion of funding from some of his billionaire peers won’t hurt.

Boom isn’t the only company developing a “quiet” supersonic aircraft. Nasa is testing its own experimental X-59 jet. And an aircraft from China’s state-owned manufacturer Comac is reportedly under way, according to a self-released paper. A patriotic aerospace race could further spur legislation. “Let’s beat ’em,” Scholl posted on X, with a US flag emoji.

But success will ultimately depend on consumer demand. The tragic crash in 2000 of an Air France Concorde catalysed its downfall, which was compounded by the downturn in air travel after 9/11. It’s unclear whether the public wants supersonic travel – or even knows of its existence. The only surveys that exist are Boom’s own (which unsurprisingly claim that 97% of passengers want it); two major aviation research firms told me there’s no real data.

Demand will be driven by affordability. “Concorde was for royalty and rock stars,” Scholl says of its $20,000 tickets in today’s money. He estimates Boom could start at $5,000 for a transatlantic flight, akin to some business-class fares. But at a time of inflation, it’s not cheap. Despite Scholl’s vision for our in-person meeting, freelance journalists are not the target market, though he says he predicts economy-level fares “for the rest of us” by the late 2030s.

Foley isn’t swayed. “This isn’t a ‘scale big’ aerospace segment,” he says. “It’s a very niche market.” Major carriers such as American and United have already put in orders for aircraft, but Foley says that’s a typical PR move for carriers to show their progressiveness. Eventually, they’ll cave to pure cost-per-seat-mile economics. The private jet market may be a better fit, but even with their participation, Foley estimates Boom would probably only sell about 300 aircraft over 10 years.

The private jet sector is routinely under fire for its poor environmental record, burning far more fuel per passenger mile. And while aviation in general accounts for 2.5% of all emissions, the industry continues to grow, leading to predictions it will double its carbon output by 2050.

Scholl says Overture will be built to be compatible with sustainable aviation fuel, and that choosing between innovative tech and the environment is a “mistaken trade-off”. The public may have different ideas. Even in the 1960s, Concorde faced eco-pushback around emerging ozone layer concerns, and advocacy from grassroots campaigns such as the Citizens League Against the Sonic Boom helped secure the bans.

Today, Gratton says it’s “irresponsible” for a supersonic jet that burns two to three times more fuel to be launched in a full-fledged climate crisis. “As an aeronautical engineer, I am absolutely thrilled with what Boom are doing,” he says. “As an environmental scientist, I’m horrified.”

“They are doing very clever work,” Gratton says. “Whether it’s a good idea that they do it – that’s the tougher question.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b281431ab3b1f106c8688d789af70aeff3e8c01a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24d7e91e00af6514e2607fbaef3b5638,N,,2025-04-12 09:56:20.355495

A proud railway town on the M4 corridor - a place with much to be proud of.
The proliferation of out of town shopping centres, urban expansions and a minimal public transport network shaped the transport destiny of my town.
And, most important of all, a good transport network can do precisely the opposite.
But I think we should talk more about ""Swindon style"" transport for Swindon, or ""York style"" transport for York.","Thank you, David, for that introduction.

Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the National Railway Museum in York.

I'm tempted to say we're in the country's finest transport museum, but as a Swindon MP and a former Deputy Mayor for Transport in London, I feel I should tread carefully.

So welcome to ONE of the VERY BEST transport museums in the country!

It feels fitting for me to do my first big transport speech here.

The history of our transport network - the stories of the men and women who designed it, built it, operated and used it - are woven into the fabric of our communities in 21st century Britain.

And it's you - the people in THIS room - who are adding to that rich tapestry every day.

You keep life moving.

You get children to school, commuters to work, and families to their holidays.

You move the goods that stock our shelves, fuel our industries, and keep businesses thriving.

You don't just connect places - you connect people with the things that they need to get on in life.

And it's in the spirit of connection that I'd like to tell you a story.

I hope you won't be disappointed to learn that I haven't invited you here for a big policy announcement or news headline, but rather to share a little bit about who I am and what I believe.

I want to tell you a story about the people and places who have shaped my thinking.

I grew up in Swindon.

A proud railway town on the M4 corridor - a place with much to be proud of.

It's also a humble football town - and I can tell you, that as a Swindon Town supporter, I have learnt the lessons of humility all too well.

By fate and circumstance, that's where my journey began.

Outside our semi detached house, I remember my dad's first van parked up - 'Malcolm Alexander Electrical Services'.

I remember the first bike I was given - blue with a basket on the front - a bit like the blue crate I've got on my bike now.

And I remember learning to drive around the town's infamous Magic Roundabout.

And the car factories that punctuate the town's history - Rover, Honda and now, BMW.

It's fair to say that in 1980s Swindon, the car was king.

It still is.

The proliferation of out of town shopping centres, urban expansions and a minimal public transport network shaped the transport destiny of my town.

Now, I won't pretend that urban planning preoccupied my teenage mind too much.

Back then, I was much more concerned about whether Wham! were going to make it to Number 1.

But when I moved away and got my first job, I began to see the bigger picture…

… that a poor transport network will limit choices.

… that it can block the aspirations of young people.

And, most important of all, a good transport network can do precisely the opposite.

I was the first person in my family to go to university.

And like so many, I found work and opportunities in the capital.

And so it was, at the age of 29, I walked into Lewisham Town Hall as a newly elected councillor - becoming the cabinet member for regeneration just two years later.

I loved that job, and I fell in love with transport.

Now, I'll admit …

It wasn't the language of highways management that enthralled me: ""There's no such thing as a speed hump Cllr Alexander, only speed tables and speed cushions.""

But it was the extension of the East London Line, the creation of new brownfield sites around major railway stations, the improvements to walking and cycling links that really got me hooked.

I learnt quickly that transport shapes a lot more than roads and railways.

And equally important, I learnt that it takes a lot of people to shape transport itself.

At Lewisham, I saw first-hand how transport investment could make a dramatic difference to people's lives.

Take Brockley Railway Station.

For years, it was an uninspiring, inaccessible place.

Uninviting, a bit run down.

Not somewhere you'd instinctively love as you rocked up for your morning commute.

But working with local campaigners, we delivered step-free access, a stunning landscaped ramp and better connectivity along the London Overground.

Today, Brockley is thriving.

It's a place where the old and the new coexist.

The Wetherspoons on the corner and fried chicken shops sit side-by-side with bakeries, breweries and a pedestrianised square.

It was a transport scheme that built a stronger, more connected community.

And, it was transport that made the difference down the road in Lewisham too.

We transformed it - relocating and improving a bus station, moving a roundabout, redesigning the roads, creating land for new homes, new public spaces and new opportunity.

And when I say ""we"", I mean the hundreds of people from different organisations who made it happen - people like you.

When a few years later I became the Member of Parliament for Lewisham East, transport was always right at the top of the list of my constituents' concerns.

The longer train station platforms that were worse than useless without the longer trains to stop at them.

The toxic air being pumped into homes around the South Circular.

And when I later became Deputy Mayor for Transport in London, I had the privilege of working on those concerns more closely than I had ever done before.

Look, London is big.

So yes, naturally, I'm proud of the big stuff:

Straining to keep the capital moving through Covid.

Working on the Elizabeth line to deliver the jewel in the crown of the UK's rail network.

Sticking to my guns on the Silvertown Tunnel, a new river crossing that enables London's red double-deckers to go under the Thames to the east of Tower Bridge for the first time.

But honestly, big doesn't always mean beautiful.

Transport isn't just about the price tag on the project.

It's about delivering a better everyday experience - buses that come on time, accessible stations, well managed road works.

I'm just as proud of the smaller projects that made a big difference - many delivered in London by my good friend and then colleague Will Norman - segregated cycle lanes on Jamaica Road and Evelyn St, more secure cycle parking, slower speeds on roads with high KSIs, a direct vision scheme to improve visibility from the cabs of HGVs.

These were transport interventions which ultimately delivered better public health, as well as better public realm.

So when I moved back to Swindon a couple of years ago, I wasn't just carrying a dream about becoming the MP for my home town.

I arrived with baggage - determined to deliver for Swindon in a similar way to London.

Not the same solutions - as every place is different, but to give people options and opportunity.

There isn't something in the water that makes Swindonians love their cars more than Londoners.

Just a reality that public transport is better in London.

And I think it's a failure of imagination, as much as a failure of policy, that young people in Swindon don't have better options than I had decades ago.

Because change is possible.

Across the country - from Swindon to Shrewsbury, Rotherham to Peterborough - we have underused transport assets.

Unloved railway buildings - land surplus to requirements or land that could be made so.

Neglected stations, like Brockley.

Potential that shouldn't go to waste, but we know that, too often, it does.

And with vision, funding and collaboration, these could become hubs of regeneration, places that don't just usher people through - but bring people together.

We talk about delivering ""London style"" transport to other places.

But I think we should talk more about ""Swindon style"" transport for Swindon, or ""York style"" transport for York.

And I want to support the capability and capacity within councils and combined authorities to deliver regeneration, investment and tangible improvements.

We have great mayors.

We have great local leaders.

We have great organisations working nationally and regionally.

We have a lot of talent in this room and beyond.

So, the question for me, is how do we best harness that?

Obviously, this is a question that has vexed me particularly since I took a call from the Prime Minister at the tail end of November, asking me to serve as his Transport Secretary.

And as someone who has skin in the game as a local MP and a passion to build on the work started by the force of nature, Lou Haigh, I naturally said yes.

And here I am.

Full-circle in some ways, and trying to shape a new path in another.

And the task is to build a better decade for transport.

Towards a better railway…

Laying the foundations for reform - establishing Shadow Great British Railways and launching a consultation on the upcoming Railways Bill to unify track and train .

Towards public ownership…

Passing the Passenger Railway Services Act, with the first operators - Southwestern and c2c - moving into public hands in the coming months.

Towards better buses…

Introducing the Bus Services Bill, giving local authorities greater control over routes, timetables, and fares - backed by over £1 billion in investment to improve reliability and frequency.

Towards better roads…

Investing £1.6 billion in local highways, an uplift of £500 million on last year - enough to fill an extra 7 million potholes.

Towards fairer work…

Enshrining greater protections for seafarers in law.

Towards cleaner skies…

Introducing the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate and launching a consultation on the revenue certainty mechanism.

Towards a fossil-free future…

Supporting the installation of thousands of new EV charge points-helping to drive record electric car sales, with 31% of new cars sold in December last year being electric.

And towards a transport system that supports the aspirations of everyone in this country…

It's why I am so proud to work with the ministerial team at the Department for Transport.

Like me - and like all of us - they've seen the difference that good services make…

…Whether it's the tap-and-go trams and buses in Mike Kane's patch, with fares capped at £2 on Greater Manchester's Bee Network.

…Or in Simon Lightwood's patch, where the mass transit system will improve integrated travel options in West Yorkshire, improving access to opportunities for people in Leeds and Bradford.

…Or, in Nottingham, where one of the local bus operators, Nottingham City Transport, has been voted UK operator of the year a record six times, with passenger satisfaction amongst the highest in the country. I hear Lilian Greenwood is a pretty good local MP too …

And as for Peter Hendy, who is his own walking museum of transport knowledge, he has a phrase that I would like to steal.

He talks about transport needing to be ""boringly reliable"".

And he's right.

If public transport options are boringly reliable, then it means day-to-day life is easier for everyone.

So, by 2035, I want public transport to play a greater role in national life, becoming the easiest, most attractive choice… brilliantly and boringly reliable.

Enrique Peñalosa, a former mayor of Bogotá, once said:

""An advanced city is not one where the poor have to own a car, but one where the rich choose to use public transport.""

That's a vision I believe in.

But I can picture the headlines now - so let me counter the column inches before they emerge: there is no such thing as a war on motorists.

I drive. I own a car and I love it - a racing green Mini Cooper convertible.

I walk. I cycle.

I take buses, trains, and taxis.

And I'll bet most of you do too.

No serious person is proposing to ask people like my dad, a self employed electrician, to swap their van for a bus, forcing them to lug all their kit around - I certainly am not.

Through his career, my dad was a professional problem solver, and I hope I'll carry the torch for that family tradition.

But I'll be focussing on solving the real problems, not wasting time on the invented ones.

Because I'm sure everybody in this room would agree that where you live shouldn't determine what you can achieve…

…that your hometown, no matter how big or how small, should provide the transport options to meet your aspirations…

… and that - if transport doesn't nurture young people with the opportunities they deserve, then our entire economy misses out on the talent it needs to grow.

That's why we're here today.

To have the conversations that bring us closer together.

I want to harness your talents, your expertise and your drive to solve real problems.

Because, no matter where people are travelling to, they should be proud of where they're coming from.

Thank you, and have a lovely evening.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/668bb8ba7541f54efe51bb2d/heidi-alexander.jpeg,N,,2025-04-12 10:56:11.246317

Private jet ownership is a financial decision as much as it is a lifestyle one.","Owning a private jet is often perceived as the pinnacle of luxury and convenience, offering unparalleled flexibility and comfort in air travel. However, the financial commitment extends far beyond the initial purchase price. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the various expenses involved, offering a detailed overview to inform your decision-making process.​

Initial acquisition costs: new vs pre-owned

The journey to private jet ownership begins with the acquisition of the aircraft. Prices vary significantly based on factors such as the aircraft's size, range, manufacturer, and whether it's new or pre-owned.​

The next thing to consider when acquiring an aircraft is financing and depreciation. While some buyers may choose to purchase a jet outright, others might explore financing options. Interest rates and loan terms can significantly impact the overall cost. Additionally, private jets depreciate over time, affecting the aircraft's resale value.

Total annual operating costs

Fixed annual costs

Beyond the purchase price, owners must budget for recurring annual expenses that ensure the aircraft remains operational and compliant with aviation regulations.​ Fixed annual costs are expenditures that are incurred regardless of the number of hours flown, such as:

Crew salaries and training

Hangar fees

Insurance

Employing a qualified crew is essential. Annual salaries for pilots and crew members can vary based on experience, aircraft type, and region, with total compensation varying significantly based on factors such as aircraft size and operational requirements. According to BizJetJobs, the average salary of a Global 6000/6500 pilot is in excess of $150,000 a year. Regular training and certifications are also necessary to maintain proficiency and comply with regulations, adding to the overall crew-related expenses.​

Storing the aircraft in a hangar protects it from environmental elements and ensures security. Hangar rental fees can vary based on location, facility quality, and aircraft size. For instance, Singapore Air Charter reports that hangar fees can range from $36,000 to $96,000 a year, depending on the size of the aircraft. Annually, this can amount to significant sums, especially in high-demand areas.​

Lastly, comprehensive insurance coverage is vital to protect against potential liabilities and damages. Annual premiums can range widely based on factors such as aircraft value, usage, coverage limits, and pilot qualifications. According to Flying MAG, premiums can range from $10,000 to $500,000 per year. It's advisable to consult with an insurance broker to tailor coverage to specific needs and ensure adequate protection.​

Variable operating costs

On the flip side of fixed costs are variable costs, which are dependent on the number of hours flown. Operating the jet incurs variable costs that fluctuate based on usage, including:

Fuel expenses

Maintenance and repairs

Landing and handling fees

Fuel is one of the most significant operating expenses. The cost of jet fuel can vary based on market conditions and regions. For example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) averaged the cost of jet fuel in 2025 to be about $87 per barrel, or approximately $2.07 per gallon, per OPIS. A mid-size jet flying 200 hours annually might consume around 36,000 gallons, totaling approximately $74,520 in fuel costs. However, fluctuations in fuel prices can significantly impact these expenses.​

Next up is maintenance – regular maintenance ensures safety and compliance with aviation standards. According to Singapore Air Charter, annual maintenance costs can range from $500,000 to $1,000,000 (or more), including routine servicing, inspections, and unexpected repairs, depending on the aircraft's age, type, and size. Additionally, older aircraft may require costly upgrades, such as installing Wi-Fi or refurbishing interiors, further adding to maintenance expenses.​

Airports charge fees for landing and ground handling services, which can accumulate significantly over time. These fees vary by airport and region and are influenced by factors such as aircraft size and the services required. While these fees may seem modest individually, they can add up, especially for frequent flyers.​

When combining fixed and variable expenses, the total annual cost of owning and operating a private jet can range widely. Estimates suggest annual costs between a few hundred thousand to a couple of million dollars, depending on factors like aircraft size, usage frequency, and operational choices. These figures underscore the importance of comprehensive budgeting and financial planning for prospective jet owners.​

Alternative ownership models

For those seeking the benefits of private aviation without the full financial commitment, alternative models exist.​

Fractional ownership

This model allows individuals to purchase a share of an aircraft, reducing upfront and operational costs. For example, fractional ownership programs may start at approximately $215,000 for a jet card with 275 hours of annual access, per Stratos Jets. Fractional ownership is particularly attractive for those who fly between 50 and 400 hours per year, offering guaranteed aircraft availability, professional management, and streamlined logistics without the hassle of full-time ownership responsibilities.

Jet cards and membership programs

Similarly, jet cards and private aviation memberships have gained popularity for offering prepaid access to private jet services without long-term commitments. With fixed hourly rates and guaranteed availability, jet card programs provide cost predictability and operational convenience.

In 2025, entry-level jet cards often start around $100,000 to $150,000, with hourly rates typically ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on aircraft category and provider. While these programs do not offer the same level of customization or personal branding as full ownership, they eliminate maintenance and management concerns entirely.

Charter services

Chartering remains a flexible, pay-as-you-go option for occasional travelers. It’s ideal for those flying fewer than 50 hours annually or for those exploring private aviation before committing to ownership. Depending on the aircraft type, distance, and destination, charter flights in 2025 can cost anywhere between $2,000 per hour for a turboprop and over $12,000 per hour for a heavy jet.

Platforms like XO, Wheels Up, and JetASAP have made chartering more accessible by offering digital booking tools and real-time pricing, making this option increasingly appealing for infrequent flyers.

Tax implications and incentives

Private jet ownership offers unique tax implications that can be both a burden and a benefit depending on how the aircraft is used. In some jurisdictions, owners may be eligible for tax deductions on operational expenses if the aircraft is used for business purposes.

In the United States, bonus depreciation continues to be a significant incentive—allowing buyers to deduct a substantial portion of the purchase cost in the year of acquisition. However, this benefit is gradually reducing: according to Aviation Tax Consultants, 2025 offers only 40% bonus depreciation (down from 100% in 2022), unless the aircraft qualifies under a binding contract from prior years that still allows 60% depreciation.

Owners must work closely with aviation tax consultants to structure aircraft ownership and usage properly—especially if combining business and personal travel—to avoid running afoul of IRS scrutiny or triggering unintended tax liabilities.

Environmental considerations and sustainability costs

As global attention shifts towards sustainability, owning a private jet in 2025 also carries an environmental and social cost. The carbon footprint of private aviation is significantly higher than that of commercial flights. In response, many owners are adopting greener practices, such as carbon offsetting programs and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage.

Carbon offsetting typically costs between $10 to $50 per metric ton of CO₂. A mid-size jet flying 200 hours a year can produce around 500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, resulting in offset costs of approximately $5,000 to $25,000 each year. SAF, while reducing lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, is currently two to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

However, as governments and industry invest in greener aviation, some regions offer subsidies or incentives for sustainable practices. The decision to operate sustainably may not be financially mandatory, but for many owners—especially high-profile individuals and corporations—it is becoming a reputational necessity.

Hidden and unexpected expenses

Beyond the obvious and recurring costs, owning a private jet includes several lesser-known expenses that can catch new owners off guard. For example:

Interior Refurbishment: Every few years, owners may opt to update cabin interiors for aesthetic reasons or to stay competitive in the charter market. These upgrades can cost anywhere from $100,000 to over $1 million depending on the materials, layout, and tech integrations.

Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to global aviation standards can result in unexpected costs, such as mandatory avionics upgrades (e.g., ADS-B compliance), international operating permits, or privacy services for flight tracking.

Management Fees: If the owner chooses to work with a management company to handle logistics, staffing, maintenance, and compliance, expect to pay between $100,000 to $250,000 annually for professional oversight.

Opportunity Cost: Tying up millions of dollars in a depreciating asset rather than investing it elsewhere is a financial trade-off often overlooked during the initial excitement of aircraft ownership.

The lifestyle value: is it worth it?

Despite the extensive costs, many jet owners will tell you the value lies not in dollars and cents, but in the lifestyle. The ability to fly on your schedule, access remote airports, avoid commercial travel disruptions, and create a personalized onboard environment offers convenience and peace of mind that money alone can’t measure. For high-level executives, celebrities, or individuals with tight travel schedules and security concerns, this freedom is often worth the expense.

That said, it’s vital to understand the economics. Private jet ownership is a financial decision as much as it is a lifestyle one. Anyone considering it in 2025 should have a clear picture of how often they’ll use the aircraft, what type of aircraft suits their needs, and whether alternative models might better align with their goals and budget.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/main-image-16_9-13-2.png,N,,2025-04-12 09:56:29.033158

På SAS tror vi på att driva utvecklingen genom samarbete. En gemensam riktning är avgörande för att skapa verklig förändring och stötta branschens omställning, säger Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President Public Affairs på SAS i en skriftlig kommentar.

E-SAF är ett syntetiskt bränsle som tillverkas med hjälp av förnybar el från exempelvis vind, sol eller vattenkraft. Det är koldioxidneutralt – eftersom det bara släpper ut den mängd koldioxid som tidigare fångats in vid produktionen.

Satsningen konkretiseras i Bodødeklarationen, som presenterades i samband med ett internationellt SAF-seminarium i norska Bodø den 9–10 april. Där samlades representanter från flygindustrin, forskarvärlden, NGO:er och EU-kommissionen.

Deklarationen bygger vidare på tidigare initiativ som Project SkyPower, där SAS i februari 2025 ledde ett upprop till EU-kommissionen tillsammans med en lång rad branschaktörer.

Målet med Bodødeklarationen är tydligt: att flyget även i framtiden ska kunna fylla sin viktiga roll i samhället – men med minskad klimatpåverkan. Här står flygbolag, teknikleverantörer, flygplatser, motor- och flygplanstillverkare, politiker och forskare enade bakom en gemensam ambition.

För SAS är strategiska partnerskap en nyckel i hållbarhetsarbetet. Ett tydligt exempel är samarbetet med Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Köpenhamns flygplats och Aalborgs flygplats. I november 2024 tecknade parterna ett avtal om att stötta dansk e-SAF-produktion inom ramen för Fjord PtX-projektet – ett initiativ som ska göra Danmark till en ledare inom hållbart flyg, skapa nya arbetstillfällen och bidra till en fossilfri framtid för branschen.

It was said to have carried up to 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones, potentially valued at billions of dollars. Now, Australia has discovered another treasure that might be even bigger. Could you imagine? This treasure is very unique. It might not be gold, silver, or even uncut gemstones, but it will be seen as one of the biggest in history.

The biggest renewable energy treasure in history is green

Renewable energy has become the most sought-after treasure in the 21st century. Now, we might have the biggest treasure yet, thanks to Australian company Vast Renewables Limited. The renewable energy company provides clean energy solutions that enable 24/7 green, cost-effective heat and power. The aim is to decarbonize the grid, green fuel production for the transport industry, and hard-to-abate industries.

Vast’s latest project, the Port Augusta utility-scale clean energy project, Vast Solar 1 (VS1), will include a hydrogen-based green methanol plant, Solar Methanol 1 (SM1). After securing up to AUD180 million of conditional funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), VS1’s construction can commence soon.

VS1 uses Vast’s next-generation concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) solution, and will be the first Australian project to supply essential long-duration renewable energy storage and production. Peak pricing intervals after sunset will be capitalized when isolated renewable energy, like solar energy, is unavailable. This will result in reliable, on-demand clean power to South Australia’s grid.

This treasure has practical applications

This historical treasure can potentially play a key role in pushing the global energy transition. Designed to supply carbon-free power and heat 24/7, VS1 will decarbonize the grid, fuel production for shipping and aviation, specialist industries such as data centers, and industries like mining and refining.

SM1 is being developed by Vast in alliance with a global energy company, Mabanaft. A real-world, in-demand application for hydrogen, green methanol has the potential to decarbonize shipping and is already utilized to power major container vessels.

These revolutionary projects will provide the foundation needed for the future exhibit of Vast’s global pipeline of clean energy projects that supplement intermittent solar panels and wind energy. VS1 and SM1 will contribute to generating green methanol and facilitate sustainable aviation fuel production.

The world will be able to see the result soon

With the much-needed funding from ARENA, VS1’s financing can almost be settled. The front-end engineering design (FEED) and commercial development have already been completed, giving Vast hope that the final investment decision (FID) will be reached. Additional investments are required to satisfy the range of AUD360 million. These additional investments will allow construction to begin in 2025.

Additional investors will also help boost the Australian economy, as Vast’s projects and production pursuits are expected to create dozens of Australian green manufacturing jobs, construction jobs, and long-term plant operations roles.

“By providing green, affordable electricity on demand when other renewables are not available to power homes, industry and fuel production, we deliver the missing piece of the puzzle.” – Craig Wood, CEO of Vast.

Wood announced he was grateful to ARENA and the Australian Government for their continued support for their project’s journey.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/661ccc8c85a612bece77e040_vastt.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 02:56:07.102765

After a hiatus of 13 years, Royal Jordanian resumed its flight service to Damascus.
Looking ahead, in the next five years, I envision RJ as a leading boutique airline, setting new benchmarks in service excellence, sustainability, and connectivity.","Mr. Karim Makhlouf, Chief Commercial Officer of Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJ), sheds light on the airline’s ambitious transformation into a leading boutique carrier.

With a legacy spanning over 61 years, Royal Jordanian (RJ) is not just Jordan’s flag carrier but a strategic connector between the Levant and the world, fostering tourism, cultural exchange, and regional connectivity.

At the heart of RJ’s vision lies the goal to position Amman as the premier Middle Eastern gateway, supported by the newly launched ExploRJordan brand — a fresh initiative to promote Jordan as a boutique destination blending modernity with authentic Arabian heritage.

Mr. Makhlouf outlines RJ’s robust expansion plans, including a 25% growth target, new non-stop routes to Washington D.C., and a long-awaited return to the Indian market with flights to Mumbai and New Delhi. He also speaks on fleet modernization, the revival of service to Damascus, and RJ’s enhanced partnership with Dnata.

Sustainability is a major pillar of RJ’s future, with the airline aiming to cut carbon emissions by over 32% through new aircraft and eco-conscious practices. This conversation offers a comprehensive look at how Royal Jordanian is redefining itself as a boutique airline for a boutique destination.

Tell us something about Brand RJ.

Royal Jordanian (RJ) is more than just an airline; it is a bridge between cultures, a key enabler of tourism, and a vital connector between the Levant and the world. With over 61 years of heritage, RJ has continuously evolved to reflect the rich legacy and warm hospitality of Jordan. Our vision is to position Amman as the premier gateway in the Middle East, providing seamless connectivity to Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa. We developed a brand called ExploRJordan which is mainly positioning Jordan as contemporary, authentic Arabia with a variety of activities in the line with a new tourism strategy.

Share with our readers about Royal Jordanian’s growth plans for the year 2025.

2025 is going to be a milestone year for us. We are focused on a growth strategy that revolves around two key pillars: boosting tourism in to Jordan and strengthening Amman as a key regional hub. We aim to grow by 25% this year, opening new routes and expanding our fleet to accommodate the rising demand. Our network expansion includes launching direct flights to Washington D.C. and entering the Indian market, which are critical steps towards our vision of enhancing connectivity.

Tell us something about your partnership with Dnata

Our partnership with Dnata represents a strategic move toward strengthening Royal Jordanian’s operational and organizational structure. Recently, we expanded our stake in Dnata’s catering company in Jordan, acquiring a 51% majority shareholding. This step aligns with our broader vision of enhancing our service offerings and supporting our customers’ needs by ensuring top-quality in-flight catering services.

This partnership allows us to leverage Dnata’s global expertise in catering and hospitality while ensuring that our local operations reflect Jordanian culture and hospitality values. It demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement, operational efficiency, and providing an elevated travel experience for our passengers. Through this collaboration, we aim to further position Royal Jordanian as a leading airline in the region, focusing on both passenger satisfaction and sustainable growth.

After a hiatus of 13 years, Royal Jordanian resumed its flight service to Damascus. How, in your opinion, will this impact global air travel?

In line with our levant strategy we always want to be the first to develop new markets and traffic within the levant region. We started the Syria flight on 31st January 2025 with daily flights allowing Syrians to use Amman as the preferred gateway to Europe, US and the Middle East with flight time of only 35 minutes from Amman to Damascus which is the shortest and fastest gateway to the world. With the increase geopolitical stability in the region, I expect traffic to and from Levant globally to over proportionally grow.

What are your plans to expand RJ’s fleet?

Fleet expansion is at the core of our growth strategy. Over the next one and a half years, we plan to introduce nearly 20 brand-new aircraft, including the Airbus A320neo family, Embraer E2 jets, and Boeing 787-9s for long-haul routes. These additions will not only enhance passenger comfort and experience but also contribute significantly to our sustainability goals by reducing carbon emissions by over 32%. RJ is set as a boutique airline to truly represent the boutique destination Jordan.

What markets do you target for your expansion plans?

Our expansion strategy is focused on strengthening connectivity with key global markets, where we opened more than 15 new routes in the last two years. While we have successfully grown our presence in Europe and North America, 2025 will see a stronger emphasis on Asia, with India being a major target. The Indian market holds immense potential, and we are dedicated to establishing Jordan as a boutique tourism destination for Indian travelers. Additionally, we opened new routes to Libya and Syria in line with our levant strategy. Casablanca will be added in the 3rd quarter to further increase our footprint in the region.

RJ will be launching non-stop flight service to Washington D.C. from mid-March 2025. How, in your opinion, this new route will be catering to the travel demands of passengers from the Middle East and North America?

The Washington D.C. route is a game-changer. There is a substantial demand for direct connectivity between Jordan and the U.S., especially for business travelers, diplomats, and the Jordanian diaspora. This route not only strengthens transatlantic travel but also provides seamless connections for passengers from surrounding Middle Eastern, North American and African countries traveling to the U.S. through Amman. The convenience of a direct flight will enhance travel options and elevate Royal Jordanian’s position in the US market.

Royal Jordanian returns to India after 10 years. Share your two cents on this new expansion plan with our readers.

We are introducing new flights to Mumbai and New Delhi with a complete new strategy in line with the new strategy of ExploRJordan, we are primarily promoting Jordan as a boutique destination. My aim is to double the number of tourism in India from 70,000 to 140,000 within the next 1-2 years. Furthermore, we will insure very high load factors through the selling of connecting flights via Amman to US, Canada, Middle East and North Africa with a global network of over 50 destinations. India as a booming aviation market will be key for our Asia growth strategy, and I foresee an increase in frequency within the next 12-18 months.

What are your goals and achievements in promoting and upholding sustainable aviation?

Sustainability is at the heart of our operations. Our fleet renewal plan is a major step towards reducing our carbon footprint by over 32% within three years. We are integrating fuel-efficient aircraft, optimizing routes, and exploring sustainable aviation fuel options. Additionally, through our ExploRJordan initiative, we actively promote eco-tourism and sustainable travel choices in Jordan, ensuring that we play our part in responsible tourism growth.

How do you describe your journey so far? Where do you wish to see your brand in the next five years?

The journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Despite geopolitical and economic challenges, Royal Jordanian has emerged stronger, with a clear growth vision and a renewed commitment to customer satisfaction. Looking ahead, in the next five years, I envision RJ as a leading boutique airline, setting new benchmarks in service excellence, sustainability, and connectivity. With our ambitious expansion plans and relentless focus on innovation, we are shaping the future of aviation in the region and beyond. RJ is following a strengthened growth with clear expansion targets. With our ExploRJordan initiative we will be the only airline in the region focusing primarily on tourism into Jordan.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SMR_3379-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 02:56:14.938629

Join us on Wednesday 16 April for ‘Understanding key trends in the energy transition’, a virtual student event with global law firm White & Case.","White & Case’s Ryan Gawrych and Hannah Bragge unpack life in the firm’s busy Energy, Infrastructure, Project and Asset Finance team

As governments and industries around the world race to decarbonise, lawyers are increasingly needed to advise on the new technologies and innovative deal structures driving the energy transition forward. From financing battery storage facilities to advising on green hydrogen projects, White & Case’s global Energy, Infrastructure, Project and Asset Finance (EIPAF) practice group is helping make it all happen.

Ahead next week’s virtual student event, ‘Understanding key trends in the energy transition — with White & Case‘, we caught up with the speakers, local partner Ryan Gawrych and associate Hannah Bragge, to hear what it’s like to work at the forefront of the energy transition.

Can you tell us a bit about your career journeys so far and what your day-to-day looks like in the EIPAF team at White & Case?

Bragge: I’m originally from Australia and started out at a different firm back home, but I’ve been with White & Case for a few years now, first in the Melbourne office, and more recently in London since August 2023. I focus mostly on project finance, especially in the renewables space, but I’ve also had great exposure to project development work, both at my previous firm and here at White & Case. One of the real strengths of our London team is that juniors and trainees get to work across both the financing and development sides of transactions. That kind of experience early on is really valuable for building a successful career.

Gawrych: Like Hannah, I’m Australian too, and I’ve had a bit of a global journey. I’ve worked in Australia, China, Mongolia, Indonesia, the UAE, the UK and now Germany. I’ve been with White & Case for just over two years and have a background that includes time at major resources companies and other international law firms. My practice is more focused on project development, commercial contracts, and M&A within the energy sector. That’s also what prompted my recent relocation to White & Case’s Hamburg office. I’m advising on low-carbon fuel projects across Europe, and Germany is right at the centre of a lot of the action.

What attracted you to this sector? What do you enjoy most about working on energy transition deals?

Bragge: It’s a mix of things. First, it’s just where the work is — this is where our clients are investing and building right now. But it’s also genuinely interesting. You’re dealing with emerging technologies, which means lenders aren’t always familiar with the risk profiles. A good example is batteries. They’re essential for balancing the grid, but the way they generate revenue differs from market to market and keeps changing. So, there’s a lot of creative legal thinking required. There’s definitely no copy-paste approach here. And personally, I find it exciting to be working on projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Gawrych: I’ve been working in the energy sector for quite a while. My career started in mining and oil & gas, especially advising Asian investors in Australian projects. But over the past seven or eight years, the global energy system has been undergoing a huge transformation. The shift away from fossil fuels is driven by everything from the Paris Climate Accords to energy security concerns. Working with big energy clients as they pivot towards renewables and new business models has been fascinating. You’re dealing with projects that have never been done before, or trying to apply lessons from one jurisdiction — say, a hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia — to a totally different legal and commercial context, like France or Germany. It’s blue-sky thinking, and it keeps things interesting.

Have you noticed changes in the market recently, especially with global elections and policy shifts?

Gawrych: While some headlines might suggest a general slowdown in the market, we’re seeing more of a recalibration, with the overall fundamentals remaining solid.

In Europe, there’s still a strong policy drive behind decarbonisation, and building new energy infrastructure remains a top political priority. But as governments are being put under increasing pressure to reallocate funding to defence and other nearshoring initiatives, we’re also seeing regulators and investors apply a higher degree of scrutiny to deal certainty and value for money. The result is a shift away from speculative technologies and structures, toward more mature and commercially viable projects. In the Middle East, we are seeing a slight slowdown in new project announcements, as developers wait to see how other markets play out following recent elections. However, the overall policy focus on the energy transition remains strong.

In the Americas, while there appears to be a policy shift away from renewables in the US, there’s still a lot happening in the energy transition space in relation to sustainable technologies like carbon capture and storage (i.e. things that reduce emissions but don’t necessarily fall under the ‘renewables’ label). And in Asia Pacific, investment in new technologies is also going strong, in particular, in green hydrogen, ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel. There’s also a lot of innovation coming out of the region around electrification and low-carbon fuels.

It sounds like a global and evolving landscape. What skills do aspiring lawyers need to thrive in this sector — and what should they be doing now to prepare?

Bragge: I think one of the biggest things to understand is that this area of law probably isn’t something you’ll study much at university, if at all. So, if you’re interested in it, you’ve got to be proactive. Read the Financial Times and The Economist. Follow project developers and green investors on LinkedIn to see how they are implementing the latest renewables, energy storage, and low-carbon technologies. White & Case publishes a lot of great materials on the intersection between the legal profession and the energy transitions that you should check-out, but there’s also plenty of other accessible content out there from other international law firms and legal commentators.

When you come into a transactional team like ours, you’ll be learning core legal skills like drafting and managing deal processes, but in our space, a broader awareness of the market really enhances the experience. And it helps you figure out if this work genuinely interests you. If you find yourself reading about a battery storage deal and thinking, “That’s cool, I want to know more,” then that’s a great sign.

Gawrych: I’d echo that. Our group probably has one of the steepest learning curves at the firm; not necessarily on the technical legal side, but in terms of understanding the industries we work in. You need to be curious. If you hear someone mention the HEFA process or green ammonia, and you’ve never come across those terms before, the instinct should be to go away, do some research, and get up to speed. That’s how you build context, which is crucial for our work. These are billion-dollar projects with huge moving parts, from engineering to policy to economics. You don’t have to be an expert from day one, and really our expertise will always be focussed on the law, but having a genuine interest and a willingness to learn about the industries that our clients operate in makes a huge difference.

And finally, what advice would you give students who are looking at firms like White & Case and thinking, ‘I want to be doing this kind of work’?

Bragge: Be curious, be informed, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you’re applying to White & Case, show that you understand what the firm actually does. We’re known for cross-border transactional work and complex infrastructure deals. If you’re passionate about global issues, climate change, or the energy sector, say so. And remember, everyone starts somewhere — you’re not expected to know everything, but showing a willingness to learn goes a long way.

Gawrych: I’d say embrace the complexity. It’s what makes the work challenging, but also what makes it rewarding. If you’re someone who likes puzzles, figuring out how different legal, commercial and technical elements all fit together, then this is a great place to be. And at White & Case, you’ll have opportunities to work on projects all over the world. That global perspective is baked into our culture and our deals, and it creates a really exciting environment to build your career. You do really need to get in there, lift up the bonnet, get stuck into the engine, and play around.

The legislation, spearheaded by Representatives Marcy Kaptur (D-Iowa) and Tracey Mann (R-Kan.) in the House, and Senators Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in the Senate, seeks to extend the crucial 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and ensure it primarily benefits fuels derived from domestically sourced feedstocks.

The bill, initially introduced in the previous legislative session, has garnered additional support this time around, with Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), and Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) joining as cosponsors. This bipartisan backing underscores the widespread recognition of the importance of renewable fuels to both the agricultural sector and the nation's energy security.

The 45Z tax credit, a key component of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, currently offers incentives for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The credit structure provides 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Notably, facilities that adhere to prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements can qualify for significantly higher credit values, reaching up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. This existing credit is slated to remain in effect for the years 2025, 2026, and 2027.

The Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act proposes a significant extension of this vital credit, pushing its expiration date an additional seven years to the end of 2034. This extended timeframe aims to provide greater long-term certainty for biofuel producers and farmers, encouraging further investment and innovation within the sector.

Beyond the extension, a central tenet of the bill is the inclusion of language that would restrict eligibility for the 45Z credit to fuels ""derived from a feedstock which was produced or grown in the United States."" This provision directly addresses concerns about the potential for imported feedstocks to benefit from a tax credit intended to support domestic industries. By prioritizing domestically sourced biomass, the legislation seeks to strengthen American agriculture, create rural economic opportunities, and reduce reliance on foreign inputs.

The reintroduced legislation has already garnered strong support from key industry stakeholders. Organizations such as Growth Energy, the American Soybean Association, the National Oilseed Processors Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Sorghum Producers, the U.S. Canola Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association have all voiced their approval.

Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, emphasized the critical need for long-term certainty provided by the bill, stating, ""Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can feel confident investing in dozens of new energy projects across rural America. With this bill they’ll have the certainty they need to accelerate innovation, create thousands of new jobs, and secure new markets for farmers and biofuel producers."" She further commended Senators Marshall and Klobuchar for their leadership and thanked other rural champions for their efforts.

The reintroduction of the Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act signals a strong commitment from a bipartisan coalition to support the growth of the domestic renewable fuels industry and ensure that American farmers are at the forefront of this burgeoning sector. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be closely watched by agricultural producers, biofuel companies, and environmental advocates alike.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-11 16:56:37.726822

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pioneer XCF Global Takes Flight With Ambitious IPO Amid Industry Tailwinds

byVasil Velev

April 10, 2025

3 minute read

XCF Global, a leading player in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market, is preparing for a high-profile IPO in the coming days, seeking to establish a foothold in a market poised for growth both in the U.S. and globally, according to its CEO Mihir Dange.

“We are really just at the inception point of what this market is going to look like over the next 10 years,” Dange said in an exclusive interview. The company’s strategy hinges on securing early-mover advantages in a market expected to grow exponentially as airlines race to meet carbon reduction mandates.

Crucial to XCF’s public debut is its newly inked 15-year agreement with energy company Phillips 66 for both feedstock supply and offtake—a move Dange describes as “a base case model which is mitigated and has upside.” The agreement is designed to ensure operational stability while giving XCF the flexibility to pursue better pricing opportunities. It also allows for flexibility if circumstances change. “We pay for the right to move away from the Phillips 66 relationship if we want to, ” he added.

IRA Uncertainty Casts a Shadow

Despite the momentum, concerns loom over the stability of federal incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The federal producer credits, vital for SAF economics, are set to expire in 2027. “..if federal credits left, there would be some type of state credits helping to push forward,” Dange assured.

In California, once the poster child for green fuel adoption, recent legislative changes have shifted momentum to other states. “We’re seeing a lot of that production actually moving out of the state and going into other states,” Dange observed.

But the company is betting on a shifting landscape across the country, where state-level incentives fill the federal gap. “Nevada is working on AB 481, which is potentially putting two and a half dollars of credits per gallon,” said Dange, emphasizing the importance of local legislation for future viability.

Emerging hubs like Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, and Nevada are positioning themselves with new tax credits and rural development programs. “There are so many different business models that there is not one right answer,” he said, highlighting the industry’s experimental phase.

Still, the potential withdrawal of federal support raises broader questions about whether the reduced support in the U.S. can sustain the industry. “It would be foolish to think that a domestic-only strategy would be the only strategy going forward,” XCF Global’s CEO warns.

International Demand for SAF: Europe Leads, Asia Follows

Globally, the SAF sector is gaining steam. Europe, with its stringent mandates—2% SAF in 2025 scaling up to 70% by 2050—is leading the charge. “You cannot use book and claim to put it into the wing. You have to actually have the molecule into the wing of the plane,” Dange said, underlining Europe’s push for real emissions reductions.

Other regions are quickly catching up. “Japan is looking at a mandate. Australia wants to put a mandate. China has targets,” Dange noted, painting a picture of burgeoning international demand.

CORSIA Demand and XCF’s Expanding Project Pipeline

This pipeline of countries and markets provides certainty for future plans and could tie in nicely with the aviation industry’s main mechanism for SAF adoption – the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

The sector’s adoption of CORSIA standards is creating a baseline of demand for low-carbon aviation fuel. “CORSIA and international mandates…will not change the supply-demand need that more infrastructure has to come up, period” Dange stressed.

Looking ahead, XCF Global plans to leverage its first project’s success to launch additional production facilities. New projects will be shaped by local incentives, feedstock availability, and export opportunities, even involving complex logistics like “moving product from Reno to Europe” if economics allow.

At first glance this is a difficult moment for all carbon mitigating initiatives in the U.S. with various incentives being removed from the board and increasing uncertainty and risk. “That difficulty is also the opportunity that is born in the space,” Mihir Dange concluded.

Steel can make up nearly a third of an LNG terminal's pricetag, so the new levies could push up costs and push back start-up dates, writes Xiaoyi Deng London, 11 April (Argus) — US president Donald Trump's volatile tariff policy and some of the countermeasures already announced by large trade partners are unlikely to cause any direct disruption to global gas markets. But they will have a direct impact on future US liquefaction capacity. And the indirect effects on gas supply and demand could be huge, stemming from a weaker macroeconomic outlook, fuel substitution and inflationary pressures on infrastructure development. US LNG developers hailed Trump's return to office, after complaining that his predecessor complicated the issuance of additional export licences. But Trump's imposition of 25pc tariffs on all foreign-sourced steel and aluminum, from 12 March, will increase infrastructure costs in the US' upstream and midstream sectors. These present an immediate risk for US LNG developers, particularly for the five projects under construction and the six others expected to reach final investment decisions (FIDs) this year. Metals account for up to 30pc of the cost of an LNG export plant. A terminal can cost $5bn-25bn to build, depending on its size, with steel used for pipelines, tanks and other structural frameworks. Facilities can be built using some domestically produced metal, but higher prices for this might lead to construction and FID delays for the country's planned liquefaction projects. US tariffs' primary effect on the domestic gas market stems from duties levied on non-energy goods used by the oil and gas industry, including steel and specialised pipeline components such as valves and compressors, which are imported. The US remains a net natural gas importer from Canada , but these flows are unlikely to be affected by trade tariffs, given the lack of alternative supply sources available to some northern US states. Tariff baiting Trump's latest tariff round , unveiled on 2 April, involves a a minimum 10pc on all foreign imports from 5 April,with much higher tariffs on selected countries that briefly came into force on 9 April, before Trump bowed to panic in financial markets and announced a 90-day pause. China is the key exception. It has announced retaliatory tariffs that could disrupt US energy exports, resulting in an escalation that leaves the overall levy at 145pc in the US and 125pc in China. China had already stopped importing US LNG earlier this year. But disruption to trade between the world's two largest economies may weigh heavily on manufacturing activity in China, in turn reducing industrial gas demand. And the ripple effects of disruption to US LPG exports to China may alter fuel-switching economics in the region and beyond. Most other countries in Asia-Pacific have opted not to follow China's lead by retaliating. The Japanese government intends to negotiate a better tariff deal and is considering investing in the US' proposed 20mn t/yr Alaska LNG export project as part of wider efforts to reduce its trade surplus with the US. Countries in Asia-Pacific have been hit with some of the highest of Trump's targeted duties. The EU is keeping retaliatory measures on the table, but these are unlikely to involve US LNG. Europe has become much more reliant on LNG imports after losing the bulk of its Russian pipeline supply, and imposing tariffs on energy imports would only reignite inflationary pressures that European countries have tried to curb over the past three years. The bloc says it is ready to negotiate on possibly increasing its US LNG imports to reduce its trade surplus and would axe tariffs on industrial imports if the US agrees to do the same. But Trump says this is not enough, citing the EU's upcoming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism as one of the ""unfair trade practices"" that justifies a tariff response.

Q&A: IMO GHG scheme in EU ETS could be 'challenging'

London, 11 April (Argus) — Delegates have approved the global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism proposal at the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 83rd Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting. Argus Media spoke to ministerial adviser and Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, on the sidelines of the London MEPC meeting. What is your initial reaction to the text? We are happy and satisfied about the content of the agreed text, so far. But we need to be careful. This week, all member states were able to vote. But in October, when adaption will take place, only those states which are parties to Marpol Annex VI will be able to vote if indeed a vote is called for, and that changes the situation a little bit. Here when we were voting, a minority was enough — 40 votes. But if or when we vote in October, then we need two thirds of those party to Marpol Annex VI to be in favour of the text. Will enthusiasm for the decision today remain by October? I'm pretty sure it will. But you never know what will happen between now and and the next six months. What is the effect of the decision on FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS? Both FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS have a review clause. This review clause states that if we are ambitious enough at the IMO, then the EU can review or amend the regulation. So of course, it is very important that we first consider if the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough to meet EU standards. Only after that evaluation, which won't be until well after October, can we consider these possible changes. Do you think the EU will be able to adopt these the text as it stands today? My personal view is that we can perhaps incorporate this text under FuelEU Maritime, but it may be more challenging for the EU ETS, where shipping is now included. What was the impact of US President Donald Trump's letter on the proceedings? EU states were not impacted, but it's difficult to say what the impact was on other states.

Fujairah biofuel uptake lags despite EU rules push

Dubai, 11 April (Argus) — Alternative bunker fuels like biofuels have yet to gain significant traction in the UAE port of Fujairah, the world's third-largest bunkering hub, even though EU regulations such as FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) are driving demand expectations. Discussions at the S&P Global Commodity Insights FUJCON 2025 this week highlighted a combination of structural and market-driven factors holding back adoption, with limited demand from key vessel types and insufficient infrastructure investment topping the list. The introduction of FuelEU Maritime, which mandates a 2pc reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity for ships calling at EU ports starting this year, alongside the EU ETS carbon pricing mechanism was expected to spur demand for biofuels in Fujairah. Many vessels refueling in the UAE hub transit to Europe, making compliance with these regulations a potential driver for alternative fuel uptake. A key reason cited is the limited presence of containerships and cruise ships in Fujairah's bunkering market. Globally, these vessel types are the primary consumers of biofuels due to their operators' commitments to decarbonisation and customer-driven sustainability demands. Fujairah's bunkering activity is dominated by bulk carriers and tankers, which have been slower to adopt alternative fuels. ""Containerships and cruise ships are leading the charge on biofuels in Singapore and Rotterdam, but they are just not a big part of the mix here,"" said Fujairah harbour master Mayed Alameeri. ""We support the use of green fuels, but without that demand pull, there's little incentive to scale up."" This lack of demand has deterred investments in biofuel storage and supply infrastructure. Unlike in Singapore and Rotterdam, where biofuel bunkering is supported by dedicated facilities, Fujairah's infrastructure remains geared toward conventional fuels. ""There is no single shipowner who has partnered with a supplier in Fujairah on adoption of alternative fuels,"" said Hafnia Bunker general manager Kasper Sorensen. ""It is very difficult to make a business case for investment."" While there have been sporadic inquiries from shipowners over the past year, these have been for small amounts — typically 150-200t — far below the scale needed to spur investment. ""You need steady offtake to justify the capex for tanks and blending,"" a Fujairah supplier said. ""Right now, we're not seeing it."" Market dynamics also play a role. The price spread between biofuels and conventional fuels remains a hurdle, with Fujairah's B24 blend trading at a significant premium to very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). Mandates need certainty The bunker market is under pressure to decarbonise as the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) targets a 50pc cut in shipping emissions by 2050 from 2008 levels. Alternative fuels are central to this goal, but regulatory disparities complicate investment decisions, industry players said. Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of caution. While FuelEU's pooling mechanism allows shipowners to offset emissions across fleets, potentially enabling biofuel bunkering in Fujairah to count toward EU compliance, clarity on implementation is limited. Bunker market participants urged the adoption of universal standards for alternative bunker fuels, warning that fragmented regulations are hampering the shift to lower-carbon options. ""Shipowners are still figuring out how to navigate these rules which are regionally divergent,"" said a shipping broker. ""Until there's more certainty, many are sticking with what they know."" Still, some market participants expressed cautious optimism. Rising inquiries, although sporadic, suggest growing awareness of biofuels' role in meeting EU mandates. ""It's not a flood, but it's a trickle that could build,"" said a bunker trader. For now, Fujairah's biofuel market remains in a holding pattern, waiting for demand signals strong enough to shift the hub's bunkering landscape.

Japan's Cosmo starts delivering SAF from Sakai refinery

Tokyo, 11 April (Argus) — Japanese energy firm Cosmo Energy has started supplying domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced at the country's first large-scale SAF plant. This marks the first SAF delivery from the plant housed at refiner Cosmo Oil's Sakai refinery, Cosmo Energy announced on 10 April. Cosmo Energy's subsidiary Cosmo Oil Marketing delivered SAF to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) at the country's western Kansai International Airport on 10 April. The delivered amount should be 15 kilolitres, based on JASDF's public notice for the tender. SAF producing joint venture Saffaire Sky Energy — launched by Cosmo Oil, engineering firm JGC and biodiesel producer Revo International — produces this SAF from used cooking oil (UCO) at the plant. The firms aim to supply around 30,000 kilolitres/yr, and plan to begin delivering SAF to domestic airlines Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA), the US' Delta Air Lines , Finland's Finnair, and German logistics group DHL Express in the 2025 fiscal year starting this April. JASDF's acrobatic flight team Blue Impulse will use the SAF in an exhibition flight scheduled on 13 April, the opening day of Expo 2025, over the event's venue in Osaka. Separately, an explosion occurred at the Sakai refinery on 10 April, but its 100,000 b/d crude distillation unit (CDU) is still operating, according to Cosmo Oil and the local fire department. The fire department received a notice from the refinery's staff that ""an explosion happened at a sulphuric acid regeneration equipment, with no fires or leaks of LPG."" The refinery was heating sulphuric acid for purification when the explosion happened. The SAF plant at the refinery is not affected by the accident, Cosmo said.

But experts say it could be a while before these “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” – synthetic aviation fuels produced from fossil-free electricity and recycled carbon dioxide – can be a major way to make aviation sustainable.

How to fly green

“There’s a collection of sectors such as aviation, long-distance maritime shipping, chemical industry, steel production – making these sectors sustainable is not as easy as for other sectors, where you can just directly apply electrification,” chemical engineer Maartje Feenstra said.

Feenstra, a senior research consultant at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures, said batteries were not viable technical solutions for airplanes.

“They don’t provide the right energy density. So that means that for aviation, we have a limited amount of technical possibilities for the energy transition. That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.

University of Adelaide researcher Tracey Dodd, a global expert on energy policy, said the aviation industry was lobbying for the right policy environments for sustainable fuels.

“But even with the best projections, it’s only going to be 0.7 per cent of fuel globally,” she said.

“That’s a drop in the ocean. How can we support a sustainable aviation revolution?”

Dodd said the technology existed for a transition to sustainable fuel sources.

“There are several synthetic biofuels that can be used in existing aircraft, meaning there is no need to change the aircraft. Algae also has significant potential, but it is more expensive as the feedstock can be used for other purposes, such as pharmaceutical products. Additionally, scientists are exploring new pathways, including hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels,” she said.

“Every day we have a new innovation. The problem is scaling it up.”

What is sustainably produced aviation fuel?

The European Union roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels requires them to make up 2 per cent of European supply by 2025, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and reaching 70 per cent by 2050.

“The aviation sector, in particular, will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” said Roland Dittmeyer from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany.

“Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.”

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project, which announced advances in sustainable fuel production in March.

KIT, and industrial partner Sunfire, said it had used water vapour and CO2 co-electrolysis technology to produce synthetic kerosene at a scale that could be used industrially.

“It’s nice to see this technology scaling up and getting sort of demonstration volumes,” said Feenstra, who is not involved in Kopernikus P2X.

Sunfire and KIT say it’s a world first. Their “syngas” – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that are converted into long-chain hydrocarbons called “syncrude” – has a 220-kilowatt (kW) output.

A Boeing 777’s twin-jet engines have a total power output of about 130,000kW.

“Co-electrolysis stands out, in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapour and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step,” said Sunfire senior engineer Hubertus Richter.

“Up to 85 per cent of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.”

Richter said Sunfire could also demonstrate that coupling the process with its co-electrolysis method meant a very high plant availability and reliability – and could potentially produce syngas with the desired quality at any time.

“This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process,” he said.

Feenstra helps illustrate Kopernikus P2X’s output another way: “With a daily production of 300 litres of syncrude, it would still take 796 days (over two years) to fill up a Boeing 747-400. For the next envisioned production of a tonne a day, it would still take slightly over half a year to fill up a Boeing 747-400.”

So there’s some way to go yet.

A problem of soaring costs

“The challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. … The more sustainable aviation fuel we require, the more that price difference is going to hurt you,” Feenstra said.

“If we want to make aviation sustainable, we’ll have to enable these fuels in one way or another.”

Dodd has been outspoken in her concerns about “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2-emitting aircraft. While scientists have raised concerns about global tourism emissions, Dodd said the issues should be tackled collectively.

People “shouldn’t necessarily have to stop doing what we love doing and what makes the world tick. We just need to be really innovative about how we can move forward”, she said.

“I think that we need to pay great attention to the challenges of decarbonising aviation,” she said.

“I understand that decarbonising the electricity system must be a priority, but we also need to consider sustainable aviation fuels to ensure it receives the necessary business and policy support.

“Aviation is a particularly hard-to-abate sector, and everyone I know in the industry is deeply committed to making progress. I want to support and encourage their efforts … it’s important to address both electricity and aviation decarbonisation.”

Dodd said one possibility would be to encourage businesses and universities that used long-distance travel to invest in sustainable aviation fuels.

“[That would mean] businesses being aware of and paying attention to how impacted their supply chain is by aviation and how – for us to move forward – that perhaps they could be supporting and partnering the airlines to scale up commercial availability of sustainable aviation field,” she said.

“You want to ensure that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive and that it won’t price certain people out of the market for flying, or for goods like flowers and coffee that we ship.”",https://wp.thenewdaily.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1743638332-pexels-refuelplane.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-04-11 09:57:12.891883

US President Donald Trump’s tariff plans, particularly on imported vehicles, sparked concern over the effects of the tariffs on such purchases, and subsequently diesel demand growth.

Furthermore, data released by the Department for Energy Security revealed that the UK’s crude oil production rose for the third consecutive month during January, reaching the highest levels since May 2023.

Meanwhile, data also highlighted that the UK’s consumption of refined petroleum products declined by 2% compared to the year prior, with diesel demand falling by 12,250 barrels per day from December 2024’s levels.

Sterling appreciated from US$1.270 to US$1.291 throughout March, reaching a four-month high as uncertainty dominated US markets. Trump’s global tariff plans sparked concerns over the potential impacts of higher prices on demand growth as the President pledged to implement trade tariffs on imports from all US trading partners.

By mid-month, market attention turned to key monetary policy decisions whereby both the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.5% and in the range of 4.25-4.5%, respectively.

By month-end, sterling traded within the US$1.29-US$1.30 range following the UK Spring Budget, which revealed government spending cuts of £3.6 billion to adhere to fiscal rules. As sterling strengthened against the US dollar throughout March, UK wholesale diesel became marginally cheaper by 0.74ppl.

Wholesale UK renewable diesel (HVO) prices rose from 106ppl to 112ppl (excluding duty and Renewable Transport Fuel Certificate (RTFC) benefit) during March, underpinned by increasing cost pressures amid feedstock prices rising to three-year highs, particularly for used cooking oil (UCO).

Supply-side concerns mounted as markets awaited guidance by the Indonesian government on UCO export restrictions after it issued regulations to curb exports earlier in the year.

From mid-month, the UK initiated an anti-dumping investigation into HVO imports from the US following a request from several stakeholders on reports that the price cap had narrowed and HVO may now be directly competing with UK-produced biodiesel.

Furthermore, a feasibility study of conversion of Grangemouth oil refinery to a renewable fuel facility was carried out by EY on behalf of the UK government. It presented nine projects that could be integrated, with one proposal being a sustainable aviation fuel and HVO plant, costing £800 million. An outline of final recommendations is expected to be published soon.

In other news, North Ayrshire council has transitioned thirty-six refuse collection vehicles from diesel to HVO to support Scottish Government sustainability goals that include phasing out new diesel or petrol vehicles in public sector fleets by 2030. Reports suggested that the council’s transition could save around 2,529 tonnes of carbon emissions over 12 months.

Furthermore, Neste delivered its first load of HVO to a cruise terminal in Singapore, kickstarting Singapore’s path to decarbonisation amid various industry goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

The 2024/25 Net Zero Report, based on a survey of sustainability leaders from 350 financial firms across 13 countries, highlights that 72% of institutions have no plans to reduce fossil fuel investments over the next decade.

At the same time, 44% intend to increase their exposure to low-carbon assets, and nearly 80% are more inclined to fund companies with clear climate transition plans.

According to Dr. Daniel Klier, CEO of South Pole, the findings underscore a troubling paradox: “Financial institutions want to have their cake and eat it too.”

He added that while financiers are ramping up climate-related engagement with their portfolio companies, they continue to fund fossil fuels, walking “a tightrope” between long-term climate goals and short-term investor returns.

Sarah Lindsay, assistant director of operational experience and sustainability, who has been with Farnborough International for 16 years, shares her insights on the process of the partnership.

“Many potential suppliers didn’t grasp the size of our event. Some offered rough estimations, but we wanted a more granular, evidence-based approach,” said Lindsay.

GCS first mission was to calculate the emissions generated by visitor travel to and from the airshow, and using the GCS Visitor Travel Carbon Calculator, Farnborough International was able to target its audience directly for the first time.

The tool was integrated into the registration process, and attendees were invited to receive a personalised carbon footprint report in exchange for sharing their travel data.

According to Lindsay, GCS’s engagement with key suppliers such as catering and transport has saved both time and resources.

The air show display is also something being factored in as the operation teams have provided fuel data, confirming that all display aircrafts are powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), supplied by the TAG-owned Farnborough Airport.

Additionally, Farnborough International’s Destination Zero campaign aims to achieve net zero emissions by embedding sustainability across four strategic pillars, (1. Energy 2. Reduce, Reuse & Recycle 3. Partnerships, and 4. Wellbeing & Community) to be able to deliver events and experiences for years to come.

The final GCS report is now being analysed to identify further ways to cut emissions ahead of the 2026 event.

World revenue for the Biofuel Industry Market is set to surpass US$138.97 billion in 2025.

Government Policies and Regulatory Support

Governments worldwide are implementing policies and incentives to encourage biofuel production and adoption as part of their efforts to reduce carbon emissions and achieve energy security. Mandates such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the U.S. and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) in the European Union have set minimum blending requirements for biofuels in transportation fuels. Additionally, tax credits, subsidies, and carbon pricing mechanisms are making biofuels a more attractive alternative to fossil fuels.

For example, the U.S. government provides a biodiesel tax credit of $1 per gallon, benefiting companies such as Renewable Energy Group (REG) and Valero Energy Corporation, which produce and distribute biodiesel and renewable diesel. Similarly, Neste, a Finland-based company, is expanding its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in response to EU regulations promoting the use of biofuels in aviation.

Feedstock Supply Constraints and Competition with Food Production

One of the most pressing challenges in the biofuel industry is the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks. First-generation biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, primarily rely on corn, sugarcane, soy, and palm oil, leading to concerns over food security and land use conflicts. The expansion of biofuel production in regions like Brazil, Indonesia, and the U.S. has sparked debates about deforestation, biodiversity loss, and rising food prices.

As governments push for higher biofuel blending targets, competition between food and fuel markets intensifies. For example, Indonesia's biodiesel program has driven up palm oil demand, impacting food prices and contributing to deforestation. Similarly, ethanol production in the U.S. has raised concerns over corn availability for food and livestock feed. To overcome this challenge, the industry must diversify feedstock sources, focusing on waste-based, cellulosic, and algae-based biofuels. However, these alternatives require significant investments in technology and infrastructure, delaying large-scale commercialization.

That slightly outpaces the Gulfstream G700 , which tops out at Mach 0.935. While both are leaders in the ultra-long-range jet category, Bombardier has claimed the crown for speed - a defining factor for time-sensitive operators and elite business travelers.

Speed is a critical factor for many business jet customers. A few minutes saved per leg adds up over transcontinental operations. High cruise speeds improve scheduling flexibility, reduce fatigue on long-haul missions, and appeal to very busy executives. In our article, we will compare the Global 8000 and G700’s speed capabilities, examine the technology behind them, and assess what it means for their market positioning.

Performance By The Numbers: Bombardier Global 8000 vs Gulfstream G700

The Bombardier Global 8000 cruises at Mach 0.94 and offers a maximum range of 8,000 nautical miles (14,816 kilometers). Its GE Passport engines balance high thrust with efficiency. In comparison, the Gulfstream G700 reaches Mach 0.935 and can fly up to 7,750 nautical miles (14,353 kilometers), using Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines. Both jets feature advanced aerodynamics and support for sustainable aviation fuel.

Neither aircraft currently has multiple variants. The Global 8000 was derived from the Global 7500 platform, achieving performance gains through aerodynamic enhancements and software updates. Gulfstream has opted to reserve upgrades for its upcoming G800 while continuing to refine the G700 as its premier offering.

According to Bombardier's official website, the Global 8000 is the fastest non-military jet after the Concorde:

“Our Global 8000 is the world’s fastest civilian aircraft since Concorde with a top speed of Mach 0.94 and the only business jet with four true living spaces and a range of 8000 nautical miles to take you faster, farther and in greater comfort than anything else in business aviation.”

The Global 8000 also made headlines during certification testing in 2021 by achieving a whooping Mach 1.015 in a dive, which was confirmed by a NASA F-18 chase plane, validating its structural integrity and high-speed capability. Gulfstream has also extensively tested the G700, aiming for full customer deliveries this year.

Specifications: Gulfstream G700 vs Bombardier Global 8000

How The Global 8000 Achieves This Performance

The Global 8000’s impressive speed is possible thanks to its aerodynamic wing design and efficient GE Passport turbofans. The aircraft also features the Vision flight deck and Bombardier’s Pũr Air system, contributing to a low cabin altitude and high comfort without sacrificing performance.

To reach Mach 0.94, the Global 8000 typically cruises much higher than commercial airliners, between 41,000 and 45,000 feet. Top speeds are most achievable under lighter load conditions, with fuel and payload optimized for long-haul missions in favorable atmospheric conditions.

There are trade-offs. High-speed operations require precise flight planning and elevated maintenance demands. The increased performance also comes with a higher purchase price and requires strict adherence to operational envelopes for noise and wear limitations.

How Bombardier Global 8000 Compares To Gulfstream G700 and Other Competing Aircraft

While the Global 8000 narrowly claims the title for top speed, the Gulfstream G700 brings a range of advantages that appeal to different priorities. The G700 features five customizable living zones - one more than the Global 8000, offering unparalleled in-flight comfort and privacy. It also has a larger cabin with 100% fresh air replenished every two to three minutes and a low cabin altitude of just 4,850 feet at 41,000 feet cruise.

The G700’s Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines also contribute to its smooth and quiet operation, giving it an edge in passenger experience. Its Symmetry Flight Deck with active control sidesticks enhances pilot ergonomics and safety. The G700 also has advanced cabin technologies like circadian lighting to minimize jet lag. G700 can also fly at speeds close to the sound barrier while maintaining a relaxing onboard environment.

With its 2024 entry into service, it’s arriving just slightly ahead of Bombardier’s latest model, which gives Gulfstream a slight head start in the market. Several celebrities, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, have already purchased this aircraft. Future rivals like the Dassault Falcon 10X and Gulfstream’s G800 are expected to continue pushing the envelope. Still, the G700 is firmly positioned as the premier choice for those who value cabin experience and overall luxury as much as speed.

Operational Use And Airline Strategy

Speed plays a vital role in charter operations, VIP transport, government, and military use. Operators can cut crucial minutes on intercontinental routes such as Singapore–Los Angeles or London–Hong Kong.

The Global 8000’s cruise capability makes it ideal for missions where time and endurance matter. The G700, while slightly slower, is often favored for its spacious layout and smooth ride, especially for ultra-long-haul comfort. The G700’s maximum range allows nonstop missions like Dubai–New York or Hong Kong–London. Its large cabin and low cabin altitude reduce jet lag, making it a strong choice for luxury charter companies and elite government operations. Military operators could potentially be interested in acquiring a new G700 as well, judging by the immense popularity of previous Gulfstream aircraft among Air Forces worldwide for VIP transport and as a spy plane.

Gulfstream promotes the G700 as ideal for non-stop travel between virtually any two cities worldwide, and operators choose this jet for its reliability, rapid dispatch, and smooth ride in premium flight planning.

Airline Adoption And Feedback

Bombardier has already attracted a roster of elite clients, including government delegations, multinational corporations, and VIP charter services. Many early Global 8000 orders are upgrades from the Global 7500, signaling customer trust. The launch customer for the brand-new Bombardier is one of the world’s largest private jet rental companies – NetJets, which has already placed an order for four aircraft. NetJets is also a key client using Global 7500.

Operators have praised its quiet interior, low cabin altitude, and stable handling at high altitudes. While full operational feedback will expand following the 2025 entry into service, initial impressions suggest Bombardier’s promises are becoming a reality.

Meanwhile, the Gulfstream G700 has been embraced by key clients, including Qatar Executive (a business jet charter branch of Qatar Airways), Flexjet, and private owners worldwide. Feedback highlights its cabin comfort, advanced avionics, and performance on long-haul sectors. Gulfstream has reported strong interest and order backlogs, with operators particularly praising the G700’s smooth handling and innovative cockpit design.

The Story Behind the Aircraft's Development

The Global 8000 was conceived during a period of post-pandemic resurgence in business aviation, when speed, range, and health-conscious features gained new prominence.

Bombardier built on the Global 7500’s success, launching the Global 8000 in 2022 with upgraded aerodynamics and cabin innovations. Development stayed largely in-house, with certification milestones achieved using the same test fleet.

Meanwhile, the Gulfstream G700 was announced in 2019 as a direct response to growing demand for ultra-long-range, high-performance jets. It was built on the proven and well-tested G650 platform but stretched to accommodate more cabin space. It was integrated with next-generation technology, including the Symmetry Flight Deck and advanced fly-by-wire systems. The G700 also introduced Gulfstream’s Predictive Landing Performance System and SmartView Synthetic Vision, improving safety and situational awareness. Gulfstream targeted operators who prioritize comfort, operational range, and speed, positioning the G700 as its flagship. The aircraft completed its maiden flight in early 2020 and has undergone an extensive test campaign with multiple prototypes.

What Comes Next?

Interior upgrades, new tech packages, and potential cabin re-configurations will likely follow as the Global 8000 enters service. Though no new variants have been announced, software improvements and connectivity enhancements are on the roadmap.

Other prominent competitors like the Falcon 10X and Gulfstream G800 could shift the competitive balance, but it will take significant innovations to match the Global 8000’s Mach 0.94 mark.

For Gulfstream, the G700 is just the beginning. The company is already working on the G800, which will offer similar speeds but with an even more extended range of 8,000 NM. Additionally, future software updates for the G700 are expected to enhance operational efficiency and cockpit integration. With its strong customer base and advanced systems, the G700 is well-positioned to remain competitive well into the 2030s.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/main-image-16_9-6-3.png,N,,2025-04-11 05:56:52.750164

An in-depth analysis reveals a nation leveraging its abundant resources and proactive policies, but also confronting significant logistical and technological challenges.

The pivotal question remains: can Malaysia effectively harness collaborative innovation, particularly through its strengthened alliance with Airbus and its long-term strategic vision, to realize its ambitious SAF goals?

In a landmark move to revolutionize the skies, aerospace giant Airbus and the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC) have inked a cutting-edge research and technology deal aimed at powering up the SAF supply chain across the Asia-Pacific region.

This collaboration, as highlighted during the Airbus Industry Outreach, underscores the strategic importance of Malaysia in the region's sustainable aviation future.

Airbus's strategic endorsement of Malaysia's potential, encapsulated in their statement, ""We see huge potential here in Malaysia,"" underscores the nation's burgeoning role in regional sustainability. This aligns seamlessly with Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher's overarching vision.

Interviewed by DagangNews following the Airbus Industry Outreach event in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday, Kitcher articulated: ""Our primary focus is to ramp up those aircraft, so that our airlines can take delivery of those most fuel efficient planes in support of their competitiveness."" This dual emphasis on production efficiency and sustainability is central to Airbus's strategy.

Kitcher's insights shed light on Airbus's approach to balancing production demands with sustainability goals. Addressing supply chain challenges post-COVID, she noted, ""We delivered 766 aircraft last year, so the ramp up is progressing and this year our guidance is to deliver around 820 commercial aircraft.""

This focus on delivering fuel-efficient aircraft directly supports the industry's net-zero 2050 goal, as these planes represent the ""first lever to that sustainability goal.""

Furthermore, Kitcher outlined Airbus's comprehensive sustainability priorities, encompassing internal emission reductions and industry-wide targets. ""We have a number of priorities for our own company, so to reduce our scope one and scope two emissions by 63% by 2030,"" she stated, emphasizing the company's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint.

These internal targets, coupled with the industry-wide goal of ""improving the CO2 intensity of our aircraft delivered by 46% by 2035,"" underscore Airbus's holistic approach to sustainability.

When asked on the Airbus-AMIC collaboration, Kitcher explained, ""The signing ceremony that just took place with AMIC is basically to research the potential of feedstock in Malaysia, so the different types of feedstock, the different locations of feedstock and their suitability for conversion into sustainable aviation fuel under the sustainability criteria as defined by ICAO.""

This research-driven partnership is crucial for Malaysia, facilitating a deeper understanding of its feedstock resources and optimizing the SAF supply chain.

Adding to this context, speaking to DagangNews, Emeritus Professor Tan Sri Dr. Zakri Abdul Hamid, Chairman of AMIC, provided further insight into the long-standing relationship with Airbus and the strategic importance of the collaboration.

""Well, you must realise we had a very long history with Airbus, we have been in this country for 40 years,"" he stated, emphasizing the established partnership.

He highlighted the research focus, stating, ""This research is to explore the prospect of SAF in this part of the world,"" and underscored Malaysia's unique advantage, ""Because we are a highly biodiverse country.""

Dr. Zakri also emphasized the specific research team involved: ""One of the lead researchers is Distinguished Professor Dr. Phang Siew Moi from USCI University with Leong Sat Sing Vice President, Group Sustainability Office and also some others."" He acknowledged the economic realities of SAF production, stating,

""There's one conditionality still very expensive to produce, so maybe 2030 and beyond, but the roadmap is there, so this is where we are to go.”

He also highlighted the magnitude of the project, stating, ""This is a bigger one, bigger money at about three million ringgit and all that.""

This long-term perspective highlights the strategic nature of the collaboration, focusing on building a sustainable SAF industry for the future.

However, a critical analysis continues to expose a pressing supply-demand disparity. While Malaysia boasts significant SAF feedstock resources, the current availability of key components, such as used cooking oil, falls considerably short of projected demand.

This necessitates a strategic diversification of feedstock sources and a robust scaling of collection infrastructures.

Furthermore, the geographic distribution of these resources, predominantly concentrated in Sabah, Sarawak, and Johor, presents intricate logistical challenges that demand meticulous planning and substantial investment.

The success of Malaysia's SAF strategy is inextricably linked to its ability to overcome these logistical and technological hurdles through collaborative innovation.

This is precisely where the reinforced research and technology cooperation agreement between Airbus and AMIC becomes pivotal, now further clarified by both Kitcher's and Dr. Zakri's insights.

Earlier in her speech at the Outreach event, Kitcher said, ""Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors – from airlines, manufacturers and airports to regulators, governments and investors.""

This collaboration is vital for Malaysia, facilitating knowledge and technology transfer, and strengthening the nation's SAF production capacity.

Notably, the Airbus-AMIC partnership prioritizes feedstocks and pathways validated under the ICAO-CORSIA framework, ensuring alignment with internationally recognized sustainability standards.

A strategic analysis of the global SAF market reveals a complex landscape characterized by a current supply surplus, largely due to the high cost of SAF.

However, long-term projections indicate a surge in demand, necessitating immediate investment in new SAF projects.

To navigate this landscape, Malaysia must implement a proactive policy framework that incentivizes investment and fosters a level playing field.

""Innovation, technology is on track to achieve progress towards these goals,"" Kitcher asserts, underscoring the necessity of a supportive regulatory environment.

Malaysia's strategic positioning as the current chair of ASEAN presents a unique opportunity to drive regional sustainability initiatives.

This leadership role, coupled with its abundant natural resources, proactive policies, and strategic collaborations like the one with Airbus and AMIC, positions Malaysia to become a key player in the global SAF market.

By addressing the current challenges and fostering strategic partnerships, Malaysia can transform its ambitious SAF goals into a tangible economic and environmental reality, ensuring a sustainable future for its aviation sector and beyond.",http://www.dagangnews.com/sites/default/files/articles/Photo-%20Signing%20Ceremony.jpeg,N,,2025-04-11 02:56:26.065070
