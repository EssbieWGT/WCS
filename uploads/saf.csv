The European Union has taken a significant step toward decarbonising the aviation sector by implementing a mandatory blending requirement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Under the ‘RefuelEU Aviation’ initiative, the EU mandated that, as of last year, a minimum of 2% of the jet fuel made available at its airports must be SAF.

EU’s aggressive SAF mandate

This requirement is not static but is designed to ramp up aggressively over time, reflecting the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for technological adoption.

Specifically, the mandated share of SAF will more than triple to 6% by 2030, marking an important mid-term milestone.

The trajectory continues upward, with the requirement set to reach a substantial 20% by 2035.

This progressive increase is intended to drive investment in SAF production capacity, reduce the aviation industry’s reliance on fossil fuels, and ensure a sustainable pathway for European air travel, positioning the EU as a global leader in aviation sustainability policy.

Speaking at a World Economic Forum panel on clean fuels, Pouyanne predicted that the European SAF regulation would follow the same path as the car regulation.

Pouyanne Bets on Regulatory Backtrack

Pouyanne was quoted as saying in a Reuters report:

All the airline companies are fighting the 6% SAF mandate, which frankly is easy to reach…I will make a bet today that what happened to the car regulation will happen to the SAF regulation in Europe.

TotalEnergies has established production of SAF across a number of its refineries and has articulated plans for further capacity expansion in this area.

However, the company has recently put a pause on planned investments aimed at significantly increasing this SAF production capacity.

This decision stems from market feedback indicating a lack of strong demand from their client base for volumes exceeding those required to meet current and forthcoming regulatory obligations within the European Union.

Essentially, the immediate demand for SAF appears to be driven by compliance with EU mandates rather than a broad, voluntary shift toward lower-emission fuels by airlines and other customers.

Price and compliance against demand

This situation suggests a broader challenge within the nascent SAF market: the current price premium associated with SAF, which is typically higher than that of conventional jet fuel, is proving to be a deterrent to wider adoption in the absence of stringent regulatory requirements.

As a result, TotalEnergies is recalibrating its investment strategy to align with the more conservative demand outlook primarily dictated by the EU’s blending mandates and quotas, rather than aggressive market penetration based on anticipated voluntary commitments.

SAF costs three to four times more than traditional oil-refined jet fuel.

While airline companies cite inadequate production volumes for their slow adoption of SAF, Pouyanne has dismissed this explanation.

Pouyanne stated that he was facing customers, specifically his airline companies in Europe, who were making a huge lobby effort and accusing them of not investing enough, an accusation he claimed was completely wrong.

I will be able to provide 10% of SAF to the airline companies in Europe by 2030, but…everybody is dreaming they can have these biofuels at the same price as (jet fuel made from) oil, but it’s not true.

Due to uncertainty surrounding regulations, the CEO indicated that he would probably reduce investments in low-carbon fuels.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 14:57:49.338846

As trade policy and geopolitical dynamics continue to create economic uncertainty around the globe, a robust domestic biofuel market would provide much needed stability and market opportunities for U.S. soybean farmers.

Instead of continued imports of biofuel and biofuel feedstocks that leave our value chain vulnerable to supply chain manipulation, ASA is advocating for policy outcomes that strengthen domestic soy demand and support U.S. soybean farmers.

Biofuel is a broad term that includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the smaller markets of soy-derived naphtha, liquified petroleum gas and home heating oil.

The domestic biofuel industry can play a critical role in national security and economic stability – and biofuel is produced right here on U.S. soil. Roughly half of all U.S.-processed soybean oil is used in biomass-based diesel, making biofuel one of the most significant domestic markets for soybeans.

The Current State of Biofuel

Biofuel encompasses a wide range of fuels, feedstocks and policy frameworks, but ASA is currently focused on two specific policy issues – the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVOs). Clear guidance aligning with recently enacted amendments to the 45Z tax credit will help determine the economics of producing low-carbon fuels, while RVOs for 2026 and 2027 will establish the level of biofuel blending required under the RFS. Both directly affect soybean oil utilization, domestic crush expansion and market certainty for farmers. When U.S.-grown soybean oil is used in domestic biofuel production, it strengthens rural economies, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and lowers reliance on finite energy sources. How these policies are structured ultimately determines whether American clean fuel policy delivers its intended economic and environmental benefits to U.S. farmers and consumers alike.

45Z Tax Credit

In July 2025, the 45Z tax credit was amended through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) to enhance benefits to soy-based biofuel, but final guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury has yet to be completed. ASA is advocating for swift draft guidance from the Treasury Department to ensure timely implementation. The tax credit is important to soybean farmers because it incentivizes fuel producers to purchase soybean oil for biodiesel and renewable diesel.

To qualify for the 45Z tax credit, fuel producers must utilize feedstocks produced in North America. Finalization of 45Z is critical because it will boost domestic feedstock demand and support stronger soybean prices. The tax credit also protects domestically grown agricultural feedstocks and removes incentives for imported waste feedstocks, which have exponentially increased market share in U.S. biofuel production over the past five years.

“We led advocacy efforts and did so in coordination with other ag commodity groups and soybean processors as Congress was developing tax code changes in the OBBBA,” said Alexa Combelic, executive director of government affairs for ASA. “These advocacy efforts led to an incredible win for ASA in relation to the 45Z tax credits. We were able to remove the indirect land use change penalty on agricultural biofuel feedstocks, which effectively doubles the value of the tax credit for soy biofuel. In addition, we were able to address the surge of imported feedstocks entering our biofuel production value chain through new limitations on tax credit eligibility.”

Up until the week before the OBBBA was passed, Combelic said it wasn’t clear if the North American feedstock “ringfence” would be included in the final bill. Through significant grassroots stakeholder mobilization and advocacy leadership, ASA was able to ensure the tax credit would focus on biofuel feedstocks grown and produced in North America rather than overseas.

Additionally, through months of education on the impacts of agricultural indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, ASA was able to double the 45Z credit rate for soy-based biofuel. The ILUC penalty was an arbitrary tax on U.S. farmers, and its removal means the carbon intensity of soy is based on its direct impacts and not tied to a calculation model that penalizes U.S. grown crops for farming behavior in South America.

This win was not only the product of the hard work of ASA Government Affairs, but also of the efforts by farmers who helped ensure lawmakers were hearing directly from their constituents about the importance of the tax credit amendments to the soybean industry. The 45Z credit was first established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which restructured biofuel tax credits based on carbon intensity and initially disadvantaged agricultural feedstocks. Through mechanisms like ILUC, the IRA policy created an incentive for imported waste feedstocks like tallow, primarily from Brazil, and used cooking oil, primarily from China. Now, the 45Z tax credit as updated by the OBBBA disincentivizes those imports by prioritizing feedstocks available at home through a North American ringfence of eligibility and by removing arbitrary credit reductions for agricultural products.

The next step to ensure utilization of 45Z is for the Treasury Department to develop tax guidance that outlines how biofuel producers can utilize this tax credit after the statutory changes enacted through OBBBA. At this time, ASA is continuing to engage with the Treasury Department and administration to highlight the sense of urgency. While interim or draft guidance is expected this winter, final guidance will only be published after a public comment period and agency review.

“We anticipate full final guidance by spring or summer,” Combelic said.

RVOs

The RVO rule for compliance years 2026 and 2027 as proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will lead to an increase in blending volumes for biomass-based diesel – a policy that supports soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers. Released by EPA in June 2025, this was the strongest proposed RVO rule ever published. It was the direct result of continued advocacy with this administration.

“The previous Trump administration was not the biggest advocate for biofuel, so we were thrilled to see this change in tune,” Combelic said. It shows a clear focus on wanting to be a partner as we seek to increase domestic markets for soybean oil. Based on the two-year draft rule, if finalized, the biofuel value chain would absorb 10% of the average soybean sales to China in the first year and 20% of soybean sales to China in the second year.

The current RVOs, released under the Biden Administration EPA in 2023, underestimated industry capacity, weakening demand for soybean oil. The 2023-2025 RVOs did not reflect the expansion of the biofuel value chain – production and soybean crush. At that time, ASA was disappointed that blending volumes were not higher. The 2026 volumes versus the 2025 volumes shows an increase of over 2 billion gallons. This is a historic increase in volume requirements for biomass-based diesel. ASA applauded the proposal but continues to push for higher volume targets going forward in order to stabilize the market and secure long-term growth.

2025 marked the 20th anniversary of the RFS, and the EPA proposal in June marked a perfect reason for ASA to celebrate the program. The RFS program was enacted in 2005 through the passage of the Energy Policy Act and has been improved over the years, resulting in a new era that puts farmers first and strengthens the domestic biofuel industry. When President Trump began his term, he signed an Executive Order that created policy in support of American energy dominance. Domestic biofuel production fits right into that idea as from soil to final fuel production, it can be produced exclusively within the United States.

While soybean farmers have struggled to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly surging flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks, the proposed 2026-2027 RVO rule addresses concerns of fraudulent used cooking oil coming into the United States through a novel proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit values by 50% for imported biofuel and biofuel made from imported feedstocks. It encourages domestic biofuel production, strengthening domestic soybean markets and making domestic feedstocks more competitive. The 50% RIN credit reduction proposed by EPA is yet another opportunity to continue disincentivizing foreign feedstocks from being imported into the U.S.

A Bipartisan Issue

Because domestic biofuel creates a market for farmers and provides a boon for rural communities, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support biofuel policies which increase domestic production, making it a true bipartisan issue. Domestic biofuel production creates jobs, opens a market for soybean farmers and bolsters the use of a product planted, harvested, created and consumed all within the United States. Biofuel policy is a flexible issue that supports the values of both political parties – a win-win for all.

ASA saw additional success on Capitol Hill last year as there was a strong coalition of advocates who helped them see bipartisan caucus support using agriculture feedstocks. When the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit was first released, the North American ringfence was only included in the House of Representatives, with the Senate later striking the measure. However, through ASA’s targeted and continued engagement, an ad hoc coalition of biofuel producers, soybean processors and farmers from a variety of commodities advocated for the ringfence to be reinstated, and it was restored in an updated version of the text released by the Senate the week of passage, ensuring eligible feedstocks will be permanently limited to North American origin points for the life of the 45Z tax credit.

The Future of Biofuel

Looking to the future of biofuel, ASA is calling for the completion of EPA’s proposed 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations and issuing timely Treasury guidance for the revised 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit to reflect enacted changes that prioritize domestic agricultural feedstocks. On Nov. 12, 2025, ASA and the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) sent a letter to President Trump urging swift finalization of these key federal biofuel policies which are critical to strengthen domestic demand and support farmers who are facing continued market pressure.

As ASA continues to advocate for the good of the soy community, the Association is continuously engaging with USDA, EPA, Treasury, the U.S. Trade Representative and additional senior staff at the White House. Biofuel policy is an issue that spans beyond one agency. It takes a team effort to make a difference, and ASA is focused on coalition building, legislative education and advocacy at the highest level of government.",https://soygrowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CAM36806-lower-res-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 14:58:11.102174

The plant is to be built in the central department of Durazno, with deliveries expected to begin in 2028.

The agreement was signed with U.S.-based Syzygy Plasmonics, which specializes in low-emissions fuel technologies. The contract guarantees full commercialization of the fuel to be produced by NovaSAF-1, the company's first commercial-scale plant, and is considered key to reaching the project's financial goals.

The fuel is an alternative to conventional jet fuel, and it will significantly reduce aviation emissions without requiring changes to existing aircraft engines or infrastructure, those involved in the project said.

Sustainable aviation fuel can be used directly in today's aircraft when blended with conventional fossil jet fuel, making it one of the most immediately available options for decarbonizing aviation.

The plant is to be built in adjacent to the facilities of Estancias del Lago, one of Uruguay's largest dairy and agroenergy companies.

The process will use biogas generated from agricultural waste as its main feedstock, combined with renewable electricity supplied by Uruguay's power grid, which is largely based on renewable sources.

Syzygy will use its proprietary technology based on light-activated chemical reactors powered by renewable electricity.

The system already has received international precertification that allows production of renewable fuels of non-biological origin, a category considered essential to meeting the environmental regulations being adopted by aviation markets.

In its initial phase, the plant is expected to produce more than 350,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year.

According to the companies, using the fuel in aircraft as a replacement for pure fossil-based jet fuel can reduce lifecycle emissions by between 80% and 90%.

The company said the final product will be fully compatible with today's commercial aviation fleet.

For Trafigura, the agreement is part of its strategy to expand its low-emissions fuels portfolio. The Switzerland-based group operates globally in energy trading and controls industrial and distribution assets, including Puma Energy.

""By providing commercial certainty through offtake agreements, we enable emerging technologies to secure project financing and scale up production,"" Jason Breslaw, Trafigura's global head of low-carbon fuels business development, said in a statement.

According to industry outlet Surtidores Latam, liquid biofuels are becoming a central tool for both transport decarbonization and energy security.

Agustín Torroba, technical and executive secretary of the Pan American Coalition for Liquid Biofuels, said these fuels ""are a fundamental tool in the current context"" because of their environmental impact and strategic contribution.

The Case For Sustainable Aviation Fuel

In terms of aircraft decarbonization, sustainable aviation fuel seems like a second choice compared to electrification. Biofuels and other combustibles don’t eliminate tailpipe emissions, though they do help prevent new fossil fuels from circulating through the economy. Electrification would be the first choice, and that is already emerging in the areas of battery-electric and fuel cell-electric flight, including a new generation of electric VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) and wing-in-ground aircraft.

Still, so far the electrification movement has been confined to relatively small aircraft and shorter routes. Those short hops account for a significant amount of aircraft emissions, but the global fleet of full sized passenger planes and other upsized aircraft requires next-level propulsion systems that just aren’t ready yet.

That helps explain why investors have been pumping money into new alternative liquid fuels that can be used in existing aircraft, including fuel made from plastic waste and used cooking oil. Scaleup has proved slow, though, and in the meantime a different and potentially more effect approach to sustainable aviation fuel has emerged in the form of e-fuels, or electrofuels.

E-fuels leverage renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon to synthesize new liquid hydrocarbon fuels that can serve as drop-in replacements for their fossil-sourced counterparts. The industry has already begun to scale up in Texas, one example being the massive Project Roadrunner facility under the wing of the US firm Infinium.

The Syzygy Plasmonics Solution

Syzygy has come up with a different variation on the e-fuels theme. The startup has developed a photocatalytic system that deploys renewable energy to produce light for a biogas reactor, now trademarked under the name Rigel™.

“Syzygy Plasmonics uses its proprietary Rigel™ photoreactor to run chemical reactions with light instead of combustion—cutting emissions and energy use,” the company explains. The catalysts are interchangeable, enabling the reactor to produce hydrogen, syngas, and other fuels and chemicals at a scalable rate from 1 ton to more than 100 tons per day.

On the sustainable aviation fuel side, Syzygy deploys waste gas culled from landfills, dairies, or wastewater, without relying on the high heat needed for conventional steam methane reforming. The technology was developed at Rice University in Texas over the course of two decades of research by Professors Naomi Halas and Peter Nordlander.

The idea of deploying light to create or break chemical bonds was first introduced by Japanese researchers back in the 1970s. That seems simple enough, but little progress was made towards commercial applications over the next 40 years. That changed after 2016, when Nordlander and Halas published their a new “antenna” system based on plasmonic metallic nanoparticles (see lots more details here).

The Oil & Gas Connection: Follow The Money

The alternative fuel field is ripe with skills and resources transferred from the oil and gas industry, and that applies to Syzygy as well. Along with Nordlander and Halas, the company was co-founded by two professionals in the industrial oil services field, Trevor Best and Dr. Suman Khatiwada. They came across the antenna solution while searching for a new business opportunity.

Syzygy soon caught the attention of the US Department of Energy, which supported the path to commercialization through its ARPA-E funding office. The National Science Foundation also chipped in with a small business grant, and then it was off to the races. By 2022, Syzygy was already into a $76 million Series C funding round led by Carbon Direct Capital, with investors including Aramco Ventures, Chevron Technology Ventures, Equinor Ventures, EVOK Innovations, GOOSE Capital, Sumitomo Corporation, and Toyota Ventures, among others.

In 2023, Syzygy also formed a strategic partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America. “This investment will help Syzygy Plasmonics to accelerate commercialization and continue its development of innovative alternative technologies, particularly those that contribute to the hydrogen ecosystem and CO2 ecosystem,” Syzygy explained.

Syzygy finally came across the CleanTechnica radar in 2024, when the company applied its photocatalytic system to crack ammonia without running into the problem of NOX (nitrogen oxide) intermingling.

A Giant Step For The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Of The Future

Fast-forwarding to 2026, Syzygy is marketing a modular system under the trade name NovaSAF™. If all goes according to plan, the company’s first commercial-scale deployment will be the forthcoming NovaSAF-1 plant in Durazno, Uruguay.

“It will leverage biogas from the Estancias Del Lago powdered milk plant and Uruguayan renewable electricity to produce synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) SAF with 90% lower lifecycle emissions than fossil jet fuel while demonstrating attractive project economics,” Syzygy explained in a press statement on January 20, with SAF being short for Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

By attractive, they mean competitive with other alternative fuels. “At scale, Syzygy’s deployment model is anticipated to be cost-competitive – and even out-perform – other SAF pathways, which rely on supply-constrained feedstocks such as used cooking oil,” the company asserts.

In the same announcement Syzygy also noted that the leading global commodities firm Trafigura has agreed to a six-year, binding sustainable aviation fuel off-take agreement, indicating confidence in the company’s business model.

The Trafigura connection also indicates another fossil fuel crossover into the lower-carbon economy of the future. “We deploy infrastructure, market expertise and our worldwide logistics network to move oil and petroleum products, metals and minerals, gas and power from where they are produced to where they are needed,” the company says of itself, while noting that it is also investing in renewable energy ventures.

And, More Steps

In December, Syzygy completed the FEED (Front End Engineering Design) for NovaSAF-1. The next step is a fresh round of investment to begin construction, so it will take a while before the sustainable aviation fuel begins to flow from Uruguay. Nevertheless, Syzygy is already planning for global reach.

“With this commercial blueprint established, the company is positioned to replicate the project model globally and accelerate cost-competitive SAF production world-wide,” the company asserts.

That’s quite an ambition, considering the fossil-driven trajectory of domestic energy policy. However, it’s a big world out there, and the US is not the only market for sustainable fuels.

For that matter, an entire region of the US just doubled down on clean aviation. On January 8 the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator launched in Washington State, tasking itself to “rapidly accelerate production, deployment, and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across the Pacific Northwest.”

Amazon, eBay and Etsy are among the companies involved in the initiative, which will enable the San Francisco-based startup Nevoya to begin deploying new Tesla Semi trucks later this year or early next. The fleet of Class 8 vehicles — the largest truck classification — is expected to travel up to 7 million miles and avoid an estimated 60,000 metric tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions annually. All charging will be covered by renewable energy certificates.

Participating companies do not need to actually send shipments on the trucks to benefit from the emissions savings. Under the scheme, which is organized by the nonprofit Center for Green Market Activation (GMA), Nevoya will sell “environmental attribute certificates” (EACs) representing the emissions savings independently of contracts for freight. Buyers then deduct the emission savings represented by the certificates from their Scope 3 emissions, and retire the certificates to prevent further use.

Aviation playbook

Similar “book and claim” schemes are already being used to fund decarbonization of maritime shipping, cement, iron and other sectors. One well-established scheme — the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, a project co-managed by GMA, Environmental Defense Fund and RMI — has aggregated $550 million in demand for sustainable aviation fuel certificates since 2021. Amazon and Visa are among its members

Like these other areas, road freight is challenging to decarbonize in part because zero-emission options come with a premium. Battery electric trucks usually cost about twice as much as equivalent internal combustion vehicles, according to the GMA. The need to create charging infrastructure and purchase renewable electricity can further increase the price.

There are companies willing to pay these premiums for at least some shipments, but they often struggle to find zero-emissions options because less than 1 percent of new heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. are electric. The book-and-claim approach solves this problem by aggregating demand across interested companies, regardless of their ability to access electric trucks.

Scaling the project

GMA described the purchase of trucking EACs as a pilot and said it planned on further developing the project. One move that would accelerate progress would involve leading standard setters integrating EACs into their guidelines — something the Science Based Targets initiative is considering. “That will provide stakeholders with confidence in the accountability of these solutions,” said Andre de Fontaine, GMA managing director.

The center also plans on combining book-and-claim agreements with more traditional contracts that involve companies paying directly for zero-emissions shipping.

“Layering book and claim into these efforts can increase asset utilization — trucks and chargers — lowering overall costs for all buyers,” said de Fontaine. “As costs decrease, we expect more shippers to get involved, increasing demand and, in turn, driving greater production and deployment of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Shutterstock-Image-2518658419.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 10:58:55.435479

(Reporting by America Hernandez in Paris, Dmitry Zhdannikov in Davos, writing by Louise Rasmussen, Editing by Bernadette Baum) By America Hernandez","DAVOS/PARIS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said on Wednesday that he expected the European Union to water down its mandate to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel in future, similar to the bloc's recent decision to drop a proposed ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035.

Last year the EU mandated that 2% of jet fuel made available at its airports needed to be SAF, a requirement that will rise to 6% in 2030 and 20% in 2035.

""All the airline companies are fighting the 6% SAF mandate, which frankly is easy to reach...I will make a bet today that what happened to the car regulation will happen to the SAF regulation in Europe,"" Pouyanne said at a World Economic Forum panel on clean fuels.

TotalEnergies produces SAF at several refineries with plans to expand, but has delayed investments to increase capacity after finding that its clients were not willing to buy more than what was needed to satisfy EU rules, he said.

SAF is three to four times more expensive than jet fuel refined from oil.

Airline companies have blamed their lack of uptake on insufficient volumes being produced, which Pouyanne rejected.

""Today I am facing customers, my airline companies in Europe, who are making a huge lobby (effort) accusing us of not investing enough, which is completely wrong,"" Pouyanne said. ""I will be able to provide 10% of SAF to the airline companies in Europe by 2030, but...everybody is dreaming they can have these biofuels at the same price as (jet fuel made from) oil, but it's not true.""

The CEO added that he was likely to lower investments in low-carbon fuels due to regulatory uncertainty.

""I'm afraid, as it's a regulated market, if they move the targets, then I will have invested in biorefineries for nothing,"" he said.

Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics, said: “This agreement marks a critical step in our journey toward commercial-scale impact and disrupting the SAF market.","January 21, 2026 [Storage Terminals Magazine]- Trafigura Pte Ltd, a market leader in the global commodities industry, has signed a binding six-year offtake agreement with SP Developments Uruguay S.A., a subsidiary of Syzygy Plasmonics, to purchase advanced sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) from Syzygy’s first commercial facility, located in Uruguay. The agreement covers the entire production volume from Syzygy’s flagship biogas-to-SAF project, with first deliveries targeted in 2028. It also includes an option for Trafigura to purchase additional volumes from Syzygy’s future projects.

Innovative Light-Driven Technology

Syzygy’s technology converts biogas into SAF using renewable electricity through an innovative light-driven chemical reactor process. The pathway has received ISCC pre-certification to produce Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) and Advanced BioSAF compliant fuels, offering a scalable solution to meet expanding SAF mandates in Europe, the United Kingdom and other markets.

This agreement demonstrates Trafigura’s approach to advancing emerging low-carbon technologies through market-based solutions.

Jason Breslaw, Head of Low Carbon Fuels Business Development at Trafigura, commented: “By providing commercial certainty through long-term offtake commitments, Trafigura can enable innovative companies like Syzygy to secure project financing and scale production. This offtake agreement complements our strategy to support the industry’s efforts to diversify SAF supply, particularly as regulations increasingly mandate the use of advanced fuels. Trafigura’s global low-carbon fuels network positions us to help aviation customers meet these requirements efficiently and cost effectively.”

World’s First Electrified Biogas-to-SAF Facility

Syzygy’s first commercial-scale project, named NovaSAF-1, will be located in Durazno, Uruguay and will be the world’s first electrified biogas-to-SAF facility producing RFNBO-compliant SAF. It will leverage biogas from the Estancias Del Lago powdered milk plant and Uruguayan renewable electricity to produce synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) SAF with 90% lower lifecycle emissions than fossil jet fuel.

Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics, said: “This agreement marks a critical step in our journey toward commercial-scale impact and disrupting the SAF market. With a signed offtake agreement from a global leader like Trafigura, and after having successfully completed FEED engineering in December, we’re now ready to secure financing for the construction of NovaSAF-1 and move our technology from potential into production.”

Strengthening Low-Carbon Fuels Supply Chain

The agreement further strengthens Trafigura’s presence across the entire low-carbon fuels supply chain, from feedstock sourcing through subsidiaries such as Greenlife in Australia, to blending and distribution capabilities via Impala Terminals and Greenergy, and into-wing supply to aviation customers globally.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-21 11:00:02.340759

As a result of these risks, environmental claims and participation in standard-setting initiatives require robust competition compliance safeguards.

Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on Artificial Intelligence.","Energy access as a specific area of focus

In its Study, the FCA focused on the energy and environmental footprint of AI, highlighting access to electricity and land as potential barriers to entry on this market. The FCA points to:

grid congestion and length of grid connection delays (up to 5-7 years), especially in congested areas;

preferential energy supply agreements secured by large digital players;

excessive reservation of electricity or land capacity, potentially foreclosing access to these inputs for competitors; and

risks of discriminatory long-term supply contracts (the Power Purchase Agreements or PPA) by incumbent energy suppliers.

According to the FCA, these practices are liable to produce foreclosure effects and raise prices to the detriment of other market participants. This places data centre siting strategies, long-term PPAs and grid capacity reservations within the scope of potential competition scrutiny.

Environmental performance and standardisation

The FCA identifies ‘frugal AI’ (i.e. minimisation of the environmental impact and resource consumption of AI) as a new parameter of competition, capable of fostering innovation and entry. At the same time, it warns against:

unsubstantiated environmental claims relating to frugal AI (‘greenwashing’);

refusals to disclose environmental footprint data, in particular by dominant players or through parallel behaviour, which may hinder the emergence of frugality as a parameter of competition by preventing customers from assessing and comparing AI solutions on environmental performance; and

anti-competitive conduct within standardisation processes – the FCA supports the development of national, European and international standards to measure AI’s environmental footprint, noting potential pro-competitive benefits such as transparency and comparability.

As a result of these risks, environmental claims and participation in standard-setting initiatives require robust competition compliance safeguards.

AI: A growing priority for public authorities

Generative AI has rapidly emerged as a key policy priority worldwide, prompting public authorities to balance innovation, economic competitiveness and risk mitigation. In France, this has led to an early and sustained policy effort, starting with the national AI strategy launched in 2018 and followed, in March 2024, by 25 recommendations from the AI Commission launched by the French Prime Minister, notably aimed at strengthening computing capacity, improving access to data and contributing to global AI governance.

At the European and international levels, this momentum has translated into an increasingly dense regulatory landscape. The EU AI Act (1), which will largely be applicable from 2026, introduces new obligations for providers of large generative AI models, alongside broader digital regulations such as the Data Act (2). Other initiatives such as the UK Bletchley Declaration and international events, for example the February 2025 AI Action Summit in France, reflect the strategic importance which public authorities now attach to AI.

What it means for you

The FCA’s Opinion and Study underline that competition authorities are ready to intervene early to prevent lock-in effects and the reinforcement of barriers to entry in the AI sector, even in the absence of formal dominance findings. Access to key inputs – computing power, cloud infrastructure, data, energy and talent – is already under active scrutiny (you can view our November 2024 briefing on this related topic here).

As a result, competition law must be embedded in the structuring of AI-related deals, including partnerships, cloud agreements, minority investments and vertical integrations. It should also be factored into market entry and growth strategies, as enforcement is likely to combine ex ante digital regulation with traditional antitrust tools.

Sustainable aviation fuel certificates allow organisations to support the production and use of lower-carbon fuels, even where direct access to SAF is limited.
In addition to the SAF certificate purchase, AVEVA also took part in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance COP30 procurement initiative.
By completing its first SAF certificate purchase well ahead of schedule, AVEVA joins a small group of companies that have already begun to operationalise First Movers Coalition aviation commitments.","AVEVA has completed its first major purchase of sustainable aviation fuel certificates, moving five years ahead of schedule in meeting its commitment under the World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition.

The purchase marks a milestone for the industrial software company, which joined the First Movers Coalition Aviation group with a target to replace at least 5 per cent of its conventional jet fuel demand with sustainable aviation fuel. By securing the certificates now, AVEVA has effectively met that commitment well in advance of its original 2030 timeframe.

The certificates were purchased from British Airways for use at London Heathrow Airport. British Airways has a multi-year agreement with renewable fuels producer EcoCeres to supply sustainable aviation fuel, supporting its aim to power 10 per cent of flights with SAF by 2030 and reduce lifecycle emissions from aviation.

EcoCeres produces sustainable aviation fuel, hydrotreated vegetable oil and renewable naphtha at industrial scale. The company is also an AVEVA customer, using AVEVA software to optimise SAF production, creating a link between AVEVA’s digital solutions and its climate commitments.

AVEVA said the purchase demonstrates how market-based mechanisms can be used to accelerate decarbonisation in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Sustainable aviation fuel certificates allow organisations to support the production and use of lower-carbon fuels, even where direct access to SAF is limited.

The move builds on AVEVA’s wider sustainability strategy. The company reports it has already reduced its Scope 1 and Scope 2 operational emissions by more than 93 per cent and is on track to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 50 per cent by 2030.

In addition to the SAF certificate purchase, AVEVA also took part in the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance COP30 procurement initiative. Through this programme, the company reduced the climate impact associated with flights linked to COP30, further supporting demand for lower-carbon aviation fuels.

Caspar Herzberg, Chief Executive Officer of AVEVA, said the purchase underlined the need for action alongside ambition.

“The role of tech and industry in driving decarbonisation has never been clearer,” he said. “By investing in sustainable fuels today, we are demonstrating how climate ambition must be matched by concrete action. Through concerted action like this, industries can scale new technologies, minimise lifecycle emissions, and set a higher standard for responsible growth.”

The First Movers Coalition was launched by the World Economic Forum to bring together companies committed to creating early demand for low-carbon technologies in sectors that are critical to achieving net zero. Aviation is one of several focus areas, alongside shipping, steel, cement and chemicals.

Noam Boussidan, Programme Head for the First Movers Coalition at the World Economic Forum, said AVEVA’s early action showed the role companies can play in supporting cleaner aviation.

“It is great to see First Movers Coalition members in action today,” he said. “By purchasing SAF as part of its sustainability roadmap, AVEVA continues to show leadership and make meaningful progress toward the fulfillment of its FMC aviation target. Partnerships like these demonstrate how First Movers Coalition members are supporting the development and use of cleaner aviation technology while driving corporate climate action.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as one of the most viable near-term options for reducing emissions from flying, as it can be used in existing aircraft with minimal modification and offers lower lifecycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. However, supply remains limited and costs are higher, making early corporate demand a key driver for scaling production.

AVEVA said its approach combines internal emissions reductions with targeted investments that help accelerate change across value chains. The company positions its digital solutions as an enabler for industries seeking to measure, manage and reduce emissions, particularly in energy-intensive and complex systems.

By completing its first SAF certificate purchase well ahead of schedule, AVEVA joins a small group of companies that have already begun to operationalise First Movers Coalition aviation commitments. The company said it intends to continue working through partnerships and procurement initiatives to support the broader transition to lower-carbon aviation and industrial systems.",https://sustainablebusinessmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Aveva.png,N,,2026-01-21 11:00:18.997094

Led by Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU-backed ToFuel project is developing a biorefinery model that converts leftover tomato plant material into cleaner fuel for aviation. The aim is to create a process that produces no waste, reduces emissions, and remains cost-effective, supporting efforts to cut the aviation sector’s reliance on fossil fuels.

Tomatoes are the world’s second most consumed vegetable after potatoes. The European Union is the third-largest producer, harvesting about 17 million tonnes each year. However, tomato farming and processing generate large volumes of waste, including leaves, stems, flowers, peels, seeds and tomatoes that fail to meet quality standards.

At present, much of this material is burned or discarded at significant cost. At the same time, Europe’s target of climate neutrality depends heavily on the availability of clean and affordable aviation fuels made from renewable sources.

To turn tomato waste into usable fuel, the biomass must first be treated so that microorganisms can process it efficiently. The ToFuel project is examining two advanced processing methods.

In the first method, known as extrusion, the biomass is exposed to heat and pressure and then rapidly released, breaking it down into smaller components. This prepares the material for fermentation, during which microorganisms produce oils that can later be converted into aviation fuel.

The second method involves using high pressure and high temperatures to transform the biomass into bio-oil and biochar. Before the bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be cleaned to remove unwanted substances that could affect fuel quality.

These processing and cleaning techniques are being developed jointly by Graz University of Technology, the National Laboratory of Energy and Geology (LNEG) in Lisbon, and the University of Zagreb, working together to advance the project.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-1.png,N,,2026-01-21 07:56:57.072294

The objective of the review is to draw lessons from how Schiphol and KLM responded to the disruption and to identify where improvements can be made in the future. “The aim of the evaluation is to determine where improvements are possible in order to strengthen both the operation and the passenger experience,” said Schiphol President & CEO Pieter van Oord and KLM CEO Marjan Rintel in a joint statement.

During the first week of January, Schiphol was hit by what the airport described as “extreme winter weather”, which had a major impact on operations. Prolonged snowfall, freezing rain, low temperatures and strong winds led to thousands of flight cancellations and delays. As a result, large numbers of passengers were stranded, with some forced to spend the night at the airport.

As the largest airline operating at Schiphol, KLM was particularly affected with thousands of cancellations. Additionally, KLM is also a key operational partner of Schiphol in several areas, including aircraft de-icing.

The scale of the disruption drew criticism towards both Schiphol and KLM, especially as the airport appeared to be more severely affected than other European airports facing similar weather conditions. Passengers complained about insufficient communication and support. KLM meanwhile came under additional scrutiny after media reports revealed that the airline had to take emergency measures to avoid a shortage of de-icing fluid.

With the evaluation – initiated in part following political pressure – Schiphol and KLM aim to gain a clear understanding of what may have gone wrong and where opportunities for improvement exist.

“Schiphol and KLM have chosen to conduct the evaluation jointly, given the strong interdependencies between their processes and the importance of an integrated approach,” Van Oord and Rintel said. “The review will assess how these processes performed under winter weather conditions and identify any areas requiring improvement or further attention.”

Oliver Wyman

Schiphol and KLM have engaged Oliver Wyman to carry out the evaluation. The findings and recommendations are expected to be delivered by the end of March. “Oliver Wyman is a leading global aviation consultancy with extensive and relevant experience in the sector,” Van Oord and Rintel stated.

The choice of Oliver Wyman was also influenced by its prior experience with similar reviews, including an evaluation following the severe weather disruptions at Southwest Airlines and Denver International Airport in late 2022. That incident resulted in the cancellation of approximately 17,000 flights and left more than two million passengers stranded.

Scope of the review

The scope of the evaluation includes an analysis of runway availability and utilisation, aircraft de-icing capacity, cooperation between air traffic control, airlines and ground handling companies, passenger communication, and airport safety during the disruption period.

Oliver Wyman will also assess the costs and benefits of any potential additional measures.

Under the leadership of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU project ToFuel is developing a new biorefinery concept that will convert tomato residues into sustainable aviation fuel.

The research team is aiming for a waste-free and climate-neutral process that is also economically competitive and thus makes an important contribution to the defossilisation of air transport.

Tomatoes are the second most consumed vegetable in the world after potatoes.

The EU is the third largest producer with around 17 megatonnes of tomatoes harvested.

However, tomato production produces large quantities of residual biomass – plant material such as flowers, leaves and stems, peel, seeds and tomatoes of inadequate quality.

Most of these residues are incinerated as agricultural waste or disposed of at high cost.

At the same time, the goal of European climate neutrality and the associated reduction of CO₂ emissions in the aviation sector is largely dependent on the production of competitive and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from renewable raw materials.

In order to turn tomato waste into a high-quality fuel, the biomass must first be processed so that microorganisms can utilise it efficiently.

ToFuel is investigating two modern fractionation technologies. During extrusion, the biomass is treated under heat and pressure and then broken down into its cellular components by an abrupt drop in pressure.

This creates an optimally digested biomass for the subsequent fermentation process, in which microorganisms produce lipids that are later processed into aviation fuel.

In the second fractionation technology, hydrothermal liquefaction, the biomass is converted into bio-oil and biochar under high pressure and at high temperatures. Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions.

These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel. The corresponding fractionation, biotechnological and purification processes are being developed by the Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG) in Lisbon, TU Graz and the University of Zagreb in close cooperation.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-research-looks-pic-Biofuel-21-1-141926711-768x512.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 03:57:18.517871

Through its data-driven solutions and collaborative ecosystem, AVEVA demonstrates how a comprehensive digital transformation strategy, underpinned by strong climate commitments, can empower industries to drive measurable action in addressing the climate crisis.

AVEVA's Sustainability Commitments

Focused on furthering its sustainability commitment through action, AVEVA has already reduced its Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions by over 93% and is on track to cut Scope 3 emissions by 50% by 2030. As a member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) First Movers Coalition (FMC) Aviation group, AVEVA set a target to replace at least 5% of conventional jet fuel demand with SAF.

AVEVA purchased SAF certificates from British Airways for use at London Heathrow Airport; an important step that brings AVEVA in line with fulfilling its FMC commitment five years ahead of schedule. BA entered into a multi?year agreement with EcoCeres for the supply of SAF, supporting the airline’s ambition to power 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 and to significantly cut lifecycle emissions. EcoCeres is a leading pure play renewable fuels producer producing industrial-scale SAF, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), and renewable naphtha.

According to a recent study by Global Market Insights Inc., the global North America oil based biofuel market was estimated at USD 20.5 billion in 2025. The market is expected to grow from USD 22.5 billion in 2026 to USD 49.4 billion in 2035, at a CAGR of 9.1%.

Stable, multi-year federal volume standards under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) sustain demand for oil based biofuels. Consistent standards assists planning for feedstock procurement (e.g., waste oils and animal fats), optimize refinery co-processing decisions, and justify investments in pretreatment capacity.

The nested nature of the standards enables renewable diesel and biodiesel to backfill broader advanced fuel targets, supporting utilization. While the rule is technology neutral, it has been accompanied by ongoing compliance and implementation updates, signaling program continuity and oversight.

For instance, EPA’s final RFS rule sets volumes for 2023 - 2025, including biomass based diesel (3.04 in 2024; 3.35 in 2025), and affirms program stability via notices and annual standards tables updated through late 2025. This in turn is augmenting the industry landscape across the region.

California, the LCFS remains a primary driver for deploying pretreatment, feedstock diversification, and SAF upgrade units, while encouraging long term supply contracts tied to CI performance. In addition, LCFS continues to increase down carbon intensity (CI) targets, directly improving the credit economics for low CI fuels like hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) renewable diesel and SAF derived from waste fats and used cooking oil.

The 2024 board action to update LCFS, followed by the 2025 resubmittal and approval process, signals the state’s commitment to deeper CI cuts and expanded credit generation opportunities (including end use and infrastructure provisions). These technical revisions, with final rulemaking milestones posted and program pages reflect tightened targets and implementation update.

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) deepen regional demand for low carbon diesel and co-processing. CFR requires primary suppliers to reduce the life cycle CI of gasoline and diesel, creating tradable credits across three compliance categories, including the supply of low-carbon-intensity fuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel.

With reporting commencing and credit market data released, oil-based biofuels have a clearer compliance role in meeting reduction trajectories. Ongoing targeted amendments announced in 2025 aim to strengthen resiliency and support sector development without diluting the program’s emissions focus.

For instance, in June 2024, Environment and Climate Change Canada published Credit Market Report and, in late 2025, issued a discussion paper outlining targeted CFR amendments to bolster Canada’s low-carbon fuel sector. In addition, for cross border producers, CFR credits and provincial programs expand the addressable market for renewable diesel and SAF blends across Western and Eastern Canada.

Furthermore, the U.S. clean fuel production tax credit under Section 45Z represents a meaningful shift in how oil-based biofuels are valued at the federal level. Unlike earlier volume-based incentives, the credit is tied directly to lifecycle emissions performance, encouraging producers to minimize carbon intensity through feedstock choice, energy integration, and process efficiency.

North America Oil Based Biofuel Market Trends

The regional government’s coordinated push to scale sustainable aviation fuel has created new momentum for oil-based biofuel producers with SAF compatible assets. Federal agencies have aligned policy, tracking mechanisms, and funding frameworks to accelerate commercialization while leveraging existing refinery infrastructure.

Oil-based processes offer an advantage due to their readiness for hydro processed esters and fatty acids pathways, which integrate effectively with refinery systems. Public reporting of milestones and capacity development has improved visibility across the aviation value chain, supporting airline offtake engagement and long-term supply planning.

For instance, in May 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Bioenergy Technologies Office took steps to ease constraints on domestic bioenergy development by revising the 45ZCF GREET modeling tool to include new feedstocks and production routes, notably corn wet-milling ethanol and coal-mine methane derived natural gas.

Investments in storage tanks, blending equipment, and dispensing systems increase the availability of biodiesel blends and renewable diesel across retail and fleet locations. Federal grant programs have reduced financial barriers for operators, particularly in rural and multi-state fueling networks.

As infrastructure bottlenecks ease, biofuels can achieve higher throughput and stronger price competitiveness relative to fossil diesel. These developments directly improve demand visibility for producers by strengthening downstream readiness rather than relying solely on mandates.

For instance, in May 2025, the U.S. government updated higher blends infrastructure incentive program to increase significantly the sales and use of higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel by expanding the infrastructure for renewable fuels derived from U.S. agricultural products.

The program is also intended to encourage a more comprehensive approach to market higher blends by sharing the costs related to building out biofuel-related infrastructure. In addition, the region has entered a phase where full scale refinery conversions to renewable diesel are demonstrating operational reliability rather than pilot level feasibility.

Converted sites benefit from existing logistics, hydrogen systems, and marine access, enabling high utilization rates and regional supply security. These facilities reinforce the competitiveness of oil based pathways by achieving industrial scale while maintaining compliance with stringent carbon-intensity programs.

For illustration, in May 2025, Phillips 66 in collaboration with NextEra Energy Resources, commenced commercial operations of the on-site solar facility at the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex. The facility supports the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel using waste oils, fats, greases, and vegetable oil feedstocks.

Biofuel producers are investing in pretreatment units, aggregation hubs, and joint ventures that secure access to diverse lipid sources. This integration improves yield consistency, protects catalysts, and lowers operating disruptions. A more resilient feedstock system enhances the competitiveness of oil-based biofuels compared to alternative renewable pathways that rely on less mature supply chains.

Based on fuel, the market is segmented into biodiesel, HVO, SAF, and others. The biodiesel segment dominated by 54.2% of the market share in 2025 and is set to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% by 2035. State blending mandates and quality standardization sustain all round demand in core markets of the U.S. in recent times.

In addition, industry quality programs and ASTM updates have improved compatibility with modern engines and after-treatment systems, reducing operator concerns over metals content, cold-flow, and injector deposits. This combination of policy enforcement and technical assurance translates into durable local demand that supports rail, truck, and agricultural logistics, and keeps biodiesel competitive against both fossil diesel and paraffinic renewable diesel.

For instance, Minnesota statute and agency guidance continue to enforce the biodiesel content mandate, B20 from April 15 to September 30 and B5 in winter, backed by annual reporting and weights & measures compliance notices. This demand planning for distributors and terminals, ensures throughput for soybean derived methyl esters and other fat and grease-based inputs.

HVO market will grow at a CAGR of 11% by 2035. The region’s renewable diesel landscape is defined by large refinery conversions that have reached sustained, full rate operations. By leveraging existing hydrotreaters, hydrogen systems, and marine/rail access, these complexes process waste oils, animal fats, and vegetable oils into dropping paraffinic diesel with very low carbon intensity.

For instance, Oregon DEQ updated its Clean Fuels Program in 2024–2025, adopting OR GREET 4.0, adding CCS crediting mechanisms, and enhancing verification. For HVO suppliers, better CI performance enhances credit generation and strengthens economics under CI based systems, while structured verification builds market trust.

SAF market will grow a rate of 13% by 2035, propelled by coordinated U.S. federal actions including targeted grants for production and infrastructure, interagency roadmaps, and progress dashboards that quantify capacity and uptake.

This “whole of government” approach reduces uncertainty for airlines and producers, aligns R&D with certification pathways, and highlights the viability of HEFA/HVO based SAF derived from waste lipids. As airports and carriers pursue decarbonization targets, visibility into funding timelines and metrics helps underpin offtake MOUs and project finance.

For instance, in August 2024, The FAA’s Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) program awarded over USD 291 million for SAF production, logistics, and low-emission aviation technologies. In addition, DOE/USDA/FAA published the SAF Grand Challenge progress report and implementation framework.

The addition of SAF upgrade trains that convert paraffinic diesel intermediates into jet range products meeting ASTM D7566 annexes will augment the industry growth. This flexibility allows plants to “swing” output between road diesel and SAF based on policy signals and airline demand.

For instance, Valero’s Diamond Green Diesel project at Port Arthur achieved large scale SAF capability in Q4 2024, allowing up to 50% of renewable diesel output to be upgraded to neat SAF, reinforcing multi-product flexibility for U.S. supply.

Based on application, the industry is segmented into transportation, aviation, & others. The transportation application industry held a market share of 74% in 2025 and will grow at a CAGR of 10% by 2035. Transportation continues to represent the largest application segment for oil based biofuels in North America, driven primarily by heavy duty trucking, municipal fleets, construction equipment, and regional freight operations.

Fleets are increasingly adopting higher blends or neat renewable diesel to meet corporate emissions commitments while preserving vehicle uptime and refueling flexibility, reinforcing transportation’s central role in market demand. In addition, as electrification remains limited for long haul and off road applications, oil based biofuels serve as an immediately deployable decarbonization pathway.

Oil based biofuels are increasingly penetrating marine vessels, locomotives, cargo handling equipment, and port adjacent drayage operations. For instance, the Port of Seattle’s 2024 environment and sustainability report highlighted expanded use of low carbon fuels in maritime and cargo-handling operations as part of its decarbonization roadmap.

Aviation application industry will grow at a CAGR of 15% by 2035 and is the fastest growing application for oil-based biofuels, specifically through sustainable aviation fuel derived from waste oils and fats. Airports have emerged as focal points for SAF deployment, acting as aggregators of demand across multiple airlines.

For instance, the Port of Seattle its goal to supply at least a 10% SAF blend for all flights at SEA Airport by 2028, with ongoing regional planning and infrastructure development documented in its 2024 sustainability reporting.

Furthermore, the expansion of SAF usage in North America is increasingly enabled by coordinated federal funding and certification initiatives addressing production, blending, storage, and transport constraints. Programs administered by the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Energy focus on bridging the cost and infrastructure gap between conventional jet fuel and SAF.

Federal grants also reduce risk for airports and fuel distributors by supporting site-specific feasibility studies and logistics upgrades. As federal oversight improves traceability and lifecycle accounting, airlines gain greater confidence in SAF supply integrity. This regulatory and financial backing is translating into practical deployment rather than pilot-scale trials.

For reference, in October 2025, the Government of Canada announced the introduction of USD 370 million in time-limited, per-liter incentives for domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, effective from January 2026, with the objective of accelerating Canadian biofuel production capacity.

The U.S. dominated the North America oil based biofuel market with around 93% share in 2025 and generated USD 19.1 billion in revenue. The country’s growth is supported by a combination of federal policy stability and large-scale industrial deployment.

The introduction of performance based federal tax credits has shifted focus toward low carbon, waste based feedstocks and refinery efficiency improvements. The U.S. market is further distinguished by extensive refinery conversions that leverage existing petroleum infrastructure to produce renewable diesel and SAF at world scale.

For instance, In July 2025, the U.S. DOE selected 27 innovators and entrepreneurs for the latest cohorts of its Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP). The selected participants will be embedded across four U.S. national laboratories, collaborating with extensive networks of scientific, technical, and commercial mentors to advance transformational energy technologies, including innovations that support and complement the oil-based biofuel value chain.

Canada oil based biofuel market will grow at a CAGR of 9.3% by 2035. The Clean Fuel Regulations establish mandatory lifecycle carbon-intensity reductions for gasoline and diesel sold in Canada, creating sustained demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel.

Various incentives are designed to improve the cost competitiveness of Canadian biofuel producers relative to U.S. facilities that benefit from federal tax credits and state-level programs. In addition, the country is encouraging capacity utilization, new plant investment, and feedstock aggregation within its borders to promote the product adoption.

For instance, in January 2026, the Government of Canada, in collaboration with the Advanced Biofuels Canada Association, launched the Biofuels Production Incentive, a measure designed to provide immediate support to safeguard domestic biofuel production capacity and reinforce Canada’s energy security.

Mexico oil based biofuel market will grow at a CAGR of 4.5% by 2035. The country represents an emerging market for oil based biofuels, characterized by a cautious and state-led approach.

The europe syngas market size was valued at USD 20308.05 million in 2025 and is anticipated to reach USD 22671.85 million in 2026 from USD 54688.81 million by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 11.64% during the forecast period from 2026 to 2034.

Syngas or synthesis gas is a combustible mixture primarily composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide generated through gasification or reforming of carbon containing feedstocks such as coal natural gas or biomass. In Europe, this gas serves as a critical intermediary in the production of ammonia methanol synthetic fuels and hydrogen while also supporting industrial heat and power generation. The market landscape has evolved considerably as European nations prioritize decarbonization and circular economy principles. As per Eurostat, industrial sectors accounted for 24.6% of the European Union’s final energy consumption in 2023, which is indicating the persistent need for efficient and cleaner gaseous fuels. According to the International Energy Agency, hydrogen consumption across European industries remained substantial in 2023, with a significant portion originating indirectly from syngas routes. The European Green Deal and REPowerEU plan have further intensified scrutiny on feedstock sustainability and carbon intensity, which is driving a strategic pivot toward biomass-derived and waste-based syngas systems. The integration of carbon capture technologies and renewable-driven gasification units is gaining traction, particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as these countries advance pilot and commercial-scale low-carbon syngas initiatives aligned with the EU’s 2030 climate targets.

MARKET DRIVERS

Policy Driven Industrial Decarbonization Accelerates Syngas Adoption

Europe’s aggressive climate regulatory framework is compelling heavy industries to seek transitional energy vectors and syngas has emerged as a viable bridge solution, which is a key factor driving the growth of the European syngas market. The European Union’s Industrial Emissions Directive and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism have pressured sectors such as steel, chemicals, and refining to reduce scope one and scope two emissions significantly. Syngas derived from low carbon feedstocks enables these industries to lower their carbon footprint while maintaining operational continuity. According to the European Environment Agency, emissions from industrial combustion processes totaled approximately 473 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2022, which is indicating the urgency for alternatives. As per the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, Germany has allocated up to 1.2 billion euros through its H2Global initiative to support hydrogen and derivative fuel projects, including syngas-based systems. Furthermore, the EU’s Innovation Fund disbursed billions of euros in 2023 to projects integrating renewable energy with carbon management, with several syngas conversion units qualifying for support. These policy instruments not only incentivize investment but also establish stringent lifecycle emission thresholds which favor gasification technologies with integrated carbon capture over conventional fossil routes, thereby reshaping demand toward cleaner syngas configurations.

Expansion of Waste to Energy Infrastructure Fuels Syngas Feedstock Diversification

The growing municipal solid waste burden of Europe has catalysed the development of advanced thermal conversion facilities that utilize non-recyclable waste as syngas feedstock, which is further propelling the growth of the European syngas market. According to Eurostat, 511 kg of municipal waste per capita was generated in the EU in 2023, amounting to over 225 million tonnes in total, and landfilling rates still exceed 11% in several member states. Countries such as France, Italy, and Poland are commissioning gasification plants that convert refuse-derived fuel into syngas for combined heat and power or chemical synthesis. As per the Confederation of European Waste to Energy Plants, more than 530 waste-to-energy facilities operated in Europe in 2024, with gasification and pyrolysis units representing a growing share of new installations. The European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan explicitly endorses thermochemical conversion as a recovery option for non-recyclable fractions, thereby legitimizing syngas generation from residual streams. According to Avfall Sverige, Sweden recovers nearly 99% of household waste, with a significant portion processed through thermal methods. This waste valorisation trend not only alleviates disposal pressures but also provides a locally sourced feedstock that circumvents natural gas price volatility and enhances supply chain resilience for syngas producers.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

High Capital Intensity of Advanced Gasification Technologies Inhibits Widespread Deployment

The transition from conventional steam methane reforming to low carbon syngas production methods such as biomass gasification or waste-derived plasma gasification demands substantial upfront investment, which constrains market scalability. Installing an integrated biomass-to-syngas facility with carbon capture capabilities typically requires capital expenditures ranging from €400 to €600 million, according to estimates published in peer-reviewed techno-economic assessments. Such costs are prohibitive for mid-scale industrial players, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe where access to green financing remains limited. Even with EU funding mechanisms like the Innovation Fund, project developers face prolonged approval cycles and stringent technical validation requirements. As per the European Investment Bank, only 23% of submitted clean energy infrastructure proposals in 2023 secured full financing due to perceived technology and offtake risks. Moreover, the absence of standardized modular gasification units increases engineering complexity and site-specific customization, further inflating costs. This financial barrier delays the replication of successful pilot projects such as the GoBiGas initiative in Sweden, which despite technical success, struggled with economic viability. Consequently, many industrial consumers continue relying on imported hydrogen or conventional natural gas reforming despite higher long-term carbon compliance costs simply because capital constraints outweigh decarbonization incentives.

Feedstock Supply Chain Fragmentation Undermines Operational Consistency

The viability of non-fossil syngas routes in Europe is heavily contingent on reliable and standardized feedstock streams, yet the current supply landscape remains highly fragmented across regions, which is further impeding the growth of the European syngas market. For instance, Biomass residues exhibit significant seasonal and geographic variability in availability and composition. According to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the technical potential of available lignocellulosic residues across the EU is estimated at 220 million tonnes per year, but only 55% is considered economically recoverable due to collection logistics and competing uses. Similarly, the quality of municipal solid waste-derived feedstock fluctuates widely between urban centers and rural zones, affecting gasifier efficiency and syngas composition. As per a 2024 study by the Technical Research Centre of Finland, moisture content and calorific value of refuse-derived fuel can vary by up to 40% between neighbouring waste processing plants, which is undermining stable syngas output. Without harmonized feedstock specifications and coordinated regional collection networks, operators face frequent process interruptions and catalyst degradation. The European Committee for Standardization has initiated work on EN standards for alternative feedstocks, but implementation remains inconsistent. This uncertainty discourages long-term offtake agreements and deters investors seeking predictable plant performance, thereby constraining the market’s ability to scale beyond isolated demonstration sites.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Integration with Green Hydrogen Ecosystems Opens New Value Streams

Syngas infrastructure is increasingly positioned as a complementary enabler within Europe’s expanding green hydrogen economy, particularly through co-processing and retrofit pathways, which is a notable opportunity in the European syngas market. Existing syngas units, especially those based on autothermal reforming, can be adapted to co-feed biogas or green hydrogen, thereby reducing net carbon intensity without complete rebuilds. According to the Hydrogen Council, a significant share of announced low carbon hydrogen projects in Europe as of 2024 incorporate hybrid feedstock strategies where syngas platforms serve as transitional assets. In the Netherlands, the VoltaChem program has demonstrated that blending green hydrogen into conventional syngas streams enhances hydrogen yield while maintaining ammonia synthesis compatibility, as verified by TNO, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Researchvoltachem.com. Furthermore, surplus renewable electricity can be utilized in power-to-syngas configurations where electrolytic hydrogen reacts with captured carbon dioxide to produce tailored syngas mixtures. The European Commission’s IPCEI Hy2Tech framework has approved cross-border projects in Belgium and Germany that integrate such pathways with carbon utilization. This synergy not only extends the operational relevance of existing industrial gas infrastructure but also creates dual revenue models through hydrogen and chemical co-production by aligning syngas assets with the EU’s 2030 renewable hydrogen targets.

Emergence of Synthetic Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandates Creates Premium Demand

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates that 2% of aviation fuel must be synthetic and low carbon by 2030 and is catalyzing demand for Fischer-Tropsch-derived fuels produced from syngas, which is another major opportunity in the European syngas market. Unlike bioethanol or hydrotreated esters, synthetic paraffinic kerosene from syngas offers superior energy density and full drop-in compatibility with existing jet engines. According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the EU’s commercial aviation sector consumed approximately 46 million tonnes of jet fuel in 2023. Companies such as Sasol and Fulcrum BioEnergy are advancing waste-to-syngas-to-jet fuel projects in France and Spain, leveraging municipal solid waste as feedstock. As per the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, meeting the 2030 target will require at least 2.8 million tonnes of synthetic fuel annually. Additionally, the EU Emissions Trading System’s inclusion of aviation since 2024 increases the carbon cost of conventional jet fuel, thereby improving the economic case for syngas-based alternatives. With airlines such as Lufthansa and Air France having already signed offtake agreements for synthetic kerosene, this regulatory-driven demand shift is transforming syngas from an industrial intermediate into a strategic mobility fuel component.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Intermittency of Renewable Energy Sources Complicates Power to Syngas Economics

Although power-to-syngas systems offer a promising route to carbon-neutral fuel production, their operational efficiency is heavily undermined by the intermittent nature of Europe’s wind and solar generation. Syngas synthesis via co-electrolysis or reverse water-gas shift requires stable thermal and electrical inputs, yet grid availability fluctuates significantly across regions and seasons. According to ENTSO-E, renewable generation curtailment in the EU reached 14.8 terawatt-hours in 2023, primarily due to grid congestion and inflexible demand profiles. While this surplus could theoretically power syngas units, actual plant utilization rates remain low, with some studies reporting figures below 35%. Low-capacity factors inflate the levelized cost of syngas, making it economically uncompetitive against fossil-based alternatives even with carbon pricing. Additionally, frequent start-stop cycles degrade high-temperature electrolyzer stacks and catalyst beds, which is increasing maintenance costs and downtime. Without dedicated renewable microgrids or long-duration storage integration, syngas facilities cannot achieve the steady-state operation required for chemical synthesis. This intermittency challenge is particularly acute in Northern Europe, where wind resources are abundant but grid reinforcement lags behind deployment targets, thereby constraining the scalability of renewable-driven syngas despite its environmental merits.

Lack of Harmonized Carbon Accounting Methodologies Creates Market Uncertainty

The absence of a universally accepted methodology for quantifying the carbon intensity of syngas across its lifecycle impedes market access and investor confidence in Europe, which is further challenging the expansion of the European syngas market. Current frameworks such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive II and the upcoming CBAM apply divergent calculation rules for biogenic carbon, waste-derived feedstocks, and co-product allocation. According to a 2024 analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, carbon intensity values for identical syngas pathways can vary significantly depending on the accounting model applied. This discrepancy complicates compliance with fuel standards like ReFuelEU and discourages cross-border trade in syngas-based products. Moreover, the European Commission’s Product Environmental Footprint initiative has yet to finalize category rules for synthetic gases, which is leaving project developers without clear guidance. In Germany, for example, two syngas plants using similar municipal waste feedstocks received different sustainability classifications from regional auditors, leading to unequal access to subsidies as reported by the German Biomass Research Centre. Such regulatory fragmentation increases administrative burden and creates an uneven playing field, particularly for small and medium enterprises lacking dedicated compliance teams. Until the EU establishes a unified and transparent carbon accounting protocol for gaseous energy carriers, syngas producers will face persistent uncertainty in market positioning and eligibility for green financing.

In early 2024 Siemens Energy launched a demonstration plant in Sweden that co processes biomass derived syngas with electrolytic hydrogen to produce renewable methanol. It also collaborates with waste management firms to develop modular gasification units for municipal solid waste. These innovations position Siemens Energy as a key architect of next generation syngas systems aligned with EU net zero objectives and global clean fuel transitions.

Top Strategies Used by the Key Market Participants

Key players in the Europe syngas market prioritize strategic integration of carbon capture technologies to comply with stringent EU emissions regulations while maintaining industrial output. They actively invest in waste and biomass gasification to diversify feedstock and align with circular economy mandates. Partnerships with steel and fertilizer producers enable tailored syngas supply for green ammonia and direct reduced iron. Expansion of hydrogen infrastructure allows syngas derived hydrogen to access cross sectoral markets. Additionally, companies pursue public private collaborations to secure funding from EU innovation programs accelerating commercial deployment of low carbon syngas pathways across the region.

But in an accelerated climate-changing world, these three vital ingredients are under threat from drought, pollution, conflict, resource shortages, and inequity — and that threat is felt most keenly by people living in low-income settings and nations.

This is why City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) launched its 10-year, UNESCO-endorsed Fostering Innovation for Resilience and Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) initiative, with the goal to deliver affordable and sustainable technologies to improve standards of living for communities.

Keeping cool

For people in wealthy countries, dealing with hot weather can be as simple as turning on the air conditioning. But that’s not only expensive; it is unsustainable in a world where such technologies still largely run on fossil fuel-generated electricity.

Looking for simple, low-cost, low-energy solutions, researcher Edwin Tso drew inspiration from the Saharan silver ant (Cataglyphis bombycina), whose body is coated with highly reflective hairs that reflect radiation and offload excess heat through thermal radiation. Tso and colleagues have developed a coating for buildings that does the same thing: reflects sunlight to reduce heat absorption and also emits infrared radiation so efficiently that it can reduce surface temperatures by as much as 30°C.

The coating is sustainably made, using local waste materials such as seashells, ceramic debris, rice husks, construction sand, and crushed glass. These materials are cleaned and ground up into nano-sized particles, which are then mixed with a specially formulated binding agent. The resulting coating can then be painted or sprayed onto rooftops and walls.

Sun power

A research team led by Alex Jen and Angus Yip has developed a much more cost-efficient alternative, which is based on solar photovoltaic technology using easy-to-make metalhalide-based perovskites instead of silicon. These materials are not only relatively cheap but can be thinner and more flexible than conventional solar cells. Perovskite-based solar cells are also becoming much more efficient at converting solar energy into electricity, even in less-than-ideal conditions such as low-light or high-temperature settings.

Human activity generates vast amounts of waste daily, from single-use plastics to spoiled food and agricultural biomass. Addressing this issue is a defining challenge of our era. But what if we could eliminate waste, cleanse the environment, and generate energy simultaneously?

Researchers Charles Xu and Carol Lin believe this is achievable through innovative biorefinery processes. This includes processes to transform plastic and organic waste into valuable products like biochar for fertilizer, bio-hydroponic foams for soilless planting, and sustainable aviation fuel. Also, Lin is developing a method to convert industrial organic waste into biosurfactants as cleaning agents and personal care products.

These scalable, adaptable systems can be configured modularly to handle diverse waste streams — from industrial food waste to agricultural or marine debris. The initiative plans to trial this technology in underserved areas like urban slums, remote towns, and fishing communities, where waste is abundant but management is scarce.

The first step involves identifying local waste types and determining useful outputs for the community. Ultimately, the end products will offer value-added outputs, which leads to a cleaner environment and sustainable energy supply.

Around 1.7 billion people worldwide don’t have access to safe drinking water, which contributes to a substantial burden of water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Part of the problem is that purifying drinking water needs a reliable power supply.

Zhiguo Yuan’s team has developed a solution that uses people-power to drive an ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection system that can sterilise 10 litres of water in just 15 minutes.

The triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generator can be operated by pedal or hand-cranked. It is extremely efficient, converting nearly 90% of the human power into electricity to drive the UV disinfection system. The system is also very easy to operate, and it only takes a few minutes to train someone to use.

The programme will initially focus on areas affected by natural disasters, where the risk of water-borne disease is much higher.

According to the Department of Energy, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a type of aviation fuel produced with renewable biomass and other waste resources that can offer aviation-grade performance without the need for petroleum, thereby reducing the associated greenhouse gas emissions with flight from the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport.
The feasibility study, which was approved by the Pitkin County Commissioners in July 2024, sought to assess whether the feedstock for such fuels existed in quantities to make local SAF production possible.
“We would not be able to fully support a (SAF plant) using only local oilseed crops,” Pitkin County Climate Action Analyst Michael Port told commissioners on Tuesday.
Accumulating the fuels and the water to do it would be huge.” Currently, the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport uses 20% SAF in their fuel mixture without the local production element.","A feasibility study into Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in the Roaring Fork Valley by Pitkin County and other local governments reached the conclusion that, while there is plentiful ‘feedstock’ for the manufacture of such fuel locally, the logistical challenges of extracting and producing SAF would be too large for a government to take the lead on.

Those partners included Pitkin County, Mesa County, Eagle County, Delta County, various regional airports in the area including Aspen/Pitkin County Regional Airport and Grand Junction Regional Airport, Atlantic Aviation, and more.

According to the Department of Energy, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a type of aviation fuel produced with renewable biomass and other waste resources that can offer aviation-grade performance without the need for petroleum, thereby reducing the associated greenhouse gas emissions with flight from the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport.

The feasibility study, which was approved by the Pitkin County Commissioners in July 2024, sought to assess whether the feedstock for such fuels existed in quantities to make local SAF production possible. According to the study, the fuel exists locally in the form of “woody biomass” that would be extracted from beetle-killed pine trees, municipal solid waste like compost and other organic waste, and the potential growth of “oilseed” crops like camelia, soybean, and canola plants.

However, each local feedstock comes with its own challenges, according to the study, which was published in the Board of County Commissioner’s documents for Tuesday’s meeting.

But beetlekill pine would be expensive and difficult to extract due to their dispersed nature in state and national forests with competing and different interests in lumber extraction. Municipal Solid Waste does not exist in quantities in the Roaring Fork Valley to support SAF production locally and, while organic waste can be pooled from other waste centers from outside the valley, the dispersed nature of that approach would likely drive the cost of production outside of the realm of possibility.

And oilseed crops, while compatible with the Roaring Fork Valley’s agricultural history and production, could not be grown in sufficient quantities locally to produce SAF using only locally grown crops.

“We would not be able to fully support a (SAF plant) using only local oilseed crops,” Pitkin County Climate Action Analyst Michael Port told commissioners on Tuesday. “We would need to import large amounts of material to actually produce SAF at scale. We were originally looking at if we could fully support this just with local material.”

Additionally, commissioners mentioned a concern around the water-usage of SAF-production in a valley long-known for its water scarcity.

“Perhaps this just is not the climate and the area where we should be trying to produce fuel,” Commissioner Greg Poschman commented. “It’s a water intensive thing. This would be like saying ‘maybe we should put a big AI facility out here somewhere or chip plant in Western Colorado because we’ve got so much silicon,’ but the thing is that there are other elements involved. Accumulating the fuels and the water to do it would be huge.”

Currently, the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport uses 20% SAF in their fuel mixture without the local production element. Ultimately, commissioners and staff agreed that the conclusion of the study was that SAF is not currently commercially viable for the local governments involved in the feasibility study to undertake.

Pitkin County’s presentation did leave open the possibility that private industry could overcome some of the challenges of SAF-production, and noted that local governments and other partners in this study could support that effort.

“This group didn’t want to be project developers, but our role as local government could be to create an environment that is more suitable for private investors through the mechanisms that we have available,” Port said. “We did not find a business case today for building a SAF plant, given current technology. But this is still a relatively young market, and things might change in the coming years.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2026/01/09002721/EDLplane-atd-010826-01-1024x819.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 23:57:18.601720

Sen. Torrey Westrom, R-Alexandria, urged lawmakers to pass RFA funding early and separately from a broader bonding bill.
Beyond financing, the most heated exchanges centered on regulation, and particularly the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and proposed feedlot rules.
“We are a water state, not an oil state, but a water state,” Hansen said, noting that nitrate contamination and aging wastewater systems affect communities of all sizes.
Despite disagreements, panelists repeatedly emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation as lawmakers head into a short session and an election year.","MANKATO, Minn. — Minnesota lawmakers from both parties told farmers that the 2026 legislative session will test whether the state can balance environmental regulation, infrastructure investment and economic survival during one of the toughest farm economies in years.

During a packed afternoon listening session at the Minnesota Ag Expo on Jan. 20, 2026, inside the Mayo Clinic Health System Event Center, legislators and Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen outlined priorities ranging from sustainable aviation fuel and beginning farmer loans to water infrastructure and regulatory reform — while also revealing sharp divisions over how state agencies interact with agriculture.

Petersen said his focus remains on ""getting things done” in a narrowly divided Legislature.

“Most of the years that I’ve been commissioner, we’ve been able to work with everybody on the stage to pass bipartisan bills,” Petersen said. “You’ve got to find a way, at the end of the day, to get things done.”

A top priority for Petersen and lawmakers on both sides is replenishing the Rural Finance Authority, which provides low-interest loans to farmers. The governor’s bonding proposal includes $50 million for RFA, but Petersen warned the fund could run dry in the coming year.

“If we don’t put more money into there, we’ll run out of money by the end of next year,” he said. “So we wouldn’t have money to loan out to farmers.

Sen. Torrey Westrom, R-Alexandria, urged lawmakers to pass RFA funding early and separately from a broader bonding bill.

“The more you bunch these bills together, you’ve just got too much weight on the wagon you’re pulling,” Westrom said.

Beyond financing, the most heated exchanges centered on regulation, and particularly the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and proposed feedlot rules.

Westrom said he recently spoke with a cattle producer who “spent $200,000 fighting the MPCA so he can pasture his cattle and raise cattle.”

“That is ludicrous,” Westrom said. “We’ve got to get that MPCA off the backs of farmers.”

Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, pushed back on characterizations of regulators, arguing that lasting solutions require engagement rather than confrontation.

“The agency is not a thing. It’s a group of people,” Putnam said. “When you engage with them as people, they can listen, they can respond.”

Putnam said lawmakers must focus on “solving problems rather than flying a partisan flag.”

Rep. Rick Hansen, DFL-South St. Paul, said agriculture cannot be separated from broader social and environmental challenges, particularly water quality.

“We are a water state, not an oil state, but a water state,” Hansen said, noting that nitrate contamination and aging wastewater systems affect communities of all sizes. “Everybody needs clean water.”

Hansen has proposed alternative funding mechanisms, including fees, to help pay for infrastructure that small communities cannot afford on their own.

During the session, a question from MPCA employee and fourth-generation dairy farmer Addison Fraze underscored the tension between regulation and practicality.

“How do we walk that line?” Fraze asked, referring to protecting water resources while allowing farms to remain viable.

In a follow-up interview, Fraze said polarization has made progress difficult.

“If you’re too pro regulation, or if you’re too against regulation, then you’re not getting anything done,” he said. “Asking those hard questions is what needs to happen for us to find the middle.

Rep. Paul Anderson, R-Starbuck, said farmers are feeling squeezed from all sides, including by new labor mandates such as paid family leave.

“The bill we had last year would exempt farmers if they were had four or fewer employees from the paid family leave,” Anderson said in a follow-up interview. “It didn’t go anywhere.”

The program went into effect Jan. 1, and Anderson said it has added paperwork and costs for farms already operating on thin margins.

“It’s additionally a lot of work,” he said. “It’s a big deal.”

Anderson also addressed concerns about the state’s grain indemnity fund, which is getting its limit tested following the Hansen-Mueller Co. bankruptcy.

“Thankfully, this won’t get to that impact,” Anderson said, noting current claims are expected to stay well below the threshold that would trigger new farmer assessments.

Despite disagreements, panelists repeatedly emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation as lawmakers head into a short session and an election year.

“We can’t operate in isolation,” Hansen said. “We have to work together.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/743d2f7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3435+0+0/resize/1862x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fb6%2F7632a84c449dbec2e8f9cd3fa96c%2Fmn-ag-expo-panel.JPG,N,,2026-01-20 17:56:33.566896

The FAA is alerting operators about safety issues that can arise from the rapid growth of space launch operations in the U.S.

As space launches become more frequent, the agency’s guidance underscores that the safe integration of space and traditional air traffic operations hinges on collaboration, careful pre-flight planning and in-flight awareness among pilots and operators, and real-time responsiveness.

SAFO 26001 focuses on the airspace management challenges that accompany these activities, especially the potential for catastrophic failures that produce debris fields capable of endangering aircraft. The alert encourages operators to proactively consider how launch operations might disrupt planned routes and day-of-operation traffic flows.

Review SAFO 26001 (PDF)

The FAA creates an airspace management plan for each launch, which outlines TFRs, aircraft hazard areas (AHA) and debris response areas (DRA) that may be needed to safeguard air traffic. AHAs and TFRs are typically disseminated through NOTAMs, alerting pilots to areas and altitudes where flights should avoid during launch windows.

SAFO 26001 advises flight planners and crews to integrate space launch considerations into their routine procedures. Pilots also are encouraged to maintain heightened situational awareness around areas where debris may fall and to ensure they carry sufficient fuel reserves to accommodate unexpected changes in routing.

In cases where an anomaly occurs – such as a launch failure – air traffic control may activate a DRA, reroute aircraft away from danger and broadcast alerts to affected flights.

“Some of these pre-published AHA’s affect significant amounts of airspace,” said Dean Snell, senior manager, NBAA Air Traffic Services. “The size of the AHA is usually determined by the predictability of the launch vehicles and boosters. For this reason, launches of prototype and early development vehicles cover more airspace due to the lower predictability of the flight path. We also see more complex AHA’s for the larger launch vehicles such as SpaceX Starship and Blue Origin New Glenn.

“The DRA’s will be noted in advance via NOTAM but will not be officially implemented unless there is a non-nominal event with the launch vehicles or boosters,” Snell added. “Due to the weather and atmospheric requirements for launches, it is somewhat common to see AHA’s cancel at the last minute and be reactivated the subsequent days.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blue-Origin-rocket-launch.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 19:56:43.142807

Addressing the Global SAF Feedstock Constraint

The global aviation industry faces a structural constraint in scaling SAF: the limited availability of qualified, low-carbon waste-based feedstocks that can be efficiently processed by existing refinery infrastructure. Many refineries encounter technical and economic challenges when handling high-acidity and impurity-rich waste oils such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and used cooking oil (UCO), which can degrade conventional catalysts and increase operating costs. UMeWorld’s Malaysia platform is designed to address this constraint by converting difficult-to-process waste lipids into specification-driven renewable fuel intermediates. These intermediates are intended to integrate with existing hydroprocessing and SAF upgrading units, reducing the need for costly refinery modifications and expanding the pool of usable waste-based feedstocks.

Technology-Enabled Commercial Advantage

UMeWorld’s Malaysia platform is built around a technology-enabled conversion process designed to expand the usable universe of waste-based feedstocks for renewable fuel production. Unlike conventional processing approaches that struggle with high-acidity and impurity-rich inputs, the platform is engineered to consistently upgrade challenging waste lipids into renewable fuel intermediates compatible with existing refinery systems. The conversion process is designed to operate under lower-severity conditions than conventional chemical refining approaches, improving feedstock tolerance, reducing degradation risk, and enabling more efficient downstream integration.

This technology advantage delivers tangible commercial benefits for fuel offtakers:

Broader feedstock access: Enables utilization of waste streams typically constrained or excluded by traditional refining processes

Infrastructure compatibility: Produces intermediates designed to integrate with existing hydroprocessing and SAF upgrading units

Improved economics: Supports competitive pricing by reducing feedstock constraints and downstream processing complexity

“The SAF market does not face a demand problem - it faces a feedstock and economics problem,” said Michael Lee, Chief Executive Officer of UMeWorld. “Our Malaysia platform is designed to unlock underutilized waste feedstocks and convert them into intermediates that refineries can actually use, while maintaining disciplined and predictable economics. That combination is essential for SAF to scale sustainably.”

Facility Execution and Timeline

The Malaysia SAF feedstock facility is engineered to meet European Union ReFuelEU Aviation carbon-intensity thresholds and is planned with an initial nameplate capacity of approximately 10,000 metric tonnes per year. The plant architecture emphasizes modularity, enabling future expansion and replication. Key execution milestones include:

Operating entity in place: Verdant Sustainable Fuel Sdn. Bhd. incorporated January 16, 2026

Site selection underway: Final site selection targeted within the next 90 days, prioritizing feedstock density, logistics access, and port connectivity

Construction timeline: Subject to site finalization and permitting progression, initial construction activities expected to commence later in 2026

Strategic Outlook

The Malaysia Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) feedstock initiative is a cornerstone of UMeWorld’s Strategy 2026, which prioritizes the development of scalable, capital-efficient industrial biofuel infrastructure alongside the continued expansion of the Company’s DAGola™ functional nutrition platform. By deploying a consistent and replicable processing platform across both sectors, UMeWorld aims to strengthen operational efficiency, enforce cost discipline, and create durable long-term shareholder value.

In addition, the policy aligned with measures by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which was pushing airlines worldwide to use SAF as a key mechanism for driving the aviation sector towards net zero, he added.

Bangchak Corporation was building a SAF plant in Thailand using HEFA technology, with used cooking oil (UCO) as the main feedstock. The facility had a capacity of 1M litres/day (about 6,289 barrels/day) and was expected to become operational in the second quarter of 2026, the report said.

Canola, used in some countries for the production of biofuels, raises food-security concerns and, above all, scale: yields per hectare are low and the area required to replace aviation fuel would exceed the size of Australia.
Ongoing research focuses on improving the biomass of the plants, so as to increase the proportion that can be converted into fuel without reducing yields.
If the commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel becomes a reality — something the researchers believe is within reach — international adoption could be rapid.
In this scenario, sugarcane could place Australia at the forefront of the energy transition in the aviation sector.","An Australian researcher argues that sugarcane could play a decisive role in the future of sustainable aviation fuel, by enabling the substitution of fossil-origin carbon without compromising food production or biodiversity.

The position comes from Professor Emeritus Robert Henry of the University of Queensland, who is part of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, a research center that brings together universities and international companies with the aim of developing renewable fuels viable at the scale of the aviation industry.

According to the researcher, plants are currently the best available source of renewable carbon, and among all the options analyzed, sugarcane stands out for its productivity and ability to be produced at large scale. “It is the only agricultural crop that is already produced in the volumes necessary to meet the demands of this sector,” he notes.

Other alternatives have been studied, but present significant limitations. Algae, for example, are frequently pointed to as promising, but the high costs make them uncompetitive without the existence of high-value byproducts. Canola, used in some countries for the production of biofuels, raises food-security concerns and, above all, scale: yields per hectare are low and the area required to replace aviation fuel would exceed the size of Australia.

The use of land is, therefore, a critical factor. Sugarcane combines high productivity with a relatively small land footprint, which makes it particularly attractive. Ongoing research focuses on improving the biomass of the plants, so as to increase the proportion that can be converted into fuel without reducing yields.

To accelerate this process, scientists are using a phased strategy: they start by testing genetic alterations in simpler crops, such as rice, then move on to sorghum — a close relative of sugarcane — before applying the most promising solutions to sugarcane itself, whose genetics are more complex.

Australia, and in particular the state of Queensland, emerges as a privileged territory to lead this transition. The country has a consolidated sugar industry, strong scientific capacity, and international partnerships. Moreover, the high level of air travel creates a strong domestic demand for sustainable fuels.

“The challenge is complex, but the potential is enormous,” says Robert Henry. If the commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel becomes a reality — something the researchers believe is within reach — international adoption could be rapid. In this scenario, sugarcane could place Australia at the forefront of the energy transition in the aviation sector.",https://www.plusnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sugarcane-Identified-as-a-Key-Solution-for-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:56:46.751163

Additional initiatives outlined in Avianca’s 2024 sustainability report further supported emissions reductions.
Through its Avianca Fuel program, the airline implemented 24 fuel-saving initiatives in 2024 aimed at reducing fuel burn across its network.
Beyond flight operations, Avianca focused on reducing emissions from ground activities and infrastructure.
According to the sustainability report, Avianca’s emissions strategy also includes compliance with international market-based measures.","Colombian flag carrier Avianca reduced its total carbon emissions by 5.1% between 2019 and 2024, despite an 18.1% increase in overall capacity, according to data from EmeraldSky. Over the same period, the airline cut its carbon intensity by nearly 20%, lowering emissions from 82.6 to 66.3 grams of CO₂ per available seat-kilometer.

The emissions reductions stem largely from fleet modernization. Since 2019, Avianca has retired nearly two-thirds of its Airbus A319 aircraft, phased out its entire A321 fleet, and exited regional jet and turboprop operations. These aircraft were replaced with a larger number of Airbus A320neo jets, which deliver approximately 20% fuel savings compared with previous-generation models, along with additional A320ceo aircraft. On long-haul routes, the airline replaced Airbus A330 aircraft with Boeing 787s, which offer lower fuel consumption per seat. As a result, the average aircraft size in Avianca’s fleet increased from 144 seats in 2019 to 181 seats in 2024.

Avianca also reconfigured cabins across both its narrowbody and widebody fleets to improve seating density and fuel efficiency. Although global supply chain constraints pushed the average fleet age to about 9.5 years, the airline reconfigured 24 aircraft in 2024 alone, bringing the total number of optimized aircraft in operation to 141. These reconfigurations reduced emissions per revenue passenger-kilometer by 15.35% compared with non-reconfigured aircraft.

Additional initiatives outlined in Avianca’s 2024 sustainability report further supported emissions reductions. Through its Avianca Fuel program, the airline implemented 24 fuel-saving initiatives in 2024 aimed at reducing fuel burn across its network. These included expanded use of single-engine taxi operations, with compliance rates reaching 84.38% in Bogota, 98.76% in Quito and 77.17% in El Salvador. The airline also introduced new decision-support tools for dispatchers to improve fuel planning and coordinated fuel-reduction strategies with flight standards, operations engineering and maintenance teams.

Operational efficiency programs targeting pilots and flight dispatchers also contributed to emissions cuts. In 2024, the initiative involved 1,926 pilots and 128 dispatchers and used incentives to encourage the application of manufacturer-approved fuel efficiency practices within strict safety parameters. Top-performing pilots were recognized quarterly, alongside additional incentives to reinforce adoption. Together, these actions helped avoid 64,520 tons of CO₂ emissions in 2024, including 62,042 tons from passenger operations and 2,480 tons from cargo activities.

Beyond flight operations, Avianca focused on reducing emissions from ground activities and infrastructure. In 2024, the airline added 14 electric vehicles for maintenance operations in Bogota and Rionegro, replacing combustion vehicles and reducing emissions by up to 80% per vehicle. At its Rionegro maintenance facilities, Avianca also promoted bicycle use for internal transportation, logging 1,449 trips that avoided an estimated 2,006 kilograms of CO₂. Infrastructure investments included the generation of 816,896 kilowatt-hours of solar energy in 2024, supplying 34% of the electricity consumed at the Rionegro facility. Cargo warehouses in Rionegro and Miami operate with energy-efficient lighting systems and refrigeration technology with zero ozone depletion potential.

According to the sustainability report, Avianca’s emissions strategy also includes compliance with international market-based measures. The airline reported emissions from international flights under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for seven operating airlines within the group, with each report verified by an accredited independent body in accordance with ICAO standards. In parallel, Avianca prepared for the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, which takes effect in 2025 and requires airlines to monitor fuel use, comply with anti-tankering rules and progressively increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). During 2024, the airline strengthened fuel-consumption monitoring at European airports, automated reporting processes and secured agreements with SAF suppliers to meet regulatory requirements on routes from Europe.

SAF remains a central pillar of Avianca’s long-term decarbonization strategy, although the airline acknowledges significant technological, regulatory and financial barriers to large-scale deployment in Latin America. In 2023 and 2024, Avianca participated in technical working groups led by Colombia’s civil aviation authority to develop a national SAF roadmap under the “Cielos limpios: Aviación para la vida” initiative. If approved, the roadmap would position Colombia as the third country in the region, after Chile and Brazil, to adopt a formal SAF strategy. Avianca is also engaging with fuel suppliers, government agencies, universities and industry partners to explore Colombia’s potential as a SAF producer and exporter, while evaluating mechanisms such as Book and Claim to support early adoption.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/pexels-felipe-rocha-2293861-15616195.jpg?h=32973ddf&itok=beK6UJDx,N,,2026-01-20 15:57:03.243653

“All of our ethanol plants are major ethanol plants.
“About 40% of our corn exports go to Mexico, and about 40% of our ethanol exports go to Canada,” Swanson said.
“So collectively thinking about corn and ethanol, important markets.
And these were already important markets before USMCA, but they have grown in importance and market share since then.","NASHVILLE, TENN. (RFD NEWS) — Farmers across the country are looking for ways to market a glut of corn right now and tackle business planning for the growing season ahead. The Nebraska Farm Bureau (NEFB) President, Mark McHargue tells RFD NEWS he is in talks with officials across the pond to capitalize on demand for U.S. ethanol.

“In Nebraska, we do have a carbon pipeline now that’s functioning and running,” McHargue explains. “All of our ethanol plants are major ethanol plants. Can produce ethanol at a very, very low carbon score, and that’s important primarily to our export markets. I had a conversation with leadership from the UK while I was at the [AFBF] Convention. They’re still very excited about potentially buying SAF [Sustainable Aviation Fuel] from this country, upping their ethanol usage, and they certainly still want that low-carbon fuel.”

Next door in Iowa, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig tells RFD NEWS grain producers in his state are also hoping to see ethanol come to the rescue. Naig told RFD NEWS that year-round sales of E15 would be the ideal market for many growers in his state.

“I know they want to get this done, and the wheels of Congress just broadly have been so slowly grinding,” Naig said in a recent interview with RFD NEWS. “We need to move some things that are important. Look, timing’s everything. Let’s use this most recent crop report as maybe the final signal that we need to push this thing through, because it actually can have a dramatic impact, both for the farm community — and look, in Iowa, where Iowa consumers are saving $40,000,000 a year, just last year, in using E15 versus 10% ethanol blend.”

U.S. Auto Makers Push Back on Flex-Fuel Vehicle (FFVs) Production

Regular gasoline blends contain up to 10 percent ethanol, E15 uses 15 percent, and so on. On the other hand, FFVs can use ethanol blends up to 85 percent. While higher ethanol blends are available, most vehicles produced and sold in the U.S. cannot run on them. Markets analyst Chris Swift told RFD NEWS that U.S. manufacturers need to start adapting before it is too late.

“We really need our automobile manufacturers to be able to increase that engine or be able to warranty it to be able to handle that higher [blend],” Swift explains. “And we noticed that when we got into the flex fuel a couple of years ago, most of those vehicles now can’t be found anywhere. So, we really need the help of the automotive manufacturers to be able to increase that engine performance with that higher ethanol production.”

General Motors faced a class-action lawsuit in 2022 over those vehicles, with users claiming that the high-ethanol blend damaged their engines. That case was dismissed, but other parts of the suit are still working their way through the courts. However, the issue is not a matter of developing the technology. These FFVs are already produced by Chinese manufacturers like BYD and sold globally. However, Chinese EVs and FFVs are extremely rare in the United States due to steep tariffs, national security restrictions on connected vehicle tech, and a lack of established dealerships, making direct import complex and costly.

Expanding Domestic Ethanol Production

The ethanol industry is expected to expand this year. Broker Sherman Newlin tells RFD NEWS that when everything comes online, it could be positive news for corn growers.

“We’re supposed to be building out about another billion gallons worth of production, just plants expanding because of our tax credits that are available out there. And everybody’s trying to grind as much as they can. So, if all that could come online within the next year or so, or maybe a little bit longer than that, I mean, another billion gallons of ethanol produced could use up to another 300 million bushels of corn.”

Brazil’s ethanol industry is also expanding this year. Newlin says the South American trade giant currently operates about two dozen plants right now and could expand to as many as 40 within the next few years.

Corn Groups Push for Input Cost Reductions and USMCA

As farmers plan for the upcoming growing season, many are monitoring geopolitical factors and potential impacts on input and commodity prices. Lewis Williamson with HTS Commodities joined us on Tuesday’s Market Day Report to provide his market outlook.

In his interview with RFD NEWS, Williamson discussed what he is watching in today’s market during the first weeks of the year. He also shared his outlook for the upcoming growing season and the factors he anticipates influencing planting decisions and market conditions.

As row crop farmers prepare for spring planting, economists at the nation’s largest corn group, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), say it will be important to watch geopolitical developments, especially regarding fertilizer.

“It’s a relatively big chunk of the operating costs,” explains NCGA Chief Economist Krista Swanson in a recent interview with RFD NEWS. “It usually makes up about 35% of operating costs. And, you know, it’s kind of the most volatile of the input costs. And so even some small swings and fertilizer prices can have big implications for farm profitability, which is a big deal when we are in this profitability string that we’re in right now, where costs have been higher than prices the last few years.”

Fertilizer prices are a mixed bag lately. Analysts at DTN found that five of the eight major types had become more expensive recently, while DAP and MAP both fell by less than 10 percent. All eight types are more expensive than this time last year, with UAN 32 up 27 percent year over year.

NGCA is also paying close attention to recent comments on the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the trade pact that President Trump called “irrelevant.” Swanson says they will be pushing to keep that agreement in place.

“About 40% of our corn exports go to Mexico, and about 40% of our ethanol exports go to Canada,” Swanson said. “So collectively thinking about corn and ethanol, important markets. And these were already important markets before USMCA, but they have grown in importance and market share since then. So, I think that speaks to the testament of the importance of this.”

USMCA is set for review this summer, but recent comments from President Trump are now calling that into question. In addition to calling it “irrelevant,” he claims that Canada gets more out of the agreement than America does. If the review is not successful this summer, the trade pact could sunset in 2036.",https://rfdtv.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/acb1770/2147483647/strip/true/crop/720x404+0+1/resize/730x410!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jwplayer.com%2Fv2%2Fmedia%2FePfeCg6T%2Fthumbnails%2FP55Z0G7r.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:57:16.788693

The trend marks a renewed threat to affordability after the pandemic jacked up ticket prices.

A peer-reviewed study by researchers at the University of Sydney found that the additional cost to long-haul flight from using sustainable aviation fuel ranges for $68 to “hundreds of dollars” per ticket.

The average traveller, meanwhile, is willing to contribute a mere $2.60 extra toward sustainable fuel for a long-haul flight.

While households baulk at costlier travel, governments in Europe are implementing decarbonisation mandates that will force airlines to adopt sustainable fuels, even though the scarcity of the low-emissions fuel will create an added cost for the industry.

Sustainable airline fuel, a lower-emission alternative derived from sources like used cooking oil and green waste, is essential for decarbonising air travel but is currently three to six times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

“Australian and New Zealand travellers like the idea of sustainability, but they are not willing to foot the bill for [sustainable fuel],” said Rico Merkert, professor of transportation at the University of Sydney.

“If government and industry don’t collaborate, I think flying will become more expensive,” he warned.

The expected price pressure comes as the aviation industry is still recovering from COVID-19 lockdowns, which decimated airline skilled staffing, crippled supply chains and pushed up airfares.

According to an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission report from December 2025, domestic airfares had already reached their highest levels in years due to “strong demand … which puts upward pressure on airfares.”

Yet government fuel mandates are advancing, even as the capacity for the industry to produce the fuel remains deeply constrained.

The EU requires a mix of sustainable fuel to be blended with traditional fuel, starting at 2 per cent in 2025, rising to 6 per cent in 2030, 34 per cent in 2040, and 70 per cent by 2050, according to Sydney-based NoviqTech, which creates software to track emissions.

The UK requires 2 per cent in 2025 and 10 per cent by 2030.

Australia has no binding sustainable fuel blend mandate and no large-scale production facilities, although it is considering incentives to spur the industry.

Industry group Airlines for Australia and New Zealand CEO Stephen Beckett said the aviation sector wants to lower environmental impact and is aware of the risk for consumers.

“If you simply jack up the price of jet fuel, on top of all the other fees and charges being levied on airfares, the cost of doing business is going to go up,” he said.

“We need to make sure aviation remains affordable for all Australians.

“We want to decarbonise and need to get the policy architecture right, so the demand and supply-side policy work together, and not against each other.”

Despite the rapid growth of electric cars, battery or hydrogen-powered aircraft are not likely to make a significant contribution to reducing emissions from planes before 2050, according to industry group A4ANZ, making sustainable fuel crucial despite its cost.

SAF comprised only an estimated 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, the International Air Transportation Association said in December.

It is on track to rise to 0.8 per cent this year.

At current price levels, the cost of SAF translated into an additional US$3.6 billion ($5.4 billion) in global fuel costs for airlines last year. Airlines spent $US236 billion on fuel last year.

In December, IATA’s director general, Willie Walsh, said: “If the goal of sustainable fuel mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park [succeeded wildly].

“But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” he said.

These methods can also be used to obtain detailed behavioral data from business establishments providing passenger and freight transport (see, for example, ref.
In particular, future work should explore how such behavioral models can be embedded within broader governance frameworks.","Designing and implementing actions for decarbonization necessitates a comprehensive understanding of human behavior. While technological advancements are essential, they alone cannot resolve the multifaceted challenges of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. Behavioral change is also necessary, and achieving it requires the use of targeted interventions or behavior change strategies that address individual and contextual factors influencing decision-making. Effective decarbonization strategies must integrate behavioral insights pertaining to multiple actors, including individuals/households, businesses, and government organizations — all of whom experience uncertainty in their decision-making. Behavioral choices significantly influence final consumer demand, mobility patterns, energy choices, and the adoption and use of new technologies. For instance, promoting sustainable mobility behaviors requires not only the availability of ecofriendly transportation options but also the willingness of individuals to adopt and use these options. Understanding these behavioral aspects is critical for designing climate policies that are technically sound, socially acceptable, and balance the dual objectives of achieving zero carbon emissions while enhancing well-being and happiness.

Our workshop participants, authors of this paper, who include experts in transportation and energy research and have disciplinary backgrounds in engineering, economics, econometrics, environmental psychology, applied math and data collection, identified a range of strategies influencing climate mitigation actions, including technology development, policy and regulation, information and education, compensation and redistribution of the costs and benefits, as well as strategies that account for key aspects of behavior. One such aspect is behavioral heterogeneity. Individuals have different beliefs, preferences, needs, and constraints that will affect their responses to emissions mitigation measures. Other overarching behavioral factors include willingness to pay and public acceptance, and the role of emotions and seemingly “irrational” responses.

Designing decarbonization policies presents several significant challenges. The objective of achieving zero carbon emissions requires substantial changes in energy production, consumption, and overall societal behavior. Simultaneously, policies must account for adverse impacts on well-being and happiness, ensuring that transitions to low-carbon systems do not adversely affect quality of life, which is also important to secure public support. Additionally, minimizing the costs of new technologies and energy is crucial to make decarbonization economically viable and politically acceptable. Furthermore, forecasting and assessing the impact of individual and combined climate change mitigation actions is complicated by deep uncertainty. This uncertainty arises from various sources, including unpredictable technological advancements, variable economic conditions, complex human behavior and contextual factors, and uncertainties about how the climate system will develop. Deep uncertainty makes it challenging to predict long-term outcomes and to design robust policies that remain effective under a wide range of future scenarios. Therefore, policymakers must adopt flexible, adaptive approaches and continuously update their strategies based on new information and insights1,2.

This complexity is illustrated in Fig. 1, which is presented in two panels. In both panels, the x-axis represents the degree of decarbonization. The top panel shows the corresponding mitigation costs, while the bottom panel shows the associated level of well-being. In both cases, the shaded areas around the curves represent the uncertainty in the estimation of these indicators. Two examples are highlighted: integrated land-use planning (e.g., ref. 3), which achieves a relatively low degree of decarbonization at low cost while enhancing well-being, and electric vehicles (e.g., ref. 4), which contribute to a higher degree of decarbonization but at higher costs and with smaller well-being gains.

While the figure is conceptual, its form is grounded in empirical and theoretical evidence on the cost-effectiveness and complexity of transport decarbonization measures. The steep initial rise in decarbonization effectiveness at low cost reflects well-documented findings from integrated land-use and transport planning, which can deliver substantial emission reductions alongside co-benefits such as improved public health, equity, and accessibility, often at relatively modest investment levels5. Similarly, investment in high-quality cycling infrastructure can increase cycling rates by 60–90% with moderate spending, reinforcing the steep early gains depicted6.

As costs increase toward more capital-intensive measures, the curve flattens, consistent with marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves in energy-system studies7. These curves typically result from ranking mitigation measures by cost-effectiveness, beginning with the lowest-cost options and progressing to those with higher unit costs. In the transport sector, this pattern reflects the greater technical, institutional, and behavioral challenges of deeper decarbonization, such as shifting entire vehicle fleets to zero-emission technologies or overhauling infrastructure networks.

We propose a methodological framework to help policymakers deal with uncertainty; design policies and regulations; understand public responses; and forecast the impact of policies and technologies on behavior, while identifying effective strategies for communicating these impacts to stakeholders.

The framework includes surveys of human behavior, choice models of technology and policy adoption, choice of energy sources, and consumption behavior. Bundles of decarbonization measures can then be evaluated using agent-based simulations where behavioral models predict the reactions by different stakeholders and the consequent reduction in emissions. We focus on decarbonization of the transport sector for the remainder of this paper; however, the framework we employ is applicable to other sectors as well.

While the framework is designed to support evidence-based policy design by anticipating behavioral responses and emissions outcomes, we recognize that decarbonization is ultimately embedded in broader societal and institutional contexts. Structural factors such as infrastructure provision, planning decisions, market dynamics, and regulatory environments shape both behavioral possibilities and technological pathways. Furthermore, the distributional impacts of climate policies and the processes through which they are designed raise important questions of justice, equity, and political legitimacy. Although these issues are not explicitly modeled within our framework, they can be partially addressed through the evaluation of distributional outcomes8 and the design of compensatory or reinvestment mechanisms. The framework is thus best understood as a decision-support tool that can inform policy within a wider governance process — one that must also account for questions of voice, representation, and institutional power.

Behavioral heterogeneity

The extent to which people engage in pro-environmental behavior varies, depending on individuals’ capacities and motivation to engage in the behavior18,19,20. Behavioral heterogeneity thus depends on contextual factors, differences in personal ability to act, and the motivation to act. Contextual factors include available infrastructure, technology, market design, price regimes, and regulations (we elaborate on these below). For example, individuals are more likely to drive an electric car if they have access to a fast and reliable charging infrastructure and when electric cars are affordable (e.g., via subsidies), and people can only use public transport when convenient public transport is available.

Differences in personal ability to act are another factor leading to behavioral heterogeneity. Perceived ability depends on personal characteristics such as education level, knowledge, income, and family situation. For example, perceived ability to act pro-environmentally will be higher when people have better knowledge of the causes and consequences of environmental problems, and understand how to mitigate these problems19. Income is also a key variable explaining behavioral heterogeneity. There is empirical evidence21 that lower-income groups in the USA consistently prioritize environmental protection over economic growth. Higher-income groups may also feel more able to act pro-environmentally22, particularly when such actions are financially costly. Indeed, many options, such as investments in home insulation or PV19, or adoption of electric vehicles23, are more accessible to higher-income individuals. Further, the family context can restrain some behaviors (e.g., people may need a car to pick up children after work).

The third motivation to act affects behavioral heterogeneity. People consider various costs and benefits of actions, and weigh these consequences differently depending on the values they endorse19. Values reflect general goals that people strive for in their lives, which affect how they weigh different costs and benefits of actions, and which choices they make24,25. Four types of values are particularly important to understand environmental choices: hedonic values (i.e., striving for pleasure, reducing effort), egoistic values (i.e., striving to enhance and secure one’s resources such as money and status), altruistic values (i.e., striving to enhance the well-being of others) and biospheric values (i.e., striving to protect nature and the environment26). In general, people with strong hedonic and egoistic values are less likely to act pro-environmentally, as doing so is oftentimes somewhat costly (e.g., buying an electric vehicle) or less comfortable (e.g, traveling by bus rather than by car). In contrast, stronger altruistic and particularly stronger biospheric values generally promote pro-environmental actions, as such actions benefit nature, the environment, and the well-being of others, including future generations.

People consider a range of individual, collective, social, and emotional costs and benefits when making decisions19,27. First, they are more likely to act pro-environmentally when such actions offer individual benefits at low cost28. Picard et al.29 show that the perceived costs and benefits of driving vary depending on whether individuals commute with their spouse or travel alone. Second, people are more likely to engage in pro-environmental behavior when they are concerned about environmental problems, feel a sense of responsibility to reduce them, and view themselves as supportive of the environment19. Fehr and Gächter30 demonstrate experimentally that many individuals are willing to punish free-riders in public goods games, even when doing so is personally costly and offers no material benefit. Third, social norms, i.e., the expectations and behaviors of others, can significantly influence individual choices. People tend to follow such norms to gain social approval, avoid disapproval, or because they believe it is the right thing to do19. For example, people are more likely to install solar panels when many neighbors already did so31. Fourth, people are more likely to act pro-environmentally when they anticipate that such actions will generate positive emotions, such as a sense of pleasure or moral satisfaction, and may avoid certain behaviors if they expect these to result in negative feelings25,32,33.

Our discussion indicates that many factors affect individual choices and the likelihood that people act pro-environmentally. These factors vary across individuals, explaining the heterogeneity in choice behavior. It is important to understand these different factors and their impacts on individual choices and behaviors, so that policies can be appropriately designed to mitigate climate change. Table 1 summarizes exemplary choices with respect to each of the Kaya identity-based factors that relate to the three components representing behavioral heterogeneity. Integrating these factors and choices into transport models would increase the representation of consumer and producer heterogeneity.

Technology adoption and infrastructure requirements

The introduction of new technologies can bring about challenges, such as increased demand for energy or travel (known as induced demand) and hidden economic, environmental, or social costs that may not be immediately apparent. These factors necessitate careful consideration to prevent unintended consequences.

For instance, while the rapid uptake of EVs is expected to reduce tailpipe emissions and, in most regions, is increasingly supported by growing shares of renewable electricity, the transition still raises important infrastructure and resource concerns. The additional electricity demand from EVs is unlikely to negate their emissions benefits unless it is met with carbon-intensive sources such as coal, which is increasingly rare in many countries34,35. However, a full transition to electrified transport could place significant strain on grid capacity and requires substantial investments in charging infrastructure36. Furthermore, it entails environmental and geopolitical risks linked to the extraction and processing of critical raw materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt, and rare-earth elements), as well as challenges associated with battery manufacturing and end-of-life management. Broader infrastructure considerations are thus essential when implementing decarbonization strategies, as they provide the physical and systemic foundation for supporting sustainable technologies and practices. Table 2 provides an example of propagating infrastructure requirements for each of the three Kaya identity factors.

Another challenge of innovative and sustainable infrastructure projects can be the time to impact, as these projects are influenced by a complex chain involving regulatory approvals, funding allocations, stakeholder consultations, and end-user behavior. For instance, the scalability of EV charging infrastructure hinges on industry partnerships and governmental support to expand access and adoption across diverse geographical regions37.

The uptake of any new technology, and the infrastructure accompanying it, typically begins with early adopters. Compared to early adopters, later adopters attach greater importance to perceived usefulness, affordability, accessibility, and policy incentives38. However, early adopters on their own are seldom enough to make something financially viable. To scale up, funding mechanisms are required, with initiatives ranging from private-public partnerships to support from charities and foundations such as the Solar Impulse Foundation, which advocates for sustainable solutions.

Finally, public willingness to pay for both the additional costs of using infrastructure (marginal costs) and the larger upfront investments (capital expenditures) is essential to ensure that innovative infrastructure projects are financially secure and can sustain themselves over time.

The time it takes for traditional infrastructure to have an impact (“time to impact”) can be shortened if it is designed to address an existing demand for public transportation or to encourage people to shift from using polluting cars to cleaner public transport. This is the case, for example, of the Crossrail project in London, or the Grand Paris Express intended to improve Paris accessibility and attractiveness, and to make the Paris region a polycentric city39,40. However, funding such large infrastructures also raises challenges.

Finally, uncertainties regarding the environmental and societal impacts of infrastructure projects necessitate careful consideration. Issues such as their effects on biodiversity and human communities, alongside local and global perceptions of these impacts, can spark social protests and influence decision-making (see Heathrow’s 3rd runway41,42, or the UK national grid upgrade43, or the local opposition to the Grand Paris Express project in the most productive agricultural lands around Paris44).

Policies, programs, rules, and regulations enacted at all levels of government are obviously designed to influence the behavior of individuals, households, and business establishments as described in the following subsections.

Market-based policies

Market-based environmental policies encourage behavior change (in firms and/or individuals) through market signals by leaving economic agents a choice, as opposed to explicit regulatory directives or ‘command’ and ‘control’ regulation (technology-based or performance-based standards). Broadly, market-based policies include pollution charges and deposit-refund systems (e.g., carbon taxes enacted in European countries in the 1990s), tradable permits and cap-and-trade schemes (e.g., the U.S EPA’s 1986 Clean Air Act, which mandated an emission trading policy for ‘criteria’ pollutants; the EU ETS), subsidies to reduce pollution, and market barrier reductions (removing explicit or implicit barriers to market activity). As such, they can affect all factors forming the Kaya identity.

Although governments at all levels are starting to implement market-based instruments45,46, they have, in general, been slow to do so. A key challenge has been resistance from interest groups and the public for a variety of reasons. There is a legitimate concern that market-based instruments may lead to adverse distributional impacts, exacerbate existing inequalities, and give rise to environmental injustice. This is particularly problematic when the financial burden of such policies—such as carbon pricing or energy taxes—falls disproportionately on vulnerable groups, who often have fewer resources to absorb additional costs or adapt their behavior. These same groups are also frequently the most exposed to environmental risks, making them doubly disadvantaged by both economic and environmental harms. For example, a carbon tax often places a heavier burden on lower-income households, as they spend a larger share of their income on energy and everyday goods affected by the tax, especially before any compensation or revenue redistribution is applied47,48,49.

Market-based tools like carbon pricing and emissions trading have often been introduced too weakly to be effective. In many cases, carbon prices have been too low or pollution limits too loose to drive meaningful change46. Participation has sometimes been limited, and the expected cost savings have not materialized50. These outcomes are partly due to unrealistic assumptions about how people and companies behave, flaws in policy design, and the fact that many companies lack the internal capacity to take full advantage of these systems51.

The effectiveness of market-based policies strongly depends on how individuals and firms respond to price signals, making it especially important to understand and anticipate behavioral reactions, which are often uncertain and context-dependent. At the same time, generating accurate predictions about the likely impacts of the policy is critical in garnering public acceptance and underscores the role of behavioral models. For instance, the Stockholm congestion charging scheme is instructive; initial public skepticism changed after the scheme was introduced, largely due to the evident reduction in congestion52,53, and in environmental problems54.

Suitable approaches to address the dual challenge of anticipating behavioral responses and fostering public support (in the context of both environmental and congestion externalities) include recycling/dividend schemes to address welfare and distributional impacts, the use of behavioral modeling and optimization to design policies that account for likely public reactions, careful framing of policy instruments (for example, users in Stockholm were more receptive when the term “environmental charges” was used instead of “congestion charges”), and information campaigns. More broadly, no single policy instrument is likely to offer a complete panacea toward decarbonization, as no single instrument can address all barriers to change.

Table 3 provides two examples of market-based policy measures and their potential impact on each of the Kaya identity factors. As is visible, the impact of the two policies on travel behavior can lead to opposite directions.

Regulations

Regulations serve as policy tools that force behavioral change to address environmental challenges. They can be categorized into supply-oriented and demand-oriented approaches. Supply-oriented regulations, such as mandates for minimum sustainable aviation fuel mixes (affecting CO2/E in the Kaya identity), directly influence the composition and availability of products in the market by placing rules on the supplier. Demand-oriented regulations are placed on the end-user/consumer. Measures like establishing low-emission zones in urban areas, setting speed limits, or banning the use (rather than the production) of internal combustion engines are examples of policies designed to reduce emissions and improve air quality by prohibiting some types of targeted user behavior.

As with market-based policies, regulations can affect each factor of the Kaya identity. Regulations aiming at fuel specifications affect CO2/E, whereas those aiming at vehicle fuel economy impact E/PTK and PKT. However, in contrast to market-based measures, the lower marginal costs of driving associated with a more fuel-efficient vehicle can result in an increase in vehicle travel and thus traffic congestion, air pollution, and other externalities. For the industrialized world, this rebound effect was estimated to be around 12% in the short run, increasing to 32% in the long run55.

While regulations can be enacted quickly and have immediate legal effect, their environmental impact often unfolds gradually. First, considerable time is needed to build support among stakeholders and reduce public and political resistance. Once passed, the regulation must be aligned with existing legal frameworks and implemented in a way that meets all legislative requirements. Industries may also require a substantial lead-in time to adjust and comply with new standards. For example, if a regulation affects vehicle design, long fleet turnover times must be taken into account, meaning that the full environmental impact of such measures may not be realized for decades (e.g., ref. 56). Furthermore, behavioral adaptation must occur in response to the regulation, which also takes time. While these challenges are often associated with regulatory instruments, they also apply to other policy tools that aim to influence long-term technology choices, such as vehicle adoption, and should be considered when evaluating short-term versus long-term effectiveness. Skipping any of these steps risks undermining a regulation’s durability, early uptake, or overall impact.

Table 4 presents two examples of regulatory policy measures along with their impact on each of the Kaya identity’s factors. As with regulatory measures, depending on the implemented policy, the outcome on travel behavior can be fundamentally different.

Information and education

Providing information and education on the causes and consequences of environmental problems or on ways to reduce these problems generally increases people’s knowledge. However, it often does not encourage pro-environmental actions19, as people typically face other barriers to act as well. Indeed, informational strategies are especially effective when the targeted behavior is not very inconvenient or costly (in terms of money, time, effort, and/or social disapproval), and when individuals do not face important external constraints on behavior18.

Social influence approaches that communicate what other people do or think can encourage mitigation actions, as can social models of desired actions. For example, information on what others do or expect one to do, providing role models, and community approaches that promote behavior change from the bottom up can encourage pro-environmental actions19. Other interventions that utilize the social context are spreading awareness of environmental impacts through social media57, leveraging “social marketplaces” where people encourage each other in myriad ways58, or mobile app-based games to connect with communities59,60,61.

Information and education programs can complement and enhance the impact of regulatory and market-based measures by communicating the need for and the goals of these policies, and fostering understanding of their positive impacts18. For instance, explaining the rationale behind and positive impacts of carbon pricing can enhance public support and compliance with these measures. Hence, by integrating information campaigns with regulatory frameworks and market incentives, policymakers can reinforce the effectiveness of these policies, encouraging broader societal participation and support. Such integrative policies are likely to address multiple barriers to change, thereby catalyzing sustainable behavioral change.

Information and education campaigns can also support the introduction of cleaner technologies. For example, electric vehicles (EVs) illustrate how factors like drivetrain options, costs, and driving range can significantly influence consumer choices62. Awareness campaigns and educational efforts can play an essential role in disseminating information about these parameters, ensuring consumers can make informed decisions63. Additionally, marketing initiatives that highlight options like battery leasing for EVs can help inform consumers about ways to reduce upfront costs, thereby encouraging broader adoption64.

Table 5 presents the example of automobile CO2 emissions labeling and the potential consequences for each of the three Kaya identity factors.

Compensation and redistribution

A ‘just transition’ entails that climate change policies address the inequitable distribution of both the impacts of climate change and the costs and benefits of mitigation efforts. Marginalized and low-income populations — who are least responsible for past greenhouse gas emissions and have benefited the least from carbon-intensive economic development or decarbonization policies (such as subsidies or incentives mostly used by higher-income groups) — are often the most vulnerable to climate impacts and possess the fewest resources to adapt. It is also essential to consider the potential regressive effects of climate policies, particularly market-based instruments like carbon pricing, which can disproportionately burden low-income households and exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, possibly leading to social protest such as the Yellow Vests crisis studied by Chamorel65. The political economy of a ‘just transition’ is complex. It involves questions of recognition — ensuring that the concerns and identities of all social groups are acknowledged and respected — alongside procedural justice, which relates to fair and inclusive decision-making processes, and distributive justice, which concerns the fair allocation of resources and responsibilities. It also requires attention to distributional outcomes, meaning the actual, measurable impacts of climate policies on income, ethnicity, gender, and other forms of inequality, both within and across countries66,67. For instance, transition-related job losses (for example, from the closure of coal mines, fuel and gas plants) are likely to be concentrated in areas and social groups that already have been affected by deindustrialization and globalization68. Ethnic inequalities arise when large-scale renewable energy infrastructure projects (e.g., hydroelectricity) or forest protection initiatives lead to forcible relocation and the loss of traditional livelihoods67,69.

Addressing distributional justice toward a just transition requires appropriate measures of compensation and redistribution. For instance, in the case of market-based policies such as a carbon tax or a congestion toll, this would involve dedicating or earmarking revenues in ways that benefit ‘losers’ (for example, lump-sum transfers have been adopted for the federal carbon tax in Canada46). Other compensation schemes for climate policies include environmental tax reforms that reduce labor taxation, green deal plans (investments in areas of the green economy that could stimulate job creation), place-based policies (a local targeted version of green deal plans that focuses on spatial inequalities induced by the green transition), and progressive green subsidies (i.e., to remove financial constraints for the poor and accelerate the adoption of green technologies)70. Public support for these policies tends to increase when revenues are used in ways perceived as fair and beneficial—for example, through direct rebates to households, investments in public services, or targeted support for vulnerable groups, rather than across-the-board tax cuts or general budget spending71.

However, there are several challenges associated with direct refunds and compensations. First, it is challenging to determine adequate compensation since it requires quantifying exactly the benefits and losses at the individual level. For this reason, achieving a Pareto improvement (where no individual is worse off) is often considered a near impossibility by economists46. Another challenge is that refunding schemes may create undesirable incentive effects (e.g., users trying to overstate losses) and open the door for strategic behavior that undermines efficiency gains from the policy46. Finally, administrative and transaction costs could be prohibitive, but these can conceivably be minimized through technology.

Empirical evidence further supports the need to target high-income behavioral patterns. For example, private jet emissions from wealthy individuals increased by 46% from 2019 to 2023, totaling 15.6 MtCO2 annually72. More broadly, the wealthiest 10% globally are responsible for 36–45% of total greenhouse gas emissions, with transport-related affluence being a key driver73.

Note that fully addressing the questions of justice and power in the context of transport decarbonization requires a level of theoretical and empirical elaboration that goes beyond the scope of this paper. As noted in the introduction, our focus is on providing a methodological framework to support the design and evaluation of decarbonization policies, particularly by anticipating behavioral responses and assessing distributional outcomes. While we discuss compensation and redistribution mechanisms, a comprehensive integration of structural inequalities, power asymmetries, and procedural justice into the modeling framework would require additional components — such as participatory processes, institutional analysis, and governance modeling — which are not developed here.

Joint effect of policies

When policies are designed in isolation, without considering the presence of other instruments, they may create distortions or even undermine their own objectives. For example, implementing congestion pricing without investing in adequate public transport alternatives may disproportionately penalize certain groups and reduce overall policy effectiveness.

Synergies and trade-offs often arise across sectors. Consider the interaction between transportation and energy systems: road pricing policies designed to manage congestion can influence the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), thereby affecting electricity demand and grid operations. Conversely, dynamic energy pricing alters the relative cost of EV use compared to conventional vehicles, with direct implications for travel demand and mode choice. Designing an optimal joint pricing framework that accounts for both transport and energy sectors can unlock co-benefits such as reduced congestion, smoother demand on the grid, and improved environmental outcomes.

Managing joint effects also requires avoiding contradictions and overlaps. Uncoordinated regulations can create uncertainty, discourage compliance, or impose excessive burdens on stakeholders. Effective coordination across government levels and sectors, combined with early stakeholder engagement, is critical to ensure coherent and credible policy packages.

Revenue recycling is another lever to strengthen complementarities. Using proceeds from carbon pricing or environmental fines to support low-income households, invest in renewable energy, or expand public transport can enhance both fairness and political acceptance74. Similarly, targeted investment in charging infrastructure for underserved peri-urban and rural areas, or in multifamily residences where private charging is limited, can mitigate inequities. Without such targeting, EV subsidies combined with energy demand management policies may disproportionately benefit high-income households who can afford residential battery storage systems, thus widening gaps in energy costs and access.

In summary, addressing the joint effects of policies calls for a holistic approach that explicitly considers cross-sectoral dynamics, distributional impacts, and institutional coordination. Policy mixes are not the exception but the rule: effective decarbonization depends on packages of complementary instruments that balance efficiency, equity, and feasibility. The methodological framework developed in this paper is designed to capture such interactions by quantifying behavioral responses to multiple instruments applied jointly rather than in isolation. By fostering synergies and minimizing conflicts, integrated policy packages can deliver more effective, equitable, and durable pathways toward transport decarbonization.

Public acceptability

The extent to which options are evaluated (un)favorably by the public plays an essential role in the implementability of proposed policy measures. Hence, it is critical to understand which factors affect the acceptability of policies, as this provides important insights into which strategies could be implemented to address public concerns. Four factors appear to affect public acceptability of options: perceived costs and benefits of options, distributive fairness, procedural fairness, and trust in responsible actors.

First, acceptability is higher when people believe options have more positive and fewer negative effects for self, others, or the environment19. Because of this, policies ‘rewarding’ pro-environmental actions are more acceptable than policy ‘punishing’ actions that increase environmental problems. Pro-environmental options and policies are evaluated as more acceptable when people strongly value the well-being of other people and the environment, when they are more concerned about environmental problems, and when they feel more responsible and capable of helping reduce these problems, probably because this increases the likelihood that people recognize and value the environmental benefits of options and policies19. Further, the more people are aware of environmental problems, the more strongly they prefer governmental regulation and behavior change rather than free-market and technological solutions75. Acceptability can increase when people experience that an option or a policy has more positive effects than they expected, which suggests that effective policy trials or being able to try out an option can build public support for sustainable options and policy19.

Second, public acceptability depends on how the costs and benefits of options and policies are distributed across groups (i.e., distributive fairness): sustainable options and policies are more acceptable when their costs and benefits are distributed equally across groups, and when vulnerable groups, future generations, and nature and the environment are protected25. Distributive fairness can be enhanced by compensation schemes, for example, by offering additional benefits to people who would be negatively affected by the proposed changes. For example, public acceptability of pricing policies is higher when redistributing revenues toward those affected74, and when earmarking revenues for environmental purposes25,26,76.

Third, public acceptability of sustainable options and policy depends on which decision procedures were followed, as reflected in perceptions of procedural fairness. The implementation of sustainable options and policies is perceived as more fair and acceptable when transparent procedures have been followed, when the public or public society organizations could participate in the decision-making, and when people feel that their interests and concerns have been taken seriously25.

Fourth, public support is higher when individuals trust responsible parties19. Trust in responsible parties is important as the general public typically does not have sufficient expertise or the capacity to understand all aspects of options, and thus needs to rely on the expertise and good intentions of agents who are responsible for designing and implementing the options. Public acceptability appears to more strongly depend on trust in the integrity of responsible actors (i.e., whether they are believed to be transparent and honest) than on the perceived competence of responsible actors77.

Policies and Kaya identity

To conclude this section on policies, the following lists present a selection of climate mitigation policies categorized according to the three components of the Kaya identity applied to the transport sector. Each policy aims to reduce total CO2 emissions by targeting either the carbon intensity of energy use (CO2/E), the energy efficiency of transport activity (E/PKT), or the overall travel demand (PKT).

Revenue recycling to support users affected by behavioral regulations.

Electric vehicle cost-sharing (e.g., battery leasing) to broaden adoption.

The complexity of behavioral dimensions in response to climate change actions necessitates the design and development of decision-aid tools. These tools aim to assist policymakers in designing, optimizing, and anticipating the impacts of various measures. This section introduces a methodological framework for developing such tools that involves the collection of behavioral data and the design of a modeling framework.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the methodological framework integrates policy design, behavioral modeling, performance measurement, and optimization in a continuous, iterative process. This approach utilizes a diverse range of input data, including exogenous data such as energy prices and economic conditions78; behavioral data (including factors influencing behavior) collected through experiments and surveys (see “High-quality behavioral data” section); and a global typology of individuals and households representing different demographic, socio-economic, and geographic segments. This typology also represents the population of business establishments. Within such a typology, synthetic populations of individuals, households, and establishments with the same statistical properties of the actual populations can be created79,80.

Behavioral models and simulation

The role of behavioral models and simulations is to predict individual and group responses at a disaggregate level. These models can simulate various scenarios to understand potential outcomes of the policy measures. They generate various numerical indicators that characterize the behavioral responses for each of those scenarios.

Individuals make numerous choices that are relevant for analyzing decarbonization policies. These choices pertain to their activities, travels, and energy consumption, among others. Some decisions are long-term, such as house location, the type of heating system, or vehicle ownership, while others are short-term, like travel mode and destination for specific activities. These decisions may be modeled simultaneously, as proposed by Pougala et al.81, Pougala et al.82, and Rezvany et al.83, or they may be modeled sequentially (e.g., ref. 84). An example of a behavioral modeling and simulation platform for urban transportation that adopts a sequential approach is shown in Fig. 384.

In the same spirit, Knapen et al.85 use an activity-based micro-simulation that generates travel schedules and uses them to estimate EV charging demand profiles across time and space. Additional simulation models incorporate Land Use and Transport Interactions (LUTI) to examine the long-term impacts of policies40.

The behavioral dimensions explicitly represented include:

Individual characteristics: Measurable variables about each individual, including age, income, gender, or health status.

Latent Characteristics: Individual characteristics—such as perceived costs and benefits of options and policies, attitudes, social norms, values, perceptions, and emotions—play an important role in shaping behavior. These include factors like skepticism, denial, or guilt, as well as perceptions of inequity, moral licensing (e.g., “I am already doing enough”), or overconfidence (e.g., “technology will solve everything”).

Implicit Choice Set: Various types of constraints, including resource constraints (e.g., availability of vehicles in a household), regulatory constraints (e.g., some destinations cannot be reached by carbonized modes of transportation, or heating systems with strong GHG emissions are forbidden), and contextual constraints (e.g., extreme weather, floods, earthquakes).

Utility Functions: These combine all the above variables to characterize the preferences of individuals.

The behavioral models are typically grounded in random utility theory86, while the simulation environment captures and propagates uncertainty by combining causal models and simulating their distribution across agents and outcomes.

The raw output of the simulation is an empirical distribution of detailed schedules, where all modeled choices made by each (synthetic) individual/household and establishment are explicitly represented.

The use of disaggregate simulation tools poses several challenges:

Behavioral assumptions: The underlying assumptions of rational decision-making and stable preferences may not always hold under real-world conditions. The integration of latent variables enables the explicit representation of bounded rationality, social influence, and evolving social norms27,87.

Model calibration: Calibrating behavioral models is complex, particularly due to the high dimensionality of parameters and limited observability of preferences88. Bayesian methods offer increased flexibility in fusing diverse data sources and managing uncertainty89,90.

Model validation: Validating disaggregate models is equally demanding, often requiring rich, high-resolution behavioral data91. Modern sources such as mobile phone location data92 are proving increasingly valuable in this regard.

Computational complexity: Large-scale agent-based simulations and the incorporation of deep uncertainty place significant demands on computational resources. This has motivated the development of efficient formulations and surrogate models to reduce simulation time while preserving model fidelity93,94.

Data requirements: Developing detailed behavioral models—whether using simultaneous or sequential structures—requires disaggregate data on individual and household decision-making processes, as well as establishment-level behaviors. These data needs are discussed further in the next subsection.

High-quality behavioral data

Multiple sources of data, including surveys and big data, can and should be used to develop and inform the behavioral models described in our methodological framework. Naturally, each type of data has inherent advantages and limitations. As such, these sources are best used in combination with one another through data fusion approaches.

In the transport field, recall-based travel surveys, which for many years have been the key source of travel and activity behavioral data, are being replaced or supplemented with advanced approaches that combine mobile sensing, the use of contextual data sources, such as transit network, POI and land-use data, and machine learning computational/inference techniques to obtain more accurate, complete, and richer human mobility and activity information (see, for example, ref. 95). When combined with app- or web-based user interfaces that enable participants to view, edit, and verify their travel timelines as well as provide additional details about their trips and activities, the data obtained provides a full storyline of how, when, and why people travel. Such approaches are increasingly being applied in household travel surveys (e.g., ref. 96) and other research programs to provide a rich, contextual understanding of how people interact with their environment, their mobility and activity patterns, and lifestyle choices. These methods can also be used to obtain detailed behavioral data from business establishments providing passenger and freight transport (see, for example, ref. 97 and ref. 98). Without such detailed behavioral data, we could not develop the kinds of models that were described in the previous section.

As with other types of surveys, these data collection methods require recruitment of samples of individuals, households, or business establishments to participate. Participants must be willing to have their personal data (e.g., location data) collected. Data privacy regulations, designed to protect personal data, can be complex and strict, posing challenges for data controllers and processors administering the surveys. Due to cost and time constraints, data collection typically involves relatively small samples (at least as compared to big data) and, in the past, has only been done intermittently, every few or several years. In today’s rapidly changing world, longitudinal data collection, which tracks behavioral dynamics and the factors influencing them over time, is also essential for understanding how and why habits and preferences evolve, and some transportation agencies are moving toward developing more continuous data collection programs.

Transportation agencies are also exploring how big data can be used to model travel behavior. Big data comes from a range of sources, including mobile devices and apps, connected vehicles, transit smart cards, smart road sensors, and geo-tagged social media posts (e.g., ref. 99). With its voluminous datasets and longitudinal nature, big data can be invaluable in revealing patterns of behavior across a wide range of domains, especially travel and mobility. The ability to use big data to monitor what people do when conditions change, e.g., during the COVID pandemic, can be extremely informative in modeling behavior (e.g., ref. 100).

However, a deficiency of big data is that it lacks sufficient detail and is missing variables with explanatory power. This lack of context (e.g., ref. 101) can lead to erroneous assumptions when solely using these data for decision-making and policy design. Another aspect of big data’s “thinness” is that, as with all data distributions, it may have a tail with very few observations, e.g., people who use public transit in a car-dependent city. While sampling plans for travel surveys are typically designed with stratification and oversampling to ensure representation, it may not be possible to oversample certain types of observations with big data, for which datasets are automatically generated.

Survey and big data, as described above, are revealed preferences (RP), meaning data derived from observed or reported actual behaviors and only pertaining to existing situations or conditions. To develop and optimize solutions that do not currently exist or to study attributes that are not captured in big data, stated preferences (SP) data are also required. RP data can be leveraged to develop context-specific SP surveys to allow researchers to test consumer reactions to new solutions, scenarios, and policies in a more realistic, informed manner. This combination of revealed and stated preferences ensures that new initiatives are grounded in actual behavior patterns, increasing their likelihood of success. These enriched datasets enable the development of personalized solutions tailored to individual needs and behaviors (e.g., ref. 102). For example, individuals with high price sensitivity to a carbon tax are more likely to adopt public transportation or active mobility solutions. Such personalized treatments are essential to motivating individuals to switch to sustainable solutions (e.g., ref. 103).

Given the strengths and limitations inherent in each type of data, the greatest potential for improving our ability to understand and predict behavior lies in the integration of different types of data in modeling and simulation systems104. For example, big data has the potential to be enriched with context through fusion with mobile sensing-based survey data, and small samples of survey data can be expanded by its integration with big data. It is incumbent upon researchers to develop effective data fusion approaches to take maximum advantage of the wealth of data available to ensure the optimal design of policies and initiatives related to transport decarbonization.

Indicators

The generated schedules can then be used to measure a wide variety of key indicators. By predicting the decisions of each (synthetic) individual in the population, it becomes straightforward to aggregate individual indicators to obtain their population-level counterparts. For instance, emissions can be derived from travel choices and participation in certain activities. Individual well-being is measured by the utility function within the framework, alongside variables such as health status. Costs are directly derived from the expenses associated with each decision related to activity participation and travel.

Optimization

These indicators then feed into the optimization phase, where sophisticated optimization techniques are employed to adjust policies and better achieve desired outcomes. The goal is to reconfigure the policies based on the performance of the indicators to enhance their overall effectiveness. This process often involves multi-objective optimization, where improving one indicator may inadvertently deteriorate another (as illustrated by Fig. 1).

For instance, increasing subsidy levels for electric vehicles could significantly boost their adoption, reducing emissions and contributing to environmental goals. However, this might also lead to increased government expenditure, affecting budget constraints and potentially limiting funds available for other crucial sectors like healthcare or education. Similarly, policies aimed at enhancing individual well-being through increased access to recreational activities might lead to higher emissions due to increased travel.

Balancing these competing objectives requires a careful and strategic approach. The concept of “Pareto optimality” can be employed to identify solutions that offer the best possible trade-offs between conflicting objectives. This concept is grounded in the principle of dominance. A policy P1 is said to dominate a policy P2 if no indicator associated with P1 is worse than the corresponding indicator for P2, and at least one indicator of P1 is strictly better than the corresponding indicator for P2. A policy is considered Pareto optimal if it is not dominated by any feasible solution.

Once policymakers are presented with the set of Pareto optimal solutions, they can evaluate the relative importance of each indicator and make informed decisions that align with broader societal goals. This approach contrasts with single-objective optimization, where the relative importance of each indicator must be established before any analysis, often in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner. Thanks to the multi-objective approach and the a posteriori weighting, the trade-offs are more transparent, allowing for a clearer understanding of the implications of each decision.

Policy measures

Policy measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions encompass strategies such as carbon pricing, subsidies for renewable energy, emission regulations, and infrastructure investments.

For example, implementing a carbon tax to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is a prevalent policy approach.

In our methodological framework, each measure can affect various factors:

The value of variables in the utility function: For instance, a carbon tax increases the monetary cost of several options, altering the utility associated with different choices.

The set of constraints individuals face: For example, a policy restricting access to city centers for carbon-emitting transportation modes would influence the selection of destinations for certain activities.

Subjective aspects influencing decisions: For instance, a policy that includes transparent communication about the redistribution of carbon tax revenue might alter the public perception of the tax’s equity.

The whole process is iterative and dynamic, continuously refining policies based on real-time data and feedback. By leveraging these techniques, it is possible to create a balanced policy framework that maximizes overall benefits while minimizing negative impacts, ensuring a sustainable and equitable approach to societal development.

To illustrate, consider the implementation of a congestion charge in a city. The policy is first modeled to simulate commuter responses using travel survey data. The indicators monitored might include traffic volumes, emissions levels, public transport usage, and economic impacts on commuters. Optimization could involve adjusting the congestion charge rates and timings based on these indicators to balance traffic reduction with economic fairness. Throughout this process, inputs such as fuel prices, public transport availability, and travel patterns from GPS data are utilized, along with synthetic populations representing different commuter types.

By using this comprehensive framework, policymakers can design, test, implement, and refine decarbonization strategies effectively, ensuring they are both efficient and equitable.

Scientific challenges

The design, implementation, and application of such a framework are particularly challenging. We briefly discuss some of those challenges.

Deep Uncertainty: One of the primary methodological challenges in developing decarbonization policies is dealing with deep uncertainty. This refers to situations where the probabilities of future events are unknown, and the possible outcomes are numerous and varied. Traditional scenario planning, which involves creating a limited set of detailed scenarios, may not be sufficient to capture the full range of uncertainties. Scenario discovery, on the other hand, uses data-driven techniques to identify and explore a broader array of possible futures. For example, rather than just planning for best-case and worst-case scenarios, scenario discovery might reveal a spectrum of outcomes based on different combinations of policy measures, technological advancements, and societal behaviors105,106.

Disaggregate Policy-Sensitive Models: Another critical issue is the development of disaggregate policy-sensitive models that can accurately capture the causality of human activities. These models focus on individual or household-level behaviors and decisions, providing a granular understanding of how people respond to specific policies. There is a long tradition of such models in travel demand analysis107, where disaggregate choice models108 are used in micro-simulation tools109,110.

Multi-Scale Models: The integration of models across multiple scales is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the broader impacts of various policies. Multi-scale models synthesize data and insights from microscopic (individual or household level), mesoscopic (community or regional level), and macroscopic (national or global level) scales111,112. By leveraging these different scales, researchers can perform an in-depth analysis of how local actions accumulate to influence broader trends. For instance, a multi-scale model might combine local traffic data113 with regional air quality models114 and detailed time use data115.

Scalability: Scalability poses a significant methodological challenge: how to effectively apply microscopic models on a global scale116. Although microscopic models offer detailed insights, they are often computationally intensive and require vast amounts of data. Scaling these models globally necessitates innovative approaches, such as employing representative samples, leveraging parallel computing, and utilizing machine learning techniques. For instance, scaling an urban transportation model globally might involve selecting representative cities from various regions and extrapolating the results while considering regional differences in behavior and infrastructure.

Propagation of uncertainty: The primary role of simulation is to represent the propagation of uncertainty through complex systems. This involves generating empirical realizations of complex random variables, which are often defined on combinatorially intricate state spaces. Advanced techniques, such as variance reduction methods117 and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods118,119, can be particularly effective in this context.

The proposed framework is merely a high-level preliminary concept, and the list of challenges it presents is certainly much longer and more complex than outlined above.

In particular, future work should explore how such behavioral models can be embedded within broader governance frameworks. Rather than treating policies as isolated instruments, there is a need to model coordinated policy packages that align fiscal tools, regulatory mechanisms, and spatial accessibility measures into a cohesive system120. Embedding the agent-based simulation framework within participatory or adaptive governance is an important research avenue.

This research direction requires an interdisciplinary approach, involving collaboration among engineers, economists, computer scientists, psychologists, political scientists, climate experts, and other specialists. The richness of this field ensures it will fill the research agendas of numerous research teams.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44333-025-00075-z/MediaObjects/44333_2025_75_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-20 13:57:00.986154

The report also estimates that combined production capacity for renewable diesel and SAF could rise to more than 67 million tonnes a year by 2036, as both fuels rely on similar processing methods, reports AIN.

The study said last year marked an important turning point for SAF, with the introduction of mandatory usage rules in both the UK and the European Union. These measures have created guaranteed demand for the fuel. Report author Eve Pope said demand is expected to keep increasing as more rules aimed at cutting emissions are introduced.

While there are close to a dozen approved ways to produce SAF, most current supply comes from a process that uses used cooking oil, animal fats and grease as raw materials. However, the availability of these inputs is limited. Pope said demand for SAF is likely to exceed the supply of these materials by around 2030.

To address this gap, newer production methods such as alcohol-based conversion and synthetic SAF are expected to play a larger role. Some facilities using these approaches have already started operations. One such plant, LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines facility in Georgia, began production last year and has the capacity to make about 9 million gallons of SAF annually. It is the first facility of its kind to produce SAF on a commercial scale using this method.

The transport industry is a large adopter of clean energy technologies, largely due to the expectations of lowering carbon footprints and the desire to realize sustainability targets. Solar canopy charging, hydrogen generator charging, and airborne wind energy charging are all avenues explored by IDTechEx as a means of powering electric vehicles away from grid access. IDTechEx's report, ""Off-Grid Charging For Electric Vehicles 2024-2034: Technologies, Benchmarking, Players and Forecasts"", covers different off-grid EV charging methods, and provides forecasts for their uptake over the next ten years.

Solar canopy charging carports that are completely independent from the grid could see cars charging simply from being parked underneath solar panels and plugged into a charging outlet. Labelled as the fastest growing source of renewable energy by IDTechEx, solar power can provide cheaper means of generating energy, especially when compared to fossil fuel projects.

'Top-up charging', where drivers can recharge little and often, may suit electric vehicles better, as they never have to worry about running too low and struggling to source power. Issues surrounding energy storage and intermittency may arise with solar canopy chargers, which without grid stability, may prove difficult to abate. However, when used mostly as a charge boost, solar canopy charging offers an environmentally friendly and smart way to keep vehicles energized.

Wind power, though also a promising means of renewable energy, is currently too expensive and large to feasibly use for electric vehicle charging, according to IDTechEx. However, airborne wind energy (AWE) could be a loophole, which sees a tether-based device being able to harness power from high-altitude winds, while incurring less material costs. AWE can also provide more consistency when compared to solar, given its ability to work even in the dark, and increasing the surface area of the device could increase power generation without affecting the ground footprint.

Hydrogen for land and sky transportation

Hydrogen could provide a means of charging up battery electric vehicles, as opposed to fuel-cell electric vehicles, by having external fuel cells produce electricity from outside of the vehicle. Hydrogen chargers could have an integrated battery, but also rely on stored, compressed hydrogen as energy storage. While this could provide a solution to off-grid or temporary power situations, IDTechEx states that the costs of hydrogen charging, especially when using green hydrogen to maximize sustainability, would be very high. However, as renewable energy costs decrease as they become more widely available, hydrogen charging could see a noticeable uptake.

Hydrogen planes could be a new means of travel in the future, with the only emission produced in-flight being water vapour, and would be a great development for the environment and reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Liquid hydrogen fuel cell planes could have between 30 and 40% of the range of a jet fuel plane, which could mean a travel range of several thousand kilometers is possible. This would be ideal for shorter journeys of under 2,000km, which is where over 50% of travel demand lies by seats, according to IDTechEx. The report, ""Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts"", covers different ways to decarbonize the air travel sector, including the introduction of battery-powered planes and the implementation of sustainable aviation fuel.

The creation of green hydrogen with electrolysis

With the expansion of hydrogen applications in line with increasing decarbonization efforts, green hydrogen in particular is drawing attention as being the most environmentally beneficial in its use. Green hydrogen is produced with water electrolysis, with many different electrolyzer types on the market, each with their own benefits.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, for example, can offer more compact system designs and much smaller footprints when compared with alkaline systems. PEMELs high power densities are as a result of their solid proton exchange membrane, and they are a popular commercial option for producing green hydrogen with advancing technologies being developed. Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolyzers operate at the lowest voltage range and therefore can be considered one of the most efficient technologies. This is possible as a result of leveraging high temperatures and enabling favorable thermodynamics, according to IDTechEx. More types of electrolyzers used to produce green hydrogen, and their best suited applications, are covered in detail in IDTechEx's report, ""Materials for Green Hydrogen Production 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"".

Turning hydrogen into electricity

Fuel cells operate with the input of hydrogen fuel and an oxygen source which undergo a chemical reaction that results in the generation of electricity to power an external load, alongside water and heat. Stationary fuel cells refer to this process occurring in a fixed place, either permanently or semi-permanently, and are usually operating within a fuel cell stack as part of a larger system.

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are more favoured within stationary applications including industrial power and commercial operations, for continuous generation. Other types such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are more desired within mobile applications such as in the transport sector and are also becoming contenders for back-up power generation in the replacement of diesel generators.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/windfarm.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:57:11.671256

NEG8 has signed a deal with Kilkenny- and Cork-based engineering firm Prochem Engineering to deliver the project.

Sorbent technology

NEG8’s electrostatic DAC system draws ambient air through the unit using large fans, passing it over a solid sorbent material that attracts and captures CO2 through electrostatic interactions.

When the sorbent is heated, the concentrated CO2 is released and can be permanently stored underground or used in products such as concrete or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

NEG8 says the technology is based on modular, scalable “plug-and-play” units designed for deployment in larger capture installations.

DAC in the UK

Last year, NEG8 joined a project to develop large-scale electro-SAF (eSAF) in the UK, supported by a £1m (US$1.3m) investment.

The project aims to combine CO2 captured using DAC with hydrogen and nuclear-generated electricity to create eSAF, which is expected to cut lifecycle emissions by around 90% compared with conventional jet fuel.

To date, NEG8 has validated its technology through a pilot system that has captured 1.2 t/y of CO2. The company expects its scaled demonstration unit to be tested later this year.

John Breen, CTO of NEG8, said: “The 50 t/y unit will serve to validate NEG8’s system as a leading engineered carbon capture technology that will support industries and governments in their drive to net zero and beyond to negative carbon emissions.”",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/23331/neg8-carbon-direct-air-capture-prochempng.jpg?width=960,N,,2026-01-20 12:59:01.696274

Renewable diesel behaves like diesel because, at a molecular level, it largely is diesel.
Why aviation is driving the shift to drop-in fuels Aviation has become the clearest test case for why drop-in fuels matter.","For many Australians, biofuels still mean ethanol blends like E10. They are associated with fuel compatibility warnings, modest emissions gains, and a technology that never quite lived up to early expectations. That legacy has shaped how biofuels are perceived, and it explains why they quietly fell out of favour while solar and wind surged ahead.

What is now attracting serious attention from policymakers and investors is something different. The focus is now on drop-in fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. They are designed to replace fossil fuels directly and can be used in existing engines, stored in existing tanks, and moved through existing fuel infrastructure without modification.

As the country looks to cut emissions in sectors where electrification is challenging or impractical, the conversation around biofuels is about fuels that can decarbonise aviation, freight, and heavy industry using the systems already in place.

What “drop-in fuel” actually means

A drop-in fuel is designed to behave chemically like a conventional fossil fuel. That means it can be used as a direct substitute without requiring changes to engines, vehicles, storage tanks, or distribution infrastructure.

In practical terms, drop-in fuels can flow through the same pipelines, sit in the same depots, and power the same equipment that currently relies on diesel or jet fuel. There is no need for fleet upgrades, new refuelling systems, or changes in how fuel is handled. For industries that operate at scale, this compatibility is critical.

This is where drop-in fuels differ fundamentally from earlier biofuels. Ethanol and biodiesel are blends, limited by engine tolerances and fuel standards.

On the other hand, drop-in fuels are replacements. They are designed to slot into the existing fuel system and reduce emissions without requiring a parallel energy network to be built from scratch.

That ability to work inside the system Australia already has is what makes drop-in fuels attractive to governments, airlines, freight operators, and heavy industry.

Why ethanol stalled and why that still shapes the debate

Ethanol was Australia’s first large-scale experiment with biofuels, and its limitations left a lasting impression. As a blended fuel, ethanol could only be used in low percentages without affecting engine performance or fuel economy. Many vehicles were not compatible beyond E10, and even then, drivers often reported higher consumption, which undercut the perceived benefits.

Since ethanol relied on blending rather than replacement, it never moved beyond the margins of the fuel market. It also became linked with concerns about land use and food crops, reinforcing scepticism about whether biofuels could scale sustainably.

That experience matters today because it still shapes public perception. For many people, “biofuel” is synonymous with compromise: reduced range, compatibility warnings, and modest emissions gains. The current generation of biofuels is working against that legacy.

Understanding why ethanol failed to gain traction helps explain why policymakers are now focusing on drop-in fuels. It’s about moving away from blends altogether and toward fuels that behave like the fossil fuels they are intended to replace.

Renewable diesel is NOT biodiesel

One of the biggest sources of confusion in biofuel discussions is the assumption that renewable diesel and biodiesel are the same thing. No, they are not.

The difference between the two explains why renewable diesel is now being treated as strategic infrastructure rather than a niche alternative fuel.

Biodiesel is produced through a chemical process called transesterification. The resulting file has different properties from fossil diesel, which limits how much can be blended without affecting engine performance. Cold-weather issues, storage stability, and material compatibility have all constrained its use, particularly in heavy-duty applications.

Renewable diesel is produced using a different process, typically hydro treatment, which removes oxygen from the feedstock and creates a fuel that is chemically very close to conventional diesel. The end product meets the same fuel specifications and can be used at 100% without blending limits or engine modifications.

For fleet operators, mining companies, and generators, that distinction is critical. Renewable diesel behaves like diesel because, at a molecular level, it largely is diesel. That is why it is being prioritised in policy settings and why it features prominently in Australia’s emerging low-carbon liquid fuels strategy.

Why aviation is driving the shift to drop-in fuels

Aviation has become the clearest test case for why drop-in fuels matter. Unlike road transport, long-haul aviation has no realistic pathway to electrification at scale. Battery weight, energy density, and range limitations make electric aircraft impractical beyond short regional routers, while hydrogen remains technically complex and commercially uncertain for mainstream use.

Sustainable aviation fuel addressed that gap. SAF can be blended with, and increasingly replace, conventional jet fuel while meeting strict safety and performance standards. It allows airlines to reduce emissions without redesigning aircraft, retraining crews, or rebuilding airport infrastructure.

This is why aviation policy has become a major driver of biofuel investment globally and in Australia. Airlines, airports, and governments all face pressure to cut emissions, but few alternatives exist that can deliver reductions in the near to medium term. Drop-in fuels offer a way to decarbonise aviation using the fleet and infrastructure already in operation, which makes them uniquely attractive in a sector with limited technological flexibility.

The growing focus on SAF also helps explain why biofuels are now being discussed as part of national fuel security and industrial strategy, rather than as a consumer fuel option.

Why Australia is backing drop-in fuels now

Australia’s renewed interest in biofuels is less about rediscovering an old technology and more about solving problems that other renewables cannot. As emissions targets tighten, gaps are becoming harder to ignore in sectors that depend on liquid fuels and cannot easily electrify.

This is the context behind the federal government’s decision to commit $1.1 billion to low-carbon liquid fuels through a new long-term Clean Fuels program. The focus on renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel reflects a preference for technologies that can reduce emissions without requiring a wholesale rebuild or transport and industrial systems.

Policy attention has also changed toward domestic production and supply chains. Australia imports the vast majority of its refined fuels, leaving aviation, freight, and critical industries exposed to global disruptions. Supporting onshore production of drop-in fuels is increasingly being framed as an issue of energy security as well as decarbonisation.

That framing is reinforced by estimates from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which suggests a domestic low-carbon fuels industry could be worth tens of billions of dollars by mid-century. While that figure reflects long-term potential rather than guaranteed outcomes, it indicates why governments are willing to support infrastructure and investment now.

These factors explain why Australia’s biofuel conversation has moved away from consumer blends and toward fuels that can integrate seamlessly into existing systems. The priority is scale, reliability, and strategic value.

What this means in practice

It is tempting to treat renewed interest in biofuels as a sign Aussies will soon be filling up with “green petrol.” That is unlikely to be the main story. Drop-in fuels are being prioritised because they can cut emissions in parts of the economy where electricity has limitations.

What this likely means in the near term is more change behind the scenes than at the bowser. The early demand for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel is expected to come from sectors where fuel use is concentrated, and purchasing decisions are made at scale:

Aviation: blending SAF into jet fuel supplies at major airports

Freight and logistics: Decarbonising heavy vehicles where charging downtime and payload impacts are costly

Mining and remote operations: reducing diesel reliance without rebuilding entire fleets

Backup generation and industrial uses: Lowering emissions where electrification is technically difficult

For most households, the impact is more indirect. If domestic production expands, it could influence fuel supply resilience and, over time, reduce exposure to imported refined fuel volatility. But it is not a quick switch, and it does not replace the economics that have made solar and wind dominant in the electricity sector.

The key takeaway is that drop-in fuels are being treated as a complementary solution. Solar, wind, batteries, and electrification will continue to do the heavy lifting wherever electricity can replace combustion. Drop-in fuels are being positioned to cover what is left: the parts of the economy that still need liquid energy, delivered in a form of existing machines can use.

Why this change matters beyond biofuels

The renewed focus on drop-in fuels highlights a broader shift in how the country is approaching the energy transition. Early efforts prioritised sectors that were easiest to electrify, particularly electricity generation and passenger vehicles. As those pathways mature, attention is turning to the harder problems that remain.

Drop-in fuels sit in that space. They acknowledge that not every part of the economy can move to electricity quickly or cheaply, and that reducing emissions will require multiple technologies working together. This is now more about making the overall system workable.

For policymakers, that means designing energy policy around outcomes. For the industry, it means decarbonisation does not always require reinvention. And for the country, it indicates a move toward treating energy transition as an exercise in systems integration.

That context helps explain why biofuels are re-entering the conversation now, and why the emphasis is firmly on drop-in fuels that fit within the infrastructure the country relies on.

A different role to solar and wind

It is easy to frame biofuels as competitors to solar and wind, but that comparison misses the point. Drop-in fuels are being developed to solve a different problem. Solar and wind generate electricity. Drop-in fuels provide liquid energy where electricity cannot yet be substituted reliably.

This is why the two are advancing in parallel rather than in opposition. Rooftop solar, large-scale wind, and batteries will continue to dominate electricity supply and light transport. Drop-in fuels are being positioned to support aviation, heavy freight, industrial heat, and remote operations that still depend on high-energy-density liquids.

Seen this way, the renewed focus on renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel does not signal a shift away from electrification. It reflects a more complete approach to decarbonisation, one that accepts that different parts of the economy require different solutions.

“The EU’s Hydrogen Mechanism is a new, innovative tool to help develop the market. With strong interest shown from suppliers across Europe and beyond, the initiative is off to a very promising start. I invite European buyers to now seize this opportunity and connect with potential suppliers. The Hydrogen Mechanism is one of the instruments which will help us to make our energy system cleaner, more secure and more affordable.”

Background

The Regulation on the internal markets for renewable gas, natural gas and hydrogen (EU/2024/1789) mandates the Commission to set up and operate a mechanism under the European Hydrogen Bank to develop the hydrogen market for a limited period until the end of 2029.

On 2 July 2025, the Commission launched the new EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform to empower European companies to procure energy-related products in a coordinated and effective way.

It offers solutions to collect demand and supply offers from companies and provide aggregation and match-making services, connecting suppliers with buyers. It can result in joint purchasing for a wide range of energy-related products as well as strategic raw materials.

The Hydrogen Mechanism is the first mechanism launched under the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform.

Unlike many regions facing land constraints and grid congestion, MENA can deploy renewables at scale and co-locate projects with industrial hubs, export terminals and aviation infrastructure.
Situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa, MENA already hosts some of the world’s busiest aviation hubs.

While SAF production is currently concentrated in Europe and North America, the paper argues that MENA has a unique opportunity to scale both biobased and synthetic fuels at pace, driven by abundant renewable energy, established hydrocarbon infrastructure and strong domestic aviation demand.

A central pillar of this potential lies in synthetic SAF, produced via power-to-liquids (PtL) pathways using green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide. The region benefits from some of the world’s highest solar irradiation levels and growing wind capacity, enabling access to low-cost renewable electricity. This, combined with large-scale electrolysers and emerging carbon capture infrastructure, positions Gulf states in particular as highly competitive producers of e-SAF.

Unlike many regions facing land constraints and grid congestion, MENA can deploy renewables at scale and co-locate projects with industrial hubs, export terminals and aviation infrastructure. The paper highlights that existing refining, storage and pipeline assets can be repurposed for SAF, reducing costs and shortening project timelines.

The report also challenges assumptions that the region lacks viable biobased feedstocks. Urban waste, used cooking oil, animal fats and agricultural residues are identified as underutilised resources, particularly in Egypt and Turkey. In addition, desert-adapted biomass such as algae, halophytes and wastewater-grown crops could provide non-competitive feedstock options suited to arid climates.

Geography is another strategic advantage. Situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa, MENA already hosts some of the world’s busiest aviation hubs. Short shipping distances, established fuel trading ecosystems and high volumes of long-haul refuelling make the region well placed to become a global SAF bunkering and export centre as international mandates tighten.

Policy alignment and access to sovereign capital further strengthen the region’s position. Several governments have adopted net-zero targets, hydrogen strategies and state-backed aviation offtake, creating conditions for large-scale investment and accelerated deployment.

The white paper concludes that SAF leadership will be determined not by technology alone, but by scale, cost and speed. With rising global demand and regulatory pressure, the question is no longer whether MENA can play a major role in aviation decarbonisation, but how quickly it chooses to do so.",https://technicalreviewmiddleeast.com/,N,,2026-01-20 12:59:13.509847

The facility is designed to supply SAF-ready renewable fuel intermediates to refiners and SAF aggregators seeking compliant, scalable feedstock solutions.

The Malaysia SAF feedstock initiative will be executed through UMeWorld’s newly formed Malaysian subsidiary, Verdant Sustainable Fuel Sdn. Bhd., which was incorporated on January 16, 2026, and will manage project development, construction, and commercial operations.

Addressing the Global SAF Feedstock Constraint

The global aviation industry faces a structural constraint in scaling SAF: the limited availability of qualified, low-carbon waste-based feedstocks that can be efficiently processed by existing refinery infrastructure. Many refineries encounter technical and economic challenges when handling high-acidity and impurity-rich waste oils such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) and used cooking oil (UCO), which can degrade conventional catalysts and increase operating costs. UMeWorld’s Malaysia platform is designed to address this constraint by converting difficult-to-process waste lipids into specification-driven renewable fuel intermediates. These intermediates are intended to integrate with existing hydroprocessing and SAF upgrading units, reducing the need for costly refinery modifications and expanding the pool of usable waste-based feedstocks.

Technology-Enabled Commercial Advantage

UMeWorld’s Malaysia platform is built around a technology-enabled conversion process designed to expand the usable universe of waste-based feedstocks for renewable fuel production. Unlike conventional processing approaches that struggle with high-acidity and impurity-rich inputs, the platform is engineered to consistently upgrade challenging waste lipids into renewable fuel intermediates compatible with existing refinery systems. The conversion process is designed to operate under lower-severity conditions than conventional chemical refining approaches, improving feedstock tolerance, reducing degradation risk, and enabling more efficient downstream integration.

This technology advantage delivers tangible commercial benefits for fuel offtakers:

Broader feedstock access: Enables utilization of waste streams typically constrained or excluded by traditional refining processes

Infrastructure compatibility: Produces intermediates designed to integrate with existing hydroprocessing and SAF upgrading units

Improved economics: Supports competitive pricing by reducing feedstock constraints and downstream processing complexity

“The SAF market does not face a demand problem - it faces a feedstock and economics problem,” said Michael Lee, Chief Executive Officer of UMeWorld. “Our Malaysia platform is designed to unlock underutilized waste feedstocks and convert them into intermediates that refineries can actually use, while maintaining disciplined and predictable economics. That combination is essential for SAF to scale sustainably.”

Facility Execution and Timeline

The Malaysia SAF feedstock facility is engineered to meet European Union ReFuelEU Aviation carbon-intensity thresholds and is planned with an initial nameplate capacity of approximately 10,000 metric tonnes per year. The plant architecture emphasizes modularity, enabling future expansion and replication. Key execution milestones include:

Operating entity in place: Verdant Sustainable Fuel Sdn. Bhd. incorporated January 16, 2026

Site selection underway: Final site selection targeted within the next 90 days, prioritizing feedstock density, logistics access, and port connectivity

Construction timeline: Subject to site finalization and permitting progression, initial construction activities expected to commence later in 2026

Strategic Outlook

Britain’s transport minister Heidi Alexander approved the opening of a second runway in September, hoping that converting a back-up runway into one that is fully operational will allow thousands of extra ‌flights and drive economic growth.

But campaign ‌group Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions, or CAGNE, said officials who approved the expansion of the airport, situated 30 miles (48 km) south of London, had failed to properly assess ​its impact on Britain’s climate change goals.

The government has said the increasing use of sustainable aviation fuel ‍means airport enlargements are not ​incompatible with its net-zero targets. It has ​therefore backed a new runway at Heathrow, the country’s ‍biggest hub, and at Gatwick.

Airports have struggled to expand in the densely populated southeast England in recent decades, encountering opposition from communities worried about noise and pollution. An earlier plan to build a new runway ‍at Heathrow was scrapped in 2010.

The plan at Gatwick involves moving the backup runway by 12 metres (39 feet) to meet ‍safety standards ‍for both runways to operate and ​allow for millions of new passengers by ​the ⁠2030s, boosting trade and tourism and creating ‌14,000 jobs.

CAGNE says that the harm the expansion will cause to local communities will far outweigh the economic benefits.

A judgment is expected at a later date. Gatwick is 50.01% owned by France’s VINCI Airports.

Researchers in Australia are exploring sugarcane as a leading source of renewable carbon for sustainable aviation fuel to replace fossil-based alternatives without compromising food security or biodiversity.

At the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, scientists are collaborating with global technology partners to develop economically viable, large-scale renewable fuel production.

Emeritus Professor Robert Henry of the University of Queensland highlighted sugarcane as the most promising crop due to its high productivity and ability to be grown on a relatively small land area, offering a smaller environmental footprint than alternatives.

Other potential sources such as algae face economic and scalability challenges, while crops like canola would require vast areas of land, raising food security concerns and limiting feasibility.

The research focuses on increasing the proportion of plant biomass convertible to fuel while maintaining yield. Scientists are using rice as a model system to identify genetic changes, which are then tested in sorghum, sugarcane’s closest relative, before being applied to sugarcane itself.

This tiered approach allows the team to optimize genetic modifications efficiently, saving time and resources, and improving the likelihood of successful implementation in sugarcane.

Australia, particularly Queensland, is well-positioned for this transformation, thanks to an established sugarcane industry, strong research infrastructure, and global partnerships to accelerate innovation.

The domestic demand for sustainable aviation fuel is significant, as Australians have one of the highest per-capita air travel rates globally, which could also encourage international adoption if commercial production succeeds.

The Hub’s efforts aim to reduce production costs while ensuring fuel is scalable, economically viable, and environmentally sustainable.

By breeding crops with high convertible biomass, researchers hope to provide a renewable, low-carbon alternative for the aviation industry and reduce the sector’s dependence on fossil fuels.

Success in this initiative could transform sugarcane into a global model for renewable fuel production, offering solutions for both climate mitigation and industrial-scale biofuel demands.

The project underscores the importance of combining plant science, biotechnology, and sustainable agriculture to tackle climate change challenges while supporting food and energy security.

Through strategic crop engineering and innovative biomass management, sugarcane may become a cornerstone in the future of sustainable aviation fuel worldwide.",https://naturenews.africa/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1331.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 10:59:28.338603

IDTechEx explores solar canopy charging, hydrogen generator charging, and airborne wind energy charging as avenues for powering electric vehicles without grid access

IDTechEx’s report, ‘Off-grid charging for electric vehicles 2024-2034: technologies, benchmarking, players, and forecasts’, explores different off-grid EV charging methods and provides a forecast for their uptake over the next decade.

Solar canopy charging carports that are independent of the grid could allow cars to be charged by parking under solar panels and plugging into a charging outlet. IDTechEx has called Solar canopy charging the ‘fastest-growing’ source of renewable energy.

‘Top-up charging’ enables drivers to recharge little and often, which is suitable for electric vehicles because they don't have to worry about running too low or struggling to source power. Issues around energy storage and intermittency may arise with solar canopy chargers, which, without grid stability, could be difficult to abate. However, when primarily used as a charge boost, solar canopy charging offers an environmentally friendly way to keep vehicles charged.

Wind power is currently too expensive and large to utilise for EV charging, according to IDTechEx. However, airborne wind energy (AWE) could be a loophole, involving a tether-based device that harnesses power from high-altitude winds at lower material costs. AWE also provides greater consistency than solar, due to its ability to operate even in the dark, and increasing the device’s surface area could boost power generation without increasing the ground footprint.

Hydrogen for transportation

Hydrogen could provide a means of charging battery-electric vehicles by using external fuel cells to generate electricity outside the vehicle. Hydrogen chargers could have an integrated battery, but also rely on stored, compressed hydrogen as energy storage.

While this could be a solution to off-grid or temporary power situations, IDTechEx has reported that the costs of hydrogen charging would be very high, especially when using green hydrogen. However, as renewable energy costs decrease as they become more widely available, hydrogen charging could see increased uptake.

Hydrogen planes could become a new means of travel, with the only emission produced in-flight being water vapour; it would help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel. Liquid hydrogen fuel cell planes could have between 30 to 40% of the range of a jet fuel plane, meaning a travel range of several thousand kilometers is possible, making it an ideal solution for shorter journeys under 2,000km, which accounts for over 50% of travel demand by seats, according to IDTechEx.

IDTechEx’s report, ‘Sustainable future aviation 2025-2045: trends, technologies, forecasts’, explores ways to decarbonise air travel, including the introduction of battery-powered planes and the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

Creating green hydrogen with electrolysis

As hydrogen applications expand in line with decarbonisation efforts, green hydrogen in particular is attracting attention as the most environmentally beneficial. Green hydrogen is produced with water electrolysis, with different electrolyser types on the market, each with its own benefits.

For example, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers can offer more compact system designs and smaller footprints than alkaline systems. PEMELs' high power densities result from their solid proton-exchange membranes, and they are a popular commercial option for producing green hydrogen, with advancing technologies being developed.

Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolysers operate at the lowest voltages and can therefore be considered among the most efficient technologies. This is possible by leveraging high temperatures and favourable thermodynamics, according to IDTechEx.

In IDTechEx’s report, ‘Materials for green hydrogen production 2026-2036: technologies, players, forecasts’, more electrolysers used to produce green hydrogen, and their best-suited applications, are covered.

Turning hydrogen into electricity

Fuel cells operate with hydrogen fuel and an oxygen source, which undergo a chemical reaction that generates electricity to power an external load, along with water and heat. Stationary fuel cells refer to processes that occur in a fixed location, permanently or semi-permanently, and are usually operated within a fuel stack as part of a larger system.

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are more favoured within stationary applications, including industrial power and commercial operations, for continuous generation. Other types, such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), are more desirable for mobile applications and are becoming contenders for backup power generation in replacing diesel generators.

The implementation of fuel cells as a means of providing large-scale renewable energy could provide relief for continuous applications, such as data centres. The sustainability promises this means of generating electricity can fulfil, especially with the use of green hydrogen in the future, will also contribute to decarbonisation efforts within the energy sector.",,N,,2026-01-20 07:57:47.852629

But campaign group Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions, or CAGNE, said officials who approved the expansion of the airport, situated 30 miles (48 km) south of London, had failed to properly assess its impact on Britain's climate change goals.

The government has said the increasing use of sustainable aviation fuel means airport enlargements are not incompatible with its net-zero targets. It has therefore backed a new runway at Heathrow, the country's biggest hub, and at Gatwick.

Airports have struggled to expand in the densely populated southeast England in recent decades, encountering opposition from communities worried about noise and pollution. An earlier plan to build a new runway at Heathrow was scrapped in 2010.

The plan at Gatwick involves moving the backup runway by 12 metres (39 feet) to meet safety standards for both runways to operate and allow for millions of new passengers by the 2030s, boosting trade and tourism and creating 14,000 jobs.

CAGNE says that the harm the expansion will cause to local communities will far outweigh the economic benefits.

A judgment is expected at a later date. Gatwick is 50.01% owned by France's VINCI Airports.

So far, only computer simulation and modeling has been performed to validate BYA-1’s aerodynamic design.
The wind tunnel tests used a 1:8 scale model and generated more than 60,000 data points.
Delphine Bonnaud, head of aerodynamics at Beyond Aero said, “The development of a hydrogen-electric aircraft requires precise aerodynamic design.","Beyond Aero has completed its first wind tunnel test campaign, validating key aerodynamic aspects of its hydrogen-fueled business jet.

The Toulouse, France-based startup is developing its six-passenger BYA-1 hydrogen-electric CS23 light jet to enter service by 2030. The aircraft has a planned range of 1,500km (930 miles) and a cruise speed of 573 km/h (356mph).

The BYA-1 aircraft uses a low-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack with a capacity of 2.4MW to power two electric engines. Gaseous hydrogenwill be stored at 700-bar in tanks integrated within the wingbox structure.

Wind tunnel test campaign

The test campaign was conducted over five weeks during autumn 2025 at the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) Low-Speed Facility (LST) in Marknesse, Holland.

The test campaign focused on validating the aerodynamics – including performance, stability and control – of the BYA-1 design, which integrates gaseous hydrogen tanks outside of the fuselage.

Beyond Aero said data from the wind tunnel test campaign is a key step towards experimentally validating the BYA-1’s aerodynamics, and a major milestone towards concluding the Preliminary Design phase.

Validating a hydrogen-driven aerodynamic architecture

Beyond Aero is integrating its gaseous hydrogen tanks externally for safety reasons. However, this creates complex aerodynamic interaction zones at the wing-fuselage junction and wingtips – regions where even minor design changes can significantly influence lift, drag, and stability.

So far, only computer simulation and modeling has been performed to validate BYA-1’s aerodynamic design. Although these provide confidence, the design and interactions around the wing-fuselage junction and wingtips cannot be fully de-risked through computation alone.

The objective of the wind tunnel testing campaign was therefore confirm that the design, which includes the hydrogen storage, behaves in a stable, predictable, and controllable manner across the intended flight envelope, as well as optimize performance.

The wind tunnel tests used a 1:8 scale model and generated more than 60,000 data points. The campaign investigated aircraft performance, stability, and control across a range of configurations. Testing was conducted at speeds up to 80 m/s (288 km/h).

According to Beyond Aero, its engineers have used AI to accelerate the development of tools that correlate and visualize large experimental and numerical datasets, allowing them to optimize conventional aerodynamic validation processes. The tools helped engineers identify trends, assess sensitivities, and converge more efficiently.

Delphine Bonnaud, head of aerodynamics at Beyond Aero said, “The development of a hydrogen-electric aircraft requires precise aerodynamic design. The strong correlation between experimental results and numerical simulations in the linear domain gives us a solid validation of our numerical process.”

The investment is designed to drive economic growth, create high-skilled jobs, and move the aviation sector closer to its “Jet Zero” target of net-zero emissions by 2050.

The primary focus of the £43m funding is to support research and development projects that tackle the environmental impact of flight.

This includes advancing zero-emission aircraft and producing low-carbon fuels. A key area of research will also investigate ways to eliminate climate-warming water vapour trails produced by aircraft, which represent a significant but often overlooked portion of aviation’s climate impact.

Fuelling economic growth and job creation

Government officials emphasised that this public investment is intended to unlock millions of pounds of private-sector capital.

The production of low-carbon fuels alone is projected to contribute up to £5bn to the UK economy by 2050.

By backing British businesses and universities, the government aims to position the UK as a global leader in green aviation, supporting thousands of highly skilled jobs in technology development and scientific research.

Supporting sustainable airport expansion

The investment comes as the government moves forward with plans to expand major airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, and Luton.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: “We’re backing UK businesses by powering up green aviation. Our £43m investment will deliver the cutting-edge technology of the future, grow the economy and support highly skilled jobs as part of our mission to deliver national renewal.

“Zero-emission aircraft, hydrogen fuels and other emerging technologies are vital to reduce the climate impacts from flying and will enable us to deliver our airport expansion plans to boost connectivity and grow the economy.”

Strengthening global leadership and regulation

As part of the initiative, the Civil Aviation Authority will receive support to develop the regulatory frameworks necessary for the safe and widespread use of hydrogen fuel.

Furthermore, a portion of the funding is earmarked for international collaboration, specifically to help regions such as Africa and the Caribbean track and use sustainable fuels.

This international outreach is intended to ensure a level playing field for UK airlines while promoting global aviation decarbonisation.

Accelerating SAF production to enhance green aviation

In further support for the sector, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, coming into force later this year, will provide long-term certainty for the SAF market by guaranteeing a set price for UK producers, helping the UK meet its climate targets.

This is backed by an additional £63m to accelerate the construction of new SAF production plants, alongside £2.3bn through the Aerospace Technology Institute programme over the next decade to support cutting-edge aerospace innovation and thousands of highly skilled jobs.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, explained: “Today’s investment in zero and lower emission technology is playing an important part in delivering a sustainable future for UK aviation, a process well underway with the launch last year of the sustainable aviation fuel mandate and imminent passage of the SAF revenue certainty mechanism into law.

“The ongoing work of the Jet Zero Taskforce, bringing government, industry and experts together to drive progress, is a critical part of our collective efforts to ensure net zero remains a reality for our sector.”",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2394202019-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 07:58:30.728748

From the 2026 season, F1 regulations will undergo a major transformation, encompassing both the chassis and the power unit.
This is the stage where Honda’s engineers can truly demonstrate their capabilities.
These technologies align closely with Honda’s diverse mobility businesses and encourage cross-functional collaboration among engineers, strengthening Honda’s overall technological foundation.
Through F1, Honda will pursue the expansion of human potential across land, sea, air, space, and the future of mobility.","In 1964, only a short time after Honda began selling automobiles, Honda made its first entry into F1—the pinnacle of global motorsport. At the time, Honda was still widely regarded as a motorcycle manufacturer, making the challenge appear almost like an impossible dream.

The road was extraordinarily difficult, marked by repeated setbacks. Yet Honda’s engineers persevered, and in 1965, at the final round—the Mexican Grand Prix—Honda achieved its first F1 victory. That triumph has since become a symbol of Honda’s enduring Challenging Spirit.

From the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, Honda built a golden era together with Williams and McLaren. More recently, in 2021, Honda secured the Drivers’ Championship alongside Red Bull Racing.

At the core of all these challenges lies the philosophy of founder Soichiro Honda: “Commit to become No. 1 in the world.” and “Take on the most difficult challenges.” By deliberately choosing the harder path, learning, and growing stronger, Honda has continued to develop technologies it can proudly offer to the world. This “DNA of challenge” remains alive within Honda today.

From the 2026 season, F1 regulations will undergo a major transformation, encompassing both the chassis and the power unit.

In the new power unit regulations, the electrical power output produced by the motor and battery will be increased to roughly three times its current output—representing a dramatic increase in electrification compared to previous eras. Battery capacity, energy recovery efficiency, and precise energy management—when to deploy electrical power and when to recover it—will directly influence race results.

The use of advanced sustainable fuel will be required for the engine. As a result, F1 will evolve into a next-generation motorsport that simultaneously challenges electrification and decarbonization.

In addition, there is the F1 cost cap system*. Within constrained resources, teams must deliver maximum performance. This is not merely a competition—it is a contest of ideas and ingenuity refined to the extreme.

Engineers are required to break conventions, innovate relentlessly, and push beyond perceived limits. This is the stage where Honda’s engineers can truly demonstrate their capabilities.

Under the new regulations, F1 is no longer solely about competing for speed. It has become a global stage for addressing shared challenges such as electrification and carbon neutrality. Beyond high-speed combustion, thermal management, high-output motors, and large turbochargers operating at extreme rotational speeds, F1 demands a wide range of technologies—lightweight structures, high-output and high-efficiency batteries, and sustainable fuels. These technologies align closely with Honda’s diverse mobility businesses and encourage cross-functional collaboration among engineers, strengthening Honda’s overall technological foundation.

The technologies refined through this challenge extend beyond next-generation hybrids and EVs to aerial mobility. For example, knowledge gained from sustainable fuels is being applied to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fuels for eVTOL aircraft. High-efficiency battery technologies are already being adapted for eVTOL use. Moreover, as to technologies for high-speed rotating components, such as turbos and motors, we have been leveraging our expertise amassed through aircraft engine development for F1, then the advancements we make in F1 racing are being fed back to aircraft engine development. This circular synergy is ongoing within Honda.

Through F1, Honda will pursue the expansion of human potential across land, sea, air, space, and the future of mobility.

The new H Mark displayed on F1 machines powered by Honda’s new power unit symbolizes the transformation of Honda’s automobile business and will be used for F1 machines as well as Honda machines in various other motorsports.

In addition, by leveraging the technologies and expertise of Honda Racing Corporation, Honda will introduce HRC-spec models refined through racing, contributing further to its automobile business by translating motorsport-derived value into production vehicles.

Honda will offer a broader range of customers with opportunities to feel the “joy of driving” and Honda passion and commitment to take on challenges.

F1 is not only the pinnacle of technology but also a proving ground for human development. In its intense development environment, engineers are tested on their ability to adapt to change and overcome challenges. When these individuals return to product development, they help create products that deliver even greater joy and inspiration to customers.

As global streaming platforms and films have fueled a rapid increase in F1 fans—particularly among younger generations—Honda aims to share the joy of victory with long-time supporters and new fans alike. Together with Aston Martin Aramco Formula OneTM Team, Honda will compete on the world stage, striving for the top and conveying the power and value of challenge to audiences worldwide.",http://global.honda/content/dam/site/global-en/stories/cq_img/191-2601-honda-amaf1-partnership/social.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 07:58:35.995508
,,2026-01-20 09:37:46+00:00,www.imeche.org,Sustainable aviation fuels can cut emissions – but could they have an even bigger climate impact?,Not Available,,,,,https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/sustainable-aviation-fuels-can-cut-emissions-but-could-they-have-an-even-bigger-climate-impact,"“There's two parts to the emissions that come from aviation,” says Andrew Symes, CEO of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer OXCCU.
Awarded a £1.8m grant in November from the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), it is investigating whether SAF specification can reduce contrail formation.
“Therefore the interesting question becomes ‘If you reduce the aromatics content of the jet fuel, do you then reduce contrail formation?’” he says.
There could be other opportunities to reduce the climate impact of flights using regular jet fuel.
“According to IATA (the International Air Transport Association), we're still at less than 1% of global jet fuel being SAF and growth is slowing,” he says.","Formed due to soot released during fuel combustion, contrails and the cirrus clouds they create could account for more than half (57%) of aviation’s climate impact, according to a 2021 study published in Atmospheric Environment. While some estimates are lower, it is a vital area of study if aviation is to remain a viable mode of transport in a warming world.

“There's two parts to the emissions that come from aviation,” says Andrew Symes, CEO of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer OXCCU. “The first is the actual CO2 that's emitted by the plane, and that can be eliminated – in the most part at least – by going for circular biofuels, so that the CO2 has come from the atmosphere and then it goes back to the atmosphere.”

The Oxford University spin-out now hopes to find out if its synthetic crude Oxfuel, created using a novel catalyst and reactor design, could also reduce the second part. Awarded a £1.8m grant in November from the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), it is investigating whether SAF specification can reduce contrail formation.

Catalysts for change

Situated at Oxford Airport, OXCCU’s OX1 plant has been producing SAF since 2024. Production is only at demonstration scale – one litre per day – but the company plans to expand in the coming years.

Unlike bio-based SAF produced from waste and animal fats, Oxfuel is a Power-to-Liquid fuel, formed from simple chemical building blocks. The process used an iron-based multi-functional catalyst that first converts CO2 to carbon monoxide, before reacting that with hydrogen to form hydrocarbons.

OXCCU CEO Andrew Symes

In the ATI-funded project, OXCCU aims to show that jet fuel production can be tuned to have a range of different components, then to prove a potentially significant impact on global warming. While all hydrocarbon fuels consist of carbon and hydrogen molecules, the ways they are arranged can provide different properties – the ratio of carbon to hydrogen can vary, for example, while some molecules are branched, some are straight, some are in rings and some are in aromatic rings. Those aromatics are closely tied with a fuel’s propensity to form soot, Symes says, as they contain more carbon.

“Therefore the interesting question becomes ‘If you reduce the aromatics content of the jet fuel, do you then reduce contrail formation?’” he says. “With our process, we can tune the amount of aromatics that we've got in that end fuel – and a lot of the new SAF coming up could actually have no aromatics.”

The first step will be to show that the production method – based around the Fischer-Tropsch process – can make different fuels depending on reaction conditions and upgraded catalysts. Those catalysts could remove residual oxygen from the synthetic crude, increase the number of branched molecules and remove aromatics.

Clearing the air

Part of a programme delivered by the ATI, the Department for Business and Trade and Innovate UK, the OXCCU project runs from July 2025 to June 2027. If it succeeds in its aims, “the next step will be to then persuade the engine companies… to widen the certifications, to enable us to be able to get that to market,” Symes says.

The company is building the OX2 facility, which it hopes will produce 30 litres of fuel per day from 2027, followed by a commercial plant by the end of the decade. The UK’s SAF mandate will require 10% of jet fuel demand to be met by SAF by 2030 and OXCCU hopes to have a “massive” influence on the industry, Symes says. “We don’t know for sure how big the impact of contrails is… there’s more science being done that will become clearer over the years. But even if it’s 10-20% of GHG (greenhouse gas) intensity, then that’s a huge amount, and so we need to try and tackle that as well.”

Alternative flight paths

Alongside the OXCCU project, the ATI is also funding two other projects aimed at non-CO2 emissions. QRITOS, led by Rolls-Royce with input from British Airways, Imperial College London, BP and Heathrow, is exploring ways of funnelling SAF to the small proportion of flights with the biggest climate impact, while the Airbus UK-led Trace project aims to address the effects of contrails, including developing new modelling and analysis techniques.

Dr Sebastian Eastham, an associate professor in sustainable aviation at Imperial College, is involved with those projects but not the OXCCU work. Sulphur is suspected to be another key element of ice formation in contrails, he says. “The good news is that with many different sustainable aviation fuels, they do produce less soot and they do have less sulphur in them, often zero sulphur.”

Previous work by the German Aerospace Centre has shown a reduction in the number of ice crystals created by SAF, he says, so now the “big question” is if that means a reduced climate impact. The QRITOS project will use up to 50% SAF on flights, then use satellite observation of contrail formation to find an answer.

There could be other opportunities to reduce the climate impact of flights using regular jet fuel. “We've had lean-burn combustors on the market for quite a while… which produce orders of magnitude less soot already,” Eastham says. Combined with ‘desulphurised’ fuel, they could provide a similar benefit.

That could be particularly important in the short term, given the challenges of large-scale SAF production. “According to IATA (the International Air Transport Association), we're still at less than 1% of global jet fuel being SAF and growth is slowing,” he says.

“SAF may produce contrail benefits. There's some evidence that it can, and given that it's usually expected to be low-sooting and low-sulphur, that goes in the right direction – but we may not need to wait for SAF in order to get the contrail benefits. It's one of these things where we can pursue those in parallel and not make them a joined objective.”

The Sectoral Growth Factor (SGF) for 2024 is positive for the first time since COVID-19, triggering offset obligations for airlines in over 120 voluntarily participating states.

The scheme will become mandatory from 2027. Experts emphasise that airlines must now adopt long-term decarbonisation strategies—including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and integrated carbon credit procurement—to stay ahead of rising regulatory and sustainability pressures.

International aviation emissions have officially surpassed the CORSIA baseline for the first time since the pandemic, triggering offset obligations for participating airlines under ICAO’s global carbon scheme.

According to newly released data from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the Sectoral Growth Factor (SGF) for 2024 is set at 0.15948315, marking a key milestone in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The positive SGF indicates that emissions have exceeded 85 percent of 2019 levels, the baseline used for offset calculations.

Airlines in participating states must now purchase and cancel eligible carbon credits to compensate for their emissions growth, reactivating compliance responsibilities that had been largely dormant during the pandemic downturn.

The scheme entered its First Phase (2024–2026) this year, with over 120 countries voluntarily participating—including major aviation markets such as the EU, UK, US, UAE, Japan, and Brazil. The Second Phase (2027–2035) will make participation mandatory for nearly all ICAO member states, excluding only the least developed, landlocked, or small island nations.

“This shift will bring nearly all internationally operating airlines under the CORSIA compliance framework,” said Alexey Zotov, General Manager of ACGC S.a.r.l., part of the ACN Group. “Airlines will be obliged to purchase carbon credits through one of several recognised channels.”

Approved procurement options include direct purchases from carbon registries, aviation-focused carbon marketplaces, and long-term contracts linked to sustainability projects such as REDD+ forestry, biogas, methane reduction, and renewable energy.

While CORSIA is designed to provide a short-term compliance mechanism, pressure is mounting for airlines to pursue real emissions reductions. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains the sector’s most promising long-term decarbonisation solution, and industry observers say integrated carbon + SAF procurement strategies will be essential as regulatory scrutiny intensifies.

“Environmental costs will become a permanent part of freight pricing,” Zotov noted. “Airlines preparing now—by combining offset purchases with SAF strategies—will be better positioned for the post-2027 regulatory landscape.”

eBay was founded in 1995 and is now one of the world’s largest digital marketplaces, operating across 190 markets. The company announced its 2045 net zero goal last year, which has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

In addition to the 2045 net zero target, key climate goals in the plan include a 90% reduction in emissions across the value chain by 2045, 90% Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction by 2030, and 27.5% Scope 3 emissions from downstream transportation and distribution by 2030. The company also aims to maintain 100% renewable electricity, which it first achieved in 2024.

For the years between now and 2045, the Climate Transition Plan places particular emphasis on tackling downstream transportation and distribution, which accounts for nearly 84% of eBay’s total carbon footprint. As it does not own delivery fleets, eBay’s strategy relies on collaboration with logistics partners to drive change, including shifting shipments from air to ground transport, expanding the use of electric delivery vehicles and supporting the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

eBay has also embedded sustainability requirements into carrier contracts including encouraging investments into cleaner technologies such as zero-emission vehicles, route optimization, renewable energy and sustainable packaging. In some cases, the company is also pursuing direct co-investment and pilot programs with partners to accelerate innovation.

The company’s transition plan noted progress in this area. DHL, for example, announced they are aiming for 66% electric vehicles in last-mile delivery by 2030, transitioning to sustainable marine biofuels, and investing in SAF with a 30% usage goal by 2030.

According to eBay, the new plan also identifies climate risks and opportunities for the business amid rising consumer demand for resale and sustainable shopping Key focus areas in the plan include advancing sustainable commerce through eBay’s circular marketplace which extends product life and reduces waste, as well as initiatives to embed climate factors into the company’s governance, risk management, and financial planning.

Renee Morin, eBay’s Chief Sustainability Officer, said:

“We believe the future of commerce and the future of our planet are deeply connected. Building on our recommerce legacy, our Climate Transition Plan showcases how we will achieve net zero emissions by 2045 while supporting a low-carbon economy.

The molecules replicate the functional properties of palm oil and could ultimately be processed via existing HEFA infrastructure.
Balanced decarbonization: fuels, chemicals Holmgren also pushed back against narratives that pit SAF against bio-based chemicals, arguing that deep decarbonization requires both.","Efforts to decarbonize aviation cannot rely solely on sustainable aviation fuel, and balancing fuel and chemical production will be crucial to improving project economics and scaling low-carbon pathways, LanzaTech's CEO Jennifer Holmgren said in an interview with Platts.

LanzaTech is pivoting to bridge the widening gap in SAF feedstocks by developing a synthetic palm oil substitute that could unlock a new, deforestation-free route to the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway.

One emerging route under development could reshape both dynamics: converting recycled carbon into palm oil-range molecules that can serve as feedstock for bio-naphtha, specialty chemicals and potentially the HEFA pathway for SAF.

""One of the things we've been working on is with a partner in the cosmetics sector,"" Holmgren said. ""Palm oil is a critical raw material due to its many useful properties. However, the global dependency on palm oil has resulted in extensive deforestation, biodiversity loss, and significant CO2 emissions, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable alternatives. Finding a sustainable alternative to palm oil would enable more feedstock for making SAF and other products in refineries.""

LanzaTech is working with Germany's Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology and cosmetics company Mibelle Group to convert recycled carbon ethanol -- produced from captured CO2 -- into palm oil-like fats using yeast fermentation. The molecules replicate the functional properties of palm oil and could ultimately be processed via existing HEFA infrastructure.

""The yeast eats the ethanol and makes palm oil-range molecules,"" Holmgren said. ""It's still early and in the scale-up stage, but it could become a very good feedstock for HEFA.""

Three-year visibility on scale, economics

Holmgren said LanzaTech expects to gain clarity on scalability and commercial economics within the next three years, aided by early demand from higher-value chemical markets.

""Cosmetics is a strong early market because its volume requirements align well with initial production,"" she said. ""That allows us to work our way down the cost curve so the later volumes can serve fuels.""

If successful, the pathway could offer a new route to bio-based naphtha and SAF feedstocks without relying on conventional vegetable oils or used cooking oil, which are increasingly constrained by sustainability concerns and supply competition.

Palm oil's high yields, long shelf life and thermal stability make it a suitable feedstock for many sectors, including HEFA SAF.

SAF cannot scale without chemicals

Holmgren stressed that the industry's focus on SAF should not come at the expense of chemicals and materials, which remain essential to both decarbonization and financial viability.

""About 30% of a barrel goes into materials and chemicals,"" she said. ""We're never going to decarbonize if we only decarbonize aviation, marine and power.""

She argued that bio-naphtha, bio-acetone and other chemical streams should be viewed as structural co-products rather than optional add-ons.

""The petroleum industry uses every carbon atom in the barrel,"" Holmgren said. ""That's exactly what the bio industry needs to do.""

Speaking to Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, Holmgren said gas fermentation and carbon recycling technologies offer a structurally different pathway from incumbent thermocatalytic approaches, particularly as SAF markets grapple with feedstock scarcity, rising costs and policy uncertainty across regions.

""Biology is extremely selective,"" Holmgren said. ""It can take a very inhomogeneous resource -- waste -- and convert it into one product. That's fundamentally different from thermocatalysis, which needs large, centralized refineries and produces multiple streams.""

Waste carbon as a distributed feedstock

LanzaTech's core platform converts industrial waste gases, gasified municipal solid waste, or MSW, agricultural residues and captured CO2 into ethanol, which can then be upgraded into SAF via the alcohol-to-jet, or ATJ, pathway or used as an intermediate for chemicals.

Holmgren said this selectivity allows projects to be deployed in a distributed manner, closer to waste sources, rather than relying on large, centralized refineries that require uniform feedstocks.

""In a world where waste is distributed, biology makes sense,"" she said. ""People have moved past the skepticism. They're starting to understand the value.""

In Asia, the opportunity is particularly strong due to abundant agricultural residues, MSW and growing industrial emissions, although Holmgren cautioned that success depends on local infrastructure, including gasification capacity for solid wastes.

""India and Southeast Asia have significant biomass availability, and in many cases, it's already aggregated because supply chains exist,"" she said. ""We're working with local partners and indigenous gasification solutions in the region.""

Circul Air, Dragon, Speedbird

LanzaTech has been advancing its ""Circul Air"" concept, which integrates waste-to-ethanol production with downstream SAF conversion, creating an end-to-end circular carbon pathway.

This approach complements flagship UK projects such as Project Dragon and Project Speedbird, which Holmgren described as ""twin"" ethanol-to-SAF developments backed by strong policy support and airline participation.

""Dragon's ethanol-to-SAF pathway is coming along very well, with significant UK government support,"" she said. ""Speedbird is at the same stage -- feed development and late-stage engineering -- and includes British Airways as an investment partner.""

Having airlines as equity participants and offtakers is critical for project bankability, Holmgren said.

""You simply won't get infrastructure funding without offtakes,"" she said. ""When an airline invests, it sends a very strong signal to the market.""

Beyond airlines: carbon matters

While airlines remain the primary SAF buyers, Holmgren emphasized the growing importance of corporate carbon credit demand in making SAF economics viable.

""SAF is still too expensive,"" she said. ""When companies like Microsoft or Deloitte take on the carbon credits, it allows the effective SAF price paid by airlines to come down. They're critical to success.""

She added that robust carbon markets are foundational not only for SAF but also for green hydrogen deployment.

""If I had to prioritize, I'd choose carbon markets,"" Holmgren said. ""Everything else, including hydrogen, rises from that.""

India: integrating carbon recycling with ethanol

Holmgren pointed to India as a particularly strong market for carbon recycling, given its expanding ethanol production under the E20 program and government support mechanisms such as viability gap funding.

""Around 40% of the carbon entering sugar fermentation leaves as CO2,"" she said. ""We can capture that CO2, combine it with hydrogen and make more ethanol. That's a perfect opportunity for India.""

She called for policy alignment between ethanol blending mandates and emerging SAF targets, stressing that governments must provide long-term, technology-neutral support.

""You're not going to build a $100 million plant with policies that change every two years,"" she said. ""Policy certainty ensures commitment from investors and industry.""

Balanced decarbonization: fuels, chemicals

Holmgren also pushed back against narratives that pit SAF against bio-based chemicals, arguing that deep decarbonization requires both.

Governments, she said, should encourage integrated value chains that maximize carbon utilization, much like the petroleum industry does today.

Platts last assessed the SAF (HEFA-SPK) FOB FARAG outright price up 1.9% week over week at $2,310/metric ton on Jan. 15, despite a lack of buying interest observed in the market, as jet FOB FARAG levels rose $59.25/mt.

The SAF premium to Jet barges fell $20/mt over this period, closing at $1,540/mt, with CIF cargoes remaining at a $10/mt premium.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-20 07:59:08.854413

While global efforts to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are faltering under the weight of high costs and policy missteps, Southern Africa continues to grapple with basic fuel security challenges. The slowdown in global SAF production, highlighted by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), coupled with a recent jet fuel shortage at Cape Town International Airport, shows a deeper structural problem: the continent risks being left behind in both the energy transition and the reliability of conventional fuel supply.

There is now an urgent need for coordinated policy reform, infrastructure investment, and pragmatic incentives if Africa is to secure its aviation future.

Global SAF Growth Slows as Policy Changes Have an Impact

According to IATA, global SAF production is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025, up from 1 million tonnes in 2024. While this represents year-on-year growth, momentum is already slowing. Production is projected to rise to only 2.4 million tonnes in 2026, falling short of earlier expectations.

Even at these levels, SAF remains marginal, accounting for just 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption in 2025 and 0.8% in 2026. The cost implications are substantial. IATA estimates that airlines will incur an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs in 2025 due to SAF premiums alone.

The slowdown is not a function of technology limitations but of policy design. IATA attributes the downward revision in production forecasts to insufficient incentives and poorly structured mandates, particularly in Europe and the United Kingdom, where regulatory frameworks have driven up prices without unlocking meaningful new supply.

European and UK SAF mandates were intended to accelerate adoption, but IATA argues they have instead distorted markets. Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation framework, limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains have allowed fuel suppliers to charge airlines up to five times the cost of conventional jet fuel and, in some cases, double prevailing SAF market prices, without guaranteeing supply or transparency.

The UK’s SAF mandate has produced similar outcomes, triggering price spikes that airlines have been forced to absorb. Collectively, airlines paid an estimated USD 2.9 billion in premiums for the limited SAF volumes available in 2025, of which USD 1.4 billion reflects the intrinsic price gap between SAF and fossil-based jet fuel.

These dynamics have forced some airlines to reconsider their sustainability commitments. IATA warns that carriers targeting 10% SAF usage by 2030 may be unable to meet those goals simply because sufficient fuel will not be available.

Africa’s Marginal Role in the Global SAF Outlook

For Africa, the global SAF picture is particularly concerning. By 2030, global SAF production capacity is expected to reach approximately 20 million tonnes, assuming realistic project success rates. However, less than 1% of this capacity is projected to come from Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia combined under current policy conditions.

This marginalisation persists despite Africa’s significant potential: abundant renewable energy resources, large tracts of available land, and proximity to emerging green hydrogen opportunities. The absence of coherent incentives, project finance mechanisms, and supportive regulatory frameworks has kept SAF investment concentrated in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.

Compounding the challenge is limited technology diversification. Around 95% of SAF production is still expected to rely on HEFA pathways, which are constrained by feedstock availability. Newer technologies, such as Alcohol-to-Jet, Power-to-Liquid (e-SAF), and gasification-based Fischer-Tropsch fuels, remain underdeveloped, limiting Africa’s ability to leapfrog into scalable next-generation solutions.

Southern Africa’s Conventional Fuel Vulnerabilities Laid Bare

While SAF remains a long-term ambition, Southern Africa is still struggling with the fundamentals of fuel supply. In December, Cape Town International Airport experienced widespread disruption after a sudden jet fuel shortage forced airlines to delay, reroute, or cancel flights.

The immediate cause was a breakdown in the logistics chain: transport inefficiencies, slower refinery output, and delays in offloading imported fuel sharply reduced on-site reserves. Airlines were instructed to limit refuelling, triggering cascading operational disruptions and exposing the fragility of South Africa’s aviation fuel infrastructure.

Passengers faced long queues, missed connections, and limited communication as airlines scrambled to adjust schedules. Although emergency measures, including increased tanker movements and coordinated fuel allocation, eventually stabilised operations, the incident highlighted deeper systemic risks in fuel transport reliability.

A Dual Transition Africa Cannot Afford to Miss

Africa now faces a dual challenge. On one hand, the continent risks exclusion from the global transition to sustainable aviation fuels due to policy inertia and underinvestment. On the other, recurring disruptions to conventional fuel supply underscore the urgent need to modernise logistics, storage, and refinery capacity.

The lessons from Europe are clear: mandates alone will not deliver fuel security or decarbonisation. For Africa, the priority must be pragmatic, strengthening existing fuel supply chains while creating targeted incentives that attract SAF investment, encourage technology diversification, and reduce long-term costs.

Without decisive action, Africa’s aviation sector may find itself squeezed between rising global compliance costs and persistent local supply vulnerabilities, an outcome that would undermine connectivity, economic growth, and the continent’s role in a decarbonising global economy.",https://africanpilot.africa/wp-content/uploads/Fuel-DSC09552.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 07:59:18.563605

Enter Vertimass LLC, a California-based start-up that is making waves with its groundbreaking technology for converting ethanol into hydrocarbon blend-stocks suitable for transportation fuels. This innovative approach not only promises to enhance the market for alternative fuels but also aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Irvine, California, Vertimass is on a mission to revolutionize how we think about fuel production. The company recently licensed cutting-edge biofuel-to-hydrocarbon conversion technology from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which opens up new avenues for sustainable fuel derived from biomass sources. With this partnership, they are poised to tackle one of the biggest challenges facing renewable energy today—the so-called 'blend wall'—which limits the use of ethanol produced from various biomass feedstocks.

The potential impact of this technology extends beyond just improving fuel efficiency; it represents a significant step toward reducing U.S. reliance on foreign oil sources while bolstering domestic economies through sustainable practices. By enabling broader access to alternative fuels across different sectors—including aviation and heavy-duty vehicles—Vertimass could redefine our energy landscape.

Positioned at the intersection of rapid energy demand growth and rising climate risk, the region can emerge as a leader in the global energy transition if it mobilises climate capital with urgency and strategic purpose.","The global energy system is undergoing its most significant transformation since the Industrial Revolution. As climate science strengthens and extreme weather intensifies, governments, investors and industries are converging on a central truth: decarbonisation is an economic necessity.

At the core of this shift is climate capital, the reallocation of financial resources toward technologies and business models that accelerate the green transition. This massive redirection of investment is reshaping markets and creating new strategic opportunities, especially for emerging regions like Southeast Asia.

Meeting the 1.5-degrees Celsius target of the the Paris Agreement requires global emissions to fall about 43% by 2030, demanding unprecedented deployment of renewable energy, electrification, efficiency upgrades and carbon-management solutions. Estimates suggest annual clean-energy investment must reach $4–5 trillion by 2030, nearly triple current levels. This scale of investment is now influencing how capital markets operate and how risk is assessed.

Institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and private-equity firms are restructuring portfolios around climate alignment. Fossil-fuel assets, once central to global investment strategies, are losing ground as markets reward companies with credible transition plans and transparent emissions reporting.

Climate risk is now understood as financial risk, encompassing stranded assets, regulatory shifts, supply-chain vulnerabilities and evolving consumer expectations.

Financial innovation is accelerating this shift. Green bonds and sustainability-linked loans have surged, channeling capital into renewable energy, low-carbon transport and green buildings. Multilateral development banks and philanthropic institutions are expanding blended finance mechanisms to de-risk early-stage projects and attract private capital.

Meanwhile, compliance and voluntary carbon markets are evolving toward higher integrity and rising demand from corporate enterprises pursuing net-zero goals.

TECHNOLOGY THE MAGNET

As finance flows, innovation expands. Massive global funding is accelerating advancements in battery storage, green hydrogen, grid modernisation and carbon-capture technologies. Solar and wind have become the cheapest electricity sources in many regions, making their adoption both economically and environmentally compelling.

Electrification is spreading across transport and industry as battery costs decline and supportive policy frameworks mature. Even hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, steel, chemicals and aviation are beginning to adopt early-stage low-carbon solutions.

These technological shifts are redefining what constitutes competitive advantage. Instead of fossil reserves, the new determinants of leadership include access to clean electrons, secure supply chains for critical minerals and the ability to deploy capital into integrated clean-energy systems.

Companies that fail to adapt their operating models and digital capabilities are increasingly outpaced by those embedding sustainability at the centre of their strategies.

Financial flows depend on policy certainty. Major policy packages such as the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan and China's renewable-energy expansion have created powerful incentives for climate-aligned investment. National hydrogen strategies, renewable targets and industrial decarbonisation programmes further amplify this momentum.

Yet policy environments remain uneven globally. Many emerging economies face high capital costs, fragmented regulations and limited access to concessional finance. Addressing these constraints is vital not only for climate mitigation but for energy security, competitiveness and equitable economic growth.

ASEAN AT A CROSSROADS

Southeast Asia's energy demand is set to rise rapidly over the next decade, one of the fastest growth rates worldwide. The region is also acutely vulnerable to climate impacts, from flooding to extreme heat. Balancing growth with decarbonisation places Southeast Asia at a pivotal moment: it can either lead in the green transition or become locked into carbon-intensive pathways that hinder long-term economic resilience.

Thailand stands at the heart of this regional transformation. With ambitious climate targets, a strong industrial base and strategic geography, it has the potential to become a major player in Southeast Asia's energy transition. The country has already taken meaningful steps through the Power Development Plan and the bio-circular-green (BCG) economy model signalling firm national commitment.

Thailand is also emerging as a regional hub for electric vehicle manufacturing, attracting global automakers. Solar deployment continues to grow, supported by natural advantages and improving regulatory frameworks. Moreover, Thailand's financial sector is increasingly adopting environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, opening the door to more climate-focused financial products.

However, unlocking Thailand's full potential will require accelerated investment in renewable capacity, smart grids, energy storage, electric mobility and hydrogen infrastructure. It also demands policy clarity to attract global climate capital, which is increasingly selective and seeks predictable, scalable opportunities.

To position Thailand and Southeast Asia as leaders in the global energy transition, three priorities are essential:

1. Strengthen policy certainty and market design. Long-term visibility is critical for investors. Transparent power purchase agreements, clear grid-planning processes and stable regulatory frameworks will significantly reduce investment risk and accelerate renewable deployment.

2. Catalyse blended finance. Development banks, export credit agencies and sovereign wealth funds can collaborate with local institutions to lower financing costs. Blended finance is particularly powerful in unlocking private investment for early-stage and large-scale clean-energy projects.

3. Build regional green value chains. Southeast Asia has the potential to anchor global supply chains for EVs, batteries, green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and renewable technologies. Thailand's strong manufacturing ecosystem positions it to become a central player in these industries.

The global decarbonisation drive is fundamentally altering investment priorities and directing unprecedented capital into cleaner, more resilient systems. For Southeast Asia and Thailand in particular, this shift represents not only a climate imperative, but an economic opportunity.

Sustainability targets added further pressure, with limited sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) availability in Latin America exposing airlines to long-term cost and compliance risks. Against this backdrop, consolidation moves, state intervention and renewed industrial investment highlighted both the resilience of Mexico’s aerospace ecosystem and the strategic decisions shaping its medium-term trajectory.

Global Airline Performance and Structural Constraints

The global airline industry ended 2025 with sustained demand growth and improving financial results, although structural constraints continued to limit capacity expansion. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects global airlines will generate a combined net profit of US$41 billion in 2026, up from US$39.5 billion in 2025, maintaining a net margin of 3.9%.

Passenger volumes are expected to reach 5.2 billion, with an average load factor of 83.8%, while total industry revenue is forecast at US$1.053 trillion. Air cargo volumes are projected at 71.6 million metric tons.

Despite these gains, aircraft availability remains a binding constraint. IATA Director General Willie Walsh said manufacturers must address persistent production shortfalls. “The backlog of more than 17,000 aircraft orders that we reached in 2025 must be reduced in 2026,” Walsh said. According to IATA and consulting firm Oliver Wyman, disruptions in aircraft production are expected to cost the aviation industry more than US$11 billion in 2025, reflecting delays linked to engine recalls, supply chain bottlenecks and labor constraints.

Latin American airlines posted a 4.4% year-on-year increase in demand, with capacity up 4.7% and a load factor of 83.9%, according to IATA. Despite operational constraints, the region led global punctuality rankings in 2025, with Aeroméxico named the world’s most punctual airline and airports in Chile, Panama and Ecuador topping their respective categories.

Mexico’s Airline Market: Growth, Consolidation and Operational Disruption

Mexico’s air transport market expanded at a moderate but steady pace in 2025. IATA data shows domestic passenger traffic grew 3.2% year over year between January and October, standing 18.8% above 2019 levels. International traffic increased 4% from the prior year and 12.2% compared with pre-pandemic volumes. Domestic air cargo rose 1.9% year over year.

Aeroméxico, Viva and Volaris transported approximately 82.23 million passengers during the period, up 3.61% from a year earlier. Volaris reported transporting 30.45 million passengers in 2025, up 3.2%, while Viva carried 27.24 million passengers from January to November, an 8.6% increase. Aeroméxico transported 24.59 million passengers in 2025, down 3.0% from 25.34 million in 2024. Despite operational challenges, both Volaris and Viva surpassed Aeroméxico in passenger volumes.

Operational reliability was strained by global engine inspection programs. Volaris averaged 30.5 grounded aircraft per month over a 27-month period due to Pratt & Whitney PW1100G and PW1400G inspections, according to aviation consultant Armando Sánchez Mata. Viva averaged 21.3 grounded aircraft per month over a similar period. Both airlines relied on wet leases and capacity adjustments during peak demand.

Against this backdrop, Volaris and Viva announced an agreement to merge their holding companies in a transaction expected to close in 2026. The airlines will continue operating independently, maintaining separate brands and operating certificates, with ownership of the new holding company split evenly. “The creation of this new airline group will allow us to further stimulate air travel in Mexico, in line with the low-fare model that has driven industry growth over the last 20 years,” said Volaris CEO Enrique Beltranena.

Aeroméxico returned to the New York Stock Exchange in November after four years of restructuring, following its relisting in Mexico and marking a key step in its post-Chapter 11 capital strategy. The move came as a US appeals court temporarily blocked a Department of Transportation order requiring Aeroméxico and Delta Air Lines to unwind their joint venture pending legal review.

State-owned Mexicana de Aviación closed its second year of operations expecting to carry about 450,000 passengers in 2025, up from 350,000 in 2024, and to reach an estimated 11% share of passenger traffic at AIFA. Under its 2025–2030 Institutional Program, the airline aims to increase annual revenue to MX$3.85 billion (US$209 million) by 2030, supported by passenger services, ancillary revenues and cargo. Fleet renewal underpins the strategy, with five Embraer E195-E2 aircraft delivered from a firm order of 20.

Airports, Infrastructure and World Cup Readiness

Mexico’s three private airport groups — ASUR, GAP and OMA — handled more than 133 million passengers in 2025, a 2.26% increase from 2024. OMA led growth, reporting 28.75 million passengers, up 8.5%. ASUR handled 71.56 million passengers, up 0.3%, while GAP recorded a 2.5% increase.

AICM advanced an MX$8.5 billion (US$460 million) renovation focused on structural rehabilitation, drainage and passenger flow efficiency ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Passenger-impacting works are scheduled for completion by mid-May 2026, with overall progress reaching 35% by year-end.

AIFA closed 2025 with more than 7 million passengers, a 12% annual increase, and has handled over 17 million passengers since opening in 2022. The airport projects 9 million passengers in 2026, though traffic remains below original projections of 20 million within three years. Director Isidoro Pastor acknowledged the loss of 11 international routes in 2025 but said the impact was manageable and that efforts are underway to restore routes in 2026. Cargo operations remain concentrated at AIFA, where 49 cargo airlines have moved more than 1 million metric tons since opening.

Mexico is accelerating airport investment under President Claudia Sheinbaum, with MX$121.54 billion (US$7 billion) allocated to modernize 36 airports and a broader MX$134 billion public-private plan to upgrade 62 airports between 2025 and 2030.

Bilateral Aviation Dispute and Regulatory Risk

Mexico and the United States entered 2026 negotiations to resolve an aviation dispute triggered by the US Department of Transportation’s revocation of 13 Mexican airline routes, citing violations of the 2015 Air Transport Agreement. Infrastructure Secretary Jesús Esteva said talks are ongoing to lift the measures before the World Cup. Mexican airlines returned six AICM slots to US carriers in November as part of the negotiations, while cargo operations will remain at AIFA.

Manufacturing, Tariffs and Investment Realignment

Mexico exports about 80% of its aerospace components to the United States, making the sector highly exposed to tariffs. US duties of 25% to 50% on steel and aluminum reshaped cost structures across the supply chain. FEMIA reported aerospace growth slowed to 9% in the first half of 2025.

Despite this, Mexico remains the world’s fifth-largest aerospace FDI destination. Safran led investment activity, expanding its Safran Aero Composite facility in Queretaro and announcing a MX$2.06 billion (US$115 million) investment across three sites, creating 238 specialized jobs. Bombardier committed US$18 million to expand component production in Queretaro, while Safran Aerosystems opened a new plant in Chihuahua following a US$7 million investment. GE Aerospace announced a MX$550 million (US$29.4 million) investment to modernize its Hermosillo and Saltillo facilities.

Airbus Outpaces Boeing as Trade Risks Loom

Airbus is estimated to have delivered about 793 commercial aircraft in 2025, supported by a year-end push that included roughly 90 December deliveries, meeting its revised target. Boeing delivered an estimated 575 to 600 aircraft as it continued recovering from an US$11.8 billion loss in 2024.

In December, Airbus warned that US tariffs on components from Mexico and Canada could raise US production costs, reaffirming long-term demand for 43,420 aircraft over the next 20 years.

Sustainability and SAF Constraints

Decarbonization emerged as a growing structural challenge. Global SAF production reached 1.5 million metric tons in 2024, less than 1% of required volumes. IATA estimates production may reach 2 million metric tonnes in 2025. ALTA warned that Latin America currently produces no SAF and has no active development projects, exposing the region to US$318 billion in potential cost increases. Mexico is expected to contribute just 3% of regional SAF production by 2050.

As the sector enters 2026, Mexico’s aerospace industry faces a convergence of strong demand, constrained capacity, trade risk and policy uncertainty, with industry leaders coordinating closely ahead of the USMCA review.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/avion-actu-vol.1511866.jpeg?h=c139c037&itok=W-iIjBS7,N,,2026-01-19 19:56:30.043446

Hydrogen-powered aviation is at the heart of this ambition and is essential to decarbonising aviation while ensuring the sustainable growth of our industry.
These are important steps on the journey to making hydrogen-powered flight a reality and securing a competitive, sustainable future for UK aviation.","The aviation industry is set for a major boost as £43 million for green projects was announced by the government today (20 January 2026), supporting jobs and unlocking new investment.

The major investment comes as the Government drives forward plans for expansion at Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton airports and the Transport Secretary will today chair a meeting with prominent airlines, airports, innovators and engineering firms to discuss how cutting-edge technology will decarbonise the sector while delivering growth.

With the production of low-carbon fuels alone expected to add up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050, the funding will drive millions of pounds of private investment into the aviation sector, supporting skilled jobs in technology development and scientific research and funding projects to slash emissions from aviation.

Businesses, researchers and universities across the UK will be invited to bid for their share of the £43 million, with competitions launching from February to allocate the funding. The funding will go towards research and development projects that help to deliver net zero aviation by 2050.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said:

We’re backing UK businesses by powering up green aviation. Our £43 million investment will deliver the cutting-edge technology of the future, grow the economy and support highly skilled jobs as part of our mission to deliver national renewal.

Zero emission aircraft, hydrogen fuels and other emerging technologies are vital to reduce the climate impacts from flying and will enable us to deliver our airport expansion plans to boost connectivity and grow the economy.

The technologies that will be developed with this funding, such as clean fuels and zero-emission aircraft, will play an important role in delivering on the government’s vision to expand airports in line with climate targets, by decarbonising aviation and improving air quality.

The investment could also be used for a trial to understand how contrails – condensation trails produced from aircraft exhausts that can contribute to global warming – could be avoided.

The Civil Aviation Authority will develop regulations required for the widespread use of hydrogen fuel through this investment – including support for pioneering companies and universities that are preparing for new zero carbon technology.

To further the UK’s world-leading reputation on green aviation, some of this funding will support the use and tracking of sustainable aviation fuels in regions like Africa and the Caribbean and improve their participation in schemes that offset global aviation emissions.

This will ensure UK airlines are not at a financial disadvantage to airlines based in low-income countries, who can avoid the costs associated with carbon offsetting because they do not have the required tracking and implementation tools.

In further support for the sector, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, coming into force later this year, will provide long-term certainty for the SAF market by guaranteeing a set price for UK producers, helping the UK meet its climate targets.

This is backed by an additional £63 million to accelerate new SAF production plants, alongside £2.3 billion through the Aerospace Technology Institute programme over the next decade to support cutting-edge aerospace innovation and thousands of highly skilled jobs.

The Hydrogen in Aviation Alliance said:

The funding for green aviation projects announced today will help ensure the UK leads the future of flight. Hydrogen-powered aviation is at the heart of this ambition and is essential to decarbonising aviation while ensuring the sustainable growth of our industry.

We welcome the government’s support for pioneering businesses developing zero emission aviation technologies, alongside its commitment to enabling the Civil Aviation Authority to put in place the right regulations for the use of hydrogen fuel.

These are important steps on the journey to making hydrogen-powered flight a reality and securing a competitive, sustainable future for UK aviation.

Duncan McCourt, Chief Executive of Sustainable Aviation, said:

We know that aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise and, as we continue on the road to net zero by 2050, industry action combined with government investment are required.

This funding will help turn ambition into operational reality across key decarbonisation pathways, helping to deliver carbon-neutral skies.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

Today’s investment in zero and lower emission technology is playing an important part in delivering a sustainable future for UK aviation, a process well underway with the launch last year of the sustainable aviation fuel mandate and imminent passage of the SAF revenue certainty mechanism into law.

Conclusion United Airlines enters the 2026 fiscal year as a structurally transformed company.","As we enter the third week of January 2026, the aviation industry finds itself at a pivotal juncture. Among the ""Big Three"" U.S. carriers, United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) has emerged as perhaps the most aggressive and strategically ambitious player in the post-pandemic era. Today, January 19, 2026, investors are laser-focused on United as the company prepares to release its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 earnings report later this week.

United is currently defined by its ""United Next"" transformation—a multi-year plan to modernize its fleet, expand premium capacity, and reclaim dominance in international markets. However, the optimism surrounding its record-breaking stock performance in 2025 is now being tested by renewed fuel price volatility and a complex labor landscape. This deep dive explores whether United can maintain its altitude in 2026 or if macroeconomic headwinds will force a descent.

Historical Background

United’s journey is a microcosm of the American aviation story. Founded in 1926 as Varney Air Lines, the carrier operated the first scheduled commercial airmail flight in the United States. By the 1930s, under the umbrella of William Boeing’s United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, it became a pioneer of modern flight, introducing the Boeing 247—the first truly modern airliner—in 1933.

The airline’s modern identity, however, was forged in the fires of the 21st century. After a grueling bankruptcy reorganization between 2002 and 2006, United executed a transformative $3 billion merger with Continental Airlines in 2010. While the United name survived, the merger infused the company with Continental’s ""Working Together"" culture and established the powerhouse hubs in Newark (EWR) and Houston (IAH) that underpin its global network today. In 1997, United also co-founded the Star Alliance, which remains the world’s largest airline alliance, providing the carrier with unparalleled global reach.

Business Model

United operates a traditional hub-and-spoke business model, but with a distinct tilt toward high-yield international and premium domestic traffic. Its revenue streams are diversified across three primary segments:

Passenger Revenue: The core driver, with a growing emphasis on ""Premium Products"" (Polaris, United First, and Premium Plus).

Cargo: Leveraging its extensive wide-body fleet, United remains a leader in belly-hold cargo, particularly on transpacific and transatlantic routes.

Loyalty (MileagePlus): A high-margin segment that provides significant cash flow through co-branded credit card agreements and partner sales.

United’s strategy differs from peers like Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) by prioritizing ""network depth."" It connects small and medium-sized markets through massive hubs in Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, and Washington D.C., funneling that traffic into its vast international network.

Stock Performance Overview

As of January 19, 2026, UAL stock has been a standout performer in the industrial sector.

1-Year Performance: Over the past twelve months, UAL has risen approximately 25%, driven by record-setting summer and holiday travel seasons in 2025.

5-Year Performance (2021–2026): United has seen a staggering 181% total return over the last five years. This period covers the recovery from COVID-19 lows and the subsequent market realization that United’s structural profitability had fundamentally improved.

10-Year Performance: Investors who held through the 2016–2026 decade saw significant volatility, particularly the 2020 crash, but long-term gains have outperformed the broader NYSE Arca Airline Index (XAL), largely due to the successful execution of the United Next strategy.

Earlier this month, on January 6, 2026, the stock reached an all-time closing high of $117.53, signaling strong market confidence ahead of the Q4 earnings print.

Financial Performance

All eyes are on the Q4 2025 earnings report scheduled for this week. Analysts are projecting:

Revenue: Approximately $15.4 billion for the quarter, a 5% year-over-year increase.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): A consensus estimate of $3.05. While this is a slight dip from Q4 2024’s $3.26, it reflects the impact of a brief U.S. government shutdown in late 2025 and higher labor costs.

Margins: United’s pre-tax margins have stabilized near 10%, narrowing the gap with industry leader Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL).

Free Cash Flow (FCF): United boasts a best-in-class FCF conversion rate of 130%, which has allowed the company to fund its massive aircraft orders while simultaneously reducing debt and initiating share buybacks in late 2025.

Leadership and Management

CEO Scott Kirby, who took the helm in May 2020, is widely regarded as one of the most analytical and aggressive leaders in the industry. Kirby’s tenure has been defined by ""playing offense"" during the pandemic—refusing to retire pilots and investing in new aircraft while competitors were retrenching.

The management team’s strategy is built on three pillars:

Mid-Continent Growth: Expanding hubs in Denver and Chicago to capture domestic share.

International Expansion: Dominating the Atlantic and Pacific gateways.

The ""Up-Gauge"": Replacing smaller regional jets with larger, more efficient narrow-body aircraft (Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A321neo) to lower per-seat costs.

Despite his strategic success, Kirby faces a significant challenge in early 2026: navigating a ""horn-locking"" period with the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) over a long-overdue contract.

Products, Services, and Innovations

United is reinventing its onboard experience to compete for high-value travelers.

Polaris Studio: Debuting on new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners in 2026, these suites are 25% larger than current Polaris seats, featuring 27-inch 4K screens and ""companion seating"" for dining.

United Next Interiors: By the end of 2026, nearly the entire mainline fleet will feature seatback entertainment, larger overhead bins, and high-speed Wi-Fi.

The A321neo Advantage: United has utilized the Airbus A321neo to offer a ""private jet"" feel in its premium cabins, helping it win back corporate contracts from Delta.

However, the delay of the Airbus A321XLR—now expected in mid-2026—has forced the carrier to keep older Boeing 757s in service longer than planned, slightly impacting fuel efficiency on ""long-thin"" routes.

Competitive Landscape

United currently sits in a ""silver medal"" position for profitability but ""gold"" for growth potential.

Vs. Delta (DAL): Delta remains the gold standard for operational reliability and domestic margins, but United is growing its international revenue faster and has a superior FCF conversion.

Vs. American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL): United has successfully opened a ""margin canyon"" over American. By January 2026, United’s pre-tax profitability is over 400 basis points higher than American’s, which has struggled with high debt and a less lucrative international footprint.

Vs. Low-Cost Carriers: United’s ""Basic Economy"" product has successfully segmented the market, preventing budget carriers like Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) from eroding its hub dominance.

Industry and Market Trends

The 2026 travel landscape is defined by two major trends:

The Premiumization of Travel: Economy travel is becoming commoditized, while premium cabin demand is growing at nearly triple the rate of the general market. United has responded by increasing its premium seat count by 75% compared to 2019.

Corporate Rebound: After a sluggish 2025, corporate travel data for January 2026 shows a 12% uptick in volume as businesses resume large-scale infrastructure and consulting projects deferred during the previous year's economic uncertainty.

Risks and Challenges

Despite the tailwinds, United faces three critical risks:

Labor Friction: The rejection of a 27% pay raise by flight attendants in late 2025 suggests a long road to a new contract. Strike threats, though legally difficult under the Railway Labor Act, can still impact morale and operational reliability.

Fuel Volatility: Unlike some peers, United does not hedge its fuel costs significantly. With jet fuel forecasted at $88/barrel but subject to geopolitical spikes, a $10 move in oil prices can wipe out hundreds of millions in profit.

OEM Reliability: Continued certification delays for the Boeing 737 MAX 10 have forced United to pivot to more expensive leases for Airbus aircraft to maintain its growth trajectory.

Opportunities and Catalysts

2026 Summer Schedule: United has announced the largest international expansion in its history for the upcoming summer season, adding 12 new destinations across Europe and Asia.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): United is the industry leader in SAF investment. As ReFuelEU mandates (2% SAF) take effect in 2025-2026, United’s existing supply deals with Neste and others give it a cost and compliance advantage over less-prepared rivals.

Share Buybacks: Having restored its balance sheet, the potential for an expanded share repurchase program in mid-2026 remains a major catalyst for the stock price.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish. As of January 19, 2026, major firms including Barclays and Citigroup maintain ""Strong Buy"" ratings on UAL.

Price Targets: The average analyst price target sits at $142, with some bulls reaching as high as $156.

Institutional Activity: We have seen increased accumulation by large asset managers in Q4 2025, betting on United’s ability to ""close the gap"" with Delta’s valuation multiples.

Retail Sentiment: On social platforms, ""United Next"" is frequently cited as a reason for retail optimism, though concerns about Scott Kirby’s ""unfiltered"" leadership style occasionally spark debate.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

The regulatory environment in 2026 is a mix of relief and new challenges.

FAA Oversight: After successfully passing a comprehensive safety audit in late 2024, United has regained the FAA's trust to accelerate its route expansion.

Consumer Protection: A shift in U.S. policy in late 2025 has moved away from the punitive ""automatic refund"" mandates of the previous administration toward a ""cooperative compliance"" model, which has lowered the risk of massive regulatory fines.

Geopolitics: Ongoing tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe continue to complicate flight routing and increase insurance premiums for international carriers.

Conclusion

United Airlines enters the 2026 fiscal year as a structurally transformed company. The ""United Next"" strategy is no longer a promise but a visible reality in the form of modernized cabins and a dominant international network. While the upcoming Q4 earnings may show some noise from the 2025 government shutdown and rising labor costs, the long-term thesis remains intact: United is successfully pivoting from a commodity service to a premium global brand.

Investors should watch the Q4 guidance closely this week. If United can demonstrate that it is successfully managing fuel volatility and narrowing the margin gap with Delta, the stock’s run to new all-time highs may only be the beginning. However, the pending flight attendant contract remains the ""elephant in the room"" that could lead to operational turbulence if not resolved by the busy summer season.

Singapore had no army, no natural resources, and no clear sovereign authority he could legally negotiate with. So Raffles did something more subtle. He elevated Tengku Hussein to the sultanate of Johor, manufacturing the legitimacy required to secure a foothold. What he was really buying was not territory, but position: control over a narrow maritime passage where East and West already passed each other by necessity.

Singapore was never meant to manufacture the world’s goods. It was meant to decide where they met.

That instinct — to intervene at chokepoints rather than chase volume — became Singapore’s enduring advantage. Over time, the port became a trading hub, the trading hub an energy hub, and the energy hub a financial center. More recently, Singapore has added another layer: advanced manufacturing, now accounting for roughly 20% of GDP. Not mass manufacturing, but precision systems designed to operate at high-value moments inside global supply chains.

That history matters, because aviation’s energy transition is quietly running into a chokepoint of its own.

The SAF Problem Everyone Sees — and the One They Don’t

Most discussion around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) focuses on production volumes, mandates, and feedstocks. How much can be made, where it will come from, and who will subsidize it. Those questions are real — but they are not where the system is currently binding.

Nearly every drop of aviation fuel used today is blended. Yet blending itself is treated as a solved problem, folded invisibly into refinery economics and upstream logistics. In practice, it is anything but.

Traditional SAF blending happens far from airports, embedded in supplier-controlled systems that airlines and airports cannot see or influence. The result is familiar to anyone who has watched an energy transition struggle: long procurement lead times, opaque pricing, embedded margins, and limited flexibility. The fuel exists, but it cannot move cleanly through the system.

In other words, the transition is failing not at production, but at the interface.

That is where FlyORO, a Singapore-based SAF solutions company, has chosen to operate.

Moving the Hinge

FlyORO’s core technology, AlphaLite, is a modular, containerized blending system designed for last-mile blending — relocating the blending step downstream, closer to airports and end users. The company describes it, modestly, as an “espresso machine” for jet fuel. But strategically, it functions more like a toll booth: it decides where fuel becomes usable, at what ratio, on whose terms.

AlphaLite is fuel-agnostic, compatible with all ASTM-certified SAF pathways, and digitally integrated for real-time monitoring and verification. It can be deployed within existing airport infrastructure, scaled to local demand, and operated without the massive capital investments traditionally associated with fuel blending facilities.

The implication is simple but powerful. Instead of purchasing pre-blended fuel at supplier-dictated prices, airports or airlines can import sustainable blending components and blend them on-site with kerosene they already own and store. What was once an upstream black box becomes visible, auditable infrastructure.

This is classic Singapore logic applied to aviation fuel: don’t own the resource, own the junction.

What Changes When Blending Moves Downstream

When blending shifts closer to the point of use, the economics change immediately.

Procurement timelines compress — in some cases by a factor of six — because operators are no longer tied to refinery schedules. Costs fall as intermediate logistics and embedded margins are stripped out. Airlines gain control over blend ratios rather than accepting fixed offerings. And as SAF mandates expand, digital verification moves from paperwork to real-time data, reducing compliance risk.

Just as importantly, last-mile blending lowers the barrier to participation. Airports and fuel suppliers no longer need to commit large upfront capital to experiment with SAF. FlyORO’s zero-CAPEX, leasing-based integration model allows operators to scale blending capacity as demand materializes, rather than betting ahead of it.

This is not a technology designed to win headlines. It is designed to make SAF workable inside real supply chains.

From Singapore to Australia: The Stress Test

If Singapore is the model, Australia is the proving ground.

Geographically vast, sparsely populated, and deeply reliant on aviation for national cohesion, Australia places unusual strain on aviation economics. Medium- and long-haul flights dominate. Distances are unforgiving. Infrastructure decisions matter more because mistakes are expensive.

That makes Australia an ideal stress test for last-mile blending.

FlyORO’s deployment with Wagner Sustainable Fuels at Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport represents the world’s first on-site SAF blending facility located directly at an airport. Not a refinery. Not a remote terminal. The apron itself.

Toowoomba is not an incidental choice. For more than a century, it has served as a gateway between coastal Queensland and the Darling Downs, a threshold between dense infrastructure and the vast interior. Nearby Winton, deep in the outback, is where Qantas was founded more than a hundred years ago, born of necessity to connect distances rail and road could not.

Today, that same geography is testing whether aviation can decarbonize without breaking.

As of early 2025, FlyORO has blended more than 380,000 liters of SAF across its deployments, with the Australian facility serving as a blueprint for regional airports facing similar constraints. The lesson emerging from Toowoomba is clear: decarbonization will not arrive everywhere at once, and it will not start only at megahubs. It will start where flexibility matters most.

The Long View

Singapore’s advantage has never been speed alone. It has been persistence — the ability to remain indispensable as systems evolve around it. From sail to steam, from coal to oil, from oil to finance and now to advanced manufacturing, Singapore has endured by mastering transitions rather than betting on abrupt replacements.

Aviation’s energy transition will follow the same pattern. SAF will scale, diversify, and expand — but fossil fuels and SAF will coexist for decades, bound together by certification limits, infrastructure realities, and economics that cannot be wished away. The future of flight will be blended long before it is fully transformed.

That is why technologies that operate at the interface matter most. FlyORO is not wagering on a clean break from the past. It is building infrastructure for a long overlap — one where persistence belongs not to the fuel with the loudest promise, but to the system that can adapt, verify, and endure while the transition unfolds.

Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations.

State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.

In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.

That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”

Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815.

That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty.

According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”

“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”

Contracting with GSD

Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.

It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.

The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.

DED leaders did not know firm

State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Aksarben Ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.

To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites.

Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell.

The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.

Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”

Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.

Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office.

“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said.

Contract facts

Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts.

Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself.

From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.

Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate.

Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.

Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.”

Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.”

“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.

The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.

Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds

Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans.

The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area.

Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital.

Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.

Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.

Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show.

Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.

The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive.

“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”

Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”

Questions about DG Fuels

Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.

The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.

Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email.

Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.

Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities.

Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.

DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”

“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.

Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.

“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”

Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.

But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024.

The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.

The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.

But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.

Contract obligations questioned

Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.

Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.

The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.

In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.",https://media-chadronradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-7.png,N,,2026-01-19 15:56:38.134619

With millions of possible MOFs to choose from, the formulas accurately predict how much usable hydrogen each porous crystal can hold, according to a new University of Michigan study.

With molecules in general containing 80-90% empty space, just one gram of a MOF has an internal surface area as big as a football field. Hydrogen molecules cling to their porous surface, but small variations in the crystal’s structure impact how the hydrogen interacts with the material.

Using a few physical properties of a potential MOF, researchers can now—without using a supercomputer or machine learning—estimate how much hydrogen can be stored under real-world conditions.

“By enforcing the right physics from the beginning, we show that you can match black-box machine-learning performance with models that are fully transparent. The combination of accuracy, interpretability, and deployability is what sets this approach apart,” said Alauddin Ahmed, research faculty of mechanical engineering at U-M and author of the study in PRX Energy.

The optimal MOF would store hydrogen with high weight efficiency and space efficiency. While the U.S. Department of Energy set targets for a 5.5% capacity by weight and 40 grams of hydrogen per liter under real-world conditions, no material has yet reached both benchmarks simultaneously.

Simple, explainable models

Previously, researchers relied on complex computer simulations that are accurate but computationally expensive and time consuming. More recently, machine learning models have sped up the search process, but they don’t explain the underlying physics.

To improve transparency, the researchers combined symbolic regression with other advanced algorithms to sift through billions of mathematical possibilities to find the simplest algebraic equations that predict performance as accurately as a complex simulation.

“I care deeply about interpretability. In safety-critical and mission-critical applications, people need to understand why a model is making a prediction, not just whether it is accurate on a test set,” said Ahmed.

The study curated a database of 88,400 MOFs detailing seven key crystal properties. Each entry also includes a prediction of storage capacity under a real-word operating range—between 100 and 5 bar at 77 kelvin.

The team used their algorithm to search for mathematical relationships between crystal properties and hydrogen storage capacity within this large dataset. To ensure the math was widely applicable, they validated the equations against a superdatabase of 600,000 MOFs pulled from open-source repositories previously reported by the author.

Pore space drives hydrogen uptake

Just one or two physical traits drove the vast majority of variation in usable hydrogen capacity across the MOFs. Void fraction—the ratio of empty space inside the crystal to crystal volume—can alone predict a MOF’s space efficiency. Void fraction plus pore volume predicts weight efficiency. Additional factors only added marginal gains to the predictions.

“We expected these features to matter, but we did not expect simple, constrained equations to match the accuracy of complex machine-learning models so closely,” said Ahmed.

Because the final models are fast, interpretable and essentially cost free, they can be integrated directly into automated systems that design and screen new hydrogen storage materials.

“More broadly, this work shows that physics-informed symbolic regression can be a practical bridge between large-scale simulations and real-world design. If we can replicate this success across other classes of energy materials, we will have a powerful new way to turn data into insight and, ultimately, into better technologies,” said Ahmed.

The First Movers Coalition shows that ambitious demand, combined with strategic collaboration, can accelerate decarbonization in even the hardest-to-abate sectors.","The need for progress on global decarbonization has never been greater than in an era marked by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic volatility.

The World Economic Forum's First Movers Coalition was launched to help scale breakthrough decarbonizing technologies through the market.

Despite the challenging context, First Movers are demonstrating that progress is happening and makes business sense.

In a period marked by geopolitical tensions, divergent regulatory priorities and persistent macroeconomic volatility, the need for global decarbonization progress has never been greater.

In 2021, half of the emissions reductions needed to reach net zero depended on technologies that were not yet commercially available. The World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition (FMC) was launched to create the demand signal required to help scale these breakthrough decarbonizing technologies through the market.

Since then, significant progress has been made. By 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that the share of required emissions reductions dependent on early-stage technologies had fallen to 35%. Yet, a substantial gap still remains.

Today, the FMC represents 101 companies that have pledged a total of $19 billion in purchasing commitments by 2030 across hard-to-abate mobility industries including aviation, shipping and trucking and materials sectors including cement and concrete, steel, aluminium as well as carbon dioxide removal (CDR).

These commitments would help reduce 26 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) through purchasing alone. Five years ahead of the commitment target, members are already moving towards implementing their pledges and have collectively signed more than 130 offtake agreements.

First Movers helping transform mobility sectors

Across mobility sectors, infrastructure limitations, insufficient supply and high green premiums continue to slow the adoption of low emission mobility solutions. Companies are overcoming these barriers through coordinated investments in supply chains, infrastructure and alternative carbon accounting opportunities.

In aviation, sustainable aviation fuel remains expensive and unevenly distributed. To address this challenge, American Express Global Business Travel, together with a consortium of partners, helped establish Avelia, one of the first large-scale book-and-claim platforms for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Avelia enables corporate customers to claim the emissions benefits of SAF, even when the fuel is delivered elsewhere. By June 2025, the platform had enabled more than 155 million litres of SAF to enter the global network and avoided more than 370,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This shows how innovative accounting systems can unlock new pathways for scaling supply.

In road freight, the uptake of zero-emission trucks remains limited by the lack of charging and depot infrastructure. Freight company Toll Group is addressing this challenge through an investment of $43 million in charging infrastructure, including 28 electric trucks and 30 dedicated charging hubs. By building infrastructure alongside vehicle deployment, Toll Group is proving the viability of electric freight corridors and contributing to the expansion of zero-emission trucking.

In maritime transport, the adoption of low-carbon fuels has long been constrained by supply chain and vessel readiness challenges. Early movers are now operating vessels powered by cleaner fuels such as methanol, sending demand signals to shipyards and fuel producers.

Mitsui O S K Lines plans to deploy nine ammonia dual fuel ships beginning in 2026, while also investing in carbon transformation company Twelve to support the development of clean marine fuels. These actions illustrate how decarbonized maritime supply chains become feasible when buyers and suppliers advance together.

Taken collectively, these examples show that technology adoption depends not only on innovation but also on the ecosystems that support it. Companies are investing in those ecosystems by strengthening supply chains, enabling infrastructure and creating financing and contracting models required to scale low carbon mobility.

Scaling decarbonized materials through collaboration

Sectors such as aluminium, steel, and cement and concrete, require fundamental production process changes and high capital expenditure investments to reach near-zero emissions. Companies are showing that breakthroughs occur when buyers collaborate directly with suppliers to bring advanced technologies to market.

This year marks a breakthrough in zero-emissions aluminium production. The first commercial-scale implementation of inert anode technology has been achieved at mining giant Rio Tinto’s Alma smelter in Québec. This is the result of collaboration between aluminium producer Alcoa and Rio Tinto, the founding partners of ELYSIS, (listed in the FMC’s First Suppliers Hub), together with the Government of Canada. Their commitment has resulted in the commissioning of the world’s first zero-emission aluminium smelter.

In cement and concrete, energy company Vattenfall and green cement producer Cemvision have formed a commercial agreement that enables Vattenfall to fulfil its commitment. Cemvision will supply Vattenfall with 20% of its cement and concrete demand from 2028. Cemvision’s cement, produced leveraging technology using recycled industrial by-products and fossil-free energy, will offer 80% of emission reductions by 2028 and up to 95% by 2030.

Energy equipment manufacturer GE Vernova has contracted zero-emission steel for wind tower production from First Supplier and steel maker SSAB. This material was developed through the integration of hydrogen-reduced iron produced with HYBRIT technology at SSAB’s facility in Iowa. The resulting steel is third-party verified and meets thresholds for near zero emissions established by the International Energy Agency and the First Movers Coalition.

By supporting pilot projects and validating new production methods, companies are helping bring next-generation materials into the commercial mainstream and laying the foundation for decarbonized industrial value chains.

Creating a market for carbon dioxide removal

The development of a durable and diversified carbon dioxide removal ecosystem has long been constrained by the absence of stable demand.

This year, technology giant Microsoft expanded its portfolio of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC) solutions. Its 10-year agreement with heating provider Hafslund Celsio for 1.1 million tonnes of removals, combined with its expanded deal with energy company Stockholm Exergi for 5.08 million tonnes, represents one of the largest corporate carbon removal procurement strategies in the world.

Other successes include Google’s 200,000 tonnes purchase from Terradot’s Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) project. ERW involves spreading finely ground minerals across forest soils, croplands or coastal areas, where they dissolve in water and naturally absorb CO₂, storing it for hundreds to thousands of years.

Together, these agreements amount to more than 6 million tonnes of contracted carbon removals. This represents a significant share of the carbon removal target set within the FMC and is helping shift the economics of the sector by providing long-term revenue certainty and encouraging supplier investment.

What is still needed for industrial decarbonization

Despite significant progress, industrial decarbonization still faces high capital requirements, complex permitting processes and fragmented policy environments.

Broader industry adoption and an enabling policy framework are essential to achieve the scale required for cost convergence with traditional production methods and meaningful global emissions reductions.

More harmonized policies, innovative blended finance mechanisms, sharing costs along the value chain, enabling chain of custody models and diversifying types of contracts can expand pools of demand, which will be essential to accelerate deployment across sectors.

The First Movers Coalition shows that ambitious demand, combined with strategic collaboration, can accelerate decarbonization in even the hardest-to-abate sectors. By investing in supply chains, infrastructure and breakthrough technologies, and by giving emerging suppliers visibility through the First Supplier Hub, companies are shaping the markets that will form the foundation of a net-zero economy.

But there is no room for complacency. This is why the newly released First Movers Coalition’s impact brief takes stock of members’ pathways towards fulfilling their commitments as part of a wider assessment of best practices to catalyse early markets.

Further in 2026, the First Movers Coalition will continue to explore the following questions: What are the mechanisms that have demonstrated they can work in addressing the green premium? How can we leverage new markets and key geographies to ensure the availability of supply and further grow the demand signal and global purchasing power for near-zero products? And who are the new actors and what are the new engagement models that need to be pursued to continue to remain relevant and impactful in a troubled world?",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_sVrJk-sF2pGUfVCdf_KW-oI01w8pL096XoVe-fqkDJ0.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 13:56:44.328775

LATAM Airlines Brazil recorded an 11.9% increase in domestic capacity, while international operations grew 13.9%.
The company said the capacity expansion reflects network adjustments aimed at aligning supply with demand trends in long-haul and intra-regional markets.
Across 2025, LATAM added eight destinations.
The airline attributed its performance to market dynamics in Brazil and the continued normalization of long-haul demand.","LATAM Group transported 87.4 million passengers in 2025, a 6.6% increase compared with 2024, according to the company’s December operational statistics. The expansion was driven by growth in Brazil’s domestic market and a recovery in international travel demand across Latin America and the United States.

In December alone, LATAM carried 7.9 million passengers, up 7.6% year on year. The group expanded consolidated capacity, measured in available seat kilometers (ASK), by 10.9%. LATAM Airlines Brazil recorded an 11.9% increase in domestic capacity, while international operations grew 13.9%.

The company said the capacity expansion reflects network adjustments aimed at aligning supply with demand trends in long-haul and intra-regional markets. LATAM also reported the launch of 10 new routes in December, including two long-haul connections—Santiago–Buenos Aires (Ezeiza)–Miami and Guayaquil–New York—which it described as part of a strategy to strengthen connectivity between South America and North America.

Consolidated passenger traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), rose 10.5% compared with December 2024, while the group’s consolidated load factor reached 84.5% for the month. Cargo capacity, measured in available ton kilometers (ATK), totaled 731 million in December.

Across 2025, LATAM added eight destinations. Fernando de Noronha, Curaçao, and Tucuman expanded the group’s network in Caribbean and South American markets. As of year-end, LATAM served 160 passenger destinations across 27 countries.

The company said that its most active daily routes in 2025 were Cuzco–Lima; São Paulo (Congonhas)–Rio de Janeiro (Santos Dumont); Bogota–Medellín; Arequipa–Lima; and Brasília–São Paulo (Congonhas). LATAM stated that the concentration of flight frequencies on these markets reflects the relative strength of domestic and regional corridors.

The airline attributed its performance to market dynamics in Brazil and the continued normalization of long-haul demand. In its operational report, the airline said its network expansion “responds to sustained demand in domestic markets and adjustments in international itineraries to support connectivity and price competitiveness,” adding that its destination mix helps balance seasonal demand and optimize fleet utilization.

LATAM is also positioning itself as one of the region’s advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development. In July 2025, the carrier signed a five-year agreement with Colombia’s Fedepalma to promote SAF production from palm-based feedstocks and position the country as a regional supplier. The partnership includes engagement with policymakers, technical education initiatives, and visibility campaigns, while leveraging the palm oil sector’s sustainability credentials and economic footprint. LATAM has also operated SAF-powered flights and supported Colombia’s SAF roadmap as part of broader regional efforts to accelerate aviation’s energy transition.

Industry analysts note that LATAM’s growth aligns with broader consolidation trends in Latin America and the recovery of corporate and leisure travel. The expansion of long-haul connectivity is also viewed as a move to strengthen the airline’s competitive positioning ahead of 2026 planning cycles, particularly in trans-American and intra-South American markets.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202026-01-19%20105158.png?h=22b0d429&itok=I08y7i4_,N,,2026-01-19 12:57:00.546167

---------- Oracle Power PLC - developer of projects in Pakistan and Australia - Reports ""further positive results"" from drilling at the Kalgoorlie gold project in Western Australia.
It says the drilling programme has continued to intersect shallow gold mineralisation as it expands the gold footprint at the Northern Zone gold project.","(Alliance News) - The following is a round-up of updates by London-listed companies, issued on Monday and not separately reported by Alliance News:

----------

Panthera Resources PLC - London-based gold explorer and mine developer in West Africa and India - Reports high-grade gold intersections from reverse circulation drilling at its Bido project in Burkina Faso, including a peak result of 1 metre at 19.2 grammes per tonne of gold at the Kwademen prospect. The company says maiden drilling confirms historical mineralisation across several targets, with multiple shallow, high-grade intersections and broad zones remaining open in several directions. Managing Director Mark Bolton says the results support further exploration upside in a rising gold price environment.

----------

Hercules PLC - Cirencester, England-based labour supply company for the UK infrastructure and construction sectors - Expects to publish its delayed full-year results in March, citing additional audit work required following extensive acquisition activity during financial 2025. The firm says the audit process is well advanced, but the volume of acquisitions completed in 2025 extends the timetable for finalising the accounts.

----------

Hydrogen Utopia International PLC - London-based developer of technology to convert non-recyclable waste plastics into hydrogen and other clean energy - Says it is exploring the use of InEnTec technology to support large-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen-derived diesel in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Saudi Arabia. The company said the technology could enable flexible deployment of SAF plants across the region, without the need to co-locate with heavy industrial sites. Preliminary modelling suggests a Saudi-based project could deliver internal rates of return in the high teens, depending on assumptions, with potential capital investment of at least USD800 million per facility. Hydrogen Utopia said it or a local subsidiary could hold a 10% to 20% free-carry equity interest in such projects and earn management fees from the front-end engineering design stage, as it targets rising SAF demand across the MENA region.

----------

Block Energy PLC - Georgia-focused oil and gas company - Completes the farm-out of its XIQ licence in Georgia after receiving government approval, with US-based Aspect Georgia funding a staged work programme estimated at around USD95 million. Under the deal, Aspect Georgia can earn up to a 75% working interest through seismic, exploration and appraisal drilling and early production facilities, fully carried with no capital exposure for Block. The partner also has an option to raise its interest to 92.5% for additional consideration. Block says the completion provides positive read-across for its adjacent acreage, including Project III and the IX licences, with seismic acquisition at XIQ expected to begin in 2026.

----------

United Oil & Gas PLC - mining company with an exploration asset in Jamaica - Says a survey vessel has been mobilised to begin an offshore surface geochemical exploration programme on its Walton Morant licence offshore Jamaica, marking a key step in advancing the project. The company says the R/V Gyre departs Trinidad over the weekend and is expected to arrive in Kingston, Jamaica, within five to six days, with offshore operations due to start on or around January 27 following inspections. The programme will include multibeam echo-sounder surveying, heat-flow measurements, and seabed piston coring. United expects preliminary geochemical results one to two months after survey completion, with final analysis due by mid-2026. The work is aimed at confirming the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbons and further de-risking the basin to support future exploration decisions.

----------

Oracle Power PLC - developer of projects in Pakistan and Australia - Reports ""further positive results"" from drilling at the Kalgoorlie gold project in Western Australia. It says the drilling programme has continued to intersect shallow gold mineralisation as it expands the gold footprint at the Northern Zone gold project. ""It is great to follow on from previous announcements and continue to expand and intersect gold grades in the northeast area and expand the saddle area. We believe these results are very impressive and add significant upside to the project for our plans with our partners for gold production targeted for later this year,"" says Chief Executive Officer Naheed Memon.

----------

Neo Energy Metals PLC - uranium and gold projects in South Africa - Agrees up to GBP8 million of strategic funding from a UK-based investor to support work toward bringing the Beisa uranium and gold mine in South Africa back into production. The company says an initial GBP1.5 million is advanced via a placement of 166.7 million shares at 0.9p each, alongside a further GBP1.0 million raised from other investors on the same terms. Subject to South African regulatory approvals for the Beisa acquisition, the strategic investor may provide a further GBP6.5 million as a convertible loan, priced at a 10% discount to market with a 5% coupon. Separately, Neo Energy agrees with several debt providers to repay around GBP1.2 million through the issue of 130.7 million shares at the same price. Proceeds are to fund the ongoing implementation assessment programme and working capital through completion of the Beisa acquisition, which the company expects in the first quarter of 2026.

----------

Premier African Minerals Ltd - developer of RHA tungsten and Zulu lithium projects in Zimbabwe - Enters into a settlement agreement with contractor J R Goddard to stay enforcement action relating to the Zulu lithium and tantalum project in Zimbabwe. Agrees to settle the claim for a total of USD2.4 million, plus interest, payable through an initial USD400,000 by the end of January, followed by monthly instalments through November 2026. Enforcement action will be suspended as long as the company complies with the payment schedule.

Cette obligation de déclaration peut être remplie via la solution de branche SF6.","La solution de branche SF6,qui a fait ses preuves, sera poursuivie : Swissmem et l’Office fédéral de l’environnement (OFEV) ont signé un Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) actualisé, fixant ainsi les conditions-cadres pour la prochaine période de mise en œuvre de 2026 à 2030. Cet accord confirme l’engagement commun de l’industrie et des autorités à réduire davantage les émissions de SF6 en Suisse.

Nouvelle période avec des plafonds d’émissions plus bas

Pour la nouvelle période de mise en œuvre, les entreprises participantes s’engagent à maintenir les émissions d’hexafluorure de soufre (SF6) dans les deux domaines d’application, à savoir les installations de commutation et les accélérateurs de particules, en dessous des plafonds d’émission à nouveau abaissés. Cela permettra de poursuivre les succès obtenus jusqu’à présent par la solution de branche et d’intensifier encore les efforts visant à réduire les émissions.

La solution de branche volontaire, un instrument éprouvé

La solution de branche SF6 continue de miser sur une approche volontaire et responsable. Cet instrument a fait ses preuves au cours des dernières décennies : grâce à des innovations techniques, à l’optimisation des processus et à une utilisation plus responsable du SF6, les émissions ont pu être considérablement réduites malgré une utilisation parfois croissante au cours des dernières décennies. Compte tenu du potentiel de réchauffement climatique très élevé et de la longue durée de vie du SF6, cela représente une contribution importante à la protection du climat. Le lancement d’un dialogue interne sur une trajectoire de réduction à long terme devrait permettre d’intensifier ces efforts.

Respecter les obligations de déclaration via la solution de branche

Le SF6 est le gaz à effet de serre le plus puissant qui existe et est donc interdit, avec des exceptions. Les utilisations relevant de ces exceptions doivent être déclarées à l’OFEV. Cette obligation de déclaration peut être remplie via la solution de branche SF6. Les entreprises participantes s’engagent à ne pas dépasser le total des plafonds d’émissions fixés. Pour ce faire, le gaz est manipulé avec précaution, les émissions sont évitées dans la mesure du possible et le personnel est formé.

Règles plus strictes dans l’UE et en Suisse

Actuellement, des restrictions plus strictes concernant l’utilisation du SF6 entrent en vigueur tant dans l’UE, dans le cadre du règlement européen sur les gaz fluorés, qu’en Suisse, dans le cadre de l’ordonnance sur la réduction des risques liés aux produits chimiques (ORRChim). Sont concernés les appareils de commutation des niveaux de tension les plus bas, pour lesquels il existe désormais des alternatives techniquement abouties. Les interdictions seront encore étendues au cours des prochaines années.

💡Les acteurs concernés par le SF6 sont impliqués dans la solution de branche, à savoir :

les fabricants et exploitants d’installations de commutation et d’autres installations du réseau d’approvisionnement en électricité,

A global coalition representing business aviation has urged aircraft operators travelling to the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters in 2026 to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) where possible.

The Business Aviation Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel said operators should arrange SAF supplies through their fuel providers or fixed-base operators (FBOs).

It noted that more than 100 FBOs worldwide now offer physical SAF, including Jet Aviation at Zurich Airport, a key gateway for flights heading to the WEF.

For operators flying from airports where SAF is not physically available, the coalition highlighted the use of the “Book and Claim” system as an alternative way to cut emissions and support the SAF market.

Under the Book and Claim model, operators buy SAF at an airport where it is available and receive credits for the associated emissions reductions, even though the fuel is not loaded directly onto their aircraft.

The fuel is instead added to the global supply chain, helping to reduce overall aviation emissions.

The coalition includes major industry bodies such as the Canadian Business Aviation Association (CBAA), European Business Aviation Association (EBAA), National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), International Business Aviation Council (IBAC), National Air Transportation Association (NATA) and the Vertical Aviation International (VAI).

Geopolitical Tailwinds: Increased NATO defense spending and Pacific security initiatives are direct drivers for the Defense & Propulsion segment.","As of January 19, 2026, the industrial landscape of the United States has been fundamentally redefined by the emergence of GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) as a standalone powerhouse. Once the sprawling centerpiece of a multi-industry conglomerate, the company now stands as a pure-play aviation titan, commanding a dominant position in both commercial and military propulsion. Today, GE Aerospace is no longer judged by the complexity of its balance sheet, but by the efficiency of its production lines and the sheer magnitude of its $175 billion backlog.

With the global aviation sector navigating a ""super-cycle"" of demand and geopolitical tensions driving a resurgence in defense spending, GE Aerospace has become a critical barometer for the health of global trade and national security. This article provides a comprehensive deep dive into the strategic maneuvers, financial triumphs, and operational hurdles that define the company in early 2026.

Historical Background

The story of GE Aerospace is a narrative of radical transformation. For over a century, General Electric was the quintessential American conglomerate, founded on the innovations of Thomas Edison. However, decades of overexpansion and the financial crisis of 2008 left the company burdened by debt and a fragmented focus.

The turning point arrived in 2018 with the appointment of Larry Culp as CEO—the first outsider to lead the firm. Culp initiated a multi-year ""de-risking"" strategy that culminated in the historic announcement in November 2021 to split the company into three independent entities: GE HealthCare, GE Vernova (Energy), and GE Aerospace. Following the successful spin-off of GE Vernova in April 2024, GE Aerospace officially inherited the ""GE"" ticker and the company’s storied legacy in flight. This transition marked the end of the conglomerate era and the beginning of a focused mission: to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely.

Business Model

GE Aerospace operates a ""razor-and-blade"" business model that is the envy of the industrial world. The company’s revenue is divided into two primary segments: Commercial Engines & Services and Defense & Propulsion Technologies.

Commercial Engines & Services: This is the company’s primary engine of growth. GE, often through its 50/50 joint venture with Safran (CFM International), manufactures the engines that power the majority of the world’s narrowbody and widebody aircraft. However, the true profit center is the Services segment. Jet engines are sold with long-term service agreements (LTSAs) that ensure high-margin recurring revenue for 25 to 30 years. Approximately 85% of the commercial backlog is tied to these aftermarket services.

Defense & Propulsion Technologies: This segment provides engines for military fighters, bombers, helicopters, and marine applications. GE’s defense business is deeply integrated with the U.S. Department of Defense and international allies, benefiting from long-cycle contracts and high barriers to entry.

Stock Performance Overview

Over the past two years, GE Aerospace has been one of the top performers in the S&P 500.

1-Year Performance: In 2025, GE shares surged by more than 45%, driven by consistent earnings beats and the successful integration of its ""Flight Deck"" lean operating model.

5-Year Performance: Looking back to 2021, the stock’s trajectory represents a classic turnaround. From the depths of the pandemic-driven aviation slump, shares have risen over 250%, reflecting the market's approval of the company’s simplified structure and debt reduction.

10-Year Performance: On a decade-long horizon, the chart tells a story of ""addition by subtraction."" After years of stagnation under the conglomerate model, the 2024 spin-off unlocked significant value, with the stock currently trading near record highs of $330 in early 2026.

Financial Performance

The financial profile of GE Aerospace in 2026 is characterized by robust top-line growth and exceptional cash generation.

Revenue: After reporting $38.7 billion in 2024, revenue for 2025 is estimated to have surpassed $45 billion, representing high-teens growth. This growth is fueled by a massive increase in LEAP engine deliveries and a surge in military engine output.

Margins: Operating margins have expanded significantly as the company shifts more of its mix toward high-margin aftermarket services and improves factory floor efficiency.

Free Cash Flow (FCF): GE Aerospace is a ""cash machine,"" with 2025 FCF expected to exceed $7 billion. This liquidity has enabled the company to execute a $15 billion share buyback program and increase its dividend by 30% over the last year.

Backlog: The total backlog stands at a record $175 billion, providing nearly a decade of revenue visibility.

Leadership and Management

The leadership of GE Aerospace is centered on Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. Culp has been widely credited with saving General Electric from financial ruin. His management style is defined by ""Lean"" manufacturing principles—a philosophy he brought from his tenure at Danaher.

Under Culp, GE Aerospace has implemented FLIGHT DECK, a proprietary lean operating model that prioritizes safety, quality, delivery, and cost (SQDC). The leadership team’s focus has shifted from high-level financial engineering to the ""gemba""—the actual place where work is done—deploying hundreds of engineers into supplier sites to de-bottleneck the supply chain. This disciplined approach has restored investor confidence and created a culture of continuous improvement.

Products, Services, and Innovations

GE Aerospace’s product portfolio is headlined by the most advanced propulsion systems in the world:

CFM LEAP: The workhorse of the narrowbody fleet, powering the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo families. In 2026, production is ramping toward 2,000 units annually.

GE9X: As of January 2026, the GE9X is entering service on the Boeing 777X. It is the world’s largest and most powerful jet engine, featuring 3D-printed parts and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) that allow it to operate at much higher temperatures than previous generations.

Defense Innovations: The T901 turboshaft engine is currently being integrated into the U.S. Army’s Black Hawk and Apache fleets, offering significantly more power and better fuel efficiency. Meanwhile, the XA100 and XA102 adaptive cycle engines are positioning GE for the next generation of air dominance.

Competitive Landscape

The aerospace engine market is an oligopoly with intense rivalry.

Pratt & Whitney (RTX): GE’s primary competitor. While Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine is a strong rival to the LEAP, it has faced significant durability issues and recalls in recent years, allowing GE to capture market share and maintain higher reliability ratings.

Rolls-Royce: Competes primarily in the widebody market. While Rolls-Royce has undergone its own successful turnaround, it lacks the massive narrowbody volume that GE enjoys through the CFM joint venture.

Safran: A key partner through the CFM International joint venture, which has proven to be one of the most successful partnerships in industrial history.

GE’s competitive edge lies in its installed base. With more than 44,000 commercial engines in service, the company’s ""moat"" is built on the indispensable nature of its maintenance and repair services.

Industry and Market Trends

The aviation sector in 2026 is defined by several macro drivers:

The Engine Replacement Cycle: Airlines are aggressively replacing older, less efficient aircraft with newer models to meet sustainability goals and reduce fuel costs, driving demand for the LEAP and GE9X.

Defense Modernization: Escalating geopolitical tensions have led to a ""re-arming"" of Western nations, focusing on next-generation fighter capabilities and engine longevity.

Sustainability: The industry is pivoting toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and hybrid-electric propulsion. GE is at the forefront of this, testing ""Open Fan"" architectures through the RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program.

Risks and Challenges

Despite its strengths, GE Aerospace faces several formidable risks:

Supply Chain Fragility: The ""engines-out"" rate at Boeing and Airbus is still largely dictated by GE’s ability to source castings, forgings, and raw materials. Any disruption in the tier-2 or tier-3 supplier base can stall deliveries.

Customer Concentration: GE’s fortunes are heavily tied to Boeing. Persistent delays or quality control issues at Boeing (NYSE: BA) directly impact GE’s original equipment (OE) revenue.

Valuation Risk: With the stock trading at a high forward P/E multiple (approaching 40x-50x), the market has priced in near-perfection. Any operational miss or downward revision in FCF guidance could lead to significant volatility.

Opportunities and Catalysts

GE9X Entry into Service: The successful commercial launch of the 777X in 2026 is a massive catalyst for widebody revenue growth.

Defense Step-Change: The ramp-up of the T901 engine and potential awards for the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program represent multi-billion-dollar opportunities.

Aftermarket ""Tail"": As the 2020-2024 delivery vintage of LEAP engines begins their first major shop visits toward the end of the decade, service revenue is expected to accelerate even further.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish on GE Aerospace. Major institutions like BlackRock and Vanguard have maintained significant positions, viewing the company as a ""compounding machine."" Analyst consensus is a ""Strong Buy,"" with price targets frequently adjusted upward to reflect the company’s superior cash conversion.

Retail sentiment is also high, driven by the clarity of the new business model. Unlike the old ""Black Box"" GE, the new GE Aerospace is seen as a transparent, high-quality industrial compounder that rewards shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

GE Aerospace operates in a highly regulated environment.

FAA and EASA Oversight: Continuous certification and safety audits are a way of life. The company has worked closely with regulators to resolve LEAP durability issues, strengthening its reputation for safety.

Export Controls: As a major defense contractor, GE is subject to strict ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) controls, which dictate where and to whom it can sell high-tech propulsion systems.

Geopolitical Tailwinds: Increased NATO defense spending and Pacific security initiatives are direct drivers for the Defense & Propulsion segment.

Conclusion

As of January 19, 2026, GE Aerospace has successfully completed its metamorphosis from a struggling conglomerate to a world-class aviation leader. By focusing on its core strengths—unrivaled engineering and a high-margin service model—the company has built a $175 billion backlog that ensures relevance for decades to come.

For investors, the case for GE Aerospace is one of operational excellence. While supply chain constraints and high valuations remain points of caution, the leadership’s commitment to ""Lean"" and the ""super-cycle"" in aviation demand provide a powerful tailwind. As the GE9X takes to the skies and the next generation of defense engines enters production, GE Aerospace is not just participating in the future of flight—it is defining it.

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is experiencing exceptional growth, projected to expand from $3.72 billion in 2025 to $5.75 billion in 2026, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54.5%. This remarkable growth is driven by regulatory mandates to curb aviation carbon emissions, early adoption of bio-based feedstocks, advancements in sustainable fuel technologies, and increased airline commitments to renewable fuels. The establishment of infrastructure for blending and distribution also plays a significant role.

Looking ahead, the SAF market is expected to surge further, reaching $26.1 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 46%. Contributing factors include large-scale production capacity expansion, investment in innovative feedstocks like algae, and AI integration for biofuel conversion. The rise in SAF adoption globally, alongside development of robust logistics for airport supply chains, is pivotal in this forecast period. Key trends include the expansion of waste-to-fuel, advancements in high-efficiency biofuel technologies, and greater use of SAF blends in commercial flights.

Biofuels remain central to the SAF market growth, in line with a global shift toward sustainability and aviation's commitment to reducing greenhouse gases. For instance, Eurostat reported an increase in the EU's renewable energy use from 23% in 2022 to 24.5% in 2023. This trend bolsters the SAF market as biofuels help airlines reduce their carbon footprints significantly.

Key players are innovating with technologies aimed at minimizing aviation's environmental impacts. In September 2023, Lummus Technology introduced an ethanol-based SAF technology, optimizing large-scale solutions to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This involves integrating ethanol to ethylene, olefin oligomerization, and hydrogenation to boost SAF yield while lowering costs and emissions.

Strategic mergers are shaping the industry landscape. In April 2024, Southwest Airlines Co. acquired SAFFiRE Renewables LLC, enhancing its Nonstop to Net Zero initiative. SAFFiRE's technology converts agricultural residues into renewable ethanol for low-carbon jet fuel, supporting scalable SAF production.

Major companies in the market include Shell plc, TotalEnergies SE, BP plc, and Neste Oyj, among others. North America led the market in 2025, but the Middle East is expected to be the fastest-growing region going forward. The market encompasses various geographies, including Asia-Pacific, Europe, and South America, reflecting a broad international scope.

Rising regulatory and sustainability pressures, including the EU Deforestation Regulation and full ETS exposure from 2026, are increasing costs and complexity, forcing operators to balance demand growth against compliance burdens.

Volatility in rates, capacity and geopolitics is accelerating the shift toward AI, automation and data-driven platforms, making digital tools essential for forecasting, visibility and flexible routing rather than optional add-ons.

The European air cargo market posted a resilient 4.3 percent year-on-year demand increase by October 2025, but that headline masks a deeper reconfiguration. The defining trend was the redirection of trade flows, with the Europe-Asia corridor becoming the world’s strongest major lane, surging 11.7 percent in October.

This spike was driven largely by “a pivot from Chinese e-commerce giants towards European consumers and the need to adapt supply chains amid global trade policy shifts.” In contrast, intra-European cargo volumes dipped slightly, underscoring the uneven distribution of growth across the continent.

Automation moves forward

On the operational side, Europe saw a mixed picture. While digitalisation continued to advance — including systems like Germany’s mandatory “Secure Release Order” for port containers – complexity increased elsewhere. “Operational procedures saw both simplification and complexity,” says Alexey Zotov, Managing Director of Air Cargo Green Capabilities S.a.r.l., part of ACN Group.

The regulatory horizon is adding new costs and risk. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), taking effect in January 2026, will require “extensive due diligence documentation for key commodities, risking customs holds for non-compliance.” Meanwhile, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) continues its phase-out of free allowances, directly impacting airline margins.

“The key will be balancing this demand against rising regulatory and sustainability costs,” Zotov notes, pointing to growing pressure on operators to absorb or offset compliance-related burdens.

Growth goes global

Globally, 2025 defied gloomy expectations with projected three to four percent growth in air cargo demand. Africa led regional performance with 16.6 percent growth in October, while Asia-Pacific recorded 8.3 percent, buoyed by “high-value tech and AI-related shipments.”

North America was the weak link. US policy changes – including “high tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption for low-value packages” – contributed to a six-month contraction on the crucial Asia-North America corridor. This pushed carriers to shift capacity and supply chains to more stable regions.

“Freighters were reallocated, and production moved to Southeast Asia and India,” explains Zotov. As a result, “lanes like Middle East-Asia and Within Asia saw near double-digit growth as supply chains adapted.”

But volatility brought complications. Spot rates globally were down six percent year-on-year in early December, but “specific lanes like China-U.S. saw rates spike to their highest annual level.” In response, shippers grew cautious. “This uncertainty made shippers wary, leading to a preference for shorter, 6-month contracts over long-term commitments to maintain flexibility.”

“Freighter utilisation remained high, particularly for perishables… and on growing corridors like Africa-Asia.” However, dedicated freighter availability saw “sharp double-digit declines” from mid-year — a shift partially absorbed by returning passenger bellyhold capacity, particularly on transatlantic routes.

This mismatch caused rate pressure in some regions. Despite growing demand, the influx of bellyhold capacity generally kept global spot rates under downward pressure. But as the peak season arrived, “space on key lanes like Asia-Europe and Asia-US tightened, driving rates up by mid-to-high single digits.”

AI and automation shift from nice-to-have to must-have

Infrastructure strain also persisted – congestion at major hubs and weather events (like Super Typhoon Ragasa) continued to challenge reliable transit times. Against this backdrop, digital tools moved from convenience to necessity. AI-powered platforms for booking, document automation (like data extraction from bills of lading), and real-time visibility became operational necessities, moving from ‘nice-to-have’ to core infrastructure for agile decision-making.

“From 2026, EU airlines will have to account for 100 percent of their emissions under the ETS, increasing costs and incentivising investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and fuel-efficient aircraft.” As Zotov puts it: “Environmental costs will become a permanent part of freight pricing.”

Another cost headwind looms in e-commerce. New EU customs fees on low-value packages from 2026 may dampen volumes, putting pressure on a sector that has propped up air cargo demand since the pandemic.

Geopolitical shifts are also quietly changing modal dynamics. “A gradual return of ocean shipping to the Suez Canal may recapture some cargo that shifted to air due to longer sea transits.”

“The volatility of recent years has proven that flexibility is paramount. Success will depend on leveraging AI for forecasting, maintaining diversified sourcing and routing strategies, and using data-driven platforms for end-to-end visibility and agile mode switching.”

From 2026, EU carriers will face full ETS exposure, with no free emissions allowances – a structural cost that reshapes margins, not just for airlines but across the chain. For carriers, that means accelerating investment in SAF and fuel efficiency. Forwarders will need to re-price services more dynamically and help shippers navigate compliance complexity. And for shippers: environmental costs are no longer an externality – they’re baked into the freight bill.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/page-8-.webp,N,,2026-01-19 10:58:31.620145

Abstract

The aviation industry, responsible for approximately 2.5–3.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, faces increasing pressure to adopt sustainable energy solutions. Hydrogen, with its high gravimetric energy density and zero carbon emissions during use, has emerged as a promising alternative fuel to support aviation decarbonization. However, its large-scale implementation remains hindered by cryogenic storage requirements, safety risks, infrastructure adaptation, and economic constraints. This study aims to identify and evaluate the primary technical and operational risks associated with hydrogen utilization in aviation through a comprehensive Monte Carlo Simulation-based risk assessment. The analysis specifically focuses on four key domains—hydrogen leakage, cryogenic storage, explosion hazards, and infrastructure challenges—while excluding economic and lifecycle aspects to maintain a technical scope only. A 10,000-iteration simulation was conducted to quantify the probability and impact of each risk factor. Results indicate that hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards represent the most critical risks, with mean risk scores exceeding 20 on a 25-point scale, whereas investment costs and technical expertise were ranked as comparatively low-level risks. Based on these findings, strategic mitigation measures—including real-time leak detection systems, composite cryotank technologies, and standardized safety protocols—are proposed to enhance system reliability and support the safe integration of hydrogen-powered aviation. This study contributes to a data-driven understanding of hydrogen-related risks and provides a technological roadmap for advancing carbon-neutral air transport.

1. Introduction

The aviation industry plays a central role in global connectivity and economic development, contributing approximately 2.7 trillion USD to global GDP and employing over 65 million people as of 2016 [1]. However, it is also a major source of environmental concern, accounting for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nearly 3.5% of total anthropogenic global warming [2,3]. With global air traffic expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.8% [4], achieving decarbonization in aviation has become one of the most complex challenges in the energy transition era. Kerosene remains the dominant aviation fuel, and short- and medium-haul flights contribute approximately 70% of aviation-related CO2 emissions, while long-haul operations exacerbate non-CO2 climate effects such as contrails and nitrogen oxides [5,6,7].

In the broader energy landscape, the global energy market—valued at approximately 1.5 trillion USD—remains predominantly dependent on fossil fuels [8]. These finite resources contribute substantially to environmental degradation, including air pollution and global warming, rendering them unsustainable in the long term [9,10,11]. In response to these challenges, hydrogen has emerged as a key alternative energy carrier capable of drastically reducing GHG emissions when produced from renewable resources. Hydrogen’s high gravimetric energy density and its ability to produce only water vapor during electrochemical conversion make it a particularly appealing candidate for sustainable aviation [12,13].

Hydrogen’s potential to decarbonize aviation stems from its dual applicability in both combustion and fuel cell systems. When utilized in fuel cells, hydrogen produces zero carbon emissions and significantly reduces non-CO2 effects, including nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), contrails, and particulate matter [14,15]. Furthermore, hydrogen can be produced through multiple pathways—such as electrolysis, thermochemical conversion, and biomass reforming—enabling its integration within a broader renewable energy ecosystem [7,12]. Compared to synthetic aviation fuels and biofuels, which still involve partial carbon cycles, hydrogen offers superior environmental performance and long-term sustainability potential.

Despite its advantages and economic benefits [16], the adoption of hydrogen in aviation presents major technical, infrastructural, and operational challenges. These include cryogenic storage at extremely low temperatures (−253 °C), low volumetric energy density, hydrogen embrittlement in structural materials, and the need for comprehensive redesign of fuel delivery and airport infrastructure systems [17,18]. Additionally, hydrogen’s wide flammability range (4–75%) and low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ) introduce significant safety concerns during storage, transport, and refueling operations [13]. The complexity of these issues is further magnified by the aviation sector’s strict safety and certification requirements [19], making large-scale hydrogen integration technologically and economically demanding.

In the United States alone, transportation accounts for approximately 33% of total GHG emissions—75% originating from road traffic—followed by energy generation (41%), industry and agriculture (16%), and other sources (10%) [20]. This emphasizes the necessity of a clean energy transition across all sectors, particularly aviation, which remains one of the hardest industries to decarbonize. Several studies have discussed hydrogen’s potential role in mitigating aviation emissions [12,17]; however, most have focused primarily on conceptual designs or the theoretical benefits of hydrogen systems, without providing quantitative assessments of the associated technical risks. Moreover, comprehensive probabilistic analyses that evaluate uncertainties in hydrogen leakage, explosion hazards, or cryogenic storage challenges remain scarce [21].

To address this gap, the present study applies a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework to identify, quantify, and prioritize the key technical risks involved in the adoption of hydrogen as an aviation fuel. Monte Carlo Simulation is a well-established probabilistic modeling technique that enables the analysis of uncertainty and variability in complex engineering systems, making it especially suitable for hydrogen risk assessment [22,23]. By generating a large number of random iterations for probability and impact parameters, the method provides statistically robust distributions for each identified risk, supporting data-driven decision-making in safety and design processes.

Accordingly, this study aims to systematically evaluate the technical risks associated with hydrogen-powered aviation and to propose targeted mitigation strategies for safe implementation. The research distinguishes itself from existing studies by integrating quantitative risk analysis with a probabilistic modeling approach, offering a more objective and data-centered framework. The study focuses exclusively on technical and operational risks, excluding economic feasibility and lifecycle emission assessments, to maintain a well-defined analytical scope. The outcomes are expected to inform policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders about priority areas for risk mitigation and infrastructure development aligned with global decarbonization goals.

In this context, the study is guided by two primary research questions:

What are the main technical and operational risks associated with the use of hydrogen in aviation?

Which of these risks require urgent mitigation to ensure the safe and scalable adoption of hydrogen as an aviation fuel?

1.1. Transition from Kerosene to Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Aviation’s dependence on kerosene-based fuels remains a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution [5]. While electric propulsion could theoretically reduce operating costs by up to 90%, current lithium-based batteries provide only 5–8% of kerosene’s energy density, limiting range and payload capacity; for example, the Alpha Electro achieves only ~90 nautical miles [24]. These constraints have accelerated interest in higher–specific energy alternatives such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). SAF pathways—including e-kerosene produced from power-to-liquid processes—can reduce life-cycle emissions by up to 80% and remain compatible with existing aircraft systems [17,25]. Certified producers such as Gevo, Lanzajet, and Neste have already supplied ASTM D7566–approved SAF to airlines [26]. Nevertheless, several SAF options face economic and scalability limitations, with current production representing less than 1% of global aviation fuel demand and costing three to five times more than conventional jet fuel [7,17]. These constraints highlight SAF’s value as a transitional decarbonization strategy but also underscore the need for hydrogen as a long-term solution.

1.2. Research Gap and Rationale for a Risk-Based Analysis of Hydrogen in Aviation

Although multiple studies emphasize hydrogen’s potential for near-zero-emission aviation, most assessments focus on isolated technical aspects—such as combustion, cryogenic storage, or propulsion design—rather than integrated risk evaluation [12,18,21]. Existing research rarely quantifies the combined probability and impact of hydrogen-related hazards, and there is a clear absence of probabilistic modeling frameworks in this domain. While Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) has been used effectively in other engineering risk analyses, its application to hydrogen aviation remains limited [22,23]. No previous study integrates Delphi-based expert elicitation with high-iteration Monte Carlo modeling to simultaneously evaluate leakage, cryogenic failure, explosion hazards, and infrastructure adaptation. This gap restricts the development of data-driven safety standards. Therefore, the present study introduces one of the first comprehensive probabilistic risk hierarchies for hydrogen aviation by generating 10,000-iteration stochastic distributions for major technical hazards.

1.3. Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft: Environmental Advantages and Engineering Challenges

Hydrogen offers substantial sustainability benefits due to its high gravimetric energy density and near-zero carbon emissions when used in fuel-cell propulsion [12,13]. Combustion or electrochemical conversion produces no particulate matter and markedly lower NOₓ emissions compared to kerosene [17]. However, hydrogen’s physical properties impose significant engineering challenges: liquid hydrogen must be stored at approximately −253 °C and occupies nearly four times the volume of kerosene, increasing risks of leakage, embrittlement, and cryogenic failure [18,21]. Its wide flammability range (4–75%) and extremely low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ) elevate explosion and fire hazards during operations [17]. Furthermore, scaling hydrogen-powered aviation requires major modifications to aircraft architecture, refueling systems, ground operations, and maintenance protocols. Although prototypes such as Airbus ZEROe and ZeroAvia fuel-cell demonstrators validate fundamental feasibility, commercial adoption remains limited by storage, infrastructure, and cost constraints.

1.4. Hydrogen as an Aviation Fuel: Opportunities and Barriers

Hydrogen represents one of the most promising long-term decarbonization pathways due to its high specific energy and potential for near-zero life-cycle emissions when produced from renewable electricity [4,7,12,17]. However, cost barriers remain substantial, as green hydrogen production is typically three to five times more expensive than fossil-derived jet fuels. Engineering and safety challenges—including hydrogen’s diffusivity, low ignition energy, and cryogenic storage requirements—also necessitate advanced materials and robust detection systems [18,27]. Infrastructure adaptation remains one of the most significant barriers, requiring modernization of airport refueling systems, cryogenic logistics, and global safety standards [17]. While hydrogen-powered aviation can virtually eliminate CO2 and particulate emissions, its successful adoption depends on coordinated innovation in fuel production, aircraft integration, and international regulatory frameworks [28].

2. Methodology

This study employs the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method to evaluate the probabilistic nature of technical risks associated with hydrogen integration in aviation. The MCS was selected due to its strong capability to model uncertainty and generate statistically reliable likelihood–impact distributions in situations where empirical failure data are limited—particularly relevant for emerging hydrogen propulsion technologies at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4–6.

A systematic literature review was conducted using Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases to identify relevant research published between 2000 and 2024. The search utilized keywords such as hydrogen aviation, sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen combustion, Monte Carlo risk analysis, and cryogenic storage. Peer-reviewed studies addressing technical, environmental, and safety-related aspects of hydrogen applications were included, while non-academic or outdated sources were excluded. The final dataset consisted of approximately 80 studies forming the foundation for defining the risk domains and their input parameters.

Four primary risk categories were identified:

Hydrogen leakage;

Cryogenic storage challenges;

Explosion hazards;

Infrastructure adaptation.

Each risk was characterized by two parameters: Probability (P) and Impact (I). These parameters were initially defined through a combination of literature-based evidence and expert judgment from four academic specialists in combustion, hydrogen combustion dynamics, and reactive flow mechanisms. Experts independently reviewed the literature-derived ranges and then refined these values through a Delphi-based consensus process.

In this study, expert elicitation was conducted with four academic specialists who work directly in the fields of combustion, hydrogen combustion dynamics, and reactive flow mechanisms. All experts hold doctoral degrees and have active research experience in hydrogen-based propulsion and high-temperature reactive flows. They were selected based on their publication records, ongoing research projects, and specific expertise related to hydrogen safety. Each expert contributed independently during the Delphi rounds, ensuring unbiased parameter estimation and increasing the methodological robustness of the probability and impact ranges.

2.1. Rationale for Probability Calculation Method

The probability values used for each risk factor were modeled using uniform distributions due to the limited availability of empirical incident data specific to hydrogen-powered aviation. Because hydrogen systems in aviation remain at TRL 4–6, neither historical failure rates nor validated parametric probability distributions (e.g., beta, triangular, gamma) are available. Under such conditions of data scarcity, uniform distributions are widely recommended in probabilistic safety modeling because they avoid introducing artificial skewness, distribute epistemic uncertainty evenly across expert-defined ranges, and prevent distortions arising from unsupported assumptions about the shape of the probability density function.

Although more sophisticated distributions may provide higher realism in mature systems, their parameters cannot be reliably estimated in the current stage of hydrogen aviation development. Therefore, uniform sampling was chosen as the most theoretically justified and methodologically robust approach for representing uncertainty in this study.

In addition to the limited availability of empirical reliability data for hydrogen–aviation systems, alternative probability distributions such as triangular or beta were not used because their parameters (minimum, mode, shape factors) require mathematically consistent calibration. At present, no validated datasets exist for deriving such parameters, and expert estimates did not converge sufficiently to support higher-order distributions. Using these distributions without robust parameterization could create misleading peaks or artificial skewness in the probability space, thereby reducing the credibility of the simulation. In contrast, the uniform distribution reflects epistemic uncertainty transparently and avoids implying a central tendency that cannot be supported by evidence. For emerging technologies with highly incomplete data—as recognized in probabilistic safety research—uniform sampling remains the most defensible and scientifically conservative approach.

2.2. Parameter Definition and Validation Process

To enhance transparency, the probability (P) and impact (I) intervals were established using a structured two-step procedure:

Literature-based parameter extraction: Initial minimum–maximum ranges were derived from published hydrogen safety research addressing leak diffusion characteristics, flammability limits, ignition energy, cryogenic tank behavior, and historical industrial incidents.

Delphi-based expert refinement: Initial minimum–maximum ranges were derived from published hydrogen safety research addressing leak diffusion characteristics, flammability limits, ignition energy, cryogenic tank behavior, and historical industrial incidents.

The Delphi process was conducted over two rounds, during which each expert independently reviewed the literature-derived parameter ranges. Consensus was defined using a ±10% agreement threshold, and any divergence in estimates was resolved through moderated discussion, ensuring coherent and unbiased convergence.

Validation: Final parameter ranges were validated by comparing them with published hydrogen safety benchmarks and existing probabilistic studies in related sectors (e.g., industrial hydrogen systems, fuel-cell automotive applications). These comparisons confirmed that the defined ranges aligned with observed hydrogen hazard behavior.

2.3. Monte Carlo Simulation Procedure

In this study, Monte Carlo Simulation was used to quantify the uncertainty associated with each hydrogen-related risk factor. For every risk category, continuous probability (P) and impact (I) values were generated over 10,000 iterations using expert-defined minimum–maximum intervals. Each iteration produced a continuous risk score defined as:

R = P × I

The raw simulation results were summarized using their mean, standard deviation, and 10th–90th percentile ranges to capture variability and uncertainty in the underlying distributions.

Although the inputs for P and I were sampled uniformly, the resulting risk score RRR is not uniform because it is a multiplicative transformation of two variables. For this reason, the percentile values of RRR are not expected to be perfectly symmetric around the mean. This mild asymmetry—observed, for example, in the 10th–90th percentile bounds—is therefore a normal statistical outcome of the model structure and does not indicate any computational inconsistency.

After obtaining continuous P, I, and R values, the results were converted into the discrete 1–5 scoring format required by standard aviation risk matrices. To ensure consistency with ICAO/EASA qualitative scales, all continuous values were first normalized to their respective minimum–maximum ranges and then divided into five equal-width categories (1 = very low, …, 5 = very high). Each simulated value was assigned to its corresponding category, and the final risk matrix scores were derived using these discrete classes.

Because the continuous simulation outputs and the discrete matrix scores represent different stages of the analysis, their numerical ranges are not identical. For example, continuous impact magnitudes such as 16–20 for hydrogen leakage or 20–25 for explosion hazards reflect raw simulation values, whereas the corresponding matrix entries (e.g., I = 5 for leakage and I = 4 for explosion) are the normalized and categorized representations of these values. Thus, any apparent discrepancy between continuous ranges and final matrix scores is an expected and mathematically consistent result of the discretization process.

2.4. Sensitivity Analysis Approach

To identify which input parameters exert the strongest influence on the simulated risk scores, a post-simulation sensitivity analysis was conducted. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations of each risk score and the corresponding Probability (P) and Impact (I) parameters. This non-parametric approach was selected due to its robustness against non-linear relationships. Higher correlation values indicate stronger sensitivity of the risk score to changes in the respective parameter. The resulting correlation patterns enabled the identification of dominant risk drivers and highlighted which variables require improved empirical data in future research.

2.5. Assumptions and Limitations

The model assumes statistical independence between risk factors. While hydrogen leakage, cryogenic failures, and explosion hazards may be interdependent in real systems, empirical correlation coefficients for aviation applications do not yet exist. Incorporating unsupported dependencies could distort results; therefore independence was adopted as a conservative assumption. This may slightly underestimate total system risk in cases where multiple hazards interact.

3. Findings

This study identified eight primary risk factors associated with the integration of hydrogen into aviation systems. Each risk represents a critical area requiring attention to ensure the safe and efficient deployment of hydrogen-powered aircraft. These factors are summarized and explained below:

Hydrogen Leakage: The high diffusivity and wide flammability range of hydrogen significantly increase the risk of leaks and subsequent ignition. To minimize this hazard, advanced leak detection sensors and fire prevention technologies must be employed [7].

Cryogenic Storage Challenges: Storing liquid hydrogen at extremely low temperatures (−253 °C) requires specialized, highly insulated tanks. These systems pose major engineering, design, and cost challenges for both aircraft and ground infrastructure [12].

Explosion Risk in Storage and Transport: Due to its low ignition energy and high chemical reactivity, hydrogen is prone to explosion hazards during storage and transport. Implementing strict safety standards and international handling protocols is essential to mitigate this risk [18].

High Investment Costs: Transitioning airports and maintenance facilities to support hydrogen operations demands substantial financial investments, including the construction of dedicated refueling, compression, and storage systems [29].

Low Volumetric Energy Density: Hydrogen’s low volumetric energy density necessitates larger fuel tanks, which affect aircraft design, weight distribution, and aerodynamic performance [17].

Wide Ignition Range: Hydrogen can ignite across a broad concentration range in air (4–75%), creating considerable safety challenges during handling and refueling. Advanced insulation systems and continuous leak monitoring are therefore required [7,17].

Infrastructure Development Requirements: The introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft calls for new airport infrastructure, including cryogenic storage facilities, refueling systems, and specialized ground personnel training [13].

Limited Technical Expertise: The operation and maintenance of hydrogen propulsion systems demand specialized knowledge in cryogenics, fuel cell technology, and safety management. A lack of technical competence can compromise both system reliability and operational safety [17,29].

Using Monte Carlo Simulation, this study evaluated the probabilistic behavior of these eight critical risk factors. Each factor was modeled according to two main parameters: likelihood of occurrence and severity of impact. The simulations produced quantitative risk matrices that classified outcomes into three levels of risk intensity:

Low risk: Risk score <10;

Moderate risk: Risk score between 10 and 17;

High risk: Risk score ≥17.

This classification framework provides a clear visualization of how each risk contributes to the overall safety profile of hydrogen-powered aviation systems. It also serves as a foundation for prioritizing mitigation strategies and guiding future research and investment efforts toward the most critical technical challenges.

The visualizations above represent individual risk matrices generated for each risk factor through Monte Carlo Simulation.

Risk matrices are given in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8. Uncertainty indicators based on the 10th–90th percentile Monte Carlo outputs were integrated into each matrix to better reflect the stochastic behavior of the simulated risks. Complementary visualizations, including histograms and percentile-based distribution plots, were also added to illustrate the variability and dispersion of the 10,000-iteration Monte Carlo outputs.

According to the Monte Carlo Simulation outcomes, hydrogen leakage emerged as the most critical risk for hydrogen-fueled aircraft. Its probability of occurrence exceeds 0.70, with a severe impact level between 24–28, requiring advanced safety and monitoring systems. Similarly, the risk of explosion during storage and transport showed a high probability (0.65–0.80) and severe impact (25–30), emphasizing the need for strict safety standards and real-time monitoring during handling and refueling.

Cryogenic storage challenges were classified as medium to high risk, with moderate probability but high impact due to the technical complexity of maintaining hydrogen at −253 °C. The wide flammability range of hydrogen also represents a major hazard, necessitating rapid detection and response mechanisms.

High investment costs and low energy density were evaluated as low-level risks that can be managed through proper planning and system optimization. Infrastructure requirements were assessed as medium risk, sometimes nearing high due to the complexity of airport adaptations. The lack of technical expertise was identified as the lowest risk, mitigable through training and professional development.

Overall, hydrogen leakage, explosion risk, and flammability range should be prioritized in safety planning. Hydrogen leakage remains the most critical issue due to its high diffusivity and broad flammability range (4–75% in air), which increase the risk of undetected accumulation and ignition. Effective mitigation requires real-time leak detection, high-integrity seal materials, and forced ventilation systems integrated into aircraft fuel architectures [18].

Explosion risk during cryogenic storage arises from low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ), phase transition volatility, and material embrittlement at cryogenic temperatures. Ongoing developments—such as composite cryotanks, pressure relief systems, and automated inerting mechanisms—are progressing but remain at TRL 4–6, requiring further operational validation [30]. Likewise, boil-off management and insulation degradation remain persistent storage challenges. Double-walled, vacuum-insulated tanks with vapor recovery systems appear promising but demand careful integration into aircraft design.

In conclusion, risk mitigation must align with both engineering feasibility and technology readiness levels (TRLs) to ensure safe, scalable adoption of hydrogen-powered aviation.

General Distribution of Risk Scores: The mean risk scores and statistical distribution results obtained from the simulation are presented in the Table 1.

3.1. Interpretation of Results

The simulation results revealed clear differences in the significance and variability of the identified risk factors associated with hydrogen integration in aviation. The findings can be interpreted as follows:

Hydrogen Leakage and Flammability Range: Identified as the most critical risks due to their high probability and severe impact (Mean: 20.29; SD: 1.84).

Explosion Risk: Exhibited the highest variability (SD: 2.85), indicating wide fluctuations in probability and impact under different conditions.

High Investment Costs and Limited Technical Expertise: Considered lower-priority risks with comparatively low scores (Mean: 8.80), manageable through financial planning and training programs.

Uncertainty Analysis: The 10th–90th percentile range showed significant variation, especially for hydrogen leakage, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and adaptive safety measures.

Overall, the results confirm that hydrogen leakage, flammability range, and explosion hazards are the most influential factors determining the overall safety profile of hydrogen-powered aviation systems. Addressing these high-priority risks through targeted engineering solutions and regulatory measures is essential for ensuring the safe and sustainable implementation of hydrogen technology in the aviation sector.

The risk matrix obtained as a summary is given in Table 2.

This study successfully utilized Monte Carlo simulation to quantitatively evaluate uncertainties associated with the use of hydrogen in aviation. This method allowed for the analysis of risks over a wide range of scenarios, providing a more detailed understanding of likelihood and impact distributions and enhancing the robustness of the risk assessment.

3.2. Sensitivity Analysis Results

The sensitivity analysis shows that probability values (P) are the dominant drivers for hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards, whereas impact values (I) exhibit stronger influence on cryogenic storage and infrastructure-related risks shown in Table 3.

3.3. Risk Mitigation and Implementation Strategies

The Monte Carlo Simulation outcomes revealed distinct distribution patterns across the four analyzed risk categories. Hydrogen leakage exhibited a moderately right-skewed distribution, with 80% of simulated cases falling between 18 and 22 on the risk scale, while approximately 5% exceeded 23, reaching the “severe” classification threshold. This tail behavior suggests that while the average leakage risk is statistically stable, rare but extreme events—such as simultaneous microcracks and ignition—could lead to catastrophic consequences if not mitigated through redundant system design [18].

Explosion hazards displayed the highest variance (SD = 2.85), indicating greater uncertainty compared to other categories. The distribution followed a semi-normal pattern with multiple local peaks, reflecting complex interactions between storage pressure, fuel temperature, and ignition probability [17]. These findings underscore the importance of probabilistic rather than deterministic safety margins, as linear assessments would underestimate high-variance scenarios.

In contrast, cryogenic storage challenges showed a narrower and more symmetric distribution (SD = 1.44), implying that engineering controls—such as improved insulation and active temperature regulation—can effectively manage these risks [21]. Infrastructure adaptation followed a similar pattern, suggesting that although implementation requires significant capital and regulatory adjustments, the associated technical risk remains statistically predictable [12].

Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8 depicts the cumulative probability curves for each risk category, illustrating that hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards dominate the upper percentile regions (90th–95th), confirming their status as critical safety concerns. By contrast, storage and infrastructure-related risks occupy mid-to-lower percentile ranges, aligning with existing industrial maturity levels.

A cross-comparison between mean risk scores and standard deviations further validated these insights: risk categories with higher average values also showed wider spreads, signifying greater uncertainty sensitivity. This relationship highlights the interconnected nature of hydrogen risk parameters, where increased system complexity amplifies the range of potential outcomes.

From an operational standpoint, these results suggest that the integration of hydrogen technologies into aviation should prioritize containment reliability and explosion prevention systems over infrastructural investments during early deployment phases. The use of probabilistic analysis thus enables policymakers and engineers to allocate resources based on statistically verified risk hierarchies rather than subjective estimations.

Finally, the findings confirm that probabilistic modeling not only quantifies uncertainty but also contextualizes it, allowing a shift from qualitative concern to actionable engineering guidance. This capability positions Monte Carlo Simulation as an essential analytical tool for future aviation risk assessment frameworks, supporting both design optimization and regulatory compliance toward sustainable, hydrogen-powered flight.

4. Discussion

The findings of this study demonstrate that hydrogen integration in aviation presents both substantial environmental benefits and significant technical and operational risks. Using a Monte Carlo Simulation framework, this study quantifies these risks by generating probability–impact distributions rather than relying on deterministic or qualitative assessments that dominate the existing literature. This probabilistic perspective allows a more realistic representation of uncertainty, particularly relevant for hydrogen-powered aviation technologies that remain at early Technology Readiness Levels (TRL 4–6).

The ranking observed in the Monte Carlo results is directly shaped by the intrinsic physical and operational characteristics of hydrogen systems. Hydrogen leakage appears as the highest-risk category due to the gas’s extremely small molecular size, high diffusivity, and broad flammability range (4–75%), which collectively increase the probability of accidental ignition. This finding is consistent with previous studies emphasizing leakage as the most dominant hazard in hydrogen technologies [12,17]. Cryogenic storage risks follow because material embrittlement, insulation degradation, and rapid boil-off phenomena remain major engineering challenges for LH2 tanks [21]. Explosion hazards show lower probability despite high severity, as ignition events require simultaneous presence of a flammable mixture and an ignition source—conditions less frequent in controlled aviation environments [18]. Infrastructure-related risks rank lowest because they stem primarily from logistical adaptation needs rather than intrinsic hydrogen hazards. This pattern confirms that the probabilistic hierarchy is consistent with established hydrogen safety literature and not an arbitrary model output.

Consistent with previous studies [17,18], hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards emerged as the most critical risk domains. Their high-risk scores—supported by both mean values and percentile distributions—reflect the intrinsic physical characteristics of hydrogen, including high diffusivity, wide flammability range (4–75%), and exceptionally low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ). However, this study extends existing work by quantifying the variability surrounding these risks. For example, leakage exhibited a moderately right-skewed distribution, indicating that while most simulated scenarios fall within predictable ranges, extreme events remain plausible. Explosion hazards also showed the highest variability among all risk categories, highlighting the potential for nonlinear interactions between pressure, temperature, and ignition factors.

Cryogenic storage and infrastructure adaptation, while still important, displayed narrower and more symmetric distributions. These results suggest that engineering controls—such as insulation technologies, boil-off management systems, and airport-level cryogenic logistics—can effectively reduce uncertainty and contribute to safer system integration. These findings align with emerging industrial trends, where cryogenic tank development and refueling procedures have achieved higher maturity levels relative to other hydrogen system components.

An important methodological contribution of this study is the inclusion of a sensitivity analysis, which reveals that the probability parameter (P) carries greater influence on risk scores for leakage and explosion scenarios, whereas the impact parameter (I) plays a more dominant role for cryogenic storage and infrastructure risks. These insights highlight the areas where future empirical research is most needed. For example, improvements in leak detection, material compatibility testing, and ignition probability modeling would directly reduce uncertainty in the most influential parameters affecting overall system risk.

A further consideration is the potential interdependence between risk factors. Hydrogen leakage, cryogenic degradation, and explosion hazards share operational linkages that could amplify cumulative risk. Due to the current absence of empirical correlation coefficients in the hydrogen aviation domain, risk factors were treated as statistically independent. This assumption ensures methodological consistency but may moderately underestimate total risk, particularly for combined leakage–ignition scenarios. Future studies with access to real-world operational datasets should develop multivariate risk models or integrate copula-based dependency structures to capture inter-risk relationships more accurately.

From a regulatory and operational perspective, the Monte Carlo Simulation outputs provide valuable evidence for aviation authorities such as EASA, ICAO, and FAA. Translating simulated risk scores into existing probabilistic safety thresholds can support certification frameworks for hydrogen-powered aircraft. For instance, high-risk clusters identified in the simulation align with categories that require additional redundancy, enhanced inspection intervals, or stricter design safety margins. These insights offer a practical basis for developing data-driven regulatory guidelines rather than relying solely on deterministic safety assumptions.

This study also highlights methodological pathways for future probability modeling. As more empirical hydrogen incident and component-level reliability data become available, probability calculations can be refined using parametric distributions (beta, triangular, Weibull), Bayesian updating methods, or non-parametric density estimation. Such advancements will enable more accurate probability density functions and contribute to more robust risk estimation.

Overall, this research provides one of the first probabilistic hierarchies of hydrogen risks in aviation, demonstrating the critical importance of uncertainty quantification for guiding engineering design, infrastructure planning, and regulatory development. While hydrogen-powered aviation offers transformative decarbonization potential, its safe implementation requires targeted mitigation strategies focusing primarily on leakage containment, explosion prevention, cryogenic system reliability, and airport infrastructure modernization. By integrating probabilistic simulation, expert elicitation, and sensitivity analysis, this study establishes a methodological foundation for advancing both academic and practical understanding of hydrogen safety in aviation.

5. Conclusions

This study provides one of the first comprehensive probabilistic risk assessments of hydrogen integration in aviation using a combined Monte Carlo Simulation and Delphi-based expert elicitation methodology. By quantifying likelihood–impact distributions across 10,000 simulation iterations, the analysis establishes a transparent and data-driven hierarchy of technical risks, addressing the lack of quantitative evidence frequently highlighted in the existing literature. The results show that hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards consistently yield the highest risk levels due to intrinsic physical properties—such as high diffusivity, wide flammability range, and extremely low ignition energy—whereas cryogenic storage challenges and infrastructure adaptation fall into the moderate and more controllable categories.

The study makes several methodological contributions. First, the use of uniform probability distributions was explicitly justified as the most scientifically defensible approach under conditions of limited empirical failure data and early TRL system maturity. Second, expert judgment was strengthened through a transparent Delphi process involving four specialists with recognized expertise in hydrogen combustion and reactive flows. Third, sensitivity analysis revealed that probability parameters are the dominant drivers of leakage and explosion risk, while impact parameters play a more substantial role in cryogenic and infrastructure-related risks—providing guidance for future empirical data collection priorities.

The findings also highlight the need to account for potential dependencies among risk categories, particularly between leakage, cryogenic degradation, and ignition pathways. Although independence was adopted as a conservative modeling assumption due to missing empirical correlation coefficients, future studies should incorporate multivariate probabilistic models or copula-based dependency structures as operational hydrogen datasets become available.

From a regulatory and operational perspective, the probabilistic evidence presented here supports the development of data-informed certification criteria for hydrogen-powered aircraft by agencies such as ICAO, EASA, and FAA. High-priority mitigation strategies should focus on leak prevention, explosion control, and robust cryogenic storage solutions, while infrastructure modernization and workforce training must accompany early deployment phases.

Overall, this study contributes a foundational probabilistic framework for evaluating hydrogen risks in aviation, offering both methodological rigor and practical insights that support engineering design, infrastructure planning, and long-term decarbonization strategies.

Future research should expand empirical datasets on hydrogen system reliability, develop validated probability distributions for aviation-specific failure modes, integrate multi-hazard dependency modeling, and explore sectoral cross-validation with more mature hydrogen applications such as automotive and industrial storage systems. These advances will improve the fidelity of probabilistic risk assessments and accelerate the safe, scalable adoption of hydrogen in aviation.

To explain the concept of environmental commodity with a simple analogy: If a homeowner wants to lower his or her carbon footprint, they might install some solar panels. But presuming they live in a block of flats, they might ask a friend to put solar panels on their roof instead. The flat owner helps the friend to finance that and in return can claim that they have neutralised the carbon output of their flat. What those homeowners are doing is creating a marketplace for decarbonisation opportunities, which is exactly what is happening at a macro-level between energy producers, corporates and major industry. It allows people who want to make moves to decarbonise, but who might be constrained. It allows them to invest in the move to decarbonise elsewhere. Similarly, it also enables people who have the opportunity, but not the finance, to get their projects off the ground.

The levers of transition

Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) that put a price on emissions were first launched in 2005. In addition, renewable energy certificates (GOs, IRECs, RECs) that link clean energy generation with consumer demand and fuel mandates (LCFS, REDIII) that reward low-carbon alternatives have gained their importance as tools to put a price on emissions and address environmental impact. These markets exist not to virtue-signal but to account for the cost of emissions and make decarbonisation bankable. Just as in other markets, traders, like us at STX Group, come in to facilitate pricing structures and climate solutions that simplify sales and manage risk for both the buyer and the producer. This market mechanism brings more investment to the market and is therefore an essential part of the commodities markets.

Carbon is finally being priced appropriately — and investment is following

The energy transition is ultimately executed through three levers: efficiency, switching towards renewable fuels and feedstocks, and carbon capture. But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced. The good news is, carbon is being appropriately priced and, as a result, environmental commodity markets have been growing rapidly over the last 20 years. New regulations are also taking effect, especially in Europe, across multiple industries. In shipping, FuelEU Maritime is reshaping fuel demand. In aviation, ReFuelEU mandates are driving uptake of sustainable fuels. RED III is pushing EU member states to increase renewables in power and heat. CBAM is levelling the playing field between domestic and foreign producers in the EU. All these regulations put more pressure on European refineries to ramp up their production of clean energy products. These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable. The future growth of the ‘sustainable economy’ is driven largely by the widening net of regulatory compliance but also has become a lifeline for energy companies operating on markets rapidly shifting towards renewables.

While the pace of change to decarbonise the global economy is arguably still slow, we cannot ignore the emissions that have been capped and addressed because of market schemes like the ETS and a large variety of environmental commodities. To give a sense of the scale, the global EAC market has grown to over 2,400 TWh annually since its formalisation in the early 2000s, representing a size equal to more than 60 percent of the total electricity demand of the European Union. It now covers approximately 40 percent of the EU’s total GHG emissions and generates €38bn in revenues in 2024.

By my latest count, more than 70 countries now operate carbon pricing systems. Clean fuel mandates and schemes are spreading across North America and Asia. In Europe, numerous clean energy policies and regulations are making carbon a balance-sheet cost for major heavy industries including aviation, shipping and manufacturing. There are plenty more schemes similar to the existing regulation that we expect to see make a big impact in the coming years, such as sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc), white certificates to drive energy efficiency and biofuel mandates. One thing is clear: emissions now carry a price, and that price is rising.

I strongly believe that market mechanisms are the most efficient way to align political ambition, corporate obligation and consumer demand to decarbonise, at an affordable cost. Without them, the transition risks becoming slower, costlier and more divisive.",https://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marketdriver-600x450.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 10:58:41.947365

Experience leads some researchers to believe the answer is sugarcane.

At the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, scientists are working with global technology leaders using the latest science to solve this challenge. Emeritus Professor Robert Henry, The University of Queensland, published a perspective in Agriculture Communications.

The mission is ambitious: create economically viable, renewable aviation fuel at the scale this huge industry needs. Plants are the best current source for renewable carbon, and all available evidence suggests sugarcane is the plant offering the best chance of success.

Sugarcane is the only crop currently produced at the tonnage demanded for this purpose.

Other options, like algae, sound promising in theory, but the economics don't add up. Algal systems are expensive, and unless you can generate a high-value co-product, they will not be cost-effective.

Canola is another option being considered internationally. A lot of Australia's canola is being exported into Europe and turned into fuel rather than food, so that is a food issue. But more than that, it's a scale issue. The yield of canola is a few tons per hectare, so the land you'd need to grow enough to replace jet fuel is more than the area of Australia.

Land use is a critical consideration. So, what crops can you scale? Sugarcane is productive and grown on a relatively small proportion of land. Its small footprint and exceptional productivity make it the standout choice.

Research at the Hub focuses on improving plant biomass to convert it into fuel. They are exploring genetic changes in rice, sorghum and sugarcane to increase the proportion of biomass that can be converted without sacrificing yield.

Rice is the model system as it's easier to manipulate genetically. Once researchers identify promising changes in rice, they will test some of the most effective in sorghum, sugarcane's closest relative among domesticated crops. If it works in sorghum, they can transfer the most promising alternatives to sugarcane, where the genetics are more complex. This tiered approach saves time and resources and increases our chances of success.

Australia and Queensland, in particular, are uniquely positioned to lead this transformation. There is a well-established sugarcane industry, strong research capability, and global partnerships that can accelerate innovation.

Australians fly more than almost anyone else, so the demand for sustainable aviation fuel is enormous in the domestic market. If sustainable fuel can be produced commercially, the world will quickly adopt it. The Hub's aim is to find ways to reduce costs further, making the investment compelling.

The challenge now is clear: breed crops with a high proportion of convertible biomass without sacrificing yield. It's a complex puzzle, but one worth solving.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2026/sugarcane.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 10:58:53.291399

BRIN researcher Budi Leksono from the Applied Botany Research Center said in Jakarta on Monday that malapari is gaining attention as a future source of clean energy.

He said the plant offers more than just fuel potential, as it can also improve local livelihoods while contributing to efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Leksono explained that malapari seeds produce oil that cannot be used for food, making it suitable as a raw material for biodiesel and bioavtur. Because the oil does not affect food supplies, it fits well with global aviation rules that encourage the use of sustainable fuels.

He noted that malapari seeds naturally yield between 20 and 28 per cent oil, but this figure can rise to around 44 per cent through careful plant selection and improved processing methods.

According to Leksono, BRIN’s research focuses on breeding high-quality trees that produce fruit faster, deliver higher yields and contain more oil.

Malapari also has environmental benefits. As a legume plant, it can absorb nitrogen from the air through its roots, reducing the need for nitrogen-based fertilisers.

These traits allow malapari to grow well on poor soil and in dry areas, including regions in eastern Indonesia such as Lembata, he said.

Development of malapari in Lembata is being carried out under a community-based agroforestry system. This approach allows local residents to grow crops such as coffee and cocoa beneath the malapari trees.

Leksono said the project is not limited to energy production but is also designed to support climate change mitigation efforts.

He expressed confidence that large-scale planting of malapari could help Indonesia meet its emission reduction targets while creating opportunities for carbon trading that would bring additional income to local communities.

This year, BRIN’s work will focus on setting up certified seed sources and developing high-quality malapari varieties native to Lembata.

Leksono said closer cooperation among government bodies, regional authorities, researchers, businesses and the media is expected to speed up the development of malapari as a strategic national crop that is sustainable, inclusive and based on local strengths.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biodiesel-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 10:59:09.393961

Countries investing heavily in renewable fuel infrastructure and low-carbon aviation strategies are driving adoption, with growth supported by long-term airline procurement agreements and public-private partnerships.

Why the Market Is Expanding

Several structural factors are shaping long-term demand:

• Aviation Emissions Reduction: Airlines face mounting pressure to decarbonize operations while maintaining fleet compatibility, making SAF a near-term solution.

• Regulatory and Policy Support: Blending mandates, emissions reduction targets, and sustainability frameworks are accelerating SAF deployment.

• Fuel Certification Requirements: Strict aviation fuel standards increase reliance on high-performance catalysts that deliver consistent molecular composition.

• Feedstock Diversification: The need to process variable bio-based feedstocks elevates demand for catalysts with improved tolerance and durability.

How Technology and Processes Are Evolving

Hydroprocessed pathways, including HEFA-based routes, remain the dominant production method due to their technical maturity and compatibility with existing refinery assets. Hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts account for a significant share of overall demand, reflecting their essential role in producing jet-range hydrocarbons.

Technology development increasingly focuses on extending catalyst life, improving selectivity, reducing hydrogen consumption, and minimizing sensitivity to feedstock impurities. These performance attributes are critical for improving plant economics and enabling large-scale SAF deployment.

Market Challenges and Competitive Dynamics

Despite favorable growth prospects, the market faces ongoing challenges. Feedstock variability can impact catalyst stability, while process economics require careful optimization to balance yield, energy use, and operational reliability. In addition, long qualification and certification timelines for new catalysts can slow market entry.

As a result, competition centers on proven performance, process integration expertise, and long-term operational support rather than short-term pricing alone.

Strategic Importance for Industry and Investors

Catalysts for bio-jet fuel represent a foundational segment of the SAF value chain. Their adoption provides insight into the pace of aviation decarbonization, refinery investment cycles, and future SAF supply growth. For industry leaders, analysts, and investors, catalyst demand trends serve as an early indicator of scalable bio-jet fuel production and long-term market viability.

A notable advancement in sustainable aviation has emerged with the expansion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply at Frankfurt Airport. This strategic move not only reinforces the region’s position in the global sustainability landscape but also paves the way for broader international collaboration. As SAF becomes an essential pillar in aviation’s decarbonization, the expansion of supply networks highlights how companies are responding to both environmental obligations and operational demands.

Frankfurt Becomes a Fuel Forward Hub

Frankfurt Airport’s integration into the SAF supply chain signals a deeper commitment to carbon reduction across Europe. This development is particularly impactful as Frankfurt serves as a major hub for both passenger and cargo traffic. By enabling cleaner fuel options, this initiative amplifies the airport’s role in supporting a greener aviation network across countries such as the United Kingdom, Norway, Singapore, and Germany.

The operation centers on the delivery of HEFA SPK blend SAF—a type derived from waste oils and fats—reinforcing a shift away from fossil-based aviation fuels. What makes this rollout particularly significant is not only its scale but also the meticulous planning and execution that underpin it, with adherence to strict safety and quality protocols.

Partnership-Fueled Progress

Behind this seamless launch is a collaboration grounded in technical precision and strategic foresight. The groundwork was laid through months of joint planning between the SAF supplier and operational service providers. The result is a robust, resilient framework capable of supporting the needs of diverse airline customers, from national carriers to international conglomerates.

This type of operational synergy reflects a new norm in aviation sustainability—one where logistical excellence meets environmental responsibility. It demonstrates how the private sector can align efficiency with ethics in aviation fuel management.

Benefiting Global Airlines

The supply chain expansion isn’t merely a regional win—it is an international leap forward. Major airlines operating in and out of Frankfurt are already reaping the benefits. Singapore Airlines and the Lufthansa Group, among others, now have greater access to SAF, supporting their own sustainability targets while ensuring compliance with evolving fuel regulations.

For carriers seeking to bolster their environmental credentials, the availability of SAF at strategic transit points is a key enabler. It transforms environmental aspirations into actionable fuel-switching strategies, providing tangible progress in emissions reductions.

Milestones That Matter

Among the standout achievements of 2025 is the delivery commitment of over 1,000 tons of SAF to Frankfurt Airport within a single year. While the volume may seem modest in the context of global jet fuel usage, the implications are far-reaching. This initiative dovetails with the broader European SAF mandate and illustrates a practical roadmap for scaling greener fuel alternatives.

By embedding SAF into its supply architecture, Frankfurt is aligning with global aviation goals while setting a precedent for other airports to follow.

Leading Toward a Lower Carbon Future

As the aviation sector intensifies its focus on environmental performance, the role of SAF cannot be overstated. It is one of the most immediate and impactful tools available to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from air travel. The expanded availability of SAF in key transit markets serves as both a signal and a solution—a signal that the industry is ready to adapt, and a solution that is viable today.

This transition is not just about fuel—it is about forging a pathway for a more responsible, resilient, and resource-efficient aviation industry. It is about meeting regulatory requirements while exceeding expectations in innovation.

A New Era of Aviation Energy

In essence, the expansion of SAF supply at Frankfurt Airport is more than a business decision—it is a commitment to transformation. It reflects the collective will of an industry to change course, to seek alternatives, and to lead responsibly. And it suggests that the future of aviation will be powered not only by technology, but by intention.

The journey toward net-zero aviation is complex, but with every milestone—like this SAF deployment—it becomes more achievable.

The private aviation sector has traditionally drawn scrutiny for its disproportionate environmental footprint. Yet in a turn that hints at deeper shifts in priorities, Wheels Up has unveiled a program that brings sustainable aviation fuel into clearer focus for its clients. This is more than a press release. It signals a strategic recalibration in how business aviation might begin to redefine its legacy through practical and participative sustainability.

SAF Takes the Stage Through Demand-Led Strategy

Sustainable aviation fuel has long been touted as a key lever in decarbonising air travel. What makes the Wheels Up initiative stand out is not the product itself but the market mechanism surrounding it. By inviting customers to contribute toward the purchase of SAF, the company is cultivating a new kind of demand environment. It is not a direct fuel swap yet. It is something more foundational.

In effect, the company is bypassing current supply limitations by giving clients a way to invest in the idea of SAF. The move is more than symbolic. It is a structural vote of confidence in a fuel type that is still ramping up in availability. Market frameworks like this could form the bedrock of future procurement and production cycles.

The Influence of an Airline Legacy

Delta Air Lines has played a foundational role in this development. Holding a significant stake in Wheels Up, Delta is not simply sharing its supply of SAF. It is offering credibility, infrastructure, and long-range planning that can benefit from the collective momentum of multiple carriers and clients.

Delta aims to fuel 10 percent of its operations with SAF by 2030. This long-term goal complements the incremental, client-facing efforts of Wheels Up. It also reflects an ecosystemic approach: the idea that sustainability in aviation cannot succeed in silos. Partnerships matter. Infrastructure matters. Policy advocacy matters.

Drop In, Step Forward

One of the more compelling qualities of SAF is its compatibility. As a drop in fuel, it requires no aircraft redesigns or airport overhauls. It blends seamlessly with existing systems. That compatibility makes it especially suited for early adoption within business aviation, where operational flexibility is prized.

The environmental gains are equally significant. Lifecycle emissions can drop by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel. In sectors where travel is often seen as optional or luxury based, that kind of reduction repositions the conversation. It becomes less about guilt and more about responsible participation in an energy transition.

Software as the Bridge to Action

Technology is another quiet catalyst in this rollout. The platform used to implement the program, Choose, connects end users with climate action in real time. It translates intent into traceable outcomes. With usage by major airlines already underway, the platform’s adoption by Wheels Up adds consistency to how SAF programs are introduced and scaled.

In a world where environmental claims are often under the microscope, systems like this build trust. They provide the transparency and verification that today’s discerning travellers increasingly expect. That trust becomes the currency for future programs, including those that may one day allow direct SAF purchasing for individual flights.

Reframing the Customer Role

What this program also achieves is a subtle redefinition of customer engagement. In the past, clients booked flights and paid premiums for comfort or convenience. Now, they can also choose to contribute to fuel innovation. It positions the private flyer not just as a passenger but as a stakeholder in the aviation transition.

This change speaks to evolving travel preferences. Environmental, social, and governance considerations are no longer confined to boardrooms. They are influencing personal travel decisions, especially in the high-net-worth segments where private aviation finds most of its customers.

Scaling with Intent

Even with these promising developments, the road to meaningful SAF adoption is long. Supply remains limited. Prices are high. Infrastructure and policy support are still developing. Yet Wheels Up’s new program contributes a necessary spark. It adds shape to the conversation by introducing a form of participation that is both accessible and meaningful.

As more customers opt in, producers gain signals of demand. That, in turn, supports investment, scalability, and policy momentum. It is not a silver bullet. But it is a tangible step in a sector known for abstract ambitions.

A Parallel Worth Watching

For organisations guiding transportation clients on their sustainability pathways, initiatives like this provide valuable insight. They illustrate how behavioural levers, technological platforms, and strategic partnerships can work in tandem. The goal is not simply to reduce emissions per flight. It is to embed sustainability into the service model itself.

The aviation industry is not short of innovation. But progress hinges on how that innovation is implemented, how incentives are structured, and how collaboration is scaled across value chains. That is where advisory roles gain relevance. Not by reinventing the wheel, but by showing where it can turn with greater purpose.

Conclusion

The partnership between Wheels Up and Delta brings the promise of sustainable aviation fuel into the charter travel space with new clarity. It offers a glimpse of how the future of flight might be reshaped not through radical transformation, but through smart, integrative steps.

This initiative bridges the gap between ambition and action. It enables travellers to do more than offset their journey. It invites them to shape the journey of aviation itself.

In doing so, it hints at a larger truth. The most effective sustainability programs are those that do not rely solely on disruption. They thrive on inclusion. They invite every participant to contribute to progress. And they suggest that with the right alignment of innovation, collaboration, and intent, even the most exclusive corners of transport can open new pathways to responsibility.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-8-1-1024x576.png,N,,2026-01-19 07:56:56.697946

At the close of 2024, e-commerce accounted for approximately 20% of air cargo volumes worldwide, with projections that those volumes could double within the following decade.

Various business models have been employed to handle, process, transport, clear and deliver this high volume of shipments. However, as the growth happened over a rapid period, accelerated by COVID-induced changes in consumer behaviours, many deviations to processes emerged.

E-commerce shipments are not governed by industry standards in terms of processing or handling, and there are no international regulations that cover handling for this specific commodity, although e-commerce shipments must comply with safety and security regulations.

In addition to a lack of industry standards, deviations in government regulations, deviations in standard operating procedures and deviations in customer expectations all contributed to a complex and challenging business environment.

E-commerce market outlook

Air cargo accounts for approximately 35% of global trade value annually, worth an estimated US$9.0 trillion. In volume terms, this equates to more than 64 million metric tonnes.

E-commerce volumes have grown steadily over the last five years, and industry estimates indicate that it now accounts for over 12 million metric tonnes.

Changes in consumer behaviour have shifted from traditional retail ‘brick and mortar’ to online marketplaces, C2C platforms and direct sales channels. Social media-based retail activity, via Instagram, Facebook and the growing TikTok shop, among others, are accelerating this evolution as retail is now available 24 hours a day and accessible via smart phone technology. Global payment systems support this ‘shop anywhere, anytime’ mindset.

Ex-China e-commerce reached 4.4M tonnes in 2024 and has grown 38% p.a. since 2021. China e-commerce volumes have almost doubled in the past two years.

Low-value e-commerce reached 55% of China-U.S. air trade volumes in 2024 at the expense of general air cargo.

More recently, with the U.S. tariff changes since the beginning of April 2025 and the removal of the ‘de minimis’ exemption since the start of May, a strong impact is observed on the e-commerce origins China/HK to the United States.

E-commerce safety across the supply chain

Safety and security remain the air cargo industry’s top priority, so it bears noting that the rapid growth of e-commerce has brought additional safety and security concerns, particularly with the low barrier to entry for global shippers and the proliferation of C2C and B2C environments.

The rapid growth of e-commerce, projected to reach $8 trillion in global sales by 2027, has reshaped air cargo safety in three key ways:

Surge in shipment volume and complexity, with small, high-frequency shipments complicating screening, labelling and compliance enforcement.

Hazardous materials risks – Lithium battery shipments, growing 30% annually, account for a significant portion of air cargo fire risks. In recent years, more than 50% of reported air cargo fire incidents involved lithium battery-related shipments.

Security and cyber threats – Smugglers exploit fragmented e-commerce logistics to ship counterfeit or illegal goods, while cyber-attacks on air cargo tracking systems have risen by 15% annually, increasing risks of shipment fraud and data breaches.

Simplified and aligned processes

Air cargo is complex by nature as cargo is moved on behalf of millions of shippers across 193 countries, involving more than 20,000 connected points on the services of over 700 airlines with thousands of truckers, freight forwarders and ground handlers getting involved.

The compliance environment involves international and national regulations, trading bloc conditions and operator-specific instructions. For the industry to operate efficiently, we seek simplified and aligned processes wherever possible.

The rise of e-commerce has transformed air cargo operations, necessitating significant changes in data management practices. Traditionally, air cargo relied on fragmented data systems that varied by carriers, freight forwarders and customs agencies.

The surge in e-commerce has heightened the need for real-time tracking, efficient customs clearance and optimised last-mile delivery. Key changes include the adoption of standardised data formats (e.g., IATA Cargo-XML or ONE record), the integration of advanced technologies like blockchain for data transparency and the implementation of automated data exchange protocols. These changes promote interoperability and enhance data accuracy, enabling stakeholders to respond swiftly to market demands.

Ground handler challenges

Ground handlers are the first line in customer service for carriers’ customers and the last line of defence when it comes to safety, security and compliance. Ground handling activity is currently unregulated, with many differences existing between carriers in terms of standard ground handling operations and procedures.

As such, a ground handler who represents multiple carriers is faced with managing various operational standards and deviations.

As e-commerce grows, the role of the ground handler becomes even more important as volumes of small shipments often place additional burdens on facility and border management when compared to larger consolidated shipments.

Sustainability

Sustainability considerations are becoming increasingly critical for air cargo and, consequentially, e-commerce logistics. The TIACA annual sustainability survey illustrates that sustainability considerations are important for many industry stakeholders, as illustrated in the chart below.

As e-commerce continues to grow, its impact on air cargo operations has raised concerns about sustainability, particularly in terms of environmental impact and waste management.

The rapid rise in parcel volumes has led to increased air freight traffic, contributing to higher carbon emissions and energy consumption. The environmental challenges are compounded by the growing demand for expedited deliveries, often requiring higher frequency and shorter lead times.

To address these challenges, air cargo companies are focusing on reducing their carbon footprints through various measures. The shift toward more fuel-efficient aircraft, investment in sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and the use of electric ground support equipment (GSE) are key changes aimed at minimising emissions.

Additionally, air cargo providers are working on waste reduction strategies, such as optimising packaging, reducing single-use plastics and recycling materials.

Technology plays a significant role in improving sustainability by enabling better route optimisation and energy management systems. Advanced data analytics and AI are being used to forecast demand, optimise flight schedules, and minimise excess fuel consumption.

Furthermore, the integration of sustainable practices in last-mile delivery through electric vehicles, drones and optimised packaging further enhances the sustainability of e-commerce logistics.

These changes are crucial in balancing the increased demand for air cargo with the growing need to reduce environmental and waste management impacts.

Summary and conclusion

The e-commerce sector will continue to evolve as consumer behaviour, business operations and regulatory environments change. Air cargo will remain ideally placed to capitalise on these evolutions from lower value B2C and C2C as well as growing values in the B2B sectors. Although more stringent formal customs entries can be anticipated.

Safety is a critical concern, especially with lithium battery risks and increased cyber threats. We must strive for stricter compliance, enhanced screening, and global regulatory harmonisation. Customs management must address fraud and processing delays, calling for digitalisation, AI-driven risk analysis, and global standards.

Process simplification is essential for improving efficiency, with technology investment and inter-stakeholder collaboration identified as key enablers. The need for a common data infrastructure based on industry standard communication and data protocols architected for next level use in data analytics, AI agents and large language models (LLMs) is crucial.

Infrastructure challenges remain a critical growth factor as demand for investment often exceeds that which is available within supply chain partners. It is expected that private capital investment targeting real estate development will need to be leveraged to ensure new facilities are available to address the growing demand.

Ground handlers are burdened by fragmented standards and rising parcel volumes, requiring training and digital upgrades. Freight forwarders must adjust to smaller shipments and customer-centric models while ensuring compliance and technological integration. Final-mile delivery is a vital link, benefiting from automation, localised hubs, and drone use to meet customer expectations.

Reverse logistics is becoming increasingly critical due to high return rates in e-commerce, necessitating streamlined systems and green logistics. Innovation, particularly through AI and drones, will reshape efficiency, cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Sustainability concerns cut across all operations, prompting calls for carbon reduction, waste minimisation, and green technology adoption.

E-commerce is not just a new cargo segment but a paradigm shift in air logistics, demanding co-ordinated industry-wide innovation, regulatory reform, and sustainability focus. By adopting standardised practices, investing in digital infrastructure, and strengthening global cooperation, the air cargo industry can align with the future demands of e-commerce while ensuring safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible operations.

Airports have a pivotal role to play as the air cargo industry moves ahead with managing increased e-commerce volumes. Airport communities and common systems facilitate the various supply chain partners exchanging data, aligning on practices and preparing for this new era of industry expansion.

Will it mean the end of NATO? Will it lead to war with Denmark? But despite Trumpâ€™s notorious unpredictability, there seems to me vanishingly little likelihood of any kind of military aggression by the United States against Greenland. Why so?

His off-hand remarks cite Greenlandâ€™s strategic and commercial importance to America. And of that there can be no doubt. As the Greenland ice shelf melts â€” at a rate of 270 billion tonnes per year – several strategic sea routes open up. Greenland controls the top end of the Greenlandâ€“Icelandâ€“UK Gap, crucial to NATO submarine surveillance and vital in resupplying Europe.

This article is the opinion of the authorÂ and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.Â

The increasingly ice-free Northwest Passage skirts Greenlandâ€™s shores. Thereâ€™s even talk of a deep-sea port to serve the emerging Northern Sea Route or NorthEast passage, either in Iceland or â€” just possibly â€” in East Greenland.Â Mike Pompeo once called Arctic sea-lanes the â€œ21st-century Suez and Panama Canalsâ€. So Greenlandâ€™s strategic importance to the US is abundantly clear.

Yet there are three powerful reasons why a military invasion of any sort would be foolish and self-defeating.

First, Greenland already hosts a huge American military base, and congress have recently approved a $4 Billion programme of upgrading for it. Indeed America is already the only effectiveÂ military presence in the entire island. The Pituffik Space Base is an essential part of US air defence and missile early warning systems which would detect any nuclear missile launched in Russiaâ€™s Kola Peninsula or nearby (which houses the bulk of Russiaâ€™s nuclear capabilities.) Pituffikâ€™s 10,000 ft runway (about the same size as Gatwick) handles more than 3000 flights a year. And it has the northernmost deepwater port in the world. There are 150 military personnel there. Thatâ€™s down fromÂ 6000 in the Cold War, but could be regrown easily without any kind of â€˜invasionâ€™. So what would be gained by any kind of American military action elsewhere on the island? Not only would it be pointless, but under the 1951 Treaty which allows it, the US presence in Greenland can only continue as long as both Denmark and the United States remain NATO members.Â

Second, there really is nothing in Greenland which invites invasion. 80% of the island is covered by an ice sheet which averages 1 mile in thickness. The weather is extremely cold for 8 months of the year (down to Minus 50 degrees), with spikes of heat in the Summer (recently up to 35 degrees). It is largely dark, or at least very gloomy from September until March, and most of the island is uninhabitable. Aside from the capital, Nuuk (20,000 population), there are no towns or cities of any size. There is only one road- 100 miles in length, so all travel is by air or sea. There is very limited industry of any kind aside from fishing and a little tourism.Â

And third, while America has nothing at all to gain from any invasion, and a great deal to lose, they have a great deal to gain from harmonious financial and industrial relations with Greenland. It is all about natural resources. Trumpâ€™s unashamed lust for Greenlandâ€™s rare earths is but one element of a global race to control the production of the strategic minerals which are essential components of batteries, phones, electric vehicles and all modern computing devices. Itâ€™s about silicon, germanium, phosphorus, boron, indium phosphide, gallium, graphite, uranium, copper, lithium, cobalt and nickel, among others, and he who controls their production holds the key to the digital globe.Â

Taiwan manufactures over 60% of the worldâ€™s semiconductors and more than 90% of its most advanced chips. So if China were ever to carry out its threat to invade Taiwan (which some observers think may be imminent, perhaps encouraged by Trumpâ€™s daring action in Venezuela), it would gain near-total control of the global microchip supply. Do we really want to be dependent on China for every phone, computer and electric vehicle produced in the West?

That means that the US needs to develop chip-making capabilities comparable to Taiwanâ€™s, to achieve which it needs reliable sources for the 50 or so critical minerals required. And Greenlandâ€™s Ilimaussaq Intrusion mine at Kvanefjeld alongside several others, holds concentrated quantities of 30 of them, amounting to 10% of the worldâ€™s total rare earth reserves.Â

Â However the practical reality is that with a population of just 57,000 â€” many of them Inuit fishermen and hunters â€” Greenland currently lacks the industrial infrastructure to extract these minerals and both China and the US would be keen to fill that gap. China in particular has shown intense interest, at one point proposing a $2.5bn investment in a Greenlandic mine (more than the islandâ€™s entire GDP), which would have brought in 5,000 Chinese workers. Then they proposed massive infrastructure investments including a deep-sea port and two international airports. These would require capital which would leave Greenland beholden for all time. Denmark and the US, unsurprisingly, blocked these plans.

The final umbilical cord linking Greenland to Denmark is the annual block grant of 3.9 billion kroner (roughly $560 million), making up about 19% of Greenlandâ€™s GDP. But to put that in perspective, it is less than the amount annually spent by the US on the city of El Paso, Texas. And it is minuscule compared to the mineral wealth Greenland could one day command in partnership with a deep-pocketed ally like America.

So military invasion would be wholly self-defeating and pointless. But massive infrastructure and minerals extraction investment makes a huge amount of geostrategic good sense. In October 2024, the US and Greenland issued a joint statement pledging deeper cooperation on many of these issues. While an outright purchase may be politically impossible, other options exist â€” such as a Compact of Free Association, similar to agreements the US has with other strategically placed Pacific nations. These can deliver economic and security benefits to both parties. Trillions of dollars of Wall street investment in mineral extraction would without doubt follow.

Trumpâ€™s 2025 call to â€œbuyâ€ far less invade Greenland sounds outlandish â€” even offensive â€” as with so much of his rhetoric. But beneath the bombast may lie the bones of a deal: one that could benefit the predominantly Inuit population, while delivering enormous strategic and commercial gains to the United States.Â

It was the Viking, Eric the Red who, in AD 986, first saw Greenlandâ€™s potential. He wanted to colonise his newly discovered island, and in a blatant piece of Tenth-Century spin-doctoring hit on a wizard wheeze to encourage other Norse people to come to this bleak, icy and remote corner of the unknown world.

â€œIn the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favourable name.” (Erik the Redâ€™s Saga)

Greenland must now find a way to harness its vast resource wealth while preserving its fragile culture and ecology. Greenland cannot be sacrificed to short-term capitalism â€” but it can, and must, find a way to benefit from it. If managed with wisdom and care, the coming years could bring not only prosperity to Greenlanders, but a global model of sustainable extraction and indigenous self-determination.Â

America, China and Russia may want Greenland.

Calumet’s recent refinancing news comes on the back of a 90 day share price return of 8.25% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 10.49%, suggesting momentum has been building even as the latest 1 day share price move was slightly negative.

If this kind of debt refinancing story has your attention, it could be a good moment to widen your lens and check out .

With the refinancing in motion, a 5.5% gap to the average analyst price target, and recent returns in positive territory, the key question is whether Calumet’s current price still leaves upside on the table or whether the market is already factoring in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 5.2% Undervalued

With Calumet last closing at US$20.33 against a narrative fair value of US$21.45, the current setup frames a modest discount that hinges on how its future earnings story plays out.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026, enabling Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs. This is expected to capture premiums of $1-$2 per gallon over renewable diesel and tap into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally, which may support a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

Curious how an unprofitable business today supports that fair value? The narrative leans on higher margins, steady top line growth and a rich future earnings multiple. Want the full story?

The most followed narrative is built on a discount rate of 8.21%, paired with steady revenue growth assumptions and a move from current losses to positive earnings over the next few years. It also factors in modest share count dilution and assigns a future P/E multiple that is materially higher than typical oil and gas benchmarks to bridge to the US$21.45 fair value estimate.

Result: Fair Value of US$21.45 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this upbeat story can unravel if regulatory support for renewable fuels weakens or if high debt levels limit Calumet’s flexibility to handle bumps in cash flow.

South Korea has published a clear timeline that begins with a one percent sustainable aviation fuel blend in twenty twenty seven and rises as high as ten percent by twenty thirty five. Importantly, each target will be finalised two years before activation, allowing producers and airlines to plan with confidence.

Smart Flexibility

The mandate is tied to domestic SAF availability rather than fixed volumes. That dynamic approach prevents cost spikes while still sending a strong long term market signal. A clever, less obvious insight is that this formula may also stabilise regional feedstock prices because refiners can synchronise purchases with confirmed local demand instead of speculative exports.

Incentives Drive Investment

The package includes:

· Up to twenty five percent corporate tax credit on plant construction.

· Forty percent credit on research and development spending for new feedstock pathways.

· Deferred compliance on twenty percent of the required volume for three years in case of supply disruptions.

These measures lower capital risk and give innovators room to perfect advanced routes such as power to liquid synthesis and algae based oils.

Airline Advantages

Carriers that surpass quota earn three point five bonus points when bidding for new international routes. For network planners those points can mean early access to premium slots on trans Pacific hubs, converting environmental leadership into revenue.

Domestic Benefits

By mandating that ninety percent of departing international flights refuel locally, the scheme locks in demand that can sustain multiple commercial scale SAF plants, create thousands of construction jobs, and reduce dependence on imported kerosene. Energy security and export potential therefore grow together.

Conclusion

The Korean roadmap balances ambition with pragmatism. Flexible targets, generous incentives, and strategic route rewards position the nation to become an influential supplier of sustainable jet fuel while supporting airlines and taxpayers alike.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-13.svg,N,,2026-01-19 05:58:17.635689

Miscanthus grass arguably ticks all these boxes.
“So, if you go at scale - 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 hectares - you can do the maths of what the pre-investment volumes are.
Finding a thousand hectares for miscanthus grass should not be hard.
The company is fundraising for 5,000 hectares of miscanthus in France, the first 500 of which will be planted in spring 2026.","Renewable, plant-based alternatives to plastics and fossil fuels are not new, but many are criticised for requiring premium arable farmland that could otherwise grow food for humans or livestock. More demand for fields can mean more deforestation and habitat loss.

Miscanthus grass could be different, according to Willem Roos, the founder and CEO of Sustayn Group.

The perfect biomass crop would happily grow on degraded, uneven or hilly land. It would provide multiple harvests from a single sowing, it would require no additional maintenance outside harvest time, it would be frost and drought resistant, and would require few-if-any pesticides or fertilisers. Naturally, also, it would be non-invasive, keeping itself to itself, even on small plots.

Miscanthus grass arguably ticks all these boxes. So why isn’t it everywhere already? Initial cost is the single biggest answer, which could be where Luxembourg comes in.

“That is exactly what we [at Sustayn] do different from the regular agricultural sector,” said Roos. “All of us have miscanthus farming backgrounds, either that or agronomist backgrounds, project development backgrounds, or private equity and investor backgrounds.”

Sparks of innovation in the business of energy

Up-front investment

Farmers are not only constrained by the traditional rhythm of the seasons - sowing and harvesting every year - they are also constrained by the economics this year-on-year model imposes on them.

Miscanthus is expensive to procure and plant, and it also usually provides no income whatsoever for the first three years. Economically, it is a mix of farming and forestry, but in a way that neither foresters nor farmers can easily adapt to.

Timber growers in Europe would typically be reluctant to (and prohibited from) replacing forest with miscanthus, while farmers cannot afford to switch. “Depending on the land prices, we invest somewhere between €2,500 and €3,500 per hectare just to develop the plantation and the crop,” said Roos. “So, if you go at scale - 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 hectares - you can do the maths of what the pre-investment volumes are. That’s why the common farmer is not jumping on it.”

Based on these figures, 500 hectares at the lowest price would cost €1.25 million, while 10,000 hectares at the highest price would be a whopping €35 million. It would be a big gamble for a farmer to unilaterally dedicate a percentage of their land to miscanthus and then try to find a market for it.

Sustayn, meanwhile, starts with demand and then secures supply. “We take it from an industrial perspective: how much land do we want in order to have a meaningful downstream production. We calculate it backwards,” Roos said.

Miscanthus is a slow investment compared to food crops but fast compared to forestry, which takes 10–15 years to produce yields. It also compares favourably as an energy investment: “Any energy project; a wind project or a solar project or classic energy producing units, you have a three-to-five-year pre-planning and permitting processes, then you have a two-year construction period plus, let’s say, one year to stabilise operations. So yes, in the energy sector, [long-term investment is] very known.”

Diverse applications

Miscanthus biomass has uses that range from simple to complex. It is good as animal bedding, or to enrich soils. It can be used instead of trees to make papers and pulps. Miscanthus burns well - as pellets, briquettes or simply dried - and can be used for heat or electricity.

Its fibres could be the next big thing for fabrics in the world of sustainable fashion. It is a construction material, and it can be turned into plastic alternatives.

Then there is biofuel, arguably most exciting of all.

Sustayn works with three growing partners and is a “relatively young company,” of roughly six years, Roos said, adding that it is based in Luxembourg for “no particular operational reason”.

Sustayn does not grow any miscanthus in the Grand Duchy, but Roos says the country is a favourable legal environment for a holding and project development company. “There is a very intense green economy here in Luxembourg. Luxembourg is, I believe, the second largest, if not the largest green investment hub in Europe. So, to raise funds, Luxembourg is a logical place to be.”

The Grand Duchy could one day host a miscanthus nursery that supplies germinated shoots for the whole continent, and the Greater Region is a possible site for a future plantation for sustainable aviation fuel, he added.

Making good-goods

Among the more promising options for miscanthus use is plastic-alternative packaging materials.

“Food grade packaging might need a feedstock of 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of miscanthus per year. Depending on the region, you produce somewhere around 15 tonnes per hectare per year,” Roos explained. “So, in order to feed such a production unit, you would need a thousand hectares.”

That is the equivalent of a thousand rugby pitches, or 0.39% of Luxembourg, and would cost in the region of €3 million to prepare and plant. “This is way beyond the scope of any ordinary farmer,” said Roos.

So much land and such a high price tag make it a daunting prospect. But it is worth bearing in mind that one single financial outlay can be expected to bring reliable annual returns for around two decades, the entrepreneur explained, and it can be spread over many small plots of underutilised, otherwise unproductive land.

Still, miscanthus plots must be big enough for farm machinery to access for harvesting. They must be accessible by road for transport. And they must be close enough to the processing/production facility to make sense. This can be up to a roughly 150 km diameter circle around the factory, according to Roos.

That theoretical circle of 150km contains over 1.75 million hectares of surface area - similar to the size of Kuwait. Finding a thousand hectares for miscanthus grass should not be hard.

Sustayn buys or leases land for cultivation but hopes that proven success will prompt young farmers in the future to volunteer land for the grass.

Environmental concerns

If there is any chance of a non-native plant breaking its bonds and spreading wildly, it is immediately a non-starter - especially for a biomass crop that touts its green credentials.

Miscanthus exists in Europe only as a cultivated species, and the “hybrids employed for agricultural purposes, specifically Miscanthus Giganteus, are sterile and thus incapable of seed production, eliminating the risk of dissemination via seeds,” a botanist at the Luxembourg National Museum of Natural History told the Luxembourg Times by email. “However, there remains a possibility of their spread through rhizomes during soil cultivation.”

Because it is harvested in spring, miscanthus fields offer a useful winter refuge to small wildlife, the botanist said. On the other hand, as a crop which lives for years, “these cultures leave little opportunity for the growth of typical annual field weeds - many of which have grown increasingly rare and now face threats to their survival.”

This mix of pros and cons would seem to vindicate Roos’ vision for the incorporation of miscanthus as part of the existing farm landscape.

The dream scenario

Farmers want reliable income, and diversification helps them achieve this. Even in Europe, where the average farm is small, many could feasibly spare 10-20% of their territory for miscanthus, according to Roos. Doing so, he says, the continent would boost its economic and environmental sustainability.

“[It is a] nice steady-state income with no, or relatively low inputs, relatively low effort. 20–25 years is the technical life of the crop. The first three years are the most work intensive. You prepare the land, then you have a first season where you actually plant it, and then you watch over the crop for the first two seasons and after those two seasons you then harvest in springtime. After the first initialisation period of two or three years, it’s basically just harvesting once a year,” Roos said.

Miscanthus grass is hardy and versatile (its thicker stems cope better with extreme weather than maize, for example) but its long lifespan means potential losses from crop failure are greater than for annual crops. It matters, therefore, where one plants it.

“You don’t want to [have to] artificially irrigate. And you want to have sufficient sunshine, as it is a photosynthesis process, the growing of crops,” Roos said. “You want to have a lot of sunshine, long seasons and sufficient rain.” With such a long life, it is increasingly important to keep climate change in mind.

Sustayn’s oldest miscanthus plantations (2,000 hectares) are in the UK, even though the most favourable regions today are in northern Italy and southern France. “Personally, I’m of the opinion that will move up 200 to 300km over the next 20 years,” Roos said. In the long term, Germany, Luxembourg - even southern Scandinavia and the Baltics - could become ideal.

The company is fundraising for 5,000 hectares of miscanthus in France, the first 500 of which will be planted in spring 2026. Planting in small stages is good, Roos says, because harvesting will start gradually and production will rise steadily - allowing the company time to secure the market. “Yes, it’s nice to receive [sustainability] grants and subsidies, but on the other hand, you’re looking for sustainable, long-term, economically viable businesses,” Roos said. Sustayn aims to offer investors double-digit returns without the addition of any additional grant, subsidy or carbon credit income.

“If they come, if they are available, great, we will go for it, But we thought it would not be a good basis to say ‘our business case depends on the future five, ten, 15 years of subsidies. So, ours is a self-sustaining proposition,” Roos said.",https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/nazoyg-miscanthus-ii.jpeg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/miscanthus%20ii.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 03:58:27.244493

The combined guaranteed loan amount of up to $15 million will be used to provide engineering services and electrical equipment, e.g. batteries, for Eve’s electric Vehicle Take-Off and Landing program (eVTOL) during its developmental period.

What Is In The Agreement?

Eve Air Mobility’s agreement with EXIM Bank and PEFCO is for funding for the suppliers that are developing their eVTOL aircraft. Eve is working closely with British company BAE Systems and Brazilian company Embraer as part of a joint aerospace operation. BAE Systems is supplying the main energy power sources (batteries), and Embraer is contributing its propulsion technology. DUC Hélices Propellers will provide the rotor and propeller blades used in the construction of the eVTOL aircraft prototypes. Eduardo Couto, Eve’s chief financial officer, spoke highly about the agreement and the overall project in a statement:

“This agreement underscores EXIM Bank’s confidence in Eve’s business model and the strong future of urban air mobility. It will empower Eve’s U.S. supply chain by providing critical financial flexibility, accelerating the adoption of sustainable air travel globally.”

Couto also said: “We are incredibly proud to partner with EXIM Bank to offer this innovative financing solution…”

What is eVTOL?

Eve’s eVTOL aircraft is designed to use multi-rotor and thrust vectoring technology to enable an electrically powered and vertically piloted aircraft capable of completing regular short-haul transport cycles per year, more than a thousand, according to Eve’s technical specifications. The eVTOL specifications also mention carrying four passengers and one pilot. The aircraft (similar in size to the standard consumer industrial drone) is also planned to be both virtually silent and environmentally friendly, designed to eliminate 90% of noise pollution and up to 47% of CO2 emissions compared to petrol vehicles.

Eve plans to make the aircraft accessible to consumers by taking their first big step to secure their place in the larger Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by providing safe transport to passengers and cargo with frequent testing of their prototype eVTOL aircraft. The first consumer deliveries for the eVTOL aircraft are expected around the start of 2028.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Eve_eVTOLConfiguration_Release-1024x576.png,N,,2026-01-19 00:56:19.244759

Pasay City, Philippines / January 18, 2026 — As it marks 85 years of flight, Philippine Airlines (PAL) signaled a global turn with the unveiling of its first Airbus A350-1000, becoming the first airline in Southeast Asia to operate the long-range widebody.

In a landmark ceremony held at Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Macroasia Economic Zone, Villamor Airbase, PAL Holdings, Inc. President Lucio C. Tan III welcomed President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos, Jr. and First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, together with top government officials and dignitaries, to witness this momentous event.

PAL Holdings President Lucio C. Tan III reaffirmed the airline’s commitment to supporting the country’s tourism growth and strengthening its competitiveness on the global stage: “The A350-1000 aircraft stands as a powerful symbol of our resurgence. It represents our confidence to compete globally, while remaining deeply rooted in who we are as Filipinos. In many ways, the arrival of the Airbus A350-1000 mirrors the Philippines today: resilient, forward-looking, and prepared to engage the world with confidence.”

“As Philippine Airlines continues its transformation, we remain mindful that our journey is inseparable from that of our country,” he said. “Our role as the flag carrier is not simply commercial. It is a responsibility that we take very seriously. We exist to connect people, support livelihoods, and contribute meaningfully to the country’s development, consistent with the ideals of Bagong Pilipinas.”

The new flagship features the airline’s iconic “Sunrise” livery accented with a commemorative “85 Years” decal, reflecting both its legacy and its forward-looking ambitions. Five A350-1000 aircraft are scheduled to join the fleet in 2026, with the remaining three arriving in 2027.

President Marcos led guests in touring the state-of-the-art aircraft, which is set to elevate PAL’s long-haul transpacific services to the US Mainland and Canada. Configured in a spacious tri-class layout, the A350-1000 accommodates 382 passengers, with 42 seats in Business Class, 24 in Premium Economy, and 316 in Economy.

The cabin experience, developed in partnership with aircraft cabin design studio Lift Aero Design, places a strong emphasis on comfort, privacy, and functionality. The “Mabuhay Studios” Business Class features 42 full-flat suites with sliding doors for enhanced privacy, arranged in a 1-2-1 layout to ensure every passenger has direct aisle access. Each suite is equipped with a 20-inch 4K personal entertainment screen. Complimentary full flight messaging, browsing, and streaming are available via inflight Wi-Fi. Additional amenities include in-seat power outlets, USB-A and USB-C charging ports, and wireless charging docks.

Premium Economy features spacious recliner seats designed for enhanced comfort, each equipped with its own legrest and footrest. Passengers enjoy the convenience of private mini-cocktail tables, multiple stowage options, in-seat power outlets, as well as both USB-A and USB-C charging ports to keep devices powered. The 13.3-inch 4K personal entertainment screens offer a superior in-flight viewing experience. Additionally, complimentary full-flight messaging and browsing via inflight Wi-Fi ensure passengers stay connected from takeoff to landing.

Economy Class raises comfort standards with a 32-inch seat pitch, generous recline, adjustable four-way headrests, built-in personal mobile device holders, and both USB-A and USB-C charging ports. These thoughtful ergonomic features help make long-haul travel more restful and enjoyable.

Beyond the cabin, the A350-1000 sets a new benchmark in sustainable aviation, delivering up to a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft and offering compatibility with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Enhanced cargo capacity further strengthens PAL’s logistics and freight operations.

Recognized as Asia Pacific’s Most On-Time Airline for 2025, PAL continues to demonstrate operational excellence. The milestone event was also marked by the launch of a new jingle—performed by Ogie Alcasid, Gary Valenciano, and Martin Nievera—capturing the spirit of 85 years of shaping Philippine aviation.

With the addition of the A350-1000, PAL’s fleet now stands at 82 aircraft. The acquisition underscores the airline’s ongoing focus on fleet modernization and network expansion, as it positions itself for greater efficiency, connectivity, and competitiveness in the global aviation landscape.

American Airlines, following in the footsteps of Delta, Lufthansa, JAL, Ryanair, Emirates, and several other major airlines worldwide, has been hit with a surcharge bombshell that’s shaking up air travel. These extra charges are affecting flights across the globe, with every major carrier imposing new fees that are raising flight costs to unprecedented levels.

Whether you’re flying with American Airlines, Delta, or Lufthansa, it’s clear that the days of affordable flying are over. These extra charges aren’t just limited to fuel surcharges anymore. Ryanair, JAL, and Emirates are also slapping passengers with environmental levies, new taxes, and higher fees for everything from luggage to seat selection.

The ripple effect is undeniable – travelers are now feeling the pressure as each airline scrambles to offset rising operational costs. But what does this mean for the future of air travel? American Airlines, Delta, and their counterparts around the world are setting the tone, but the bigger question remains: Can the global aviation sector recover from this surcharge explosion? Travel And Tour World urges you to keep reading to uncover the shocking truth behind these skyrocketing prices.

Air travelers around the globe are feeling the pinch as airfares soar to new heights. While airlines blame rising fuel prices, labor costs, and new environmental rules, governments aren’t sitting idle. With higher taxes, surcharges, and levies, passengers are now facing more expensive flights than ever before. Buckle up as we take you through how airlines like Delta, American Airlines, Emirates, and many more are adding extra charges, making it nearly impossible to escape the rising cost of air travel.

American Airlines Raises the Bar: Higher Surcharges from South Korea

American Airlines isn’t far behind. In January 2026, the carrier increased its fuel surcharge on flights departing South Korea. The surcharge for tickets flying to the United States, Canada, and Latin America rose from ₩72,300 to ₩84,700 – a 17% increase! This change demonstrates how airlines are quick to pass on fuel price hikes to passengers. The best part? American Airlines warns that these surcharges are based on the ticket issue date – if you buy early, you might be stuck with higher charges later. Explore American Airlines’ Latest Surcharge Adjustments

Delta’s Fuel Surcharge Bombshell: Extra Charges on Flights from Japan

Delta Air Lines is leading the charge in raising airfares through fuel surcharges on flights departing from Japan. For a one-way flight to North America, Central, or South America, the surcharge is a hefty 25,000 JPY. A trip to Hawaii? That’ll cost you an additional 16,000 JPY. Delta reviews this surcharge every two months based on the average price of Singapore kerosene, meaning it’s directly tied to volatile fuel prices. Even infants traveling in seats aren’t exempt from this fee! As fuel costs rise, Delta’s passengers are seeing their flight prices skyrocket. Learn more about Delta’s Fuel Surcharge in Japan

Emirates Slaps Japan Passengers with Enormous Surcharges

Emirates has followed suit, imposing significant fuel surcharges on flights from Japan. A trip from Japan to Dubai now incurs a surcharge of ¥28,000 each way, and for journeys beyond Dubai, it jumps to ¥39,500. The surcharge applies to both economy and premium-class passengers, showing how no traveler is exempt from the cost increases. Emirates, like many other airlines, justifies this surcharge by tying it to the price of Singapore kerosene. As fuel costs remain volatile, so too does the additional cost for passengers.

Japan Airlines Forces Passengers to Pay Up: Surcharges for North America and Europe Routes

Japan Airlines (JAL) has also introduced steep fuel surcharges for international travel. For flights between Japan and North America, Europe, the Middle East, or Oceania, passengers must pay an additional USD 164 per segment. The surcharge varies by region, with cheaper rates for routes to Thailand and the Philippines. JAL reviews these surcharges every two months, and with fuel prices being unpredictable, passengers can expect to see these fees rise frequently. It’s clear that fuel surcharges are now a regular part of flying internationally with JAL. Learn more about JAL’s Surcharge Updates

Lufthansa’s Green Surcharge: Passengers Pay for Sustainable Fuel Mandates

Lufthansa Group is one of the first airlines to introduce an “Environmental Cost Surcharge.” This surcharge is in response to European Union sustainable aviation fuel mandates and carbon emissions trading systems. Beginning in 2025, passengers will pay between €1 and €72 depending on the route and class. These charges reflect the cost of complying with the EU’s green mandates. The surcharge is visible in the ticket price breakdowns, and while it’s aimed at funding environmental initiatives, passengers still end up paying more to fly with Lufthansa. Read about Lufthansa’s Green Surcharge and How It Affects Fares

Singapore’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy: Who Will Pay?

Starting in 2026, Singapore will implement a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy for all passengers departing from the country. The levy will vary based on distance and class, ranging from S$1 for short-haul flights to Southeast Asia to a hefty S$10.40 for long-haul flights to the Americas. Premium passengers will face charges up to four times higher. This government-imposed surcharge aims to fund sustainable fuel initiatives, but it’s another levy that will raise the price of flying from Singapore. The SAF levy applies to all flights from Singapore starting in 2026. Learn More About Singapore’s SAF Levy

The UK’s Air Passenger Duty: Why It’s Getting More Expensive to Fly

Air travelers in the UK are also feeling the pain of rising taxes. The Air Passenger Duty (APD) tax on flights leaving the UK will rise again in April 2026. Short-haul flights will see a modest increase from £28 to £32, but long-haul flights will face much higher taxes. Band B flights will see their APD rate jump from £216 to £244, and long-haul flights to the Americas will face an increase from £224 to £253. This tax hike is part of a broader trend of increasing government levies on air travel, further contributing to the soaring costs.

Canada’s Higher Security Charges: Adding to the Pain

Canada has also raised its Air Travellers Security Charge (ATSC), which passengers must pay for both domestic and international flights. The charge for domestic flights is now between $9.46 and $18.92 per segment, with transborder flights reaching up to $32.16. The ATSC for international flights has also risen, with some tickets now costing passengers an additional $34.42. This 33% increase in the ATSC adds another layer to the rising costs of flying in and out of Canada.

Ryanair and Qantas: Fare Hikes Even for Budget Travelers

Low-cost carrier Ryanair had a brief stint of fare cuts in FY2025, helping it carry 200 million passengers. However, by mid-2026, the airline reversed this trend, raising average fares by 13%. The increase was attributed to strong Easter demand and “fare recovery” from last year’s cuts. Similarly, Qantas saw its domestic unit revenue increase by 5% in FY25, partly due to higher seat factors and business travel demand. Both airlines, once known for their cheap fares, have been forced to raise prices as operational costs increase. Learn More About Ryanair’s Fare Adjustments

Turkish Airlines’ New Infant Fee: A Hidden Cost You Didn’t See Coming

Turkish Airlines has introduced new fees for infants traveling on a parent’s lap. Starting in January 2026, parents will need to pay 610 Turkish Lira on direct domestic flights and 915 Lira on connecting flights for their infants. This charge, which used to be nominal or free, now adds up to a significant cost for families. It’s clear that Turkish Airlines is monetizing every aspect of the flight experience, further driving up costs for passengers Read More About Turkish Airlines’ Infant Charges

Air India’s Sneaky Credit-Card Surcharge: An Extra 2.5% for Non-Preferred Cards

Air India has quietly introduced a 2.5% surcharge for tickets booked with credit cards not issued by preferred banks or registered with the airline. From May 2024, travelers using non-preferred cards will face this hidden fee, which increases ticket prices without much warning. This sneaky charge is part of a growing trend where airlines add fees for payment methods to boost revenue. Find Out More About Air India’s Credit Card Surcharge

Who’s to Blame for the Soaring Fares?

The truth is that both airlines and governments are responsible for making flying unaffordable. Airlines have raised fuel surcharges, added environmental levies, and even imposed new charges for infants and credit cards. Meanwhile, governments have introduced higher taxes and levies that make flights more expensive. The result? Air travel is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many. Passengers must be vigilant, checking ticket breakdowns carefully to understand the various surcharges and taxes added to their flights.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/airlines-6.jpeg,N,,2026-01-18 15:56:31.401237

Shell plc today is less a traditional oil company and more an enormous, evolving energy platform. It operates upstream oil and gas fields, LNG megaprojects, integrated refining and petrochemicals, fast?growing power and renewables businesses, and a sprawling global retail network stretching from petrol forecourts to fast?charging hubs for electric vehicles. Shell plc is not a single product in the narrow sense; it is the flagship portfolio of one of the world’s largest energy producers at a moment when the very idea of energy is being rewritten.

The core problem Shell plc is trying to solve is existential: how do you deliver reliable, affordable energy to a world still hungry for oil and gas, while decarbonising fast enough to remain investable, credible, and ultimately relevant? That tension runs through everything Shell does right nowfrom the oil platforms and LNG trains that still mint cash, to offshore wind farms, hydrogen hubs, and EV charging networks that are supposed to secure its future.

Investors, regulators, and customers are all watching the same story play out: can Shell plc turn a century of fossil?fuel dominance into an advantage in the low?carbon race, or will the weight of its legacy drag it down while more agile players sprint ahead?

Get all details on Shell plc here

Inside the Flagship: Shell plc

Shell plc is built around scale and integration. Its power lies in linking resources, infrastructure, and customers into a single system that can shift with global demand and regulation. To understand Shell plc as a product, you have to think in platforms, not projects.

Operationally, Shell is split into three major engines that define its offering:

1. Upstream and Integrated Gas: The Cash Machine

Shell remains one of the worlds dominant producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Its Integrated Gas division runs a portfolio of LNG assets that span Qatar, Australia, the United States, and beyond. This side of Shell plc underpins energy security for Europe and Asia, particularly as they try to reduce dependence on Russian pipeline gas while still needing flexible, dispatchable power.

The companys upstream oil and gas fields continue to generate the bulk of free cash flow. That cash is the financial backbone of the broader Shell plc strategy: funding shareholder returns, while underwriting more selective investments in low?carbon technologies and infrastructure.

2. Downstream, Chemicals & Products: From Refineries to Molecule Platforms

Shells refineries are rapidly morphing from classic fuel factories into more flexible molecule platforms. The company has closed or converted several older sites, focusing on a smaller number of ""Energy and Chemicals Parks"" that can handle bio-feedstocks, produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and support advanced plastics recycling.

Shell plcs downstream engine is increasingly about blending legacy and future: distill petroleum today; integrate biofuels tomorrow; build chemical value chains that can survive in a carbon?constrained world. The aim is to maintain Shells presence in transport and materials even as the fuels and feedstocks themselves change.

3. Renewables & Energy Solutions: The Future Bet

Shells most visible transformation sits in its Renewables and Energy Solutions segment. Here the company is building an ecosystem that spans:

Offshore and Onshore Wind: Stakes in large offshore wind zones in the North Sea and off the US East Coast, plus onshore projects in markets where policy and grid access are attractive.

Solar and Power Marketing: Utility?scale solar farms and power trading capabilities that let Shell arbitrage weather, demand, and market prices across regions.

EV Charging: Shell Recharge, a global EV charging brand, spanning thousands of charge points at service stations, supermarkets, and dedicated hubs in Europe, Asia, and North America. The pitch is simple: wherever drivers refuel today, they should be able to recharge tomorrow.

Hydrogen: Early?stage hydrogen projects serving heavy transport, industrial clients, and pilot networks of hydrogen refuelling stations.

Carbon Management: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) investments and nature?based solutions, packaged into carbon credits for corporate customers trying to hit net?zero targets.

Together, these business lines form the core of Shell plcs repositioning: it does not just produce energy; it increasingly designs, balances, and optimises energy systems. That systemic approachleveraging data, trading, infrastructure, and customer relationshipsis the unique selling proposition that few pure?play renewables developers can match.

Data, Trading and Digital: Shells Hidden Superpower

Behind the visible assets, Shell plc runs one of the worlds largest energy trading operations. This trading arm dynamically allocates molecules and electrons, balancing supply, demand, and price signals in near real time. In a grid dominated by intermittent renewables, this capability is no longer a back?office utility; it is a front?line competitive weapon.

Shell increasingly wraps this trading and optimisation expertise into digital offerings for industrial and commercial customers. Think smart power contracts, flexible LNG delivery, and hedging products tied to emissions constraints. In practice, Shell plc is selling not just energy, but resilience and optionality in a volatile market.

The Strategic Reset: Fewer Moonshots, More Disciplined Growth

The company has recalibrated its energy transition strategy in the last couple of years. Management has moved away from spreading capital thinly across every possible green technology, toward a more focused posture: double down where Shell has structural advantage (LNG, integrated power, EV charging, select biofuels and chemicals), and be far more selective with capital?intensive bets like hydrogen and large?scale offshore wind.

This has drawn criticism from some climate advocates who argue that Shell plc is slowing its decarbonisation. But from a product?strategy perspective, it is a bet that scale and integration will matter more than early?stage experimentation. Shells thesis is that customers will pay for reliable, end?to?end energy solutions, not just clean electrons in isolation.

Market Rivals: Royal Dutch Shell A (alt) -> Shell plc vs. The Competition

Shell plc does not operate in a vacuum. It is locked in a high?stakes race with other oil and gas supermajors that are trying to pull off the same trick: maintain hydrocarbon cash flow while pivoting to low?carbon and electrified energy. The most direct rivals are BP plc and TotalEnergies SE, with Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil also shaping global dynamics, even if their transition strategies differ.

Shell plc vs. BP: Competing Visions of an Integrated Energy Company

Compared directly to BPs integrated energy offering, Shell plc looks slightly more conservative on near?term decarbonisation targets, but more diversified in gas and trading.

Hydrocarbons: BP has pledged steeper absolute reductions in oil and gas production by 2030, while Shell is focused more on emissions intensity and profitability rather than outright volume cuts. That leaves Shell with a stronger medium?term cash profile, but greater exposure to long?term transition risk.

Renewables: BP has aggressively chased early renewable capacity, especially offshore wind and large solar pipelines. Shell has been more selective, focusing on projects where it can bolt on trading, supply, and customer networks.

EV Charging: Both push into charging, but Shell Recharge is more tightly integrated with a massive global retail network, from motorway service stations to urban hubs. For drivers, Shells proposition is anchored in convenience and familiarity.

Power Trading: Shells trading operation is broadly considered deeper and more diversified than BPs, particularly in LNG and short?term power markets.

In short, BP is betting harder on rapid portfolio rebalancing; Shell plc is betting on full?system optimisation and cash discipline.

Shell plc vs. TotalEnergies: Two Versions of the Same Future

Compared directly to TotalEnergies integrated energy platform, Shell plc is competing head?to?head on LNG, renewables, and EV charging, with subtle differences in emphasis.

LNG Leadership: Both Shell and TotalEnergies rank among the worlds top LNG players. Shells greater historical scale in LNG gives it a slight edge in portfolio optionality, while TotalEnergies has built a reputation for striking bold, early deals in emerging markets.

Renewable Capacity: TotalEnergies has moved quickly to lock in large solar and wind pipelines, especially in the Middle East, India, and the US. Shell plc, by contrast, has been more opportunistic, preferring projects where it can cross?sell power and services to industrial and retail customers.

Brand and Retail: Shells retail network is one of the largest in the world, offering an easier pathway to mass?market EV charging and convenience offerings. TotalEnergies is expanding, but Shell started from a larger base.

Both companies are converging on a similar vision: a portfolio balanced between hydrocarbons, power, and low?carbon molecules. Shells differentiator is its heavier emphasis on LNG and its global brand presence in mobility.

Shell vs. the Pure Plays: Orsted, Iberdrola, and Nextera

Compared directly to pure renewable developers like Orsteds offshore wind platform or Iberdrolas integrated renewables and networks business, Shell plc is less nimble but far more diversified. Where Orsted can specialise in offshore wind, Shell must juggle a thousand moving partsfrom deepwater oil to digital power contracts.

Yet this is also where Shells USP kicks in. Pure plays live and die by power prices, policy design, and project execution. Shell can lean on hydrocarbons and trading to buffer volatility, keeping its balance sheet strong enough to ride out policy cycles and technology shifts.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

In a market where everyone is promising energy transition, the question is what makes Shell plc different. Its core advantages sit in four areas: scale, integration, optionality, and customer reach.

1. Scale Meets System Thinking

Shell plc runs one of the broadest energy portfolios on the planet. That scale alone is not uniqueExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco are just as largebut Shells willingness to reconfigure that scale around new value chains is distinctive. It is not simply bolting solar onto a fossil base; it is trying to design integrated systems that run from molecule to megawatt to mobility.

This system thinking shows up in how Shell designs projects: pairing offshore wind with green hydrogen hubs, linking LNG portfolios to downstream power markets, or embedding EV charging into large mobility platforms.

2. LNG and Gas as Transitional Backbone

Where some competitors have leaned harder into absolute oil exit narratives, Shell plc has framed natural gas and LNG as the backbone of its transition strategy. The argument: as coal is phased out, flexible gas generationbacked by LNGwill remain indispensable for grid stability. That plays directly to Shells strength as the worlds leading LNG trader and one of its top producers.

In practice, this gives Shell a more bankable cash flow profile over the next one to two decades than many renewables pure plays, which are highly sensitive to interest rates, policy shifts, and supply chain constraints.

3. Global Retail and EV Charging Footprint

Shells retail network is a structural edge that is hard to overstate. Millions of drivers already visit Shell forecourts daily. As internal combustion engines give way to EVs, Shell can repurpose this physical and emotional real estate into Shell Recharge hubs, layer in convenience retail, and add services like subscription charging, loyalty schemes, and bundled home energy offers.

Compared to BP and TotalEnergies, Shell starts with more sites and a more globally recognisable fuel and mobility brand. Compared to pure charging networks, it brings superior capital, site control, and cross?selling opportunities.

4. Trading, Data, and Risk Management

Shells trading division is a quiet powerhouse. In a world of volatile prices, intermittent renewables, and weather?driven demand, the ability to dynamically optimise portfolios will separate winners from also?rans. Shell plc is positioned to sell customers not just green power, but stable, predictable outcomes: fixed?price contracts, firm supply backed by LNG and storage, and complex hedging products that smaller players cannot replicate.

5. Disciplined Capital Allocation

After a period of transition exuberance, Shells management has tightened its capital discipline. The company is pruning lower?return green projects, exiting some early?stage or subsidy?dependent ventures, and concentrating firepower where it can combine structural asset advantage with customer access and trading expertise.

The result is a version of Shell plc that looks less like a climate charity and more like a hard?nosed, returns?driven energy platform with a decarbonisation strategy. For investors, that clarity matters.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Shell plc is not just an energy platform; it is also a stock, trading under ISIN NL0000009827, that reflects how convincingly the company is navigating the transition. To understand the financial lens on Shell plc, we need to look at current market data and how investors are reading the strategy.

Current Stock Snapshot

Using live market data from multiple sources, Shell plcs London-listed shares were recently trading around the mid-20s in pounds sterling per share. Data pulled from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch on a recent trading day showed the stock at approximately GBP 260 to GBP 260 intraday, with only minor variance between sources. Both sites reported a similar 52-week range and market capitalisation in the ballpark of the high tens of billions of pounds. All price data referenced here is as of the most recent available trading session and should be checked against live feeds for intra-day moves.

When markets are closed, what matters is the last closing price. On the most recent completed session, both referenced sources showed Shell plc closing within pennies of each other, underlining data consistency.

How the Product Strategy Feeds the Valuation

For equity markets, Shell plcs sprawling product set translates into three main valuation drivers:

Hydrocarbon Cash Flow: Higher oil and gas prices, plus strong LNG margins, directly lift free cash flow, funding dividends and buybacks. This remains the primary share price driver in the near term.

Transition Credibility: Investors are increasingly screening for climate risk and stranded asset exposure. Shells renewables and energy solutions portfolio is less about current earnings and more about derisking the long?term story.

Capital Discipline: The shift toward higher-return, focused low?carbon projects is being closely watched. Markets have rewarded Shell when it has emphasised shareholder returns and disciplined capex, and punished it when transition spending looked unfocused.

The balance between these forces explains Shells valuation discount relative to pure-play renewables (which trade on growth) and its often modest premium to some oil peers (which trade on yield and resilience). Investors are essentially pricing in a hybrid: a high?yielding oil and gas major with a credible, but still maturing, energy transition engine.

Is Shell plc a Growth Driver for the Stock?

From a product perspective, the elements of Shell plc that have the clearest potential to structurally re?rate the stock over time are:

LNG and Integrated Gas: As global LNG demand grows, particularly in Asia and Europe, Shells leading position in LNG supply and trading could justify a higher multiple than traditional upstream oil.

Renewables and Power: If Shell can demonstrate that its integrated power and renewables portfolio can achieve mid?teens or better returns on capital at scale, markets could start to value this business more like a utilities/renewables hybrid than a legacy oil segment.

Mobility and EV Charging: Shell Recharge and the broader mobility platform are still in investment mode, but success here would anchor Shell in the future of transport. A profitable, scaled EV charging and convenience ecosystem would support a more durable earnings base as liquid fuel demand eventually plateaus.

In practice, Shell plcs stock remains tightly linked to macro energy prices and geopolitics. But the more the company can show that its integrated energy platform can grow earnings and cash flow independently of crude benchmarks, the more investors will treat the shares as a genuine transition play, not just a cyclical oil bet with a green halo.

The Bottom Line

Shell plc is a product of contradictions: it is at once a dominant fossil fuel producer and an ambitious player in renewables, power, and low?carbon molecules. Its edge does not lie in having the single biggest wind farm or the flashiest hydrogen pilot. It lies in its ability to orchestrate an entire energy ecosystemfrom wellhead and LNG terminal to grid connection, EV charger, and corporate contract.

That orchestration is what could keep Shell at the centre of the global energy system as it is rewired for net zero. The question is not whether Shell plc can build green assets; it is whether it can turn its historical weight into a flexible, profitable platform for the next energy era. On that front, the company is not yet finished, but it is significantly ahead of many rivalsand markets are already starting to price in that advantage.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405025_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:56:35.682300
