Your leftovers may one day help power airplanes. Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign have developed a way to transform food waste into a clean, high-energy fuel capable of powering commercial jets — without requiring any changes to aircraft engines.

From kitchen waste to jet fuel

In a study published in Nature Communications, agricultural engineers detailed how they converted discarded food from processing plants into bio-crude oil using a process known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). This method mimics how the Earth naturally forms fossil fuels over millions of years — only it does it in hours, using heat, water, and pressure.

The resulting oil is then refined into jet fuel through a two-step cleaning and upgrading process. First, impurities such as salts and moisture are removed. Next, the oil undergoes catalytic hydrotreating — a process that strips away unwanted elements like nitrogen and sulfur. The team found that a cobalt–molybdenum catalyst was particularly effective for refining the oil into the specific hydrocarbons required for aviation fuel.

The finished product passed tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration, meeting all the technical standards for commercial jet fuel. “This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” said project lead Yuanhui Zhang. “We take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product.”

Closing aviation’s emissions gap

Aviation accounts for about 7 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Electric batteries can power small aircraft, but not long-haul jets, since jet fuel carries about 50 times more energy per kilogram than current lithium-ion technology.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — derived from renewable or recycled sources — could reduce flying emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional kerosene. The new food-waste-based version adds another potential feedstock to that growing list, offering a way to cut both emissions and waste.

Scaling the solution

For now, the breakthrough is proof of concept. Producing enough food-derived jet fuel to supply commercial fleets will require major industrial investment and infrastructure. “Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in,” Zhang said.

If scaled successfully, the method could offer a circular solution for one of aviation’s toughest environmental challenges — turning yesterday’s leftovers into tomorrow’s takeoff fuel.

(NASDAQ: GEVO) delivered a major earnings surprise for the third quarter of 2025, posting results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and highlighted a sharp turnaround in its financial performance.

Record Revenue Growth and Strong Financial Recovery

For Q3 2025, Gevo reported revenues of $43.6 million, far above analyst forecasts of $37.03 million, and a dramatic increase from about $2 million during the same period last year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.03, beating the expected loss of $0.04.

Most notably, Gevo achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million, marking its second consecutive quarter of profitability. This was a major improvement compared to a loss of $16.7 million a year ago, reflecting improving operational efficiency and higher cash flow from its facilities.

The company ended the quarter with $108 million in cash, ensuring a strong liquidity position as it continues investing in growth projects.

North Dakota Facility Powers Carbon and Ethanol Gains

Gevo’s North Dakota operations were the cornerstone of its quarterly success, contributing $12.3 million in operational income. This performance was driven by efficient low-carbon ethanol production, carbon sequestration, and robust sales of clean fuel and voluntary carbon credits.

During the quarter, the site achieved several operational milestones:

Produced 17 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol

Generated 46,000 tons of protein and corn oil co-products

Sequestered 42,000 tons of carbon dioxide

Produced 92,000 MMBtu of renewable natural gas (RNG)

Gevo’s Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) system has now stored over 560,000 metric tons of CO₂ since its launch in June 2022, making it the world’s first ethanol dry mill to achieve commercial-scale carbon storage.

The company also capitalized on Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs), selling all its remaining 2025 credits worth $30 million, bringing total CFPC sales for the year to $52 million. This reflects Gevo’s ability to monetize carbon-linked incentives effectively.

Carbon Credit Expansion Strengthens Revenue Mix

Gevo is rapidly scaling its carbon revenue streams. In Q3 2025, the company signed a multi-year offtake agreement expected to generate around $26 million in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) credit sales over five years, with the potential to increase volumes.

By the end of 2025, Gevo expects carbon co-product sales to grow to $3–5 million, up from $1 million in Q2. The company projects that long-term annual carbon revenues could exceed $30 million as it optimizes its carbon accounting and trading systems.

Gevo’s carbon credits are certified under the Puro.Earth standard, ensuring over 1,000 years of permanence, among the most durable forms of carbon removal on the market. Its customers include Nasdaq and Biorecro, signaling growing confidence from corporate buyers in Gevo’s durable carbon removal capabilities.

This dual-income approach, combining low-carbon fuel sales with carbon credit monetization, strengthens Gevo’s position in both the voluntary and compliance carbon markets.

Strategic Focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the main pillar of Gevo’s long-term strategy. Through its proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, the company converts renewable ethanol into low-carbon jet fuel, helping airlines decarbonize air travel.

Gevo plans a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026 for its upcoming ATJ-30 plant, a project designed to scale synthetic SAF production at its North Dakota site. Once completed, the plant could play a central role in meeting the aviation sector’s growing SAF demand.

SAF Market Forecast

The global SAF market is expanding rapidly. In 2025, the market was valued at about $2.25 billion but is forecasted to soar to $134.57 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of over 57 percent, according to industry estimates. This surge is driven by regulatory mandates, green aviation goals, and policies like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative.

Gevo’s integrated approach linking SAF production, ethanol output, and carbon monetization aligns perfectly with the industry’s transition toward net-zero aviation. As the company scales ethanol production to 75 million gallons annually, it expects a substantial boost in SAF output and carbon credit revenues.

Carbon Capture and Policy Incentives Drive Future Growth

The company capitalizes on the intersection of clean fuel policy, carbon markets, and technology innovation. By sequestering carbon at its ethanol facilities, the company captures and sells verified carbon credits while also producing renewable fuels that qualify for federal incentives.

With growing policy support and rising carbon prices, Gevo is positioned to benefit from both market-based carbon trading and tax credit monetization. The Section 45Z clean fuel credits, in particular, provide strong financial incentives that enhance the company’s margins and encourage further expansion.

As governments tighten emission standards and airlines commit to net-zero targets by 2050, the demand for SAF and durable carbon credits will continue to rise. Gevo’s technology and operations are built to meet this challenge while maintaining commercial viability.

Investor Confidence and Stock Performance

Following its strong Q3 2025 results, Gevo’s stock rose over 4 percent in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s growth trajectory. The stock trades around $2.12 per share with a market capitalization of about $513 million.

Investors are increasingly viewing Gevo as a clean-energy growth stock, citing:

Consistent revenue growth and improving EBITDA margins

Clear strategic direction toward SAF and carbon capture

Effective monetization of clean fuel tax credits and carbon offsets

The company’s solid balance sheet, strong policy tailwinds, and successful operational execution position it favorably within the renewable hydrocarbon fuels market.

Gevo’s Role in the Green Aviation Future

The aviation sector targets a 65% reduction in emissions through SAF by 2050. And companies like Gevo will play a critical role in meeting that goal. Its ATJ technology, carbon sequestration systems, and integration with carbon markets make it one of the few clean fuel developers with a fully circular carbon strategy.

Significantly, its North Dakota operations serve as a blueprint for carbon-negative fuel production, proving that decarbonization and profitability can coexist. With expansion plans for 2026 and beyond, the company is well-positioned to scale both its fuel and carbon businesses.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2304894779.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 14:00:45.820761

The GBP2 billion SAF plant is relocating from its Billingham site in Teesside to a neighbouring larger site in Seal Sands, just 500m from its original location. The new site will offer closer access to key infrastructure, including carbon capture and storage facilities, and has additional space for expanded on-site processing. It will also facilitate seamless integration of the SAF into the network once online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in SAF production,” said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami.

“Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world. This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

The project which is due to come online in 2030 aims to convert 1.5 million tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks, including forestry, sawmill and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF mandate, into more than 180 million litres of second-generation SAF. This is the equivalent of offsetting carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

Commenting on Alfanar’s investment in Teesside during a visit to the engineering firm’s HQ on Monday 10 November, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, said: “Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future and Alfanar’s GBP2 billion investment to build the world’s largest SAF plant is a clear signal of that leadership.

Construction of the plant will commence in 2026, with COD in 2028. I have written before that SAF seems to be the most valuable fuel when measured in $ per MMBTU terms. Yet there's only that much UCO available to produce SAF via the prevalent HEFA pathway. The world will soon need to move to other feedstock to produce the required amount of SAF as more and more countries implement SAF mandates. Eg Singapore will target a 1% SAF blend for all departing flights from 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030. Aether's Aurora technology can create sustainable fuels from any feedstock that can be converted to CO, CO2, and/or CH4. Feedstock flexibility is a key advantage. The company doesn't do the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion. Instead, it focuses on the parts before and after FT, ie an electrified & intensified syngas generation, and an intensified upgrading of FT hydrocarbons. See Aether’s website for more details - https://lnkd.in/gW2Rt5B8 For Project Beacon, the feedstock will be industrial waste gases and biomethane and this will be turned into CORSIA certified SAF. The biomethane supply chain in the region is something Singapore hopes it can catalyse. Feedstock can of course also come from the gasification of the abundant biomass waste in Southeast Asia. Offtakers for Aether's SAF can be Singapore Airlines Group (for which Aether has a MOU - https://lnkd.in/gUUTyyrd) or perhaps CAAS in its procurement of SAF for the national blend mandate.

Airlander 10 is a new type of hybrid aircraft that uses a combination of aerostatic lift, aerodynamic lift, and vectored thrust, with a 10 tonne payload and 4,000 nautical mile maximum range. The initial Airlander 10 will be powered by four diesel engines, providing an emissions reduction of up to 90% when compared with comparable capacity aircraft. Integrating ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-electric propulsion will deliver full zero-emission in-flight operations carrying 100+ passengers, as well as reduced maintenance costs.

ZeroAvia’s first generation 600kW hydrogen-electric powertrain – ZA600 – has already passed several regulatory milestones, secured hundreds of pre-orders and signed up launch customer airlines who are working to embed the system into more traditional fixed-wing aircraft for lower cost and more environmentally friendly flight. The company has conducted flight testing of a prototype on board a 19-seat aircraft.

With ample space for hydrogen storage in the hull, the Airlander represents an excellent option for adopting the first generation of certified hydrogen technologies that are already close to market entry: hydrogen storage, low temperature PEM fuel cell power generation and electric propulsion systems that are well advanced in the certification journey. This partnership will build on HAV’s earlier R&D work to explore electric propulsion for Airlander.

As part of the agreement, the companies will also study the potential applicability of ZeroAvia’s hydrogen-electric technology to future larger aircraft developed by Hybrid Air Vehicles, and assess planned Airlander 10 operations to define the hydrogen fuel infrastructure requirements.

Tom Grundy, Hybrid Air Vehicles, said:

“ZeroAvia has led the development of hydrogen-electric propulsion systems and made impressive progress commercially, technically and with regulators. Our intention has always been to offer our customers a fully zero-emission variant of the Airlander, for efficiency and environmental reasons, and this partnership with ZeroAvia will help us in this direction.”

Val Miftakhov, Founder & CEO, ZeroAvia said:

“Airlander is another exciting airframe for line-fit of our powertrains as it can open up a whole new market in air travel due to its range, efficiency and ability to operate from almost anywhere.

The Project Beacon facility will be developed by climate technology start-up Aether Fuels and Aster, and produce up to 50 barrels a day – or 2,000 tonnes of fuel annually – when completed in 2028.

It will be located at Aster’s refining hub on Pulau Bukom, which the chemical, energy and infrastructure solutions company took over from Shell in April.

Aster and Aether Fuels, which inked their partnership on Nov 11, did not disclose their investment amount.

Before this, Aether Fuels – which has counted Temasek-owned Xora Innovation as its lead investor since 2022 – had a pilot plant in the United States.

The technology that Aether Fuels uses to produce the green aviation fuel yields 20 per cent more fuel while requiring only half as much investment in equipment compared with producing sustainable fuel using waste oils, according to Mr Conor Madigan, the company’s founder and chief executive.

The technology is also flexible as it can use various other raw materials.

Construction will begin in the second half of 2026, and the facility will employ 24 staff once operational.

A second, larger plant is also being planned in parallel with the initial facility. It can produce 1,000 barrels of the fuel per day, said Mr Madigan. This translates to an annual production of 330,000 tonnes.

Sustainable aviation fuel is jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources that produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil jet fuel.

Finnish energy giant Neste

operates a refinery in Tuas South

that can produce up to one million tonnes of such fuel from waste materials like used cooking oil and animal fats annually.

Aether Fuels’ technology uses industrial waste gases and biomethane to produce the fuel, which achieves a more than 70 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional jet fuel, according to the company . This approach is not as readily available as the technology used by Neste.

Sustainable aviation fuel is widely regarded as the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, which contributes to 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions, as it does not require aircraft modification or new airport infrastructure. The fuel is blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel before use.

The greener fuel is almost four times more expensive than fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Mr Madigan said that in August, sustainable aviation fuel cost between US$2,700 (S$3,517) and US$2,800 per tonne, compared with between US$700 and US$800 per tonne for conventional jet fuel.

He said Aether Fuels aims to narrow this price gap, although costs will still depend on factors beyond its control, such as the price of hydrogen and renewable energy, which is needed for production.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at the Changi and Seletar airports in 2026. On Nov 10, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced that from October 2026, passengers and cargo on departing flights from Singapore

will be subjected to a levy to fund

purchases of sustainable aviation fuel to meet this target.

In February 2025, SIA Group signed a memorandum of understanding with Aether Fuels to potentially buy the fuel for five years when Aether begins commercial production. The sustainable aviation fuel will be blended with regular jet fuel before being supplied to selected airports served by SIA and its subsidiary, Scoot.

In September 2024, JetBlue signed a non-binding agreement with Aether to potentially buy fuel when commercial production begins.

Speaking at Aster and Aether Fuels’ signing ceremony, Economic Development Board chairman Png Cheong Boon said the partnership reflects the ongoing transformation taking place in Singapore’s energy and chemicals sector.

He said the energy and chemicals sector accounts for about a quarter of Singapore’s manufacturing output and contributes 3 per cent to the country’s gross domestic product, making it one of the largest manufacturing sectors.

Singapore wants the industry to go green in step with global trends, and the Aster-Aether Fuels partnership aligns with the country’s vision for the industry and “helps steer the industry towards that goal”, he added.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/18685fca61ef00958f9cd347ca3dc93e325b3039b9910bac131f35e12920f851,N,,2025-11-11 09:56:20.593078

Ben Sampson: Hello, I’m Ben Sampson, editor of Aerospace Testing International, the world’s leading magazine dedicated to the application of testing, evaluation, and inspection in the aerospace industry.

Welcome to this episode of the Testing Talk Podcast from ATI

Sustainable aviation fuel SAF has risen up many people’s agenda’s again in aviation – as the number one way to reduce the sector’s emissions. I thought it would be a good time to speak to an expert about SAF from a technical point of view.

Francesco di Sabatino, who is a group leader in the Combustion for Power and Propulsion Group at the Southwest Research Institute is that expert. He and his researchers have just completed a test program comparing the performance and emissions of SAF, efuel and Jet A to each other, and plan to make the results public.

He has some early insights to share from the comparison and some thoughts on how we could enhance SAF to make it more appealing to aircraft operators that I think you will find interesting.

So now – wherever you are and whatever you are doing – it’s time to listen back to my interview with Francesco di Sabatino from the Southwest Research Institute.

As the name says, we do a lot of stuff related to power and propulsion, mainly in the field of combustion. Southwest Research Institute is a non-profit organization, a research institution that’s been around for more than seventy years, always here in San Antonio. That is kind of in the center of Texas, more or less.

Southwest really does everything from deep sea to deep space. This is our model really. So we develop submersibles for the for the Navy, I believe, as well as spacecraft for NASA. Combustion is just a part of all this stuff. We really do a lot of a lot of different things.

And Southwest Research Institute lives in what we call the Valley of Death. So from TRL seven to eight. We help our clients to develop a product or we develop products for our clients to bring to commercialization. We do not sell any products. We do research for clients or the government.

Ben: So you’re not really blue skies research so much. It’s more research and testing which is closer to industry. Right?

Francesco: Correct. Although, we do have a very small part of our Institute that does basic research or science. But we mostly work with industry. Yes.

Ben: And now you’ve recently done a project about sustainable aviation fuel, which compared it to, e-fuels and normal jet fuel. Can you just talk me through that, what you did and why you did it? What you were trying to find out?

Francesco: Sure. So I’ve been exposed to sustainable aviation fuel before joining Southwest Research Institute, and I wanted to continue that research here as well, mainly because it showed me that there is a lot of like work that has to be done on SAF, right?

There are companies producing SAF, but the amount of information available in the literature is very limited. Mainly because all these companies are very protective of their products. So for engine testing the data available is very, very limited because lots of large OEMs don’t really want to share.

So the overarching idea was really to try to produce a data set that could be used by everybody in the world, to maybe help them develop new fuels. Or if they’re working on engine testing, as a starting point for that. When I started looking inside our Institute at who was working on SAF, I found groups working on SAF production as well as characterization, like for ASTM certification. I put together all these people to try to develop a project to produce a very complete data set to release to the public.

And that’s what we’ve achieved. We produced our own SAF that we then blended with Jet A and we characterized this blend. Plus we characterized commercially available SAF as well as commercially available Jet A, then we tested all three fuels in our jet engine. We measured engine performance and emissions, both gaseous and particulate. We noticed some interesting stuff, that will be published very soon in a paper. But again, the focus really is on producing a data set that can be used by anyone.

Ben: So you identified a lack of data and knowledge about SAF within industry, and you’ve attempted to fill that gap by producing your own fuels and then testing them all in-house. Right?

Francesco: Yes.

Ben: Okay. Fantastic. Alright. So can you tell me a little bit more about the production? Let’s talk about the testing in a moment, I mean, we’re interested in the results. But producing that amount of fuel, how did you go about that? You’re producing SAF and e-fuel, which is fuel from water, isn’t it? Using electrolysis?

Francesco: It can be, there can be a lot of different sources. So unfortunately, I cannot really talk about that technology because its proprietary, but I can guide you through the steps that we followed.

To start with we got a feedstock from a client that generously dontated it. Even getting a feedstock is not simple. It’s not something you can find online, for example, It’s very rare. Then we, hydrotreated that feedstock. And we produce liquid fuel out of that. We add the hydrogen and heat, and we have a Catalytic process. All of these remove the impurities of oxygen and other things that can be in the original feedstock.

After that we do isomerization. We try to improve the quality of the fuel. Because whatever you get from the first step is not the right quality. These processes improve quality until you get to the distillation, and that’s where you actually get the kind of quality that you need for putting it into a jet engine.

So that’s the process we followed. And, let me tell you it’s not a cheap process. Especially if you do it on a small scale. It’s expensive

Ben: Yeah, that was my question there, actually. But do you need a lot of fuel to do this?

Francesco: No, we don’t need a lot. We can do tests in our system with less than a barrel of fuel. So, fifty-five gallons, fifty gallons. So we didn’t have to produce a lot. Our blend ended up being around 15%, and 85% Jet A. So we didn’t really need a lot, but even that small amount was quite expensive because, we’re not producing the fuel at scale. We do have that capability. But we’re not doing it for that project. But, yeah, if you produce a small scale, it’s usually expensive.

Ben: So let’s talk a bit about the testing. I mean how did you do the testing? What tests did you put the different fuels through? How how did you ensure that you could compare the data sets from each fuel?

Francesco: Yes. So of course there are many ways that you can do these tests. We investigated different ways and had to settle with the one that was feasible for us. It might not be the best way of comparing the fuels, but that was working for us.

So the reality was that we were comparing different engine throttle conditions, so fixed throttle and just seeing how the engine does with the different fuels. Again there are other ways. This was the way we decided due to several limitations with our system.

We tested the three fuels one after the other. After each test we actually purge all the lines and try to purge the lines inside the engines with nitrogen as well as. We measured engine performance based on air flow rate through the engine, the rotational speeds of the compressor and turbine and pressure and temperature along the engines such as compressor discharge, turbine inlet and turbine outlet temperature, things like that.

We also measured gaseous emissions in terms of CO, CO2, oxygen, if you want to call that an emission, and NOx and sulfur oxides. We also measured particulate matter, volatile and non-volatile, specifically soot. and we also did a quite interesting analysis of soot particles. We put the soot particles we collected on specific filters then analyzed them with a scanning electron microscope. So we could go very into the details of the particulate and try to see exactly what the particulate looks like. Such as if there are any kinds of other components on the surface of the particle. So that’s what we’re done for testing.

Ben: What was the trickiest part? I mean, what was the cleverest part of the test to set up? Because you’ve got an engine running on a stand, right? A jet engine in the lab. Okay. And then, I mean, what was the trickiest part to get right or measure?

Francesco: Yes. I would say one thing was trying to get similar humidity levels, because humidity swings quite a lot here in Texas. But also trying to collect the exhaust gases very close to the engine was tricky for material compatibility. The gases were very hot as we were trying to collect them from the engine core and not from the dilution. So, to really have whatever was coming out from the combustor. And for that, we had to kind of design a custom-made probe that we installed just outside the engine.

Ben: Okay. So what? what did you find out ? Was there any differences or anything that surprised you between the emissions of each type of fuel?

Francesco: Honestly, lots of them were expected. So in terms of engine performance, we didn’t see substantial differences between the fuels. But again, that was expected because SAF blends are designed to be dropped in, so are designed to be somewhat similar to jet fuel.

What we observed in terms of emission was that sulfur emissions were much, much smaller compared to Jet A. That was kind of expected because the sulfur in the fuel comes from oil. So it’s present in the process to get jet fuel. while that’s not the case for SAF, right? There’s no sulfur to begin with, so sulfur levels to begin with in the fuel were very limited.

Another thing we observed is that soot particles where substantially less than expected, because the aromatics content was less for the SAF. We observed different, NOx emissions. That was somewhat unexpected. We are still working on trying to understand why that was the case. But we observed substantial difference between NOx, Jet A and SAF. So that’s a very interesting result, and we are still investigating why that is the case.

Unfortunately, our system didn’t have a lot of access to the actual combustion process, because it happens inside the engine. So we are we have limited information about what is going on with the combustion itself, where the NOx is formed. So that’s why it’s taking a little longer to understand why we have these differences in NOx.

Ben: You had an e-fuel you were testing as well. Are you describing the e-fuel as SAF? And was there any differences between the fuel that you made?

Francesco: So compared to the commercially available stuff that we bought on the market, there was some small differences. But the end product is very similar. Right? It’s not like we are getting something that is jet fuel like, it is jet fuel. So we were not expecting a substantial difference.

Ben: So in terms of the composition of this fuel and the composition of the emissions and particulates that you’re getting. You’re really just seeing environmental benefits at this level.

Francesco: Correct. But I would say I want to add one thing. I think here we really have a kind of an opportunity. Right. Because right now we are trying to create SAF to be exactly like jet fuel. But we practically have full control on the composition of the fuel. So why not produce this fuel in such a way that can enhance the performance of the engine? Maybe you will end up with like less fuel consumption. So overall you get lower emissions and more efficiency. I know that this is may not possible at the moment for safety reasons. but there is an opportunity here and I think, we should look at that in the future and say, okay, maybe we should move away from trying to be exactly the same as a Jet A and try to generate a fuel that has better performance.

Ben: How might you do that?

Francesco: I mean, you can definitely control the chemical composition of your fuel, right? So you can change the performance and fuel is composed by major components such as alkanes, aromatics. I’m not a chemical engineer but I’m somewhat familiar with that. You can change the relative percentages to get better performance. However, we’re probably like several years, maybe decades away from that. But I just want to highlight that, we are looking into making something that is same as Jet A, but maybe we should look at something that is better than Jet A.

Ben: So will you be doing any follow up studies or research ?

Francesco: So yes, we will. I cannot really talk about the details, but we have follow-up studies next year, 2026. And we are also establishing a more structured program here at Southwest to keep working on stuff like this all together. The various groups that participated will maybe in the future be organizing a workshop here on site, and try to bring people from the various aspects of SAF, like production, characterization and testing on site, put them in the same room and try to come up with good results there.

Ben: So what’s the main message? The main implication? That you would say there is no real difference between these types of fuels for airplane operators?

Francesco: In terms of performance yes, there is no main differences. Right. But that’s by design, right? That’s how the SAF has been designed in past years in terms of mission. There is a difference for the environment, right? So we definitely should keep pushing them. I think I forgot to mention, we don’t have an explanation for this at the moment, but also the smell of burning stuff and burning Jet A was different. There was much less smell from burning it than burning Jet A. So that’s also a good thing for the airport, and for whoever lives around the airport.

But the message here is really, we need to keep working on stuff. We need to keep developing data sets that can be used by everybody. I’m really advocating for sharing data, because to me, that’s the only way of getting to a point that you can demonstrate that this stuff is valuable and it gives less emissions. So it’s good for everybody.

Ben: Thanks, Francesco. It’s a really interesting study, and I’m pleased we’ve been able to catch up about it. I just got a one or two final questions really about the more general landscape of the industry.

Francesco: Yeah,

Ben: There’s some tough questions that perhaps are beyond me and you answering over the next couple of minutes at least. But I just wouldn’t mind your thoughts on them if that’s okay. I mean there are some barriers to the introduction of SAF, that aren’t perhaps engineering-related. I mean, I’m talking here mainly about the cost and incentives to scale up. Do you see SAF in general for the industry as a practical way to reduce emissions? Do you think it’s a good idea that we can do?

Francesco: Yes. I think we should look at all technologies, and see which one is the most valuable.

From my experience SAF seems to be the only way right now. The other options, for example, hydrogen dibt seems to be very feasible at this stage. SAF is exactly the same as Jet A, and we know how to use Jet A. We know how to handle SAF, so it seems to be the way.

However, in my opinion, we need to create a market for SAF and the market is not really there yet. That’s one of the reasons why the price of it is very high. Even getting a new production facility is extremely expensive. If there is no market for the SAF its because we’re not creating it, then there’s no way we’re going to use it. The market can be created by incentives from the government. For example in Europe there are mandates for that. That’s one way. But without a market for SAF it’s going to stay too expensive and airlines won’t be able to afford it. If they are able to afford it, then the customer will have to pay for it. And I don’t know if people are willing to pay maybe two or three times the cost of the ticket for SAF.

Ben: So going back to what you just said about at the moment we’re trying to match as a drop in fuel. Do you think there’s real scope to make SAF even better than jet fuel? You know, that could be a way to tempt people to use it.

Francesco: Yes. That could be one way. Sure. I think that’s, that’s a good idea. However again because of the cost it probably won’t be competitive anyway. So again I think it’s good to make it. But we should make it better. But we should also think about the cost of making it.

Ben: Just finally, do you think there’s any, you mentioned some of the ASTM standards that you were working towards. And do you think do you think there’s anything different that they could do to help it?

Francesco: I know. I think it’s very difficult. Because safety is paramount. There’s nothing more important than safety for an aircraft. And that’s sticking for a very long time. So the industry has been risk averse since it was born. So I think the combination of all these things makes things go slowly, but maybe it’s a good thing they are going slowly, right? Because then we are sure that we’re going to get a product that is safe and can be used properly. But this safety also comes with this cost. So again, it’s all about balance with these factors.

Ben: But studies like yours help to increase awareness that the fuel can be used and is harmless in aircraft. And, well, it’s harmless in aircraft and with environmental benefits beyond normal jet fuel.

Francesco: Yes, correct. That’s my idea as well. Right. To just to show the benefits, to show this with real measurements, proper measurement that shows the emissions are less with the same performance. That’s one of the main goals of the project.

Ben: So will the data be freely available at some point?

Francesco: Yes. It’s going to be open source. As soon as the paper is published. We are going to also publish it on our website and all the other things. So people, will we have free access to it.

Ben: You know what? That will be not to put pressure on you.

Francesco: Yeah it’s a very large paper. So it takes time.

Ben: All right. Great. Okay. Well, Francesca, thank you again for your time and talking me through the project that you’ve just done. It’s very interesting. I’m sure our listeners or our readers will find it very interesting, too. So. Yeah. Great. Bye

Francesco: Thank you.

Ben: Bye.

“From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude.” Nature Communications 2025.","Trash that would otherwise rot in landfills could be converted into 62.5 billion liters of jet fuel per year, with a carbon footprint 80-90% smaller than that of fossil-based aviation fuel, according to a new study (1).

Aviation represents 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is extremely hard to decarbonize. One potential solution is sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) made from renewable feedstocks. But some of these feedstocks come with their own problems – biofuel crops can displace natural ecosystems or food crops, for example.

That has produced a surge of interest in making fuel from various forms of waste. “There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,” says study team member Michael McElroy, professor of environmental studies at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Using these wastes as feedstocks could reduce the cost of the decarbonization transition for hard-to-abate sectors.”

Municipal solid waste is a great potential feedstock because there’s already a collection system for it and it’s abundant all year round. But trash-based fuel hasn’t been the subject of much research. The new analysis is the first to use real-world data from commercial facilities involved in various production steps to calculate the potential of this approach at a global scale.

Making fuel from trash is challenging because the material is so heterogeneous. That means more steps and more energy used for manufacturing and refining the fuel. Still, the international team of U.S. and Chinese researchers calculated that globally, more than 62.5 billion liters of trash-based jet fuel could be produced each year. Incorporating it into the aviation fuel supply would reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the industry by 16%.

The initial step of turning solid waste into a mix of gases emerged as particularly tricky. “Gasification technology remains a core technical challenge in biomass energy development,” says study team member Ming Zhao, professor of environmental engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. “Its reliability and efficiency are crucial to the sustainability of green fuel synthesis, and progress on low-carbon fuels, whether methanol or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, depends on advancing this process.”

But researchers are working to improve gasification and other processes involved in making SAFs. In a separate study, researchers at the University of Illinois developed a new method for making jet fuel from food waste, which comprises the largest share of municipal solid waste in many areas (2).

It’s pretty easy to turn food waste into a high-energy liquid fuel through a process known as hydrothermal liquefaction. The problem is that this biocrude oil has a varied chemical composition, but the jet fuel needs to be uniform and extremely precise.

The researchers tested dozens of chemical catalysts for refining the biocrude and hit upon one containing the elements cobalt and molybdenum that can do the job in a single step, resulting in jet fuel that meets current industry standards.

While the result could be fine-tuned further, the researchers say it is the first food-waste-based jet fuel that could be used directly in airplanes without needing to be blended with fossil-based jet fuel.

The food-waste biocrude could also be refined into gasoline and diesel fuel, the researchers say. But while both food waste and municipal solid waste could be part of the solution to SAFs, neither is sufficient to replace conventional jet fuel completely – a sobering reminder of just how much fuel airplanes (and other fossil-based forms of transportation) burn.

Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.","Europe faces a critical decade for aviation decarbonisation. Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise; unlike road transport, aircraft cannot realistically switch to electric or hydrogen propulsion at scale in the near term. That makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) — and the next generation of synthetic SAFs (eSAF) — the most viable path for deep emissions cuts this decade.

SAFs can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% while working seamlessly with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. Yet despite this potential, SAFs today represent only around 2% of European jet fuel use. While the current supply is sufficient to meet demand, high production costs remain a significant barrier.

Conventional jet fuel trades currently at roughly US$600/t, compared with around US$2000 for SAF and US$7500 for eSAF. Producers need firm investment decisions now to expand capacity by 2030, but airlines remain cautious about long-term offtake agreements at these prices.

“No single fuel will dominate aviation in the decades ahead,” says Axel Vanmeulder, Renewable Fuels Expert. “Even in the most optimistic scenarios, fossil fuels remain part of the mix. But sustainable aviation fuel is by far the most viable option for the sector in the next twenty years.”

Overcoming the barriers to SAF adoption

The bottlenecks are clear and interconnected:

Feedstock limits: bio-based SAFs derived from used cooking oils, food waste, and other residues will reach their practical limits between 2030 and 2040. Beyond that, scaling eSAF production using renewable hydrogen and captured carbon will be vital. This makes early planning for synthetic fuels essential to avoid future shortages.

Price gap: SAF today costs roughly three times more than fossil jet fuel, and eSAF is currently more than 10 times as expensive, making long-term offtake agreements difficult to secure.

Investment risk: producers face multi-billion-dollar capital commitments years before revenues flow. Without credible offtake deals or policy certainty, projects remain financially unviable.

Policy instability: airlines and producers need predictable, long-term frameworks. Sudden changes in mandates or incentives can delay projects and reduce investor confidence.

Credibility: “Supply chains need watertight certification and audits,” notes Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of greenwashing — like palm oil being passed off as waste oil — the entire market risks losing trust.

“The cost gap is the biggest barrier. Jet fuel today trades around US$600/t, SAF is about US$2000, and synthetic SAF is closer to US$7500. Airlines are hesitant to sign long-term offtake agreements at those levels and with these price gaps, yet without them producers can’t move forward with investment decisions.

“Feedstocks like used cooking oil and food waste can only take us so far — they’ll reach their limits by 2030 – 2040. That’s why synthetic fuels, made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon, are already being written into future mandates.”

Regulation: driving change and creating demand

Regulation is now the sharpest lever for transformation. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending, rising from 2% in 2025 to 6% by 2030¹, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050¹. Within this framework, a sub-mandate requires eSAF to reach 1.2% of total supply by 2030 — a critical measure for synthetic fuel growth. This sharp increase could flip today’s surplus into a shortage unless projects are financed and built in advance.

“The step-up in 2030 is significant,” Axel Vanmeulder explains. “In Europe, the SAF mandate jumps from 2% to 6% overnight. That could turn today’s oversupply into a shortage if projects aren’t built now.”

In the UK, the forthcoming SAF Mandate follows a similar trajectory, beginning at 2% in 2025 and climbing to 10% by 2030², with future rises to 22% by 2040². The UK’s alignment with Europe ensures a consistent market signal across two major aviation regions.

Globally, the CORSIA scheme (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) developed by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), requires airlines to offset emissions above 2019 levels³ on international flights. Though less demanding than EU rules, CORSIA establishes a global baseline, ensuring that airlines cannot ignore their emissions.

“CORSIA is a global floor — it ensures airlines can’t ignore their emissions on international flights. European mandates go further, but CORSIA makes carbon pricing and fuel transition unavoidable for every carrier worldwide.”

Beyond Europe, countries including China, Singapore, and India are developing their own SAF mandates — signalling that the transition is global and irreversible. Harmonised standards will be critical to reduce complexity and costs for airlines operating internationally.

Corporate momentum: industry taking flight

Major airlines and energy producers are already demonstrating that SAF is viable today:

Lufthansa Group is using SAF derived from used cooking oils and waste residues, achieving lifecycle emission cuts of around 80%.

JetBlue Airways has secured regular SAF supplies at key US airports, supported by corporate partners sharing the cost premium.

United Airlines has launched a dedicated investment fund to scale future SAF production.

In the UK, the RAF is deploying renewable HVO fuel across its operations4 — proof that sustainable fuels can deliver both performance and carbon reductions.

These examples show that with policy clarity, investment, and collaboration, SAF adoption is already creating tangible operational and environmental benefits.

Government and industry collaboration: lessons from fusion

Large-scale coordination between governments and industry can accelerate the deployment of breakthrough energy technologies. A prominent example outside aviation is the international nuclear fusion project, where over 20 countries are collaborating in a multi-billion-dollar experiment5 to demonstrate a proof of concept.

This demonstrates the potential for global cooperation to overcome technical and financial barriers, a model that could be applied to scaling SAF. Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.

Challenges and market realities: learning from setbacks

While SAF adoption is critical, the sector faces economic and operational hurdles. Shell’s decision to cancel its Rotterdam biofuels plant provides a stark example. The facility was planned to produce up to 820 000 t of biofuels, half intended for SAF from waste cooking oils and animal fat, but after technical delays5 and market reassessments, the project was deemed “insufficiently competitive” and scrapped.

This highlights the complex interplay of cost, investment risk, and policy stability. Even technically viable projects can fail if SAF prices are too high, if airlines delay offtake agreements, or if government incentives are unclear. The consequences are significant: delayed projects reduce near-term SAF supply, potentially jeopardising Europe’s ReFuelEU 2030 targets, and signal to investors that high-capital projects require stronger policy backing.

The Shell example reinforces the need for predictable, long-term frameworks, coordinated action, and financial mechanisms like Contracts for Difference. Without these, the SAF transition risks slowing just when demand is set to increase sharply.

Policy tools to bridge the cost gap

To reach ReFuelEU’s 2030 targets, producers must begin building large-scale plants now. Yet financing remains difficult without predictable regulation or price support. Policy shifts or delayed mandates could trigger shortages just as demand accelerates.

“Contracts for Difference are one of the most effective tools available,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “They give producers confidence to build multi-billion-dollar plants today by bridging the gap between the high cost of production and what airlines are willing to pay in the future.”

Government-backed instruments like Contracts for Difference and carbon price guarantees can de-risk investment by ensuring stable revenues. Without such mechanisms, projects will struggle to reach final investment decisions — putting 2030 supply goals at risk.

Maintaining credibility and momentum

As the SAF sector scales, maintaining market integrity is essential. Rigorous certification and transparent auditing must underpin every link in the value chain to prevent reputational damage and ensure real emission reductions.

“Credibility is everything,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of weak certification or greenwashing, the entire market loses trust.”

Looking ahead: building an energy transition in motion

Pilot programmes are already demonstrating SAF’s technical viability, while rapid innovation in hydrogen-based and synthetic fuels is expanding future feedstock options. The transition must now move from pilot to scale.

Over the next decade, SAF will be central to global flight decarbonisation. The challenge — and opportunity — is ensuring policy, finance, and technology progress in lockstep.

CFP Energy and industry partners are calling for:

Consistent, long-term regulation that gives investors and airlines confidence.

Clear certification standards to protect market credibility.

Sustained investment incentives to bridge the cost gap.

“We need to treat this as an energy transition in motion, not one waiting to happen,” concludes Axel Vanmeulder.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced the introduction of a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy for all departing passengers, as well as outbound cargo shipments and general and business aviation flights.

The levy is due to come into effect on flights departing Singapore from 1 October 2026 and will be payable on all air tickets or other aviation services sold from 1 April 2026.

In doing so, Singapore will become the first country worldwide to introduce this type of surcharge in the name of sustainability.

The origins of the new SAF levy

In 2024, CAAS launched the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, which set out Singapore’s approach to the long-term, sustainable growth of Singapore’s aviation sector.

Under the Blueprint, CAAS said it intended to work with aviation stakeholders to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

In February 2024, as part of that strategy, the CAAS unveiled its plan to introduce a new levy aimed at decarbonising airline operations. Specifically, the levy is being introduced to support the country’s goal of having 1% of all jet fuel used at the city-state’s Changi and Seletar Airports come from SAF by 2026.

This figure is planned to increase further to 3-5% by 2030, depending on “global developments and the wider availability and adoption” of SAF.

How is the levy to be calculated?

The quantum of the SAF levy is set based on the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1% SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery.

As longer passenger flights consume more fuel, the SAF levy varies based on the distance travelled. For simplicity and ease of administration, all destinations from Singapore are grouped into four geographical bands.

For flights with multiple stops, the SAF levy applicable is based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore. The bands include the following county groups –

Band 1 – Southeast Asia

Band 2 – Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea

Band 3 – Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands, New Zealand

Band 4 – Americas

The SAF Levy for passengers will be set on a per-passenger basis and varies based on the distance travelled (as classified by the four geographical bands). It will also be set according to cabin of travel, with economy and premium economy class as one group (“Economy”), while business and first class travel are also clubbed together (“Premium”).

According to CAAS, the SAF levy for the Premium cabins will be four times that for the Economy cabins or the same geographical band, for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabins of travel.

For example, the levy on a flight to a Southeast Asian destination will be S$1 in the Economy category, versus S$4 for a Premium ticket on the same route. On the longest Band 4 flight, a passenger will pay a levy amount of S$10.40 against the $41.60 paid by a Premium passenger.

Airlines have been instructed by CAAS to collect the SAF levy themselves at the point of ticket sale and must also display the SAF levy as a distinct line item on the passenger’s ticket price summary.

The CAAS notes that the SAF levy will only apply to passengers who are travelling on origin-to-destination flights and not those simply transiting through Singapore.

CAAS had previously estimated the SAF levy to be around S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for a passenger in economy class travelling direct to Bangkok, Tokyo, and London, respectively.

The actual SAF levy amounts for Economy tickets to these same destinations are now to be charged at S$1.00, S$2.80, and S$6.40, respectively. The lower SAF Levy amounts reflect the lower prevailing cost of SAF compared to when the initial estimates were made, said the CAAS.

SAF levy for cargo shipments

It is not just passenger flights that will be affected by the new levy. Origin-destination cargo shipments are also set to be affected, with the levy being charged on a per-kilogram basis and varying based on the distance travelled, again using the four geographical bands set out above.

The aircraft operator will collect the SAF levy from the customer and must display the SAF Levy as a distinct line item on the air cargo contract. Sample rates show that the charges to be imposed vary from S$0.01 per kilogram on a Band 1 flight, through to S$0.15 per kilogram for a Band 4 flight.

Business and general aviation flights are also affected

The SAF levy for general and business aviation flights is charged on a per-aircraft basis and varies based on the distance travelled, categorised by the four geographical bands.

The amount is also calculated as a function of an aircraft’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) official codes (A-F) for aircraft wingspan, which serve as a proxy for aircraft size.

The levies to be charged will vary from S$40 for a six-seat Cessna C404 Titan flying to a Band 1 destination to S$1,950 for a Gulfstream 6000 travelling between Singapore and a Band 4 destination.

However, the CAAS advises that certain flights, such as training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, will not be subject to the SAF levy.

How the SAF levy will be collected

All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS. In turn, the fund will subsequently be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes, said CAAS, and would and to cover the associated administrative costs.

“The Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) will manage the procurement, allocation, and administration of SAF and EAs, to get the best value for money and ensure transparency and accountability in the use of the fund,” said a CAAS statement.

“CAAS will continue to engage airlines, aircraft operators, and other industry stakeholders in the coming weeks and work with them on implementation,” the statement added.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, said, “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub.”

“It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost that is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses, and the public time to adjust.”

Passengers may not pay the whole levy

However, operating airlines may likely swallow some of the impact of the new levy being charged, to ensure that their flights from Singapore remain competitive.

Thus, although the levy may be S$10.40 on an economy flight to the US, the passenger is unlikely to bear this whole charge on their ticket price.

Instead, airlines may well adjust their base fares to keep the overall cost of tickets competitive, thereby absorbing some, if not all, of the levy. It is also worth noting that in the case of frequent flyer award tickets and other complimentary ticket types, the SAF levy will still apply and is likely to be picked up in full by the passenger, as with any other tax or surcharge.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_1504285675_Editorial_Use_Only-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 12:56:16.102513

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander told the Airlines 2025 conference in London on Monday that “the goal of SAF is to get more people in the skies, not price them out” by making air travel more sustainable.
“We simply cannot raise living standards, remove barriers to opportunity and deliver net zero without a thriving and sustainable aviation sector.” Alexander argued: “The demand for flight is only going in one direction.

Transport secretary Heidi Alexander told the Airlines 2025 conference in London on Monday that “the goal of SAF is to get more people in the skies, not price them out” by making air travel more sustainable.

She said the government’s Revenue Certainty Mechanism for SAF producers would “ensure more UK SAF projects get off the ground” but insisted: “It includes safeguards so that airlines pay a fair market price for fuel and passengers see little to no change in the price of a ticket.”

The government launched a consultation on proposals for the mechanism last month. However, that made clear the costs would be passed “through the supply chain and on to consumers”.

Alexander listed a series of government promises to the industry, recalling that when she addressed the Airlines UK annual dinner in February, she “made clear the government’s ironclad commitment to aviation” and said: “Judge us on what we do.”

She noted the government had given the go ahead to “airport projects from London to Yorkshire” and claimed: “A new runway at Heathrow [is] closer than ever before.”

The transport secretary suggested: “In this government you finally have a partner you can trust.”

She insisted: “I’ve not got my fingers in my ears when CEOs talk to me about the UK’s competitiveness, reducing your cost burden or smoothing the transition to greener flight.

“We’re single-minded in our desire to remove those barriers holding you back.

“We simply cannot raise living standards, remove barriers to opportunity and deliver net zero without a thriving and sustainable aviation sector.”

Alexander argued: “The demand for flight is only going in one direction. If the UK is to seize its share of a growing global aviation market, then my job is to create the conditions for you to compete, to grow and to secure a more sustainable future.”

She said: “It beggars belief that for years the issue of capacity in London and the Southeast was kicked into the long grass.

“This government could have sat on its hands while claiming this was too difficult or too politically contentious. But we weren’t prepared to let that happen.

“It’s why I gave the green light to Luton’s expansion in April, followed by Gatwick’s north runway in September, sending a clear signal this government is taking the brakes off growth. Just a few weeks ago, I announced an update on Heathrow’s expansion.”

She promised “a decision on a third runway within this parliament”, saying the government’s ambition is for “flights taking off on a new runway by 2035” and insisted: “We’ll waste no more time getting major infrastructure projects off the ground.”

Alexander noted she is currently considering two schemes for expanding Heathrow and said: “I’ll decide on a single scheme review very soon.”

She also pledged to move as fast as possible on UK airspace modernisation, insisting: “I will ensure the UK Airspace Design Service is set up before the end of the year.

When Alfanar evaluated its Lighthouse Green Fuels project it discovered the former INEOS Nitriles site in Seal Sands offered everything the initial plot lacked. The new location is only five hundred metres away but brings deeper quays, rail sidings and ample space. From feedstock pre-treatment to final fuel storage every stage will now sit within one integrated boundary. That design choice minimises truck movements and accelerates construction schedules.

Production Highlights

Phase one will process one point five million tonnes of forestry, sawmill and agricultural residues every year. The result will be more than one hundred eighty million litres of certified second generation Sustainable Aviation Fuel. When blended into airline tanks the supply offsets the carbon footprint of about four thousand five hundred transatlantic trips between London and New York. Because the plant sits close to a developing carbon capture pipeline, operators expect a two hundred percent lifecycle emissions reduction compared with conventional kerosene once sequestration begins.

Non-Obvious Insight

Locating the pretreatment units alongside the reactor provides a useful thermal advantage. Waste heat from the gasification stage can dry incoming biomass, lowering total energy demand and shielding the business model from volatile gas prices. This simple piece of engineering integration often hides in technical drawings yet delivers meaningful cost savings over decades.

Community Impact

Local leaders forecast thousands of high quality jobs in construction, operations and maintenance. Crucially, the initiative will anchor a new regional supply chain for biomass logistics, equipment fabrication and carbon management, further diversifying the Tees Valley economy.

Conclusion

By combining abundant feedstock, excellent logistics and smart process integration, Lighthouse Green Fuels is setting a new global benchmark for Sustainable Aviation Fuel deployment.

Palm Oil’s Sustainability Advantage Palm oil’s efficiency makes it difficult to overlook.","Step into the future of energy and you may find an unlikely player at the heart of it: palm oil. Once viewed largely as an agricultural commodity, palm oil is now a cornerstone of renewable energy and industrial innovation. At the center of this transformation stands Indonesia, the world’s largest palm oil producer, whose unmatched capacity is powering clean energy programs and industrial growth across Asia.

Powering the Energy Transition

Palm oil is at the center of Indonesia’s biofuel revolution. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) noted that the country produced 18.5 billion liters of biodiesel in 2023 under its B35 program, which requires a 35 percent palm component in diesel. Expansion to B40 is already in preparation, ensuring stronger integration of biofuels into the national energy mix.

The global impact is evident. S&P Global Commodity Insights projects biodiesel mandates to increase palm oil demand by nearly 10 percent in 2025. For countries like Pakistan, which spends billions annually on petroleum imports, Indonesian biodiesel represents a credible alternative to strengthen energy security and reduce dependence on volatile fuel markets.

Beyond biodiesel, palm oil is being explored as a base for advanced biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With global airlines under pressure to cut carbon emissions, palm oil’s role in powering aviation could emerge as a critical frontier for renewable energy innovation.

Expanding Industrial Frontiers

Palm oil’s industrial applications extend well beyond fuels. Bioplastics derived from palm oil are gaining traction as countries restrict single-use plastics. Palm-based polymers are being developed into packaging, automotive parts, and medical devices, offering biodegradable alternatives to petrochemicals.

The oleochemical industry, which uses palm oil to manufacture surfactants, detergents, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, is expected to grow at 7 percent annually until 2030, as per Grand View Research. Oleochemicals derived from palm oil are now a key raw material for renewable chemicals, enabling industries to decarbonize supply chains.

Lubricants represent another growth frontier. Research published on ResearchGate shows palm oil’s superior viscosity and biodegradability compared to mineral oils, making it a sustainable substitute for industries reliant on machinery and transport. In economies where agriculture and manufacturing dominate, palm oil–based lubricants not only lower dependence on petroleum imports but also contribute to emissions reduction targets.

Emerging applications include palm-based resins for construction, adhesives for packaging, and feedstock for hydrogenated biofuels, further proving palm oil’s versatility across industrial sectors.

Palm Oil’s Sustainability Advantage

Palm oil’s efficiency makes it difficult to overlook. Yale University’s Environmental Leadership & Training Initiative highlights that producing a tonne of palm oil requires four to ten times less land than soybean, sunflower, or rapeseed. This efficiency translates into lower resource pressure, strengthening palm oil’s positioning as a sustainable industrial input.

Indonesia has also invested heavily in climate-resilient production and replanting programs, making sustainability a competitive differentiator in global markets where buyers increasingly seek responsibly sourced materials.

Indonesia’s Volume Advantage

Indonesia dominates global supply. USDA data shows the country produced 46 million metric tonnes of crude palm oil in 2024, over 58 percent of the world’s total. This surplus enables Indonesia to meet domestic biodiesel goals while continuing to supply international markets, a flexibility its regional peers lack.

Bioenergy Times reported that Indonesia’s expanding biodiesel programs could absorb up to 12 million kiloliters of palm oil in 2025, nearly one-third of its biodiesel feedstock output. Despite rising domestic demand, Indonesia’s production scale ensures continued export availability. For major importers like Pakistan and India, this ability to balance internal demand with external commitments provides critical supply security.

Building Strategic Partnerships

Trade relationships between Indonesia and its import partners already yield significant benefits. But the real opportunity lies in extending these partnerships beyond traditional commodity trade.

South Asia’s energy resilience and industrial growth are increasingly tied to Indonesian palm oil. Future growth areas include investment in biodiesel blending facilities, the development of palm oil refinery infrastructure, and joint ventures in oleochemical and bioplastic manufacturing. Each of these sectors contributes directly to industrial modernization, green technology adoption, and employment creation, while reducing dependence on petroleum-based imports.

For Pakistan, deeper collaboration could mean moving from being solely an importer of crude palm oil to a co-investor in refining, advanced biofuel facilities, and downstream industries. Access to Indonesian expertise in processing and biodiesel technology would strengthen local capacity, while Indonesia benefits from reliable long-term demand and regional strategic alignment.

Entering Palm Oil’s Next Chapter

Palm oil is entering a new era, one where it is as central to energy and industry as it once was to agriculture. Indonesia, with unmatched scale and proactive policies, is leading this transition.

Engagement with Indonesian palm oil is about securing renewable energy options, building industrial supply chains, and fostering sustainable economic growth. As global biodiesel demand accelerates and industrial applications expand, from biofuels to bioplastics, Indonesia stands ready to provide both the volume and the reliability that partners require.

Palm oil has moved beyond raw commodity status to become tomorrow’s industrial foundation, with Indonesia at the forefront of this transformation.",https://gapki.id/en/dir-site/uploads/2025/11/palmoil_industry_sun_jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 08:56:56.729539

The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation’s 2025 Sustainability Acceleration Challenge reveals that while more organizations are tracking and managing travel emissions, adoption of low-carbon solutions continues to lag.

The annual benchmark, developed with Accenture, gathered input from 285 corporations representing a combined business travel spend of $22 billion. The results, released during the GBTA + VDR Europe Conference in Hamburg, show a 20% increase in participation compared with 2024, signaling rising engagement. Yet the overall maturity score across companies improved only marginally—from 1.3 to 1.4 on a five-point scale—indicating slow progress in embedding sustainability within global travel programs.

Modest gains amid rising participation

The GBTA Foundation reported that smaller companies with travel budgets under $5 million have made notable strides in advancing sustainability initiatives, while larger programs exceeding $500 million in annual spend have regressed. The Financial, Banking and Insurance sector leads with a maturity score of 1.9, followed by Professional Services and Consulting at 1.7. These industries account for a significant portion of emissions tied to business travel.

Areas showing the most improvement include Sustainable Travel Policies, which rose from a 1.8 to 2.2 score, and Carbon Budgets, up from 0.5 to 0.7. Reporting and target-setting have also become more standard practice, with more firms integrating these mechanisms into their travel programs. However, tools that directly shape travel decisions—such as carbon fees or online booking tool (OBT) features designed to encourage greener choices—have shown little to no progress.

“Year two of our benchmark shows real engagement and growing commitment. But despite progress, greater urgency is needed,” said Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director, GBTA Foundation. “To future-proof business travel, companies must accelerate adoption of sustainable procurement practices and carbon management strategies to send a real signal to the market.”

Where companies are falling short

Despite growing awareness, the benchmark highlights three critical areas that require acceleration: influencing travel behavior, unifying demand for sustainable suppliers, and investing in emissions abatement technologies. Supplier sustainability assessments have increased, but more advanced measures—such as adopting GBTA Sustainable Procurement Standards or embedding sustainability clauses in contracts—remain static at a score of 1.2. Limited guidance and technology gaps continue to slow progress.

Investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) has grown modestly, with 15% of corporations purchasing SAF certificates in 2025, up from 12% last year. While this trend points to increased interest, adoption remains far from mainstream. GBTA encourages firms to use its SAF Corporate Connect program to support implementation and share best practices across the sector.

“The GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge provides a roadmap for the future,” said Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel & Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture. “With more companies participating, we’re seeing where the industry is moving forward, and where further collaboration can close the gap between ambition and action.”

According to GBTA, regional performance varied. Global and Asia-Pacific travel programs recorded slight improvements, while European and North American firms saw marginal declines, reflecting the influence of regulatory and economic uncertainty on travel policy advancement.

Recognizing leaders and innovators

To highlight progress, GBTA introduced the inaugural Acceleration Awards and Leaderboards recognizing companies that demonstrate leadership and measurable improvement in travel decarbonization. Winners include Kearney, BDO LLP, Parexel, University of California, IKEA, and Nokia across various global, regional, and industry categories. BDO LLP was named Europe’s Regional Leader for its sustainability-driven travel initiatives.

“BDO LLP are participating in the Acceleration Challenge to showcase our leadership in sustainable travel,” said Verity Phillips-Davies, Travel Manager at BDO LLP. “By innovating and advocating for impactful solutions, we aim to inspire industry-wide change and demonstrate how strategic engagement can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of business travel.”

Millot added: “These companies exemplify the leadership, innovation, and collaboration needed to transform business travel for a net-zero future. Their commitment to measurable progress shows what’s possible when sustainability becomes an integral part of corporate travel strategy.”

The GBTA Foundation continues to expand resources to help organizations transition from awareness to implementation through its Sustainable Business Travel Transition Pathway and new training on Sustainable Procurement Standards.

(NASDAQ: GEVO), a pioneer in bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is positioning itself at the forefront of this transition with its ATJ-30 jet fuel project. The company's third-quarter 2025 financial results and strategic roadmap suggest a clear-eyed focus on leveraging its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology to capture a significant share of the rapidly expanding SAF market. With a projected $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA once operational, the ATJ-30 project represents both a financial milestone and a strategic bet on the future of low-carbon aviation.

Strategic Momentum in Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Gevo's ATJ-30 project is a cornerstone of its long-term strategy to capitalize on the surging demand for SAF. The U.S. bio-based SAF market is projected to grow from $420.04 million in 2024 to $4.77 billion by 2032, driven by airline commitments to carbon neutrality and regulatory tailwinds, according to a

. Over 90% of airlines now aim for at least 2% SAF use by 2025, creating a structural tailwind for producers like Gevo, according to the same OpenPR report.

The company's ATJ technology, which converts ethanol into renewable jet fuel, is uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend. By leveraging its existing ethanol production infrastructure and corn supply chains, Gevo aims to achieve cost advantages over competitors. CEO Dr. Patrick Gruber emphasized that the ATJ-30 project, pending a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026, could add $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA once operational, as reported by

. This figure assumes robust demand from airlines and governments seeking to meet decarbonization targets, as well as successful integration of Gevo's production network, as noted in the same StockTitan report.

Carbon Credit Monetization: A Dual Revenue Stream

Gevo's financial flexibility is further bolstered by its aggressive monetization of carbon credits. In Q3 2025, the company generated $52 million from Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs) under the 45Z tax credit program, as reported by

. Additionally, a multi-year Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) offtake agreement is expected to yield $26 million over five years, according to the same Finimize report. These non-operational revenue streams are critical for funding capital expenditures and reducing reliance on volatile commodity markets.

The strategic value of carbon credits extends beyond immediate cash flow. By converting emissions reductions into tradable assets, Gevo aligns its business model with global sustainability frameworks. This approach not only enhances profitability but also strengthens its appeal to institutional investors prioritizing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria. As the U.S. government introduces new incentives for bio-based SAF adoption, Gevo's ability to scale carbon credit monetization could become a key differentiator in a competitive market, according to the OpenPR report.

Path to $150M Adjusted EBITDA: Risks and Realities

While the $150 million EBITDA target is ambitious, several factors could accelerate or hinder its realization. On the positive side, Gevo's Q3 2025 results demonstrated operational resilience, with $6.7 million in Adjusted EBITDA and $108.4 million in cash reserves, as reported by StockTitan. The company's focus on cost reduction and carbon co-products is also improving its balance sheet, according to Finimize. However, challenges remain.

First, the ATJ-30 project's success hinges on securing the FID by mid-2026 and obtaining a DOE loan guarantee extension, as Finimize noted. Delays in regulatory approvals or capital constraints could derail timelines. Second, the SAF market, while growing, is still nascent. Gevo must navigate pricing pressures and competition from emerging players like LanzaJet and SkyNRG, as reported in the OpenPR report. Finally, the conversion of carbon credits into cash depends on stable policy environments and market demand for carbon offsets-a variable that could shift with political cycles.

Conclusion: A High-Stakes Bet on the Future of Aviation

Gevo's ATJ-30 project encapsulates the dual forces of innovation and risk in the renewable energy sector. By targeting $150 million in Adjusted EBITDA, the company is betting on its ability to scale production, secure strategic partnerships, and monetize carbon assets in a market poised for explosive growth. While execution risks are significant, the alignment of industry trends, regulatory support, and Gevo's technological expertise suggests that this target is not merely aspirational-it is a calculated gamble on the future of sustainable aviation.

For investors, the key question is whether Gevo can maintain its strategic momentum while navigating the complexities of capital-intensive expansion. If the company succeeds, the rewards could be transformative-not just for its bottom line, but for the broader transition to a low-carbon economy.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1762829608080.jpg.png,N,,2025-11-11 08:57:11.945854

Construction of the plant, dubbed “Project Beacon”, will commence in 2026. It will begin commercial operations in 2028. The plant will be located at Aster’s refining hub on Pulau Bukom, which it took over from Shell in April.

The move comes amid a deal spree by Aster – a joint venture between Indonesia’s Chandra Asri and commodities trader Glencore.

Besides the Bukom refinery, the company also recently purchased Singapore’s Esso petrol stations and the Jurong Island assets of Shell and Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals.

Aster chief financial officer Andre Khor said that the sustainable aviation fuel plant is aligned with the deep-tech focus of its unit, Aster Ventures.

“The thesis driving up the investment is that… we are looking at deep tech to help address core industrial (needs), as well as next-generation energy solutions that are adjacent and synergistic with our energy, chemicals and infrastructure assets on the ground,” he said.

Khor was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the deal signing, held at Temasek Shophouse on Tuesday (Nov 11).

Project Beacon will use Aether’s proprietary technology to convert industrial waste gas, as well as biomethane, into sustainable aviation fuel.

This is a first for the region. Incumbent producers of this fuel, such as Neste, typically tap used cooking oil to produce it.

Aster will provide Aether with the waste carbon feedstock for fuel production, as well as renewable power, utilities and site support.

The output will be certified by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, a global initiative to decarbonise the aviation sector.

“Tonnes of interest”

Project Beacon will produce up to 50 barrels of fuel a day, or 2,000 tonnes a year. This comprises 1,600 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel and 400 tonnes of sustainable naphtha.

There will also be 24 full-time jobs created for the operation of the plant, said Aether’s founder and chief executive Conor Madigan. The startup separately plans to grow its Singapore headcount to 30, from two at present.

Based in Singapore and Chicago, Aether was incubated and funded in 2022 by Xora, a deep-tech venture firm backed by Temasek.

Speaking to The Business Times at Tuesday’s event, Madigan noted that there is a shortage of used cooking oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Aether aims to overcome this problem through its technology, which allows the fuel to be made from waste gases and other forms of waste carbon. With Project Beacon, the input will be gases from Aster’s refining processes.

“(That) allows us to get the feedstock we need in a super-steady stream and consistent flow… And so it really makes this project super simple. We have a rock solid feedstock supply, and it allows us to demonstrate a route to making fuels that we think is quite scalable,” he said.

In February, Singapore Airlines signed an agreement with Aether to potentially source sustainable aviation fuel from the startup.

Asked if the carrier will purchase the fuel from Project Beacon, Madigan would only say: “It is our intention that the offtake for this plant will be to a major airline. We hope to provide updates on that down the line.”

He also noted that there is “tonnes of interest throughout Asia” for offtake, especially as more governments mandate the use of the fuel.

Singapore, for instance, aims for sustainable aviation fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

The Republic has set up a central buyer for sustainable aviation fuel, while also introducing a levy for the fuel ranging from S$1 to S$41.60 per airline ticket.

Aether was “really impressed here in Singapore by the policy support for sustainability and the sort of steadiness of the government’s approach, which is a contrast right now (to the) world in general”, said Madigan.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ce55d785b9b48e50ae56872316ee7ae99a6f36d791bc126e4690fea214c4fd9f?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-11-11 05:56:29.151981

Gevo topped revenue forecasts with $42.71 million in the third quarter of 2025, notching its second straight period of positive adjusted EBITDA and ramping up future plans through a fresh carbon credit agreement and expansion into green jet fuel.

What does this mean?

Gevo, the biofuels firm, logged sales that beat analyst expectations by over $3 million, with steady operations at its North Dakota and renewable natural gas facilities helping deliver another positive adjusted EBITDA. The company’s recent multi-year carbon credit deal will add $26 million over five years, boosting its efforts to diversify income and reinforce balance sheet strength. Selling its Agri-Energy subsidiary trimmed annual costs by $3 million, keeping things leaner. While Gevo still reported a net loss of $7.58 million and operating costs at $46.4 million, its roadmap to profitability looks clearer as it eyes a mid-2026 decision on a new alcohol-to-jet fuel plant and aims to hit $100 million in adjusted EBITDA by scaling up carbon co-products and trimming expenses.

Why should I care?

For markets: Positive signals fuel sector momentum.

Gevo’s stronger-than-expected numbers and upbeat analyst sentiment set it apart from much of the renewable fuels sector, where many companies are still rated 'hold.' The stock’s median 12-month price target sits at $2.63—a solid premium to recent trading levels—reflecting faith in Gevo’s diversification, tight cost controls, and push into sustainable aviation fuels as airlines step up their climate goals.

Taking science-based action both reduces emissions and manages transition risks, maintaining competitiveness and offering growth opportunities in a carbon-constrained world.”","The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) announced the release of its updated draft Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2, its planned update to its key standard to assess, certify and track companies’ decarbonization commitments to achieve net zero emissions and to support science-based climate target setting.

According to the SBTi, the new draft aims to enable more companies to set net zero goals by “making science-based climate action more accessible and actionable,” while simultaneously balancing the need to maintain alignment with global climate goals. Among the key changes introduced in the new draft is “a menu of options for companies to drive down their carbon footprint,” according to SBTi CEO David Kennedy, including multiple pathways allowed for target setting for direct emissions reductions, and clearer rules for the use of instruments such as carbon credits to reach decarbonization goals.

The SBTi was founded in 2015 with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. The organizations’ key functions include defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science, providing technical assistance to companies who set science-based targets, and providing companies with independent assessment and validation of their emissions reduction targets. To date, nearly 12,000 companies have set science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, or made commitments to do so.

The organization’s flagship first Corporate Net-Zero Standard was published in 2021, and the SBTi announced plans early last year to update the standard.

In March 2025, the SBTi released its initial draft of the new V2 standard, and launched a consultation into a series of the changes introduced, including proposals to add allow multiple methods for reaching emissions targets, require explicit Scope 2 (purchased energy) emissions targets, require large companies to set Scope 3 value chain emissions goals. The initial draft also included a consultation on options to address residual emissions on the pathway to net zero, including the introduction of interim carbon removal targets, as well as formally recognizing companies which are investing in Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM).

Following feedback from the first draft’s public consultation and expert working groups, the SBTi’s new draft further develops and refines the proposals, including an update to the key ambition for companies, changing from “Companies shall publicly commit to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050,” to “Companies shall set an ambition to transition their operations and value chains to align with the goal to be net-zero by no later than 2050,” with the SBTi noting that the new language avoids confusion from the word “commitment,” focusing instead on “the company’s overarching intention to reach net-zero by 2050.”

For direct operations Scope 1 emissions, the new draft introduces 3 approaches for target setting – including reducing emissions on a linear pathway to net-zero, increasing the share of low-carbon activities over time, and implementing Asset Decarbonization Plans to decarbonize assets based on technological readiness. The draft also adds some flexibility and clarity to Scope 2 target setting requirements, including maintaining requirements for all companies to set near-term targets, but making long-term targets optional for smaller companies, specifying criteria for near-term targets, adding mechanisms for limited amounts of electricity, heat, steam and cooling to be excluded from the near-term targets, and improved criteria for purchasing low carbon electricity.

The proposed updated standard’s Scope 3 approach focuses on addressing priority emissions sources that can have the greatest impact, while allowing flexibility, with the SBTi noting that value chain emissions have formed one of the most significant barriers to companies’ setting of science-based targets. The new draft increases focus from the initial draft on targeting the highest-priority emissions in the near-term while exclusions for lower-impact activities and areas where influence is limited, while also introducing three options for Scope 3 target setting – including “emissions intensity,” “activity alignment,” and “counterparty alignment” – noting that the options “reflect the diversity of value chain emissions and the different mitigation strategies companies use across their value chains.”

One of the key changes in the new draft is the formalization of the integration of the use of environmental attribute certificates (EACs), such as carbon credits or energy and commodity certificates, while including strict conditions. For example, Scope 2 targets can include matching using low-carbon electricity EACs that are purchased in the same region as the company’s electricity consumption, while Scope 3 targets may use EACs on a limited basis where direct supplier engagement or physical traceability is not feasible.

The SBTi’s new draft standard also adds a new recognition mechanism aimed at incentivizing companies by highlighting early, voluntary action to address ongoing emissions, introducing a “leadership” category, which includes large companies addressing 100% of their ongoing scope 1-3 emissions, or smaller companies addressing 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Additionally, the new draft also includes new requirements for large companies (or Category A companies, which include large companies in all countries and medium-sized companies in high-income countries), including a requirement for the publication of credible transition plans within 12 months of target validation, as well as to address an increasing portion of ongoing emissions, or those not yet reduced on the pathway towards net zero by 2050, from 2035 through a portfolio of carbon removals.

In the UK, the RAF is deploying renewable HVO fuel across its operations4 — proof that sustainable fuels can deliver both performance and carbon reductions.
Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.","Europe faces a critical decade for aviation decarbonisation. Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise; unlike road transport, aircraft cannot realistically switch to electric or hydrogen propulsion at scale in the near term. That makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) — and the next generation of synthetic SAFs (eSAF) — the most viable path for deep emissions cuts this decade.

SAFs can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% while working seamlessly with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. Yet despite this potential, SAFs today represent only around 2% of European jet fuel use. While the current supply is sufficient to meet demand, high production costs remain a significant barrier.

Conventional jet fuel trades currently at roughly US$600/t, compared with around US$2000 for SAF and US$7500 for eSAF. Producers need firm investment decisions now to expand capacity by 2030, but airlines remain cautious about long-term offtake agreements at these prices.

“No single fuel will dominate aviation in the decades ahead,” says Axel Vanmeulder, Renewable Fuels Expert. “Even in the most optimistic scenarios, fossil fuels remain part of the mix. But sustainable aviation fuel is by far the most viable option for the sector in the next twenty years.”

Overcoming the barriers to SAF adoption

The bottlenecks are clear and interconnected:

Feedstock limits: bio-based SAFs derived from used cooking oils, food waste, and other residues will reach their practical limits between 2030 and 2040. Beyond that, scaling eSAF production using renewable hydrogen and captured carbon will be vital. This makes early planning for synthetic fuels essential to avoid future shortages.

Price gap: SAF today costs roughly three times more than fossil jet fuel, and eSAF is currently more than 10 times as expensive, making long-term offtake agreements difficult to secure.

Investment risk: producers face multi-billion-dollar capital commitments years before revenues flow. Without credible offtake deals or policy certainty, projects remain financially unviable.

Policy instability: airlines and producers need predictable, long-term frameworks. Sudden changes in mandates or incentives can delay projects and reduce investor confidence.

Credibility: “Supply chains need watertight certification and audits,” notes Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of greenwashing — like palm oil being passed off as waste oil — the entire market risks losing trust.

“The cost gap is the biggest barrier. Jet fuel today trades around US$600/t, SAF is about US$2000, and synthetic SAF is closer to US$7500. Airlines are hesitant to sign long-term offtake agreements at those levels and with these price gaps, yet without them producers can’t move forward with investment decisions.

“Feedstocks like used cooking oil and food waste can only take us so far — they’ll reach their limits by 2030 – 2040. That’s why synthetic fuels, made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon, are already being written into future mandates.”

Regulation: driving change and creating demand

Regulation is now the sharpest lever for transformation. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending, rising from 2% in 2025 to 6% by 2030¹, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050¹. Within this framework, a sub-mandate requires eSAF to reach 1.2% of total supply by 2030 — a critical measure for synthetic fuel growth. This sharp increase could flip today’s surplus into a shortage unless projects are financed and built in advance.

“The step-up in 2030 is significant,” Axel Vanmeulder explains. “In Europe, the SAF mandate jumps from 2% to 6% overnight. That could turn today’s oversupply into a shortage if projects aren’t built now.”

In the UK, the forthcoming SAF Mandate follows a similar trajectory, beginning at 2% in 2025 and climbing to 10% by 2030², with future rises to 22% by 2040². The UK’s alignment with Europe ensures a consistent market signal across two major aviation regions.

Globally, the CORSIA scheme (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) developed by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), requires airlines to offset emissions above 2019 levels³ on international flights. Though less demanding than EU rules, CORSIA establishes a global baseline, ensuring that airlines cannot ignore their emissions.

“CORSIA is a global floor — it ensures airlines can’t ignore their emissions on international flights. European mandates go further, but CORSIA makes carbon pricing and fuel transition unavoidable for every carrier worldwide.”

Beyond Europe, countries including China, Singapore, and India are developing their own SAF mandates — signalling that the transition is global and irreversible. Harmonised standards will be critical to reduce complexity and costs for airlines operating internationally.

Corporate momentum: industry taking flight

Major airlines and energy producers are already demonstrating that SAF is viable today:

Lufthansa Group is using SAF derived from used cooking oils and waste residues, achieving lifecycle emission cuts of around 80%.

JetBlue Airways has secured regular SAF supplies at key US airports, supported by corporate partners sharing the cost premium.

United Airlines has launched a dedicated investment fund to scale future SAF production.

In the UK, the RAF is deploying renewable HVO fuel across its operations4 — proof that sustainable fuels can deliver both performance and carbon reductions.

These examples show that with policy clarity, investment, and collaboration, SAF adoption is already creating tangible operational and environmental benefits.

Government and industry collaboration: lessons from fusion

Large-scale coordination between governments and industry can accelerate the deployment of breakthrough energy technologies. A prominent example outside aviation is the international nuclear fusion project, where over 20 countries are collaborating in a multi-billion-dollar experiment5 to demonstrate a proof of concept.

This demonstrates the potential for global cooperation to overcome technical and financial barriers, a model that could be applied to scaling SAF. Coordinated action, combined with policy certainty and investment support, is key to the success of high-cost, high-impact projects in aviation.

Challenges and market realities: learning from setbacks

While SAF adoption is critical, the sector faces economic and operational hurdles. Shell’s decision to cancel its Rotterdam biofuels plant provides a stark example. The facility was planned to produce up to 820 000 t of biofuels, half intended for SAF from waste cooking oils and animal fat, but after technical delays5 and market reassessments, the project was deemed “insufficiently competitive” and scrapped.

This highlights the complex interplay of cost, investment risk, and policy stability. Even technically viable projects can fail if SAF prices are too high, if airlines delay offtake agreements, or if government incentives are unclear. The consequences are significant: delayed projects reduce near-term SAF supply, potentially jeopardising Europe’s ReFuelEU 2030 targets, and signal to investors that high-capital projects require stronger policy backing.

The Shell example reinforces the need for predictable, long-term frameworks, coordinated action, and financial mechanisms like Contracts for Difference. Without these, the SAF transition risks slowing just when demand is set to increase sharply.

Policy tools to bridge the cost gap

To reach ReFuelEU’s 2030 targets, producers must begin building large-scale plants now. Yet financing remains difficult without predictable regulation or price support. Policy shifts or delayed mandates could trigger shortages just as demand accelerates.

“Contracts for Difference are one of the most effective tools available,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “They give producers confidence to build multi-billion-dollar plants today by bridging the gap between the high cost of production and what airlines are willing to pay in the future.”

Government-backed instruments like Contracts for Difference and carbon price guarantees can de-risk investment by ensuring stable revenues. Without such mechanisms, projects will struggle to reach final investment decisions — putting 2030 supply goals at risk.

Maintaining credibility and momentum

As the SAF sector scales, maintaining market integrity is essential. Rigorous certification and transparent auditing must underpin every link in the value chain to prevent reputational damage and ensure real emission reductions.

“Credibility is everything,” says Axel Vanmeulder. “If there’s any suspicion of weak certification or greenwashing, the entire market loses trust.”

Looking ahead: building an energy transition in motion

Pilot programmes are already demonstrating SAF’s technical viability, while rapid innovation in hydrogen-based and synthetic fuels is expanding future feedstock options. The transition must now move from pilot to scale.

Over the next decade, SAF will be central to global flight decarbonisation. The challenge — and opportunity — is ensuring policy, finance, and technology progress in lockstep.

CFP Energy and industry partners are calling for:

Consistent, long-term regulation that gives investors and airlines confidence.

Clear certification standards to protect market credibility.

Sustained investment incentives to bridge the cost gap.

“We need to treat this as an energy transition in motion, not one waiting to happen,” concludes Axel Vanmeulder.

A Gulfstream G650 flying to London, for example, would be charged a levy of S$1,200.
We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”","Singapore’s Ministry of Transport’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAAS) announced that it will be implementing a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy for travelers and cargo on all departing flights, starting in April 2026.

Fees will range from S$1.00 (USD$0.77) for an economy-class passenger on a short-range flight to S$41.60 (USD$31.95) for a business-class passenger on a Americas-bound flight.

The new SAF levy follows the launch by CAAS in February 2024 of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint, outlining a series of key actions aimed at decarbonizing Singapore’s aviation sector with goals to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% by 2030, and to achieve net zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050. The blueprint included a requirement for all departing flights from Singapore to use SAF, beginning at 1% from 2026, and expected to increase in following years.

When it launched the blueprint, CAAS said that use of SAF is anticipated to contribute nearly two thirds of the emissions reductions required for the sector to reach net zero by 2050.

The introduction of the levy forms part of the blueprint’s initiatives aimed at building an SAF ecosystem. The levy is based on the distance travelled by the flight, and the volume of SAF needed to meet the 1% SAF target for 2026 and the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery

While CAAS had originally estimated the levy for economy class passengers to be S$3.00, S$6.00, and S$16.00 for flights to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively, the actual fee to be charged will be substantially lower – at S$1.00, S$2.80, and S$6.40 to each destination, respectively – due to the lower cost of SAF since the estimates were released early last year.

The new system will also introduce levies on cargo on a per-kilogram basis, also based on distance travelled, as well as on business aviation flights on a per aircraft basis, based on aircraft type and distance travelled. A Gulfstream G650 flying to London, for example, would be charged a levy of S$1,200.

According to CAAS, the levies collected will go into a statutory SAF Fund, which will be used solely for the purchase of SAF and SAF environmental attributes, and to cover related administration costs.

CAAS General Director Mr Han Kok Juan said:

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Airport-Singapore2.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 05:56:39.496342

Singapore will soon introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy of up to S$41.60 (around $31.95 or Rs 3,690) per passenger beginning next year, marking a significant step in its efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that the levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing from October 1, 2026. Passengers transiting through Singapore will be exempt from the charge. Under the new system, the amount of levy will vary depending on travel class and route distance. Economy and premium economy travellers will pay S$1 for short-haul trips within Southeast Asia and S$10.40 for flights to the Americas. Business and first-class passengers will be charged four times that amount, reported Bloomberg. Cargo flights will also face a separate fee, calculated by weight. The funds raised through this levy will support the centralised purchase of sustainable aviation fuel — typically produced from waste oils or agricultural feedstock — as part of Singapore’s plan to achieve an SAF adoption rate of 3–5% by 2030. According to CAAS, a drop in SAF costs has allowed the levy to remain lower than earlier projections, which had estimated rates between S$3 and S$16. Singapore becomes the first country in the world to impose a passenger-based green fuel tax — a move especially notable given its position as a major global aviation hub. Changi Airport is on track for a record year, with passenger traffic expected to surpass its pre-pandemic peak of 68.3 million in 2019. Although aviation contributes only around 1.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, as per the European Commission cited by Bloomberg, the industry continues to face significant challenges in cutting emissions due to limited SAF availability and high production costs. The International Air Transport Association noted that while global SAF production doubled last year, it still accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel volumes. Singapore’s announcement coincides with the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, where nearly 200 countries are discussing measures to strengthen global climate action.

The Green Route inaugural flight took place on Thursday, 6th November, at Suvarnabhumi Airport in the presence of key representatives from both the public and private sectors.

Attendees included Vietnamese ambassador to Thailand Pham Viet Hung, Ambassador of Vietnam to Thailand; Panya Chupanit, director-general of the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, Ministry of Transport; and Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand director-general Manat Chavanaprayoon among others.

TAT governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool remarked at the event: “TAT commends VietJet Thailand for its leadership in integrating sustainability into commercial aviation. This milestone demonstrates how the aviation sector can play a pivotal role in promoting responsible travel and supporting Thailand’s national target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. It is a meaningful step towards building a low-carbon society and strengthening Thailand’s position as a regional leader in sustainable tourism.”

This maiden flight makes Vietjet Thailand the country’s first low-cost carrier service on this route powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This initiative also underscores Thailand’s commitment to sustainable tourism and supports the aviation industry’s transition towards cleaner, low-carbon operations across ASEAN.

Putting the sustainable tourism agenda forward

Kiatphaibool added that TAT continues to advance sustainable tourism through initiatives such as the Thailand Tourism Awards, CF-Hotels, Sustainable Tourism Acceleration Rating (STAR), and the Krabi Prototype project.

These programmes guide tourism operators towards greener practices and reinforce TAT’s mission to position Thailand as a trusted, value-driven destination for responsible travellers.

The Green Route collaboration between VietJet, and PTT OR exemplifies how cross-sector partnerships can drive sustainable mobility and enhance Thailand’s reputation as a leader in sustainable travel and low-carbon tourism.

Integrating sustainability into commercial aviation

Under its Fly Green programme which aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, VietJet Thailand became the country’s first low-cost carrier to use SAF on commercial routes.

The Bangkok–Phu Quoc-Bangkok service marks the airline’s second Green Route, following the Bangkok–Da Nang debut in 2024.

Developed in partnership with PTT OR and Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services (BAFS), the initiative reflects VietJet’s long-term strategy to reduce emissions and achieve a five-percent SAF blend across all flights by 2030.

Each SAF-powered flight can cut approximately 250 kilograms of CO₂ and reduce up to 80 percent of total emissions, contributing to the airline’s target of lowering more than 153,000 tonnes of CO₂ within six years.

According to Vietjet Thailand CEO Woranate Laprabang, the airline’s integration of SAF into its regular operations reflects its commitment to balancing business growth with environmental responsibility, while empowering passengers to contribute to reducing carbon emissions through their travel choices.

He added that this collaboration demonstrates how synergy between the aviation and energy sectors can accelerate the transition towards a greener and more sustainable future for the industry.

Produced from renewable and waste-based materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas, SAF meets ASTM D7566 international standards and performs identically to conventional Jet A-1 fuel without compromising safety or efficiency.

Thailand has strong potential for SAF production due to its abundant bio-based resources and growing circular economy infrastructure.

Strengthened public–private collaboration will be crucial to scaling production, improving cost efficiency, and supporting both national and regional carbon-reduction goals.

Vietnam remains one of Thailand’s most important short-haul markets, with over 600,000 Vietnamese visitors expected in 2025. Vietnamese travellers continue to favour Thailand for its leisure, wellness, and cultural offerings while exploring new destinations.

Shaping new agreements and solutions to accelerate ZEV and infrastructure deployment, including 26,000+ heavy, medium and light electric vehicles and approximately 200 MW of renewable energy capacity in India, Mexico, and Brazil;

Driving the business case for electrification use cases and supporting policy and standards integration in Europe;

Co-design future mobility solutions with cities to ensure half of the world population has access to sustainable and people-centered and affordable solutions;

Securing coherent policy frameworks, harmonized standards, and effective market-based mechanisms to accelerate transport decarbonization across modes, including the adoption of alternative fuels required in the maritime and aviation sectors.

Decarbonization is within reach, and businesses are showing the pathway

Transport is responsible for ~ 23 % of global energy‑related CO₂ emissions, making it one of the largest and fastest‑growing drivers of climate change. To align with the Paris Agreement, the sector must cut emissions by approximately 25 % by 2030.

Despite historical increases in global energy transition investments last year, led in great part by transport electrification, BloombergNEF highlights these must accelerate as they currently only represent 37% of what is required to get on track with the Net Zero Scenario.

To make this transition a reality, we need to address several use cases across transport modes and shape solutions that address specific market needs, while ensuring a just transition and protecting natural ecosystems.

This means deploying zero-emission vehicles supported by appropriate charging infrastructure, smart and flexible grids and digitalization to achieve seamless integration and operational efficiencies. Complementing electrification, Alternative Fuels like Hydrogen, Biofuels, and RNG are crucial to fill gaps where electrification falls short and ensure decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and aviation. This multi-use case and multi-technology landscape presents decarbonization challenges such as integration, fragmented planning and uncertain investments.

The good news is that the technologies are available, and businesses have been backing the transition with significant investments, showing that the transition is feasible and full of opportunities.

Clean transport remains one of the fastest growing areas of investment in the energy transition as EV adoption surges, more infrastructure is built, and shipping and aviation activity picks up.

– Colin McKerracher, Head of Clean Transport at BloombergNEF

According to WBCSD’s Business Breakthrough Barometer 2025, 91 % of business leaders say they have maintained or increased investments toward net-zero over the past year. This demonstrates both commitment and confidence in the available decarbonization technologies and digital solutions.

Governments and companies must collaborate across regions to bridge implementation and investment gaps

While global investment in electrified transport reached USD $757.4 billion in 2024 and the driving force behind growth in the global energy transition, investments are still insufficient to meet the scale and pace required for global transport decarbonization. The transport landscape remains fragmented and unpredictable, hampering scaled adoption and threatening global decarbonization goals.

Companies working towards decarbonization often face systemic challenges that slow down their progress. These include unclear transition roadmaps and varying market maturities, supply and demand gaps, diverse transportation and mobility needs, lack of integration in multi-fuel landscapes, and knowledge gaps.

Bridging these gaps requires collective action across the transport and mobility value chains and across regions, including:

Clarifying technology breakthroughs that can rapidly scale and benefit climate, people, and nature, and strengthening the business case for their adoption by unlocking operational efficiencies and addressing risks.

Removing roadblocks and aligning on standards and mechanisms that promote capital flow into clean transport.

Driving regional action to foster ecosystem collaboration and enable tailored solutions design.

The road to sustainable mobility is about building better infrastructure, stronger partnerships, and a shared vision for the future of movement. At Toyota, we believe innovation thrives when businesses, governments, and communities work together to create mobility systems that are inclusive, efficient, and carbon neutral. Our goal is to help every journey contribute to a more sustainable world.

Brazil partnership

As part of the Brazil country partnership, established at COP29, companies seek opportunities to scale investments in transport decarbonization. At COP30, in partnership with CALSTART, Smart Freight Centre, ICCT, WRI Brasil, Scania, Amazon and C40, they are announcing the e-Dutra coalition to transform Brazil’s mobility future.

The initiative has begun deploying electric trucks and chargers along the Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo corridor, with the intention to reach 1,000 trucks operating daily by 2030. By integrating lessons learned about vehicle performance, route optimization, and the practical requirements for large-scale commercial charging networks, e-Dutra is set to accelerate the rollout of reliable, high-capacity charging stations. Additionally, by aggregating large-scale commitments from shippers and logistics providers, the coalition creates a predictable demand signal which de-risks investments in charging infrastructure.

With our Brazilian brand Volkswagen Truck & Bus as a co-leader of the e-Dutra Coalition, TRATON is proud to work alongside our partners to transform Brazil’s road freight into a zero-emission future. By deploying electric trucks and developing the charging infrastructure along the Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo corridor, we are creating a scalable model that will accelerate the adoption of sustainable transport across the country.

– Andreas Follér, Chief Sustainability Officer, TRATON Group

As the battery revolution continues to unfold, electrifying road freight transport is a critical step in the energy transition of supply chains. But it requires collaboration across the entire ecosystem including private companies, regulators, and infrastructure providers. The Laneshift e-Dutra initiative shows how cross-sector cooperation can accelerate this transition and deliver tangible benefits to the communities along Brazil’s most important freight corridor.

– Morten Bo Christiansen, Head of Energy Transition, A.P. Moller – Maersk

The e-Dutra corridor is a landmark for sustainable freight and a powerful example of what collaboration can achieve. Decarbonizing transport is not only essential for the climate – it’s also a major driver of innovation, competitiveness, and growth. This coalition demonstrates how companies, government, and partners can turn ambition into action through investing in zero-emission trucks and charging infrastructure, through which Brazil is setting a new benchmark for climate leadership. WBCSD is looking forward to supporting the initiative and help accelerate the systemic transformation of transportation in Brazil and beyond.

– Diane Holdorf, Executive Vice President, WBCSD

Corporates strengthen efforts to scale ZEV and infrastructure deployment in Europe

At COP30, businesses are joining forces under the new ZEV European Coalition to drive regional dialogues and shape opportunities for scaling implementation and investments in ZEV & charging infrastructure deployment.

The European Commission-led Green Deal, Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) and Clean Transport Corridor Initiative (CTCI) are driving crucial opportunities for accelerated investment and implementation in European green corridors.

The WBCSD ZEV European Coalition (ZEV EC) will seek to reinforce these efforts, targeting the deployment of tens of thousands of EV, charging units and Renewable Energy Sources across the region, and call for integrated and clear policies and standards that will drive electrification.

Businesses and cities come together to prepare for Future Urban Mobility

Urban mobility accounts for 40% of passenger’s global transport CO2 emissions, and passenger and freight demand are projected to double by 2050. Cities face mounting pressure to address three core challenges:

how to reduce their ecological impact (reducing GHG emissions, air pollution and optimizing energy use);

how to deliver inclusive, accessible mobility;

how to make sustainable mobility attractive and economically viable for users and operators.

In 2025, WBCSD members continue to drive the co-design of the future mobility solutions that are sustainable, accessible, and collaborate with cities to shape affordable solutions. These dialogues will shape actionable roadmaps through 2026 and beyond.

Urban mobility is at the heart of a sustainable future. At Volkswagen Group, we are driving the transformation toward cleaner, smarter, and more connected mobility solutions, where every journey contributes to a better quality of life for all. By systematically developing our portfolio by fostering solutions like MOIA’s autonomous and shared mobility services, we’re turning this vision into reality—making sustainable, accessible transportation an everyday experience.

– Dirk Voeste, Chief Sustainability Officer, Volkswagen Group

Digitalization and AI will be essential to efficiently plan urban mobility systems, optimizing infrastructure and network investments, and allowing for operational efficiencies. Since 2019, mobility sector companies at WBCSD have developed value chain frameworks to scale sustainable mobility services, demonstrating how public-private collaboration based on data exchange can accelerate and optimize deploymentof charging infrastructure, drive more efficient and user-centric mobility, or enhance transport resilience.

Our multi-fuel bus pilot with Rybnik demonstrated how granular data-driven fuel optimization can strategically manage fuel mixes (Hydrogen and, ICE) to reduce GHG emissions while increasing resilience. This initiative, highlighting the power of digital collaboration and integrated transport systems for better investment decisions and urban mobility, offers crucial insights for logistics (HGV fleets) to achieve economically viable and environmentally responsible decarbonization.

A timely transition cannot happen without global frameworks to scale low carbon fuels for maritime and aviation

Beyond road transport, the maritime, aviation, and rail sectors together account for around 25% of global transport emissions.

The “beyond road” sector faces complex challenges to decarbonize, including a lagging business case for alternative fuels, prohibitive prices, a lack of integration across value chains and regional roadmaps, and low standardization of recognized emissions accounting standards slowing demand for industry solutions.

The energy transition that the shipping industry is undertaking is challenging, yet the technology is ready with dual fuel vessels already operating. We see several technological and fuel pathways ahead, including liquified biomethane, biodiesel, and alcohols such as e- and bio-methanol where we have our largest offtake agreement starting production already next year. As with other transport sectors, the energy transition of shipping requires action and support from an entire ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.

– Morten Bo Christiansen, Head of Energy Transition, A.P. Moller – Maersk

Scaling the maritime sector’s net-zero transition will demand USD $2.6 trillion by 2050, USD $2 trillion of which is for zero-emission fuel production. Meeting the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) long-term aviation decarbonization goals will require approximately USD $3.2 trillion by 2050, with USD $19–45 billion alone needed by 2030 to scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

Companies in the maritime and aviation value chains have come together under a new Beyond road coalition at WBCSD to advocate for clear and integrated policy, standards and market-based mechanisms and accelerate the business case for decarbonization.",https://www.wbcsd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WBCSD-highlighting-global-efforts-for-transport-decarbonization-at-COP30.webp,N,,2025-11-11 05:56:53.298000

""If a corporate can fulfil its CSR obligation, even partially through SAF purchase, then the incentive is obvious,"" he added.","Voluntary sustainable aviation fuel programmes by airlines will provide a value proposition for corporates in reducing their carbon footprints, and feedstock collection for producing the fuel will also bring in collateral socio-economic benefits for India, according to a senior Airbus official.

European aircraft maker Airbus, which has a significant presence in India, has also pitched for bringing corporates' spending on the airlines' voluntary Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programmes under the government's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) framework.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) Development, Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, said a voluntary scheme for SAF will be an ""opportunity for airlines to differentiate and to propose something new to their corporate customers first, then to cargo customers and eventually to private customers"".

India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and Indian carriers have placed orders for more than 1,700 aircraft. As part of sustainability efforts, the government will soon be coming out with a SAF policy.

Elaborating on the value proposition of having the voluntary SAF programmes, Manhes told PTI in an interview in the national capital that the idea is about selling business travel experience with not only good seats and meals but also with a ""lower carbon footprint"".

In the context of the airlines' grouping, IATA's view that SAF blending mandates without incentives is a ""no-go area"", Manhes opined that creating voluntary demand for SAF will not result in market distortion.

He observed that airlines are reluctant to opt for SAF schemes without incentives because they will incur more costs as the fuel itself comes at a higher cost.

""Voluntary demand is not a market distortion. It is an add-on,"" he noted.

India aims to have 1 per cent blending of SAF in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent blending by 2028 and 5 per cent blending by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in fuel in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

Manhes said the idea is to help airlines in India to develop a mechanism and products for voluntary SAF programmes, and then make sure that the demand materialises.

""If a corporate can fulfil its CSR obligation, even partially through SAF purchase, then the incentive is obvious,"" he added.

Under the Companies Law, a certain class of profitable corporates are required to shell out at least two per cent of their three-year average annual profit towards CSR activities in a financial year.

Manhes also said that feedstock collection for SAF will be a huge opportunity for collateral socio-economic benefits, and that applies to India like any other country.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue. Utilisation of feedstock for SAF production is also expected to help farmers increase their income.

A recent study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, said that India can emerge as a significant centre for sustainable aviation fuel production in South Asia, and the country's potential biomass feedstock for the fuel is projected to be 100 million tonnes by 2030.

""Regulations, targets, mandates, whatever you call it, will not get us to where we need to be to reach net zero in 2050... You need voluntary demands, "" he emphasised.

Long seen as one of the most promising routes to decarbonising flight, SAF has historically struggled with scalability, cost and complexity.

However, in a lab at the University of Alberta, a young researcher believes those barriers are finally beginning to fall.

The research, conducted under the supervision of Prof. David C. Bressler, focuses on advancing the lipid-tohydrocarbon (LTH) process for renewable fuel production.

PhD student Bernardo Souto and his colleagues at the Biorefining Conversions and Fermentation Laboratory (Bressler’s lab) have been working hand-in-hand with analytical technology giant PerkinElmer to unlock a new way of producing renewable jet fuel.

The collaboration, which began under the Alberta Biojet Initiative (ABI), has led to a major breakthrough in how wa

ste fats and oils can be converted into high-quality, ready-to-use aviation fuel. “It’s an incredibly exciting time,” said Souto at the start of his discussion with the magazine’s editor.

“Our process takes lipids from virtually any source, animal fats, used cooking oil, even algae, and converts them directly into hydrocarbons suitable for jet engines.

“The best part is that it’s cleaner, cheaper and more efficient than many existing methods.”

A collaboration born from challenge

The partnership between PerkinElmer and the University of Alberta began in earnest in 2019, when the ABI was launched as a $7 million (€6 million) collaboration involving Natural Resources Canada, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Prairies Economic Development Canada, Alberta, Future Energy Systems, the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences at the University of Alberta, Edmonton International Airport, and FORGE Hydrocarbons, which is the industry and commercialisation partner.

The goal: to develop and demonstrate technologies capable of producing sustainable aviation fuel from Canadian feedstocks. At that time, Souto’s research group, led by Prof. Bressler, was already known for its pioneering work in lipid conversion – transforming oils and fats into renewable hydrocarbons.

However, as their experiments grew more complex, so did their analytical needs. “We had the technology, but we needed precision,” Souto explained. “We were generating hundreds of compounds in our reactions, and we needed to identify and quantify every one of them accurately. That’s when PerkinElmer came in.”

Working closely with PerkinElmer’s engineers and technicians, the Bressler’s lab team helped design and optimise a suite of advanced analytical instruments, including gas chromatographs, thermal analysers and elemental analysers, specifically tailored for renewable fuel research.

PerkinElmer was very supportive giving the department good price reductions, allowing the team not only to push their research further, but to showcase how such analytical innovation could accelerate the wider biofuels sector. “They really helped us bridge the gap between laboratory curiosity and industrial application,” Souto continued.

“By giving us access to cutting-edge tools, we could understand our feedstocks, track every product and evaluate our yields in real time.”

From laboratory bench to industrial scale

What began as a proofof- concept in 2003 has since matured into a fullscale demonstration.

Over two decades of development, the Bressler’s lab team has advanced from tiny microreactors producing millilitres of fuel to pilot-scale systems capable of generating 20 kilograms per hour.

Each step has refined the process, and each scale-up has been guided by careful analysis.

The underlying technology, now patented and licensed to FORGE Hydrocarbons, a Canadian spin-off company from the university, offers a compelling new route to SAF. FORGE is currently constructing its first commercial plant in Sombra, Ontario, designed to produce renewable diesel and later expand to sustainable jet fuel production.

What makes the FORGE LTH Process unique is its feedstock flexibility and simplicity.

Traditional SAF pathways, such as the widely used hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) route, depend on expensive catalysts and high-purity feedstocks.

In contrast, the FORGE LTH Process relies primarily on temperature and pressure to break down complex lipids into usable hydrocarbons, eliminating the need for catalysts or hydrogen during the renewable diesel stage. For sustainable aviation fuel production, only small amounts of hydrogen are later introduced to improve fuel properties while maintaining a low carbon profile. “It’s what we call a ‘feedstock-agnostic’ process,” Souto explained.

“It doesn’t matter if the oil comes from plants, animals, or microorganisms, we can use it.

“It also doesn’t need to be pristine. Even waste or low-quality fats can be turned into clean, drop-in fuels that are chemically similar to diesel or jet fuel.” This simplicity has powerful implications for scalability and cost reduction.

The PerkinElmer effect

PerkinElmer’s technical collaboration and support were instrumental in advancing the analytical component of our SAF research.

Their instruments have given the researchers a clearer view of what happens inside the process, helping them understand and optimise the chemistry in unprecedented detail. “In the early days, analysing a single gas sample required several instruments and additional time to obtain a full picture,” Souto recalled.

“We needed to use several instruments to get a full picture. Thanks to the new system we developed with PerkinElmer, we can now complete the same analysis more efficiently and with greater accuracy.”

The collaboration has also produced an online gas chromatograph capable of sampling directly from the process. This innovation allows researchers to monitor chemical changes in real time.

“It means we can literally see what’s happening inside the process at the push of a button,” said Souto.

“That’s a huge leap forward for optimisation. It helps us connect process conditions to the chemistry, and the chemistry to the final product.” This ability to obtain rapid, high-resolution data has dramatically improved research efficiency.

“When you’re running pilot plants, you’re generating hundreds of samples a day,” Souto noted.

“You can’t afford to spend hours analysing each one. The speed and reliability we’ve achieved have made a massive difference.”

From waste to wings

While the past focus was on renewable diesel, the Bressler’s lab ultimate goal is clear: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The demand for SAF is rising rapidly as airlines and governments set aggressive decarbonisation targets. Aviation currently accounts for around 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that demand for jet fuel will double by 2050.

“If we want to fly more without worsening emissions, we need alternatives,” Souto said.

“We don’t have to replace fossil fuels entirely, but we do need to meet growing demand with sustainable options.”

Souto envisions a future where modular SAF production units can operate directly at airports, using locally available waste oils to produce fuel on site. “Imagine collecting used cooking oil from a city’s restaurants and converting it into jet fuel right at the airport,” he said.

“That’s the kind of decentralised model that FORGE Hydrocarbons is deploying.”

The potential advantages of the process extend beyond cost and logistics. Unlike HEFA fuels, which often lack aromatic compounds necessary for jet engine performance, the FORGE LTH Process naturally produces a broader spectrum of hydrocarbons, including aromatics, that can make the resulting fuel more compatible with current aviation standards.

“In theory, our fuel could be used without blending,” Souto suggested. “That’s what we’re testing now – ensuring it meets ASTM specifications for drop-in use.”

Scaling up for the SAF era

The team’s progress so far is impressive. More than 100 pilot campaigns have been conducted, amounting to over 2,000 hours of continuous operation.

The renewable diesel produced already meets Canadian fuel quality standards, and work is now underway to finalise testing for SAF certification. The transition from renewable diesel to aviation-grade fuel is not just a chemical step, but a regulatory one.

Every new SAF pathway must pass rigorous ASTM testing to ensure compatibility, safety and performance.

Souto’s team is now focusing on the fine-tuning required to meet those standards, analysing molecular profiles, and ensuring consistent quality across feedstocks.

“This is where PerkinElmer continues to be critical,” said Souto. “We’re studying how different feedstocks behave and how composition affects the end product. The goal is to tailor the process so we can control the properties we need.”

The University of Alberta’s research does not stop there. The team is also exploring how reaction parameters can be optimised for energy efficiency and carbon reduction, potentially opening doors to on-site SAF production at regional airports or refineries.

FORGE Hydrocarbons, meanwhile, is moving ahead with its commercial deployment.

Once the Ontario plant is fully operational, it will represent one of Canada’s most advanced renewable fuel facilities and a proof point for a process that could reshape the market.

The future of flight, fuelled by partnership

Looking ahead, Souto believes that collaboration between academia and industry will remain vital to progress.

“We’re always facing new challenges,” he said. “That’s the nature of research. But the partnership with PerkinElmer allows us to tackle them faster, to develop new tools, new methods, and ultimately better fuels.”

For PerkinElmer, the collaboration is equally rewarding, demonstrating how advanced analytical science can accelerate clean energy innovation. The company now uses the Alberta lab as a demonstration site, showcasing to other researchers and industry partners how cutting-edge instrumentation can drive real-world breakthroughs.

Each year, Dr Bressler and Souto present their findings as part of PerkinElmer’s seminar series, sharing lessons from their SAF journey and highlighting how analytical precision translates into cleaner skies.

A cleaner horizon

As airlines, governments and fuel producers worldwide push towards net-zero, the need for viable, scalable SAF solutions has never been greater. The FORGE LTH Process could well be one of the keys to meeting that challenge.

By combining scientific rigour, industrial insight and the power of partnership, Souto and his colleagues are proving that the future of flight does not have to come at the expense of the planet.

“We’re not trying to reinvent aviation,” Souto concluded. “We’re just making it sustainable – one drop of fuel at a time.”

The funds collected from passengers will go to the centralised purchase of sustainable aviation fuel-typically made from waste oils or agricultural feedstock-as Singapore looks to achieve a SAF adoption rate of 3% to 5% by 2030. The global aviation sector makes up a relatively small portion of global greenhouse gas emissions-just 1.2% last year, according to the European Commission.

But surging demand for travel, coupled with the higher cost of sustainable fuels and their limited availability, are among key hurdles for the industry's efforts to decarbonise.

While SAF production doubled last year, it accounted for only 0.3% of global jet fuel volumes, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Singapore's announcement coincides with the COP30 meeting in Brazil, where negotiators from nearly 200 countries are set to thrash out technical details on the world's efforts to mitigate climate change. While the duties may be a surprise to some travelers, they're cheaper than initially feared. The government had previously estimated them at between S$3 and S$16, but a decline in SAF costs has prompted a smaller levy.

“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.
Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and one of the largest of its kind anywhere in the world,"" said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami.
“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms.","Global project development, manufacturing and engineering group Alfanar has today confirmed a move to a larger, more enhanced site for its Lighthouse Green Fuels (LGF) SAF project. During a keynote to aviation leaders at the Airlines 2025 conference in London, UK Country Head of Alfanar Noaman Al Adhami also unveiled a new dedicated brand and website for LGF which is wholly owned by Alfanar.

The £2bn LGF project will convert 1.5m tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks –including forestry, sawmill, and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF Mandate – into more than 180m litres of second-generation SAF every year, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 27,000 short-haul flights.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location. It offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

It is also even closer to carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network when online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

“The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production. Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and one of the largest of its kind anywhere in the world,"" said Alfanar UK Country Head, Noaman Al Adhami. ""This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

“Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future, and Alfanar’s £2 billion investment to build the world’s biggest sustainable aviation fuel plant of its kind is a clear sign of that leadership,"" said Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, who visited Alfanar’s London HQ. “We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms.

Aemetis also provided an update of biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects.

During an earnings call, Aemetis Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee reported that the company’s RNG business significantly increased biogas production capacity at the end of the third quarter with a new multi-dairy digester that came online in September. That facility increased RNG capacity by more than 30%. According to McAfee, Aemetis remains on track to have more than 500,000 MMBtus of RNG capacity in place by the end of 2025, increasing to 1 MMBtus by the end of 2026. Aemetis is currently operating or building digesters to process waste from 18 dairies.

The California Air Resources Board earlier this year approved Low Carbon Fuel Standard pathways for seven of Aemetis’ dairy digesters, with an average carbon intensity (CI) score of -384 gCO2e/MJ. “These pathway approvals increased our LCFS credit revenue by 160% for these dairies starting in the third quarter of this year, compared to dairy digesters with the -150 default pathway score while pathways are pending approval,” McAfee said, noting four additional LCFS pathways are currently under review at CARB.

McAfee confirmed that the company’s RNG facilities qualify for the Section 48 energy investment tax credit. RNG output also qualifies for 45Z clean fuel production tax credits. “Collectively, molecule revenues, LCFS credit sales, D3 [renewable identification number (RIN)] sales and the sale of 45Z production tax credits are expected to generate strong positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of this year and expanding operating cash flow in 2026, as new dairy RNG production comes online 45Z calculations are issued by the Department of Energy and LCFS credit prices continue to rise,” he said.

Regarding operations at the Keyes ethanol plant, McAfee reported that the mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) system is completing equipment fabrication. On-site construction is expected to begin during the fourth quarter of 2025 and be complete during the second quarter of 2026. The MVR system is expected to reduce natural gas consumption at the ethanol plant by 80%, according to McAfee.

The Keyes plant reduced ethanol production during Spring 2025 in order to optimize ethanol margins. McAfee said the facility ramped up production during the third quarter due to higher ethanol demand and improved margins. Higher production is expected to continue during the fourth quarter.

Aemetis also operates a biodiesel subsidiary in India, which is targeting an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2026. McAfee said the company is actively seeking to expand into biogas and ethanol production in India.

In addition, Aemetis is working to develop the Riverbank biorefinery, a 90 MMgy SAF and renewable diesel facility in California, along with CCS capacity. According to McAfee, the company continues to engage in active discussions on financing structures for the Riverbank project, and is waiting further clarity on the 45Z production credit and biofuel mandates to support project financing. For the adjacent CCS project, Aemetis has completed initial site and installation work for its CO2 characterization well. The data obtained from the next phase of drill will support the company’s Class VI permit application.

Aemetis sold 14.7 million gallons of ethanol during the third quarter of 2025, down from 15.5 million gallons sold during the same period of 2024. For the first nine months of the year, ethanol sales reached 42.6 million gallons, down from 44.4 million gallons sold during the same period of last year.

About AIIB The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a multilateral development bank dedicated to financing “Infrastructure for Tomorrow,” with sustainability at its core.","The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has approved a USD1 billion Climate-Focused Policy-Based Financing (CPBF) loan in support of the Government of Brazil’s actions toward achieving its climate goals under its Nationally Determined Contributions. The financing will support policy and institutional measures that facilitate implementation of Brazil’s Ecological Transformation Plan in sustainable finance, energy transition and green and resilient infrastructure.

Announcing the investment, Jin Liqun, President and Chair of the Board of Directors, AIIB, said Brazil’s reform program “couples policy ambition with practical market reforms,” adding that “AIIB’s support will help channel more private capital into sustainable finance, accelerate the energy transition, and build climate-resilient infrastructure—delivering tangible benefits for people, nature and the economy.”

“Through this CPBF, Brazil and AIIB are demonstrating that climate action and development go hand in hand,” said Tatiana Rosito, Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Finance and AIIB Alternate Governor for Brazil. “This partnership is helping us turn policy into progress – creating markets for sustainable finance, advancing carbon market and blended-finance mechanisms such as Eco Invest Brasil, driving the energy transition, and recognizing nature as essential infrastructure for a resilient future.”

Under the CPBF, reforms are organized across sustainable finance, energy transition, and green and resilient infrastructure—three pillars that together direct public and private capital toward low-carbon growth and biome regeneration; promote competitive, sustainable bioenergy with robust value chains; and enhance the resilience of critical natural assets and infrastructure. Expected results include establishing governance for a national carbon market, mobilizing private resources for sustainable infrastructure and forest conservation, producing low-GHG sustainable aviation fuel, deploying early-warning systems for extreme heat, and strengthening forest and mangrove restoration.

The project applies AIIB’s operational policies for CPBF and will complement policy loans of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Semi-annual program reviews will track prior actions and results, consistent with the Program’s agreed framework.

This initiative builds on AIIB’s previous analytical work – including its Nature as Infrastructure Report (2023), which reframes natural ecosystems as core infrastructure assets, and its Infrastructure for Planetary Health Report (2025), which integrates infrastructure investment with human, environmental and climate health outcomes.

But for travellers who are price-conscious, this may push them to choose another country to fly from, said Ms Kong, 55.

The Australian, who typically visits family here before continuing her travels to other parts of Asia and Europe from Changi Airport, has taken six business class flights out of Singapore for work and leisure so far in 2025.

Speaking to The Straits Times from Sydney, where she is based, she expressed surprise at Singapore’s decision to impose a levy at a time when people are increasingly conscious about costs and uncertain about the economic outlook.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on Nov 10 announced that passengers flying out of Singapore from October 2026 will

pay a levy of between $1 and $41.60

that will go towards the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. The levy paid will vary based on flight distance and class of travel.

It will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from Oct 1 that year.

Passengers in economy or premium economy class will pay between $1 and $10.40, depending on their destination.

Those who fly business or first class will pay between $4 and $41.60.

The travellers ST interviewed said that while the levy amount is not significant enough to change their travel habits, it is another fee added to the already-high cost of air travel.

Ms May Ng, 37, said she is resigned to paying the charge since there is no choice.

The personal assistant, who travels with her husband and two daughters in economy class, flies out of Singapore up to four times a year, usually to destinations within Asia.

While Ms Ng believes that adopting sustainable aviation fuel is good for the environment, “who wants to pay more?” she asked.

Still, the amount is not large enough to change her family’s travel plans or encourage her to book tickets earlier to avoid paying the levy.

Passengers who book their tickets before April 1, 2026, will not have to pay the levy, even if they are travelling after Oct 1, 2026.

Ms Claudine Ho, an administrator in the medical industry, flies up to 10 times a year.

The 53-year-old, who takes a mix of economy and business class flights, said more can be done to help travellers understand the importance of sustainability by making it relatable to the layperson, so that travellers can understand the reason behind imposing the levy.

Another frequent traveller, Mr Julius Toh, sees the levy as yet another example of the rising cost of living.

However, the 55-year-old bar owner, who travels up to eight times a year for work and with family within Asia and to Europe, said most travellers would probably not notice it.

A spokesman for national carrier Singapore Airlines told ST that the charge aligns with SIA Group’s commitment to gradually increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel.

He said it will continue to work with partners, including government agencies and fuel suppliers, to accelerate the development and commercialisation of green jet fuel.

Mr Sheldon Hee, regional vice-president for the Asia-Pacific at the International Air Transport Association, said the industry body for airlines welcomes the “lead time for the implementation and the industry consultations to clarify the implementation details”.

The timing of the levy roll-out – for tickets sold from April 2026 for flights departing from October that year – is based on industry feedback, giving airlines and passengers time to adjust, CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said on Nov 10.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, calculated on a per-kilogramme basis.

It will also vary based on the distance travelled.

A spokeswoman for DHL said the global logistics company is reviewing the details of the levy, and assessing the impact on its operations and customers.

FedEx, another global logistics provider with operations in Singapore, declined comment as it was still looking into the details of the announcement.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b807b1e153e03012dc337258ec1f5ef6f6840b75c0bccb1b50c6895e520de757,N,,2025-11-10 17:56:14.157053

An investigation by the EU Commission and the Network of Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Authorities decided that airlines’ descriptions of carbon offsets and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) gave passengers a false impression that flying was sustainable. Flight emissions ‘calculators’ and vague net-zero emissions targets were also raised as greenwashing practices.

Lufthansa, KLM, and Ryanair are among the airlines who will now revise their claims after reaching an agreement with the EU. The bloc warned that if they did not fall in line with the investigation, sanctions could follow. The 21 airlines must now use the term ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ with appropriate clarifications, and be much clearer with their carbon offsetting claims.

Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, said:

It is excellent news airlines have agreed to stop luring consumers with green promises following our complaint to the European Commission. It was high time airlines stopped painting flying as a sustainable option. Paying ‘green fares’ to plant trees can never guarantee to suck aircraft emissions out of the air.

The EU’s recommendations made clear that sustainability claims and ‘green’ terminology can only be used if backed up by comprehensive targets, strategies, and timelines. Announced on the eve of COP30, the agreement sends a strong message to all airlines, and highlights how much more needs to be done for aviation to make realistic steps towards decarbonisation and overall sustainability.

Often made from biomass waste or cooking oils, small percentages of sustainable aviation fuels are already blended with conventional kerosene fuels, with the aviation industry and travelers pushing towards larger integration.
The current corn-based sustainable aviation fuel production method chemically modifies ethanol to make aviation fuel through a process called Alcohol-to-Jet.
""A variety of factors need to be considered when planning how to produce large quantities of sustainable aviation fuels from CO₂.
Starting with CO₂ from corn ethanol fermentation promises the fastest path to scaling up this new industry,"" said Sick.","Manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel with CO₂ byproducts of ethanol production could reduce carbon intensity by more than 80% compared to fossil fuels.

The CO2 released from corn during ethanol production could actually be a valuable, underutilized resource for producing aviation fuel rather than a waste byproduct, according to a study published in the SAE International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, Energy, Environment, & Policy.

Unlike the CO₂ from coal plants or cement kilns, which requires a lot of energy to capture, fermentation to produce ethanol releases very pure streams containing 85% CO₂ by volume or higher. As the corn plants sequestered CO₂ from the air, capturing the CO₂ released from fermentation and using it as fuel would reuse CO₂ without adding more to the atmosphere.

""It is exciting to explore whether this 'waste' stream can actually become a significant asset, turning inefficiency into advantage and accelerating the real-world application of emerging technologies,"" said Stephen McCord, a research scientist in mechanical engineering at U-M and lead author of the study.

With aviation producing over a gigaton of fossil CO2 emissions annually, sustainable aviation fuel produced from non-fossil carbon stocks can help reduce these emissions. Often made from biomass waste or cooking oils, small percentages of sustainable aviation fuels are already blended with conventional kerosene fuels, with the aviation industry and travelers pushing towards larger integration.

The United States produced 15.6 billion gallons of ethanol in 2023, releasing 48 megatons of CO₂, offering a route to produce sustainable aviation fuel at scale. With several different ways to make sustainable aviation fuel from bioethanol, the research team compared pathways to determine the ones with the lowest environmental impact.

""We hope to inform future development and policy by highlighting which routes are most promising for reducing aviation's carbon footprint using existing waste resources,"" said Volker Sick, former Director of the Global CO₂ Initiative and the DTE Energy Professor of Advanced Energy Research at U-M and senior author of the study.

The current corn-based sustainable aviation fuel production method chemically modifies ethanol to make aviation fuel through a process called Alcohol-to-Jet. Although it has a high fuel yield of 90%, this route only reduces carbon intensity by about 4.5% to 20% compared to kerosene jet fuel.

The research team compared this method to two CO₂-based routes. Both methods begin by converting captured CO₂ into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H₂). The gas fermentation route uses syngas to create ethanol as an intermediate step, then uses Alcohol-to-Jet to produce fuel. The Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis route instead feeds syngas into a reactor, synthesizing the long-chain liquid hydrocarbons that make up jet fuel.

A life cycle assessment found both approaches outperformed conventional methods, with Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis projected to reduce carbon intensity by up to 90% while gas fermentation was projected to reduce it by 84%.

When considering existing bioethanol facilities and workforce skills, gas fermentation followed by Alcohol-to-Jet came out on top as the path with the smoothest transition despite a slightly lower carbon intensity reduction.

""A variety of factors need to be considered when planning how to produce large quantities of sustainable aviation fuels from CO₂. Starting with CO₂ from corn ethanol fermentation promises the fastest path to scaling up this new industry,"" said Sick.

As a follow-up, the research team assessed the economic competitiveness of these two pathways to understand which would operate best in real-world conditions and which could be deployed quickest in the US.

With electrification and hydrogen both facing significant technical and practical obstacles for long-distance air travel, hydrocarbon fuels will likely remain essential for aviation in the foreseeable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2019/ethanol.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:06.366061

The facility will convert used cooking oil and waste-based feedstocks into certified sustainable aviation fuel meeting international standards. Phase I will produce 125 million litres per year around 18 percent of the UAE’s 2030 target, while Phase II will double capacity to 250 million litres per year, supporting regional exports and contributing up to 36 percent of the nation’s SAF goal.

The planned investment for phase I is $200 million and additional $100 million for Phase II, making a total investment of $300 million. The project represents a major contribution and step forward in the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 Agenda.

First introduced at Adipec 2024 in alignment with the nation’s vision to expand sustainable fuel production, Mena Biofuels has since progressed from concept to implementation, moving decisively towards execution. Over the past year the company has completed a comprehensive feasibility study validating the project’s economic viability and set the foundation for progressing the project to realisation. The project has secured the lease of land, adjacent to Mena Terminals, from the Government of Fujairah, appointed Dynatron FZE, a UAE engineering consulting firm, to act as Project Manager, completed detailed topographic and hydrological surveys carried out by UAE based consulting firms, and selected an internationally recognized technology provider for the process to convert waste-based feedstocks into certified sustainable aviation fuel. Robert Wright, former CEO of the European Biofuels Association, has been contracted to provide advice on policy and regulation matters, and MUC Engineering – Fujairah Branch has been appointed to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment study as well as provide Project NOC consulting services.

At Adipec 2025, Mena Biofuels advanced its commercial implementation through the signing of strategic offtake MoU in the presence of Suhail Mohamed Al-Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, with Emirates Petroleum Company PJSC (Emarat), a pioneer in the UAE’s oil and gas industry. In addition, it is the intention to sign a similar MoU at the upcoming Dubai Air Show. The agreements set the foundation for UAE production of sustainable aviation fuel, marking a key step in advancing the nation’s SAF Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 objectives.

Building on this momentum, Mena Biofuels has launched the first of two Engineering, Procurement, and Construction and commissioning (EPCC) tender for the Fujairah SAF facility, inviting qualified international and regional contractors with proven experience in renewable fuel and industrial projects to participate. The first EPCC package will cover the receiving, storage, and distribution facilities for feedstock, SAF, and by-products, establishing the project’s logistical backbone. Within Q1 2026, Mena Biofuels will issue the second EPCC tender, covering the SAF refinery process units and associated infrastructure, marking a major step toward full-scale implementation of the UAE’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel plant. The project continues to move from vision to execution, positioning the UAE as a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuel production and ensuring SAF supply from Fujairah to the UAE, GCC, and international markets.

Ali Khalifa Al Shamsi, Chief Executive Officer of Emarat, said, “Building a home-grown SAF ecosystem requires investors, technology and distributors pulling in one direction. With Emarat’s agreement with Mena Biofuels, intent becomes supply: accelerated volumes from Fujairah, certified and locally produced, giving airlines a credible path to decarbonise. By backing a UAE-built SAF stream in FOIZ, we are creating domestic capacity that carriers can count on—advancing the SAF Roadmap 2030 and the nation’s Net Zero 2050 ambition while keeping value, jobs and know-how in the UAE.Twelve months from concept to implementation sends a clear signal that the UAE is serious about sustainable aviation fuel, and Emarat is committed to turning that momentum into dependable offtake and real emissions reductions.”

Captain Salem Al Afkham, Director, Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ), said: “The launch of the UAE’s first SAF plant here in Fujairah marks a defining milestone for both the Emirate and the Nation. As the first project of its kind in Fujairah and the UAE, it reflects our shared commitment to the Net Zero 2050 strategy and the transition toward more sustainable energy sources. We are proud to be part of this achievement, which represents a new chapter in Fujairah’s energy journey. This project moves Fujairah closer to its strategic ambition of diversifying its energy mix beyond conventional hydrocarbons and into cleaner, higher-value fuels. It also aligns with the emirate’s and the UAE’s vision of fostering in-market value creation — bringing together investment, innovation, and industrial capacity to build long-term economic and environmental resilience.

As this and similar projects take shape, FOIZ continues to evolve from one of the world’s top three oil storage and bunkering hubs into a fully integrated energy ecosystem — one where processing capacity and advanced technologies are leveraged to convert feedstocks into higher-value, more sustainable fuels. This transformation strengthens Fujairah’s role as a vital contributor to the region’s clean-fuels landscape and underscores our ongoing commitment to supporting the UAE’s broader energy transition.”

“We are proud to see Mena Biofuels progress from announcement to implementation in just one year,” said H.E Mohamed Saeed Al-Raqbani, Chairman of Mena Biofuels. “This project directly supports the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and embodies our commitment to advancing clean energy through industrial investment and strategic partnerships.”

Zach Nunn on the harms of the ""catastrophic"" Schumer Shutdown and ...",Matthew Foldi,,,,,https://washingtonreporter.news/p/interview-rep-zach-nunn-on-the-harms,"“We’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families,” Nunn said, discussing a facility that he recently visited.

Rep. Zach Nunn: Well, first and foremost, we’ve gone out to our first responder groups across the 3rd District in Iowa.
Rep. Zach Nunn: Every single day of September, October, and now going in November, has been ruined by the Schumer shutdown.","While the Schumer Shutdown has devastated Americans across the country, Rep. Zach Nunn (R., Iowa) has spent the past few weeks meeting with constituents who have been devastated by what he categorized as the Democrats’ “partisan, extreme primary politics” that have ground America to a halt.

The Washington Reporter previously covered Nunn’s latest tour of Iowa’s 3rd District; now Nunn, in his latest interview with the Reporter, shared his thoughts on how Democrats are abandoning their roots in states like Iowa and how President Donald Trump scored a major win for farmers, manufacturers, and rural Americans during his most recent trip to Asia.

Nunn, a self-described “common sense conservative” who represents one of the most competitive districts in America, painted a bleak picture of how the Schumer Shutdown has devastated districts like his.

The “harvest is ongoing. The Department of Agriculture’s offices are closed. We’ve got guys who are having their hardest farm year ever, and it’s coming on the back of the fact that the president has gone above and beyond to try and open up new markets, particularly in Asia, for things like soybeans, corn, and beef. All good news.”

“But,” Nunn noted, “this also come off the heels of four years of the Biden administration being a complete failure on moving forward with domestic production as well. That’s things like biofuels, including E15, 45Z tax credits, really looking at the sustainable aviation fuel. These are two things that farmers are looking for now, and until we can win just five holdouts the Democratic caucus, Democrats have decided to hold the entire country hostage, hold the Midwest hostage on this issue.”

The other issue that Nunn focused on was cuts to SNAP and WIC. Nunn, who was “at both the food bank that collects all this and the food pantry that distributes all this,” has seen the consequences firsthand.

“We have seen record requests coming in from Iowa families who don’t know whether they should save their money to fill up the minivan, save their money to fill up the refrigerator, or save their money because they have no idea when they’re going to get paid again,” he explained. “I just talked to TSA guys on this and a number of them are on SNAP. They’re barely making it by in their front line position that protects us all, but now they’re also in the third missed pay period. This is putting a real stress on men and women who are being asked to show up on shift to protect all of us.”

Nunn explained that the consequences extend to Head Start programs as well, even though several in Iowa had not suffered from the shutdown.

“We’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families,” Nunn said, discussing a facility that he recently visited. “We’re talking about two, three, and four year olds that I spent time with, hearing it directly from both the staff at Head Start, the educators, as well as the parents who, if Head Start, runs out, not only do they not have WIC, they do not have SNAP, but now they can’t even go to work because they don’t have the opportunity for child care. It’s a triple strike for these families, and they’re going to be out big time if these programs aren’t able to be funded.”

But there are also unintended consequences that policymakers had clearly been ignoring, and he saw that firsthand when he met with law enforcement officers.

“When it comes to our sheriffs and our county law enforcement here, these guys are seeing an uptick in the number of challenges that are coming from domestic situations related to not getting the assistance that families need, and it puts a lot of stress on the community, particularly a rural community, when it doesn’t have a food bank up the street, but it depends on things like SNAP and WIC to take care of kiddos, to take care of senior citizens, so these are the unintended consequence of a shutdown, but it’s the totally foreseeable result of bad policy management in D.C,” Nunn explained.

“When Washington doesn’t pay its bills with taxpayer dollars that we sent from Iowa, Iowans end up getting hurt by this,” he added.

While a deal seems imminent that could end parts of the shutdown, Nunn stressed that “the longest shutdown in government history [is] a shutdown of choice by the Democrats, a shutdown that’s never happened over a simple clean funding bill.” He called it “a reflection of a Democratic Party that has not only lost touch with its roots in places like Iowa, but it is clearly putting partisan, extreme primary politics ahead of the entire country.”

While most federally elected Democrats were content to abandon the communities that Nunn spent the shutdown visiting, Trump struck major deals across the world.

Nunn said that Trump’s Asia trip in particular is welcome relief for his district.

“For farmers, manufacturers and, candidly, for rural America, this is huge,” Nunn said. “For the last four years, under the Biden administration, we went from trade parity to a $50 billion trade deficit just in the ag sector alone. In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets.”

Trump, Nunn said, has “done two things. He’s done, first of all, not just a great deal with China to get them to open back up, but he’s worked the entire region, everywhere from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, specifically, a 95 percent reduction on tariffs for Iowa ag, in the course of 24 hours. This is huge. This is what we need. We need Iowa farms to be successful, because they can’t just be the big farms that can sell overseas. It’s got to be the hometown farms that can have a market for this.”

The other aspect, which he has discussed with both the White House and with the Treasury Department, is that “we’ve got to have the opportunity to have a better domestic market here for being able to sell our commodities,” he said. “That’s everything from our beef market to our biofuels market. And I’m happy to say the administration is hearing us on that, and that is something that helps out not just rural America be successful, but it drives down the cost of food and fuel for the entire country.”

“Affordability in all of its aspects is going to come in those two areas, where, if we can drive down the cost of people being able to purchase goods at a cheaper and feed their families at cheaper rate, we’re moving in the right direction,” Nunn said.

Below is a transcript of our interview with Rep. Zach Nunn, lightly edited for clarity.

Washington Reporter:

Congressman Nunn, can you walk us through how the past several weeks of unprecedented and historic obstruction from your Democratic colleagues is harming states like Iowa and districts like yours specifically?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Let me just begin by saying I’m a common sense conservative, and I think that that goes a long way when I have one of the most competitive congressional districts in the entire state. We just had an election that showed that people were really frustrated with the dysfunction of D.C., and they want to see people who are going to be change agents delivering on things from affordability to housing to what we’re doing in the ag sector, particularly for both domestic and for the export market. Just this week, we spent a lot of time with farmers. This is the big thing. Harvest is ongoing. USDA, the Department of Agriculture, their offices are closed. We’ve got guys who are having their hardest farm year ever, and it’s coming on the back of the fact that the president has gone above and beyond to try and open up new markets, particularly in Asia, for things like soybeans, corn, and beef. All good news. But this also come off the heels of four years of the Biden administration being a complete failure on moving forward with domestic production as well. That’s things like biofuels, including E15, 45Z tax credits, really looking at the sustainable irrigation fuel. These are two things that farmers are looking for now, and until we can win just five holdouts the Democratic caucus, Democrats have decided to hold the entire country hostage, hold the Midwest hostage on this issue. So that’s my farmer issue. The second issue that we’ve really talked to here are the folks who depend on farmers. That is young families and women and independent children. SNAP and WIC are having big time impacts. I’ve been out at both the food bank that collects all this and the food pantry that distributes all this. We have seen record requests coming in from Iowa families who don’t know whether they should save their money to fill up the minivan, save their money to fill up the refrigerator, or save their money because they have no idea when they’re going to get paid again. I just talked to TSA guys on this and a number of them are on SNAP. They’re barely making it by in their front line position that protects us all, but now they’re also in the third missed pay period. This is putting a real stress on men and women who are being asked to show up on shift to protect all of us. But Democrats, again, thought that their liberal, progressive base deserved first priority on Election Day, versus 350 million Americans. And Foldi, I’ll also highlight this; I’m in a +1 Democrat district. And I get that. I work with people who are Republicans, people who are independents, and people who are Democrats, but I am hearing across the board here from these folks that they blame the Senate for this. They see they’re on the same side here now as the air traffic controllers union, the teamsters union, the hardcore federal union guys who are saying that Senate Democrats need to pass what the House Republicans passed back in September because now it’s crushing their own workforce. They can’t even be out there lying trying to justify this thing anymore. This is hopefully a wake up call to folks that if Democrats have lost everybody, from, Fetterman to union workers in Des Moines, Iowa, they’re in real trouble.

Washington Reporter:

You were mentioning the election results; how do you think that those are going to impact the Democrats’ approach to ending the shutdown? And how do you think it’s changing your approach here as you think about how to get out of the shutdown?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

We’ve offered a very clean pathway to end the shutdown. It should have been done two months ago, and every day that goes by, it hurts more and more Iowans. That’s unacceptable. I’ve been so aggressive as to say it’s catastrophic, not just for our food banks, not just for our farmers, but for the 2,000 National Guardsmen from Iowa who are currently deployed to Iraq who are going to go through a second month without their pay, that is unacceptable, particularly as somebody who continues to serve and fight with our armed forces. This should never have happened. The second part of this is, I am afraid the Democrats are taking the wrong lesson away from this. There is a handful of folks who are on the far left who think that the success of a Democratic socialist communist in New York is an indication that holding America hostage is how they get the things that they’re crying about. But as we heard from Schumer himself, you don’t throw a tantrum and shut down the government when you don’t get your way. That’s what he said six months ago. Here we are, beyond six weeks and the man hasn’t been able to find an off ramp with his own base to get the government open, and so while Democrats on the far coasts are talking about how we can continue to leverage this independents, and what I would call old school Democrats back home in Iowa have said, this is enough, and it’s hurting people who are the least able to bear the brunt of the Democratic shutdown operation. And as a result, just like with union Democrats, just like with old school Democrats, they went over to Trump in waves, I think we’re seeing a second coming of this, at least in the Midwest, of folks who are done with the shutdown and they don’t see liberal elites taking them into consideration.

Washington Reporter:

I’m particularly curious what you learned from your law enforcement roundtable and your Drake University Head Start visit, because you already touched on the farmer aspect and the TSA aspect. How does the shutdown impact law enforcement in the Midwest and Head Start and university programs?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Well, first and foremost, we’ve gone out to our first responder groups across the 3rd District in Iowa. That means meeting with multiple police departments and sheriff’s offices, as well as both our full time and our volunteer firefighters and EMS. For the volunteers, this is just crushing; all of their SAFER grants are now on hold, and this is major equipment purchases. I talked with the Crescent Fire Department that wants to buy a multimillion dollar fire truck that helps protect them, particularly during the harvest season, when we have a lot of heavy operations going on, and they need to be able to respond both with the ambulance and the hook and ladder truck, and they can’t get it. When it comes to our sheriffs and our county law enforcement here, these guys are seeing an uptick in the number of challenges that are coming from domestic situations related to not getting the assistance that families need, and it puts a lot of stress on the community, particularly a rural community, when it doesn’t have a food bank up the street, but it depends on things like SNAP and WIC to take care of kiddos, to take care of senior citizens, so these are the unintended consequence of a shutdown, but it’s the totally foreseeable result of bad policy management in D.C. When Washington doesn’t pay its bills with taxpayer dollars that we sent from Iowa, Iowans end up getting hurt by this. The other side of the story, which is really tragic here, is we’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families. We’re talking about two, three, and four year olds that I spent time with, hearing it directly from both the staff at Head Start, the educators, as well as the parents who, if Head Start, runs out, not only do they not have WIC, they do not have SNAP, but now they can’t even go to work because they don’t have the opportunity for child care. It’s a triple strike for these families, and they’re going to be out big time if these programs aren’t able to be funded. I’m happy to we’ve been able to lead some good legislation on this, getting our SAFER grants, our cops grants, and Head Start in Des Moines effectively supported. We’ve gone out of the way to make sure that we worked with the White House on getting our troops paid through October. But this is not forever, and while SNAP and WIC are going to be able to be extended, we’ve got to get to a solution. The longest shutdown in government history, a shutdown of choice by the Democrats, a shutdown that’s never happened over a simple clean funding bill, is a reflection of a Democratic Party that has not only lost touch with its roots in places like Iowa, but it is clearly putting partisan, extreme primary politics ahead of the entire country.

Washington Reporter:

Iowa and Oklahoma don’t have any federally elected Democrats. Over in Oklahoma, Stephanie Bice was telling me that the shutdown shows that Democrats don’t care about rural America. Is that what’s going on here?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

When two guys from an extreme leftist state like New York are more worried about if they are going to have to try and get the endorsement of the new communist Mayor than they are the guys like Fetterman, who basically said that Democrats need to get their shit together if they can’t help feed the people who are poorest in this country, not only are you no longer championing what Democrats say they’re going to do, but you’re hurting the people, regardless of political party, who are the Americans on the front line of facing a Thanksgiving without food, without fuel, and without a future.

Washington Reporter:

I was struck by your point on Trump earlier, and obviously he spent a lot of the shutdown getting trade deals while Democrats in D.C. were doing no deals. Can you give us a sense of how the Asia trip, for example, is being received, especially by farmers in your district and in your state?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

For farmers, manufacturers and, candidly, for rural America, this is huge. For the last four years, under the Biden administration, we went from trade parity to a $50 billion trade deficit just in the ag sector alone. In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets. And the president’s done two things. He’s done, first of all, not just a great deal with China to get them to open back up, but he’s worked the entire region, everywhere from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, specifically, a 95 percent reduction on tariffs for Iowa ag, in the course of 24 hours. This is huge. This is what we need. We need Iowa farms to be successful, because they can’t just be the big farms that can sell overseas. It’s got to be the hometown farms that can have a market for this. And then the other aspect of this, and one of the areas where I’ve been very vocal with both the White House and with the Treasury Secretary, is that we’ve got to have the opportunity to have a better domestic market here for being able to sell our commodities. That’s everything from our beef market to our biofuels market. And I’m happy to say the administration is hearing us on that, and that is something that helps out not just rural America be successful, but it drives down the cost of food and fuel for the entire country. Affordability in all of its aspects is going to come in those two areas, where, if we can drive down the cost of people being able to purchase goods at a cheaper and feed their families at cheaper rate, we’re moving in the right direction.

Washington Reporter:

Do you think that people’s Thanksgiving plans are going to be ruined by Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Every single day of September, October, and now going in November, has been ruined by the Schumer shutdown. Hakeem and Schumer has the opportunity to end this tonight. They’ve had 14 times to end it prior to this. And I’ll be very clear here, there are five individuals who make the decision for the entire country right now. Republicans have been clear in the House. Republicans have been clear in the Senate, and the majority of both chambers want this. But more importantly, the majority of Americans, regardless of party, want this. Five people can do the right thing. It’s up to them to decide whether families are going to get to have the Thanksgiving and the Christmas they deserve.

Washington Reporter:

The European Commission has reached an agreement with 21 airlines to revise or remove environmental claims deemed misleading, following a coordinated investigation by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network.

The agreement concludes months of dialogue that began after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023, accusing major carriers of “greenwashing.”

EU secures agreement with airlines to end misleading environmental messaging

The airlines involved include Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SAS, EasyJet, Norwegian, SWISS, TAP Air Portugal, Austrian Airlines, and Vueling. All have committed to eliminate or clarify claims suggesting that a specific flight could be made “carbon neutral” or “sustainable” through the purchase of offsets or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“Consumers are the firepower of our economy. Time and time again, Europeans have shown their readiness to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future,” said Michael McGrath, Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law and Consumer Protection.

“It is now important that the industry match these efforts by ensuring transparency and honesty in environmental claims. Consumers deserve clear and accurate information about the true impact of air travel and the real efforts that can be made to increase sustainability.”

“This dialogue is an encouraging acknowledgement of the responsibility we share to provide consumers with truthful information and to work toward genuine improvements in reducing the environmental impact of aviation,” said Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy. “I welcome the commitment made by the airlines to change their practices.

What airlines must change in their messaging

The Commission and national authorities said that many airline marketing practices violated the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which prohibits vague or unverifiable environmental promises. Under the new agreement, carriers will:

Remove or reword claims implying individual flights can be carbon neutral through offset schemes or SAF purchases.

Avoid using generic language like “green,” “eco-friendly,” or “sustainable travel” without providing scientific evidence.

Clarify the actual share of SAF used and the lifecycle methodology behind emissions-reduction figures.

Provide transparent assumptions in flight-emission calculators and ensure comparisons are scientifically supported.

The Commission emphasised that this was a compliance commitment, not a fine, but warned that enforcement could follow if the airlines fail to update their marketing.

The KLM “greenwashing” case: a win for environmental groups

In March 2024, the District Court of Amsterdam ruled that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines misled consumers with sustainability-related advertising, marking the first successful greenwashing lawsuit against an airline.

Environmental group Fossielvrij NL filed the case in 2022 with legal backing from ClientEarth, targeting KLM’s “Fly Responsibly” campaign. The plaintiffs argued that the airline’s claims about offsetting and sustainable aviation fuel created a false impression that passengers could fly “responsibly” without contributing to climate change.

The court found that 15 out of 19 marketing statements were misleading or insufficiently substantiated, including language implying KLM’s flights were sustainable or that purchasing offsets or SAF could neutralise emissions. In its ruling, the court said KLM had painted “an overly rosy picture” of sustainable aviation fuel and overstated the effectiveness of its measures, as reported by The Guardian.

Although the court did not require corrective advertising, it ordered the airline to ensure future claims are concrete, transparent, and evidence-based. KLM removed the contested materials.

Other airlines under fire for sustainability claims

Other airlines have also faced challenges from environmental groups and consumer protection agencies over their sustainability claims, not only in Europe but in the US as well. However, the US courts have generally favoured airlines.

Austrian Airlines: “carbon neutral to Venice”

In Austria, consumer group VKI filed a lawsuit against Austrian Airlines over a 2023 campaign claiming passengers could fly “carbon neutral to Venice” thanks to SAF. The court ruled that the claim was misleading because the airline used only a small fraction of SAF—nowhere near enough to offset the flight’s actual emissions.

Ryanair: “Europe’s lowest emissions airline”

The UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Ryanair’s 2020 ads that described it as “Europe’s lowest emissions airline.” Regulators said the claim relied on outdated data and failed to account for other carriers.

Delta Air Lines: “world’s first carbon-neutral airline”

In the United States, Delta Air Lines is facing a proposed class-action lawsuit (Berrin v. Delta Air Lines Inc.) filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The suit alleges that Delta misled passengers by marketing itself as “the world’s first carbon-neutral airline.”

The plaintiff, represented by environmental counsel, argued that Delta’s carbon-neutral claim relied on offsets that were “manifestly and provably false.” The lawsuit claimed that Delta overstated the impact of its carbon offsets, many of which, it said, were overcredited or unverifiable. Delta denied wrongdoing and filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the advertising was aspirational and that carbon offsets were certified by third-party verifiers.

United Airlines: SAF and carbon offsets claims

Also in the US, a class-action lawsuit (Zajac v. United Airlines Inc.) accused the airline of misleading consumers about its use of sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsets. The Maryland court dismissed the case in 2024, ruling that it was pre-empted by the Airline Deregulation Act, which limits state-level consumer actions against airlines.

Europe requires proof of airline ‘green’ claims

The EU’s coordinated action on airlines follows broader regulatory reforms, not all of which have been successful. The Green Claims Directive, for example, was withdrawn in June of this year. It would have required companies to substantiate any environmental marketing statements with scientific evidence.

At the same time, regulatory requirements are providing firm numbers that airlines can cite in their messaging to specify their sustainability progress. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which took effect in 2024, requires European airlines to blend set proportions of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. Airlines can publish their current blend compared to the target percentage required.

Airlines’ sustainability messaging agreement is only the beginning

Consumer groups say the new airline commitments are only the start.

“It is great news that authorities from across Europe acknowledge consumers have been fooled by airlines’ greenwashing. It is unacceptable that airlines have freely lured consumers into offsetting their flight’s emissions, sometimes at a high price. One can never be sure that the trees planted to compensate a flight’s high emissions will capture the carbon back into the ground – if they are planted at all,” said Monique Goyens, BEUC’s Director General.

“The fact that European consumer protection authorities are calling on airlines to get their act together shows there’s a wind of change. Greenwashing is no longer acceptable, and the fact that aviation is one of the most highly polluting sectors makes it even more intolerable. Today’s crackdown on greenwashing is encouraging at a time when consumers are expected to shift to more sustainable lifestyles.”

The combined effect of regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and public pressure will reshape how airlines talk about sustainability. Airlines now know that marketing slogans like “carbon-neutral flights” or “fly responsibly” can expose them to legal liability. The agreement does not mean airlines should stop promoting their sustainability initiatives, but rather that they should communicate measurable, verified progress rather than aspirational claims.

The initiative, named Project Speedbird, represents a joint development between LanzaJet and British Airways. Fluor will recognise the undisclosed contract value in the third quarter.

Mike Alexander, group president of Project Execution at Fluor Corporation, characterised Project Speedbird as marking pivotal advancement in global efforts to decarbonise aviation. He stated that by accelerating adoption of sustainable fuel technologies, the project will help redefine the future of flight, with Fluor proud to bring engineering and design expertise to the visionary initiative.

The project will leverage LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to transform second-generation ethanol, sourced from agricultural residues and woody biomass, into sustainable aviation fuel. British Airways will utilise this SAF to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 230,000 tonnes annually, equivalent to emissions from 26,000 domestic flights.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, stated that Project Speedbird represents the next commercial-scale facility in LanzaJet’s development portfolio, working closely with British Airways. He characterised it as an important step in continued scale-up of the company’s leading sustainable fuels technology. Samartzis noted that partnering with globally recognised engineering, procurement, and construction company Fluor Corporation demonstrates commitment to highest standards in project execution.

Located in Teesside, UK, the facility will produce more than 90,000 tonnes (30 million gallons) of SAF and renewable diesel annually. The site was selected for strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and access to skilled workforce.

Front-end engineering and design establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, site layouts, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions and subsequent detailed engineering for construction. FEED work bridges conceptual design and full engineering, procurement, and construction execution, addressing technical uncertainties and refining project scope.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology converts ethanol into jet fuel through catalytic processes producing hydrocarbons meeting aviation fuel specifications. The technology’s use of second-generation ethanol derived from agricultural residues and woody biomass addresses sustainability concerns about first-generation biofuels competing with food production.

British Airways’ commitment to offtake the facility’s SAF production provides commercial foundation supporting project financing. Long-term purchase agreements from creditworthy airlines enable project developers to secure debt financing and proceed with capital-intensive facility construction.

The 230,000-tonne annual emissions reduction represents substantial carbon abatement for British Airways’ operations, supporting the airline’s decarbonisation objectives. Aviation faces limited near-term alternatives to liquid fuels, making SAF a primary pathway for emissions reduction whilst maintaining existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Teesside’s selection reflects the region’s industrial heritage, existing energy infrastructure, port facilities, and workforce with relevant skills from petrochemical and process industries. The UK government has supported development of low-carbon industries in Teesside through various policy initiatives and funding programmes supporting industrial transformation.

The facility’s dual production of SAF and renewable diesel provides operational flexibility and revenue diversification. Renewable diesel serves road transport markets, providing additional offtake opportunities beyond aviation applications. Production processes for SAF and renewable diesel share technological similarities, enabling integrated facilities producing both products.

Project Speedbird advances UK objectives for developing domestic SAF production capacity supporting aviation sector decarbonisation whilst creating industrial jobs and supply chain opportunities. The UK government has established mandates requiring SAF blending in aviation fuel, creating policy certainty supporting production investments.

The 90,000-tonne annual SAF production capacity represents meaningful scale for European markets, where SAF availability currently falls well short of demand created by regulatory mandates and airline sustainability commitments. Commercial-scale facilities like Project Speedbird prove essential for closing this supply-demand gap.

Fluor’s role in FEED positions the engineering firm for potential EPC contract award following final investment decision, though FEED contracts don’t guarantee subsequent construction phase awards. The company’s project execution expertise in process industries supports complex facility development requiring integration of novel technologies with proven engineering practices.

LanzaJet operates the world’s first ethanol-to-SAF production facility in Georgia, United States, providing operational experience informing subsequent project development including Project Speedbird. Scaling from demonstration to multiple commercial facilities requires proven technology, experienced partners, and creditworthy offtake agreements—elements converging in the British Airways partnership.",https://storageterminalsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LJ-FPF-Approved-18-scaled-e1762763461613.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 13:01:48.047769

CBS reports that flight bookings are up 2% compared with 2024, when an estimated 79.9 million travelers journeyed 50 miles or more from home.

The vast majority-71.74%-traveled by car last year. While owning and driving cars will continue to be a fundamental mode of transport for the foreseeable future, Thanksgiving traffic might look much more sustainable in the not-too-distant future, CANOPY reports.

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

Input from 285 companies across the globe – representing an annual business travel spend of $22 billion USD – reveals that companies are still committed to tracking and managing carbon emissions from their employee travel programs, with measurable gains in maturity and more organizations joining the effort. Progress, however, remains limited in certain high impact areas, underscoring the need for faster, collective action to invest in low-carbon travel solutions.

Year two of our benchmark shows real engagement and growing commitment. But despite progress, greater urgency is needed. To future-proof business travel, companies must accelerate adoption of sustainable procurement practices and carbon management strategies to send a real signal to the market. Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director, GBTA Foundation

The 2025 results from the global benchmark developed in collaboration with Accenture were released today at the GBTA + VDR Europe Conference in Hamburg and can be downloaded here.

Key findings from the 2025 GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge include:

Participation continues to grow: 285 companies participated in the 2025 assessment, marking a 20% increase compared to 2024. Across the two years, participants represent approximately $31 billion in annual business travel spend and include one-quarter of BTN’s Top 100 corporate travel programs.

Incremental maturity gains: The global average score is now 1.4 compared to 1.3 in 2024 (out of a maturity scale from 0 showing “no activity” to 5 being “leading practice”), reflecting limited overall improvement.

Regional shifts: Global and APAC travel programs improved slightly, while regional and local programs in Europe and North America dipped marginally, likely due to regulatory changes and economic uncertainty.

Program size correlation: Smaller (<$5M) programs have made notable progress this year, while the largest (>$500M) programs have regressed overall, perhaps demonstrating that while companies under intense public scrutiny may be slowing their sustainability efforts, smaller companies may be using sustainability leadership as a way to differentiate themselves.

Leading industry sectors: The Financial, Banking and Insurance sector continues to lead (maturity score of 1.9 out of 5), followed by the Professional Services and Consulting sector (score of 1.7). These sectors traditionally have a large share of their emissions coming from their business travel programs.

Where companies are making progress:

Cost-positive sustainable practices are accelerating. Sustainable Travel Policies (2.2 score in 2025 versus 1.8 score in 2024) and Carbon Budgets (0.7 score in 2025 versus 0.5 score in 2024) show strong year-over-year improvement.

Reporting and targets setting are becoming standard. Reporting (2.7 score in 2025 versus 2.1 score in 2024) and Targets Setting (1.7 score in 2025 versus 1.4 score in 2024) are increasingly built into travel programs – although the largest companies show some regression.

Where acceleration is urgently needed:

Shaping travel decisions. Tools that influence booking choices – Carbon Fees (score of 0.4 in 2025) and OBT (online booking tool) Features (score of 2.4 in 2025), have stalled. Embedding these mechanisms is key to enforcing sustainable travel policies.

Sending a unified demand signal: While supplier sustainability assessments are increasing, advanced levers such as the GBTA Sustainable Procurement Standards and sustainability clauses in Contracting (score of 1.2 in 2025), show no movement – likely hindered by limited guidance and technology enablement.

Investing in emissions abatement: The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to decrease emissions from business travel is growing (15% of corporates purchasing SAF certificates in 2025, up from 12% in 2024), but adoption remains low. Corporates can leverage GBTA SAF Corporate Connect for best practices on SAF implementation.

The GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge provides a roadmap for the future. With more companies participating, we’re seeing where the industry is moving forward, and where further collaboration can close the gap between ambition and action.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location.
This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.
Alfanar UK country head, Noaman Al Adhami, said: “The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.
Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.","Global project development, manufacturing and engineering group Alfanar has confirmed a move to a larger, more enhanced site for its Lighthouse Green Fuels (LGF) SAF project. During a keynote to aviation leaders at the Airlines 2025 conference in London, UK Country Head of Alfanar Noaman Al Adhami also unveiled a new dedicated brand and website for LGF – LGF Projects Ltd – which is wholly owned by Alfanar.

The £2 billion (€2.28 billion) LGF project will convert 1.5 million tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks – including forestry, sawmill, and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF Mandate – into more than 180 million litres of second-generation SAF, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location.

It offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

It is also even closer to carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network when online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

Alfanar UK country head, Noaman Al Adhami, said: “The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production. Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.

“This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, who visited Alfanar’s London HQ, said: “Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future, and Alfanar’s £2 billion investment to build the world’s biggest sustainable aviation fuel plant of its kind is a clear sign of that leadership.

“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms. Having a project of this scale built right here shows what we already know - that Teesside has the people, skills and drive to deliver groundbreaking projects like this.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lighthouse-Green-Fuels-pic-Biofuel-10-11-768x432.png,N,,2025-11-10 11:00:24.624877

The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company’s second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of 1 million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O’Hare International Airport.*

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis added.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

SAF: Part of a holistic aviation sustainability strategy

Under current fuel standards, neat—or unblended—SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.^ However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. Upping its ambition, FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.

How has policy focus evolved in your markets since the pandemic?

Location cost for airlines have increased dramatically, particularly in Austria and Germany. In Vienna, for example, the increase between 2019 and 2024 nearly reached 80%! The German aviation tax rose 25% in May 2024 and January 1, 2025, aviation security fees increased up to 50%. The excessively high fees represent the main reason why air traffic recovery massively lags other European countries. This development is extremely worrying. Connectivity is essential for economic growth. According to earlier research conducted by IATA and Oxford Economics among EU countries, a 10% increase in the level of connectivity, relative to the GDP size, can increase long-run GDP by 1.1%.

In 2013, Germany ranked first among all European countries in terms of air connectivity – that is, passenger capacity weighted by the economic importance of all served destinations. Since then, both the United Kingdom and Spain have overtaken Germany.

Austria has also slipped in recent years. In 2014 it was ranked 27th, compared to 33rd in 2024.

Switzerland – comparable in size to Austria – ranked 22nd in 2014 and 2024.

It is important to stop and reverse these negative trends. The importance of air transport for societies and economies is vital. In Germany, around 400,000 people work directly in the aviation sector, 50,000 in Austria, 66,000 in Switzerland, and 8,5000 in Luxembourg. These are impressive figures! Air transport connects the world, building important bridges to other countries and cultures. It is also critical for trade, as the rapid transport of important production goods is an indispensable location factor.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment. What updates can you provide from your markets, notably on the required sufficient availability and ‘affordable’ pricing, as well as the book and claim system?

Since 1st January 2025 there has been a blending mandate of 2% SAF in Europe. The positive message is that the airlines will fulfill this mandate, despite the challenges of SAF inaccessibility in many airports, and high prices.

Germany has always showed a penchant for eSAF. A few months back, the world’s largest Power to Liquid (PtL) plant from Ineratec opened in Frankfurt. While this is promising, its yearly kerosene production does not suffice to operate a single flight from Frankfurt to Palma de Mallorca. Regarding eSAF, availability is scarce. Regulators must not ignore this fact. In Germany, a law in place requires a PtL sub-quota from January 1, 2026. Absurdly, airlines are thus legally obliged to buy a product which practically does not exist. A few weeks ago, the Federal Ministry of the Environment informed the aviation industry that the law would not be enforced – far too late.

Switzerland is also quite active in non-fossil SAF R&D – Metafuels/Evos and Synhelion, just to name two promising projects. The country has introduced the same SAF mandates as in the European Union, effective 1st January 2026.

The Austrian fuel producer OMV produces biogenic SAF in Vienna, and are currently building a large plant in Romania, where 250,000 tons of fuel will be produced annually from 2028, the delocalization being mainly cost-driven, with overall costs in Central Europe too high.

Despite excellent research and pioneering projects, industrial scale production will not see daylight in Central Europe. A “Book and Claim” of “SAF Accounting” system would facilitate SAF purchase anywhere worldwide for our airlines. It should be politically supported and quickly introduced.

In past years, we have been witnessing increasing greenwashing measures from Governments. What actions have you or will you put in place to counter this trend?

Germany and Austria have new governments in place since spring, both of which have a much better understanding of air transport and its benefits. However, half of parliament members are new, requiring us to expose and explain this value. IATA is known for fact-based discussions and industry expertise, offering extensive data and economic reports for leading politicians and key stakeholders. This includes policy recommendations developed for Germany and Austria, where our Association plays an active role as member of the governmental SAF working groups in support of the sustainable transition.

Germany is one of the largest aviation markets in Europe, yet it has underperformed in comparison to other major ones. How do you explain it, and what can be done to address this?

The location cost increase is extremely harmful, lowering airline competitiveness. Comparing 2024 with 2019 (pre-pandemic), domestic flight connections have plummeted an astonishing 50%. Outside major hubs such as Frankfurt and Munich, the situation is even more dire, reaching declines of up to 75%! Many airlines are withdrawing their aircraft from Germany to operate from more economically favorable locations instead. This is detrimental to connectivity and mobility in the country and is already leading to job losses. Aviation bears a very high tax burden that other transport modes do not have. In 2024 alone, the aviation tax amounted to more than €2 billion Euro.

Aviation needs fewer, not more, government-induced burdens to avoid further widening the gap with the competition. Specifically, this means:

abolition of aviation taxes in Austria and Germany. More taxes mean less value creation in the countries, and the endangerment of many thousands of jobs;

reduction of air traffic management costs;

reduction of security costs and other state location costs, to reach competitive levels again.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.
Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.
The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds.","SINGAPORE, Nov 10 — Passengers departing from Singapore will soon be footing part of the bill for the country’s shift to greener skies, with a new levy of between S$1 (RM3.20) and S$41.60 to support the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), The Straits Times reported today.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced today that the charge will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from October that year.

The levy, which airlines must list as a separate line item on air tickets, will be based on flight distance and travel class — with business and first-class passengers paying up to four times more than those in economy.

For economy or premium economy travellers, the levy will range from S$1 for a flight to Bangkok to S$10.40 for one to New York. Those flying in premium cabins will pay between S$4 and S$41.60.

CAAS said the charges were lower than previously forecast due to a drop in green jet fuel prices.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.

The roll-out is timed to give airlines and travellers room to adapt, according to CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

“If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond October 1, 2026,” he said.

The fee will also not apply to transit passengers, training flights or humanitarian operations.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Despite volatile fuel prices, Han said the levy will remain fixed until the SAF target changes.

The levy will come on top of existing airport fees, bringing total charges for an economy passenger flying to New York to S$75.60 in 2026, and S$106.80 for a premium passenger.

Changi’s current S$65.20 passenger fee is set to rise gradually to S$79.20 by 2030 to help fund airport upgrades and higher operating costs.

The new charge will also apply to cargo shipments, private jets and chartered flights, with rates adjusted for aircraft size and distance.

The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds. The fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied at both of Singapore’s airports.

Under the country’s sustainable air hub blueprint launched in February 2024, the government and industry aim to cut airport emissions by 20 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.",https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2025/11/10/309079.JPG,N,,2025-11-10 09:17:07.015747

“The next generation of aviation is now real that people can see it.
The supply chain and the infrastructure around aerospace hasn’t recovered as quickly as anyone would have would have hoped.
Flying in formation At the same time, other aviation investors are clubbing together to invest in capital-heavy areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.
Sees.ai recently raised a £3.65m round from investors including Boeing and Hearst Ventures.","It is the best of times and the worst of times for aerospace innovation. On the one hand, the pace of innovation is rapid, with electric air taxis such as Joby moving closer to safety certification and drone developments accelerated by warfare. At the same time, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, still recovering from the after-effects of the covid pandemic, are working on precarious finances and are ill-placed to make heavy bets on their innovation arms.

“Aerospace is in that transformational stage,” says Nichola Bates (pictured, above), founder of XeleratedFifty, the innovation and investment group that recently spun out of aerospace company Boeing. “The next generation of aviation is now real that people can see it. We can see drones and air taxis flying around. It’s actually real. Financial investors are saying, ‘okay, now it’s ready for us’. I think we’re in that stage where these new things are growing, and there is potential to be really disruptive.”

But it is hard to focus on innovation when more immediate business issues need attention. “The recovery from covid has been a lot more difficult than expected. The supply chain and the infrastructure around aerospace hasn’t recovered as quickly as anyone would have would have hoped. All of that leads to a different focus. The fear around the bottom line becomes more acute,” says Bates.

Both JetBlue and Boeing have posted heavy losses – JetBlue reported a net loss of $208m in the first quarter of this year, while Boeing posted a loss of $11.8bn in 2024. Both companies’ innovation arms spun out to become independent operations earlier this year.

Bates took the startup accelerator and investment programme she had built at Boeing outside the organisation earlier this year, making it into a part of FiftyGroup, an investor in the industrial sector. The move came soon after JetBlue Ventures, headed by Amy Burr, spun out of US airline JetBlue, turning it into part of aviation investor Sky Leasing.

Flying in formation

At the same time, other aviation investors are clubbing together to invest in capital-heavy areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.

United Airlines Ventures set up a sustainable aviation fuel fund that has brought in money from more than 22 external investors, providing extra firepower and a measure of independence to the fund.

Another group of airlines linked to the Oneworld Alliance, including American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and International Airlines Group (IAG), parent company of British Airways, have jointly backed a $150m SAF fund that will be managed by venture capital firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

“Any individual airline’s CVC faces an uphill battle when investing in deeply technical sectors like SAF. Seed investments in this sector are completely a different proposition to something like software, they are much more capital intensive,” says Matt Ridley, director of sustainability and innovation at IAG.

“A single CVC team can’t hire 10 SAF specialists, but by investing together we can draw on a talent pool that effectively gives us that.”

Investing through an external fund run by a third party also allowed the investments in SAF, which require a long-term capital commitment, to be protected from short term priority shifts at the airlines.

“CVC investing can also be subject to pendulum swings, alternating between almost total independence and being closer to the core corporation. Having seven or eight airlines oscillating between different degrees of strategic and financial focus in the investments wouldn’t have allowed the same kind of long-term benefit. Investing through this fund insulates the decision-making on investments from those corporate swings,” says Ridley.

Taking a broader approach

While these moves — spinning out or investing together — have been responses to constrained budgets, they can also be an opportunity to broaden the scope of the investment team’s activities.

“The restrictions are gone now,” says Bates. Her team — which had a heavily hands-on approach in helping startups build and scale their businesses — had always fielded requests from companies in other sectors to deliver projects for them.

“There was such a crossover in the companies that we worked with, whether it was from the aerospace, oil and gas, or automotive sectors, we were always asked if we could do this for them. We could only do that if it was a strategic benefit to Boeing. Now we don’t have that restriction. We can work across different verticals, which is really positive.”

Bates and her team supported more than 40 startups in 14 countries while part of Boeing, including supporting Sees.ai, a company developing autonomous drone inspections for critical national infrastructure such as power lines, pipelines and railways. Sees.ai recently raised a £3.65m round from investors including Boeing and Hearst Ventures.

But now Bates is seeking to apply the model to other sectors such as energy, defence, space and shipping. “We’re looking for things that can be really transformational to these hard to disrupt industries,” she says. “The reality was that there are things that I could do at Boeing because of that profile, that platform, the access that [that brand] gives you. However, it needs to be bigger. It doesn’t happen with one organisation. It takes a community to come together, to really start pushing forward,” says Bates. “My dream for this was always that we build that neutral platform where organisations can come together.”

Benefits for outside collaborators

There are benefits, too, for the outside groups working with these corporate investors.

“For Breakthrough the benefit is that you have customers representing about a third of the 2024 SAF market in this fund and you get all the strategic benefits of that. The potential customers of SAF are all in this fund,” says Ridley.

Meanwhile, for London-headquartered Fifty Group, the addition of XeleratedFifty brings more early-stage investment capability to an organisation that has typically invested in much later-stage financing and large infrastructure projects that can take decades to realise.

“The LPs that they’re working with are all very excited about now having us support what they’re trying to do at earlier stages, helping them identify the innovation coming through. We are making sure that they’re innovative and challenging them with some of the things that we’re seeing in the portfolio. We’re holding their feet to the fire to say, here’s how the technology has changed the 10 years since you started this project,” says Bates.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/10/Nichola-Bates-airline-background.png,N,,2025-11-10 09:17:37.453657

The initiative, named Project Speedbird, represents a joint development between LanzaJet and British Airways. Fluor will recognise the undisclosed contract value in the third quarter.

Mike Alexander, group president of Project Execution at Fluor Corporation, characterised Project Speedbird as marking pivotal advancement in global efforts to decarbonise aviation. He stated that by accelerating adoption of sustainable fuel technologies, the project will help redefine the future of flight, with Fluor proud to bring engineering and design expertise to the visionary initiative.

The project will leverage LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to transform second-generation ethanol, sourced from agricultural residues and woody biomass, into sustainable aviation fuel. British Airways will utilise this SAF to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 230,000 tonnes annually, equivalent to emissions from 26,000 domestic flights.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, stated that Project Speedbird represents the next commercial-scale facility in LanzaJet’s development portfolio, working closely with British Airways. He characterised it as an important step in continued scale-up of the company’s leading sustainable fuels technology. Samartzis noted that partnering with globally recognised engineering, procurement, and construction company Fluor Corporation demonstrates commitment to highest standards in project execution.

Located in Teesside, UK, the facility will produce more than 90,000 tonnes (30 million gallons) of SAF and renewable diesel annually. The site was selected for strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and access to skilled workforce.

Front-end engineering and design establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, site layouts, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions and subsequent detailed engineering for construction. FEED work bridges conceptual design and full engineering, procurement, and construction execution, addressing technical uncertainties and refining project scope.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology converts ethanol into jet fuel through catalytic processes producing hydrocarbons meeting aviation fuel specifications. The technology’s use of second-generation ethanol derived from agricultural residues and woody biomass addresses sustainability concerns about first-generation biofuels competing with food production.

British Airways’ commitment to offtake the facility’s SAF production provides commercial foundation supporting project financing. Long-term purchase agreements from creditworthy airlines enable project developers to secure debt financing and proceed with capital-intensive facility construction.

The 230,000-tonne annual emissions reduction represents substantial carbon abatement for British Airways’ operations, supporting the airline’s decarbonisation objectives. Aviation faces limited near-term alternatives to liquid fuels, making SAF a primary pathway for emissions reduction whilst maintaining existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Teesside’s selection reflects the region’s industrial heritage, existing energy infrastructure, port facilities, and workforce with relevant skills from petrochemical and process industries. The UK government has supported development of low-carbon industries in Teesside through various policy initiatives and funding programmes supporting industrial transformation.

The facility’s dual production of SAF and renewable diesel provides operational flexibility and revenue diversification. Renewable diesel serves road transport markets, providing additional offtake opportunities beyond aviation applications. Production processes for SAF and renewable diesel share technological similarities, enabling integrated facilities producing both products.

Project Speedbird advances UK objectives for developing domestic SAF production capacity supporting aviation sector decarbonisation whilst creating industrial jobs and supply chain opportunities. The UK government has established mandates requiring SAF blending in aviation fuel, creating policy certainty supporting production investments.

The 90,000-tonne annual SAF production capacity represents meaningful scale for European markets, where SAF availability currently falls well short of demand created by regulatory mandates and airline sustainability commitments. Commercial-scale facilities like Project Speedbird prove essential for closing this supply-demand gap.

Fluor’s role in FEED positions the engineering firm for potential EPC contract award following final investment decision, though FEED contracts don’t guarantee subsequent construction phase awards. The company’s project execution expertise in process industries supports complex facility development requiring integration of novel technologies with proven engineering practices.

LanzaJet operates the world’s first ethanol-to-SAF production facility in Georgia, United States, providing operational experience informing subsequent project development including Project Speedbird. Scaling from demonstration to multiple commercial facilities requires proven technology, experienced partners, and creditworthy offtake agreements—elements converging in the British Airways partnership.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:03.820947

The Tourism Authority of Thailand, in partnership with VietJet and PTT OR, has launched a groundbreaking Green Route flight between Bangkok and Phu Quoc, powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a significant step toward a more eco-friendly aviation sector in ASEAN. This collaboration is a direct response to the increasing global demand for sustainable travel solutions and Thailand’s ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. By introducing this SAF-powered service, Thailand is not only promoting responsible travel but also positioning itself as a regional leader in sustainable tourism. The Green Route flight aligns with the broader efforts of the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint, making this partnership a key milestone in the transition to low-carbon air travel.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has teamed up with VietJet Thailand and PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited (PTT OR) to launch the first-ever “Green Route” flight connecting Bangkok and Phu Quoc. This marks a milestone in Thailand’s aviation industry as the inaugural service on this route is powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership underscores Thailand’s commitment to advancing sustainable tourism and supporting the aviation industry’s transition towards cleaner, low-carbon operations throughout the ASEAN region.

VietJet Thailand’s move to incorporate SAF into its operations sets a significant example for the aviation industry. By launching the Green Route, the airline demonstrates its commitment to sustainability and responsible travel. The collaboration aligns with Thailand’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050 and showcases how aviation can contribute to promoting responsible tourism. With the Green Route flight, Thailand takes a meaningful step towards a low-carbon society while positioning itself as a leader in sustainable tourism in the region.

The inaugural Green Route flight took off on November 6, 2025, from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, with officials from the public and private sectors attending to mark the occasion. The ceremony included representatives from both the tourism and energy sectors, underscoring the cross-sector collaboration necessary to achieve long-term sustainability goals. By working together, these sectors are accelerating the transition to more environmentally responsible travel options.

VietJet Thailand’s Green Route flight is part of its “Fly Green” program, which aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. VietJet Thailand made history as the first low-cost carrier in the country to operate flights using SAF. The Bangkok–Phu Quoc route is the airline’s second Green Route, following the successful launch of the Bangkok–Da Nang route in 2024. This collaboration between VietJet, PTT OR, and Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services (BAFS) illustrates the airline’s long-term commitment to reducing emissions and embracing sustainable aviation practices.

The airline’s goal is to achieve a five-percent SAF blend across all its flights by 2030. The Green Route flights are a critical step toward reaching this target. Each SAF-powered flight on the Bangkok–Phu Quoc route will reduce CO₂ emissions by around 250 kilograms, resulting in a reduction of up to 80 percent in total emissions per flight. VietJet aims to cut over 153,000 tonnes of CO₂ within the next six years, contributing significantly to Thailand’s overall carbon-reduction goals.

VietJet’s Chief Executive Officer emphasized that the airline’s integration of SAF into its routine operations is a clear demonstration of its commitment to balancing business growth with environmental responsibility. He pointed out that this collaboration highlights the vital role that synergy between the aviation and energy sectors can play in accelerating the transition to greener, more sustainable travel. This initiative shows how strategic partnerships can help transform the aviation sector into a more sustainable industry, benefiting both businesses and passengers.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas. It adheres to ASTM D7566 international standards, ensuring it performs just like conventional Jet A-1 fuel without compromising on safety or efficiency. SAF offers a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, with the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thailand is well-positioned to become a leading producer of SAF due to its abundant bio-based resources and growing circular economy infrastructure. With continued public–private collaboration, the production of SAF can be scaled up to meet both national and regional carbon-reduction targets, while improving cost efficiency.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand continues to advance sustainable tourism by promoting initiatives like the Thailand Tourism Awards, CF-Hotels, and the Sustainable Tourism Acceleration Rating (STAR). These programs guide tourism operators toward adopting greener practices and reinforce TAT’s mission to position Thailand as a responsible destination for eco-conscious travelers. The Green Route initiative between VietJet and PTT OR exemplifies how cross-sector partnerships can drive sustainable mobility and help enhance Thailand’s reputation as a global leader in low-carbon tourism.

Vietnam remains one of Thailand’s most important short-haul markets, with over 600,000 Vietnamese visitors expected in 2025. Travelers from Vietnam continue to visit Thailand for its cultural, leisure, and wellness offerings. With a growing interest in new destinations, TAT aims to strengthen its presence in the Vietnamese market by continuing to collaborate with airlines and digital travel partners. This collaboration includes initiatives like the Thailand Summer Blast campaign and the Krabi Prototype project, which focus on highlighting sustainable routes and certified operators under CF-Hotels and the Thailand Tourism Awards.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand, in collaboration with VietJet and PTT OR, has launched the first SAF-powered Green Route flight between Bangkok and Phu Quoc to support Thailand’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and drive sustainable tourism in ASEAN. This initiative showcases the country’s commitment to reducing aviation emissions and promoting eco-friendly travel.

TAT’s focus on sustainable tourism not only supports Thailand’s green tourism initiatives but also strengthens its position as a trusted destination for travelers seeking responsible, low-carbon experiences. By emphasizing eco-friendly travel options like the Green Route, TAT is fostering a tourism ecosystem that contributes to the preservation of natural resources while enhancing the quality of life for both visitors and local communities. This collaboration between VietJet and PTT OR is an important step toward making sustainable travel the norm in Thailand, setting a positive example for other countries in the region.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vietjet-850x567-2.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:08.127500

At a briefing on 10 November, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said the new levy will be imposed on all passengers with tickets bought from 1 April 2026 for all flights departing from 1 October.

Singapore is the first in the world to impose a blanket levy on all departing flights, with the funds going towards bulk procurement of SAF.

The levy will cover not just passenger services but also cargo, as well as business and general aviation flights. It will also increase according to the distance travelled and cabin class of travel, states CAAS.

An economy-class (or premium economy-class) passenger travelling within Southeast Asia will pay a levy of S$1 ($0.77), while economy-class passengers travelling to the USA will pay an additional S$10.40.

Business- and first-class passengers travelling within Southeast Asia will be charged S$4, with the levy rising to S$41.60 for travel to the USA.

CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan says the levy is lower than previously indicated because the price of SAF has “moderated”.

“We are also giving time for passengers to adjust to the SAF levy,” Han says.

In 2024, the CAAS gave examples on how much the levy could cost: an economy-class passenger flying to Bangkok could pay S$3, while those flying to London could pay S$16.

For cargo flights, the levy will be imposed on shippers – instead of aircraft operators – with charges varying according to geographical distance. For example, for shipments to Northeast or South Asia, the levy stands at S$0.04 per kg.

CAAS says the levy for business and general aviation flights will be charged on a per-aircraft basis, based on distance travelled and aircraft size. Certain flights – including training and humanitarian flights – will not be subjected to the levy.

The imposition of the levy comes as Singapore targets a 1% uplift of SAF from 2026, with the aim of increasing it to between 3% and 5% in 2030.

In late-October, CAAS announced the setting up of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), a government-owned non-profit company that will oversee the acquisition and distribution of SAF, as well as implementation of the country’s SAF policies.

Han says Singapore’s procurement of SAF will be done with a fixed-cost envelopment model, where the levy – and the central funds – will be at a fixed rate regardless of the price of SAF.

Asked if the levy will be subject to regular review, Han points to the pricing model, noting: “[The] levy will be fixed in achieving this 1% [uplift] target, so we would… expect the levy to be fixed for [a] period of time. When [our uplift targets are] 3-5%… then the levy would have to be adjusted to achieve [the target].”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/6/5/113765_singaporechangiairportandjewelaugust2024_923771.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:14.005944

“We’re disappointed at the progress that has been made in relation to the production of SAF.","Such is the fundamental importance of aviation tackling its emissions that it has become commonplace for decarbonisation to dominate the agenda of ICAO’s triennial gatherings.

But the 42nd ICAO Assembly, held in Montreal over two weeks and concluding in early October, saw ­sustainability take something of a back seat to ­security, safety and geopolitical issues.

That perhaps says much about the agreements that have already been reached within ICAO, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) for aviation to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

“For the last four assemblies, it’s really been ­focused on climate change and sustainability,” says Haldane Dodd, executive director of cross-aviation industry grouping the Air Transport Action Group.

“We had CORSIA agreed in 2016, we had the long-term goal agreed in 2022. Those have all been adopted,” he adds. “We want to make sure they don’t get watered down in an assembly like this or that we don’t see any sign from governments of pulling away from that.

“And we didn’t. In fact, we saw a lot of support for the work ICAO has been doing, both on the policy framework vision-side as well as the capacity building and assistance to states to make sure they were ready to face these big challenges.”

Notably, ICAO in its post-assembly communications on sustainable development highlighted ­“unprecedented unity”, noting that all member states supported environmental resolutions without any reservations for the first time.

Both Dodd and Asia-Pacific Airlines Association director general Subhas Menon flag the ­significance of China’s approach, given it has previously ­expressed reservations related to the LTAG and CORSIA resolutions.

“They agreed to discuss with ICAO states on ­implementing CORSIA as well as the long-term ­aspirational goal,” says Menon. “They have become very much more collaborative than they were in the past. So that was a very important development, with China being such a big market.”

Menon also took encouragement from the ICAO Assembly as a whole. “There was a reaffirmation of the long-term aspirational goal, recognition that production of SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] is still not enough, and that governments will have to come up with enabling policies, as well as ensuring that the other elements of the roadmap – like technology – should also be ramped up. And [there was] a recognition that supply chain problems are also a drag when it comes to environmental goals.

“We left in a good position because China joined the party and there was recognition of some of the problems we are facing as an industry.”

However, Aoife O’Leary, founder and chief ­executive of environmental NGO Opportunity Green – which has a focus on sectors where emissions are not yet coming down – was less impressed. “The lack of acknowledgement of climate reality I found really discordant,” she says. “It’s very ‘well we have CORSIA so we couldn’t possibly push it or do anything else’, meanwhile talking down any efforts coming from anywhere else.”

Unsurprisingly, given its importance to achieving net-zero and the challenges around ramping up production, SAF remains a key concern within the industry – particularly next generation SAF solutions. States had in November 2023 at ICAO’s third Alternative Aviation Fuels meeting agreed a framework targeting a 5% reduction in emissions from aviation by 2030, with this endorsed at the assembly.

However, IATA says that while it expects SAF ­production to double this year, that will still account for less than 1% of aviation fuel. “We’re disappointed at the progress that has been made in relation to the production of SAF. It’s not where we need it to be,” IATA director general Willie Walsh said ahead of the assembly.

“The demand exists, and I think the evidence for that is the number of airlines who have entered into agreements for the future purchase of SAF. But we need to see greater production.”

One fresh development was the launch of the Finvest ETAF portal on the eve of the assembly. This is an initiative between ICAO and the International Renewable Energy Agency aimed at accelerating production of SAF by helping connect project developers with potential financers.

“The message I had for the assembly… is the urgency of setting the right policy environment for us to do the scale-up in an expedited way,” Dodd says. “I’m not massively concerned about the 2030 timeframe. My concern is more for the 2030-2050 timeframe. That scale-up is going to have to be really steep in terms of SAF supply, so the next five years are really crucial to make sure you’ve got the right policies in place to set the trajectory for where we need to get to in 2050.”

MANDATES INTRODUCED

This year has seen the start of mandates in both the EU and the UK. This has begun with a 2% SAF requirement of total fuel this year, with the threshold levels in both schemes rising – and ­crucially including initial requirements around SAF that is not produced from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), such as used cooking oil.

“This has led to a significant increase in fuel costs for airline operations in the EU and in the UK, but is not translated into a significant increase in the production of SAF,” complains Walsh.

IAG group sustainability officer Jonathon ­Counsell says: “We’re always very clear that ­mandates on their own will not deliver SAF investment. They ­create a demand signal, but you will not get ­investment on mandates alone. You do need ­complementary policy initiatives.”

South Korea in September announced the introduction of SAF requirements, which will make it mandatory for 1% of fuel on international flights to be SAF from 2027, rising to 3-5% in 2030. It is one of several countries in the region that have outlined SAF requirements. Menon though notes that such policies in Asia are “more about targets and governments coming up with the policies to provide the necessary SAF”.

INCENTIVE SCHEMES

Seoul’s SAF Blending Mandate Roadmap, for example, includes the creation of an industry-wide SAF Alliance to support development, as well as incentives and tax credits.

“We are seeing a lot more of that happening in the Asia-Pacific region,” says Menon.

CORSIA was one of the first major sustainability initiatives developed through ICAO, a global offsetting scheme agreed in the standoff when the EU pushed to include international aviation within its Emissions Trading System (ETS). When CORSIA was agreed, the EU limited the scope of aviation within its scheme to intra-European Economic Areas flights only.

Airline bodies have backed CORSIA as a means of avoiding a “patchwork” of regional schemes, but have flagged a lack of availability of CORSIA eligible emissions units (EEUs). IATA led the call for governments to issue letters of authorisation to help airlines access EEUs. IATA forecasts airlines will require between 146 and 236 million EEUs during CORSIA’s first phase from 2024-2026, but the current supply is limited to the 15.8 million credits made available by Guyana.

Environmental groups though criticise the ­effectiveness of CORSIA, which remains voluntary until 2027. Transport & Environment (T&E) and Carbon Market Watch issued analysis estimating that CORSIA will offset only 26% of EU aviation’s CO2 emissions by 2035 – because it is largely focused on aviation growth.

The effectiveness of CORSIA will come under renewed focus as the EU next year considers whether to extend the scope of aviation within its ETS to ­cover fights operating beyond Europe.

T&E and Carbon Market Watch argue that relying on CORSIA and not extending the EU ETS will cost Europe billions in lost revenues. Carbon Market Watch says its analysis shows a scope extension from 2027 could raise an extra €147 billion ($170 billion) by 2040.

ICAO says 130 states are now participating in ­CORSIA. However, that does not include key ­markets such as Brazil, China, India and Russia. And while there are more positive noises from China on ­CORSIA, there is unpredictability around the US ­approach under the Trump Administration.

Opportunity Green’s O’Leary questions whether the USA will actually implement CORSIA. “Under Trump I can’t imagine that scenario. For all the lobbying powers of airlines, I don’t think they are going to manage to get that through the US.” She says this adds to the reasons the EU should expand the scope of its ETS.

“Even though we have been talking about climate, which has been a public issue for at least 10 years, we haven’t done anything about aviation other than within Europe,” she says. “I’m hopeful that this time we might actually put international flights in the ETS. That is about a billion tonnes of CO2 a year, so a huge amount of emissions that you immediately start to regulate.”

Premium travel is also under the microscope after a group of countries, including Barbados, France and Kenya in 2023 established the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF). The task force has said it will conclude its work at November’s COP30 event in Belem, Brazil, with an announcement by its co-chairs on “options for implementing progressive international levies”.

US transportation secretary Sean Duffy, in a speech at the assembly, said that airspace was not something “to be monetised or leveraged as an economic cudgel”, adding that “new taxes and illegitimate user charges are not only at odds with ICAO principles” but would open up a domino effect of “disproportionate, unjust, or duplicative economic costs”.

These comments appear primarily directed at the GSLTF, opposition to which the USA outlined in a working paper submitted at the assembly – and which did not mention CORSIA.

Crucially, efforts to decarbonise aviation are set against political shifts in the net-zero debate, notably in the USA, whose Inflation Reduction Act policies have been lauded within the industry as a catalyst for sustainable aviation investment.

“There are some headwinds in this space and they are not just coming from governments,” says Dodd. “They are also coming from the traditional energy industry pulling back on their ­climate ­commitments. Some of the finance institutions have been pulling back on things they have been talking about on sustainability.

“We look at it from a fundamental perspective and that hasn’t changed. We know the science is telling us the climate is changing. We know as an industry we are going to continue to grow. So we need to have a response to that.”

ONGOING CONCERN

IAG’s Counsell adds: “The underlying problem doesn’t go away. This is not like a business fad. And I think it is very clear to us as a business that we will continue to address this problem. Politics is politics, it’s cyclical and we’ll ride through it. But you can’t deny the issue still needs to be resolved.”

While O’Leary is “pretty concerned” at the current political direction, she also believes these shifts are cyclical – pointing to it only being a few years since the Green Deal was the centrepiece of the European Commission legislative programme.

“For the climate, the science doesn’t change. So the longer we leave it, the worse it is. We are progressing – slowly, but surely. But we do need to speed it up,” she says. “I remain hopeful this is a phase and not a complete turn. But I guess that remains to be seen.”

How Oneworld-led initiative will fuel SAF advance

Moves led by Oneworld partners to establish an investment fund intended to kickstart development of next generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) signal that demand is there among airlines, executives say.

In September, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines announced they were cornerstone investors in the new fund, which is also supported by their Oneworld partners Cathay Pacific, IAG and Japan Airlines, plus Star Alliance member Singapore Airlines.

An initial $150 million allocation is being managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), a fund founded by Bill Gates and other business leaders to support less-pollutive energy technologies.

“[The initiative is about] making sure the next generations of technology are funded and available,” explains Oneworld director of sustainability and innovation Matt Ridley.

“This is an area Breakthrough has got 10 years’ experience of actually bringing technologies out of the university environment and then scaling them up,” he says. The airlines have already worked with BEV investments like propulsion developer ZeroAvia and SAF producer LanzaJet.

IAG group sustainability officer Jonathon Counsell points to the importance of tackling the longer-term supply of next-generation SAF, particularly given the feedstock limitations of first generation (1G) HEFA-based fuels.

“When we look out to 2050, industry targets are for around 70% SAF. It’s quite clear to us that only a relatively small proportion of that will come from 1G [SAF]. Therefore, you really do need to start catalysing development of 2G and 3G [SAF]. There’s no production of either of those anywhere today.”

Ridley adds: “I think it has already sent a message that airlines are serious about SAF, airlines are serious about backing the entrepreneurs and technologies that will bring this technology forwards.

Just as importantly, ministers drew a line: no burning food crops, only fuels from real wastes, residues or new electrofuels (e-SAFs).
The fuels industry says aviation could be the new home for UK-grown ethanol.
The UK has a real chance to lead in advanced aviation fuels, especially electrofuels made from renewable power and captured CO2.
With a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill out for consultation, now is the moment to hold the line.","For 20 years the UK government has talked itself in circles about aviation’s climate problem while emissions kept rising. When a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate was set last year, it looked like a breakthrough. From 2025, fuel suppliers must start blending in cleaner alternatives, with the share growing over time. Just as importantly, ministers drew a line: no burning food crops, only fuels from real wastes, residues or new electrofuels (e-SAFs).

This is one of the climate policies the UK can genuinely be proud of, so no wonder industry is already circling to tear it down. It aligned with public common sense: flying should be greener, but at the same time never compete with food on our plates. While protecting crops like wheat and oats from fuel tanks, it gave investors confidence that the UK was backing genuinely sustainable and advanced fuels. Brussels reached the same conclusion, banning food-based fuels – and promoting eSAFs – for exactly the same reasons.

And the kicker? It was working. In just six months, cleaner fuels hit 1.3 per cent of supply, in some months spiking to nearly 3 per cent. The 2 per cent goal for 2025 will be met without any weakening, just as car makers once claimed electric quotas were impossible, till they smashed through them under the ZEV mandate. The truth is clear: tough rules deliver.

But before the ink was even dry, parts of the aviation industry – led by the likes of British Airways and Boeing – joined forces with the oil lobby, including Shell pushing to weaken the rules by demanding inclusion of food-based biofuels. After 20 years of empty promises, the risk is clear: if the UK government bends now, real progress will be dumped in favour of greenwash in the skies. What stalls change isn’t technology; it is politicians caving in to special interests who are desperate to keep the era of fake fixes alive.

Loud voices in the aviation and fuels sector insist today’s safeguards are too rigid. They warn that sticking to genuine waste oils and residues risks bottlenecks and higher prices. They argue that letting British farmers grow crops for fuel on “marginal” land or as cover rotations would add flexibility, smooth volatility and “diversify feedstocks” until e‑fuels arrive in scale.

We’ve seen this story before. The last time governments fell for the biofuels pitch, food crops were poured into car fuel tanks and global prices skyrocketed. The World Bank and OECD highlighted the contribution of crop-based biofuels. The UN warned of food riots as millions were priced out of bread and cooking oil. Families paid the price once and the danger hasn’t gone away.

Saying, “but these would be British crops” is no defence. Markets don’t reward patriotic intentions. Even with a 19 per cent tariff, almost half the bioethanol burned on UK roads last year was imported from the US undercutting local producers. Now the UK‑US trade deal swings the door wide open to 1.4 billion litres of tariff‑free American ethanol, equal to all the road bioethanol the UK uses. The fuels industry says aviation could be the new home for UK-grown ethanol. But what’s stopping US agribusiness giants from taking over there too? Once crops are made eligible, you don’t control who floods the market. And that also risks imports from countries where biofuels drive deforestation.

This isn’t just an environmental risk – it’s an industrial one. The UK has a real chance to lead in advanced aviation fuels, especially electrofuels made from renewable power and captured CO2. Projects including those already planned in Teesside and Aberdeenshire, backed by tens of millions in government funding, could anchor hundreds of skilled jobs and boost energy security in an age of volatile geopolitics.

But all of that rests on one thing: policy certainty. Increasingly, net zero is being twisted into a weapon used by parts of industry not to drive ambition but to roll it back. The moment ministers water down the rules to make room for crop fuels, the signal to innovators is clear: don’t waste your time competing with the cheapest, dirtiest option.

This isn’t just about perception, it cuts straight to government credibility on new industries. Britain claims it wants to lead in clean technologies, pulling in global investment, creating green growth and future‑proof jobs.

If the UK blinks first and defaults to the cheapest option of burning food, it will send a simple message to investors: we’re not serious. A country that can’t defend its own cornerstone industrial policy – the SAF mandate – won’t lead the energy revolution; it will watch others seize the prize.

And while ministers preach leadership, they’re quietly signing off the biggest wave of airport expansion in decades: Gatwick’s second runway, Luton’s capacity boost, and Heathrow’s long‑debated third runway. By the 2040s, aviation is set to be the UK’s single biggest source of climate pollution. Expanding airports with one hand while weakening aviation policy with the other isn’t leadership; it’s sabotage dressed up as growth.

If ministers want Britain to lead aviation’s future, the choice couldn’t be clearer. With a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill out for consultation, now is the moment to hold the line. Why shy away from a new industrial revolution when this country has the talent and the technology to lead it? Ministers must resist pressure to dilute ambition by including outdated biofuels and instead back cutting‑ edge e‑SAF. If we want national pride, let’s earn it through being bold, energetic, and leading the way to a stronger, more prosperous future.",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/11/10/adobestock_210884092_imresizer-800x418.jpg?1762771700,N,,2025-11-10 06:16:40.361633

The release of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) by the European Commission was noted as a momentous stride in acknowledging the imperative need to accelerate the decarbonisation of air transport. This formal recognition by a key regulatory body was deemed significant, as it addressed several enduring systemic weaknesses that had been observed within the European Union’s existing aviation sustainability framework. While the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expressed welcoming sentiments regarding this progression, a clear message was simultaneously conveyed: supplementary, robust action is still considered essential for the successful achievement of the industry’s net zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal.

It has been formally stated by Willie Walsh, the Director General of IATA, that the acknowledgement of market challenges stemming from initial design flaws in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates was appreciated. Specifically, the persistent and substantial price gap between sustainable and conventional jet fuels, coupled with the need for strong, tangible investment support, were highlighted as pivotal areas where the STIP demonstrated positive recognition. The proposed extension of SAF support under the EU ETS, the consideration of tradable SAF and Book-and-Claim mechanisms, the simplification of operator reporting procedures, and the planned improvement of access to sustainability certificates through the Union Database (UDB) were all identified as constructive developments. Furthermore, the advancement of dual conformance for SAF under both EU RED and CORSIA was regarded as a crucial step toward fostering global regulatory harmonisation. The goal of this harmonisation is to ensure that fuels certified under one system can be recognised under another, thereby streamlining international operations and reducing administrative burdens for aircraft operators. This focus on global alignment is considered vital, given the inherently international nature of air transport.

Catalyzing Supply: The Urgency of SAF Book-and-Claim Mechanisms

The European Commission‘s formal recognition regarding the considerable potential of mechanisms that facilitate tradable SAF certification, including various Book-and-Claim options, was a particularly encouraging development noted by IATA. These mechanisms are explicitly intended to directly address the critical supply barrier that currently constrains SAF availability across many European airports. The challenge is primarily geographical, as SAF production facilities are not uniformly distributed across the continent, leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in distribution. The implementation of such a system is acknowledged as a vital enabler for attracting necessary investments into SAF production facilities, as it decouples the physical delivery of the fuel from the environmental claim. Investors are granted greater certainty when a mechanism exists to monetize the environmental attributes regardless of where the physical fuel is uplifted.

Market Structure: Prioritising Demand-Side Considerations

A central tenet for the successful materialisation of the STIP involves the appropriate acknowledgement of the role played by aircraft operators as the ultimate end-users of SAF. Giving due and prominent consideration to their operational and economic issues is argued to be a top priority. Airlines are the commercial driver for SAF production, and their financial viability must be protected as they take on the considerable costs of the energy transition. For aircraft operators to effectively plan the seamless integration of SAF into their daily flight operations, a market characterized by predictability and clear price transparency is an absolute requirement. This stable market environment allows for long-term planning, hedging strategies, and secure procurement contracts, which are essential given the massive capital investment cycles and high operational costs within the aviation sector.

Fuel Diversity: Ensuring Technology-Neutral SAF Support

The issue of technological neutrality in SAF production support is considered a key factor in ensuring a diversified and scalable supply across Europe. While the STIP does acknowledge the role that biofuels can play, it has been observed that the document continues to unduly prioritize e-SAF, with the primary reasoning cited being perceived feedstock constraints. E-SAF, or electro-fuel, requires significant renewable electricity and captured carbon, representing a crucial long-term pathway, but the current production capacity is limited. This specific approach is viewed with concern by the industry, which argues for a broader perspective that capitalizes on all available, certified SAF technologies.

A recent report commissioned by IATA on feedstock availability has conclusively demonstrated that Europe possesses significant untapped potential for sustainable feedstocks. This available resource base includes substantial advanced residues and various waste streams that can be ethically and efficiently converted into high-quality biofuels. Therefore, a truly technology-neutral approach—one that actively supports both biofuels and e-SAF—is deemed absolutely essential. This dual focus is necessary to maximize the full potential of all available SAF pathways, as every variant will be required if the ambitious target of 500 Mt in 2050 is to be successfully reached. Biofuels, derived from waste fats, oils, and agricultural residues, offer a more immediate scalability solution that can bridge the gap until e-SAF production reaches maturity.

Path to Net Zero: A Call for Coherent and Timely Policy

The International Air Transport Association stands prepared to engage constructively with the European Commission to methodically address the identified policy gaps. The paramount objective of this collaboration is to ensure that the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is ultimately transformed into a coherent, fully investment-ready framework that can deliver the necessary market certainty and volume of SAF required. This is a crucial partnership, as regulatory certainty is the bedrock upon which billions in private investment will be committed.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Air-Travel-8.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:16:58.805888

Pengerang Biorefinery Sdn. Bhd., a joint venture between Malaysia’s PETRONAS, Italy’s Enilive S.p.A., and Japan’s Euglena Co., Ltd, has officially broken ground on a new biorefinery complex within the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Johor. Once operational in the second half of 2028, the facility will process up to 650,000 tonnes of renewable feedstocks annually to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO), and bio-naphtha. Feedstocks will include waste oils, animal fats, and residues from vegetable oil processing.

The project positions Malaysia as a key regional hub for advanced biofuel production at a time when Southeast Asia’s aviation and transport sectors are under growing pressure to decarbonize. The refinery will leverage PIC’s strategic location near major international shipping routes to distribute biofuels efficiently across Asia.

PETRONAS Executive Vice President and Downstream CEO Datuk Sazali Hamzah described the project as central to the company’s strategy of developing a “holistic bio-based value chain,” reinforcing PETRONAS’ ambition to become an integrated energy leader by the next decade.

For Enilive, the facility extends its global biofuel footprint, which already includes biorefineries in Italy and the U.S., and projects under development in Italy and South Korea. CEO Stefano Ballista said the new site would contribute toward Enilive’s target of over 5 million tonnes of bioproducts and 2 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030.

Euglena’s President Mitsuru Izumo highlighted the venture as a milestone in the company’s broader efforts to commercialize algal biofuels and expand decarbonization solutions in the ASEAN region. He noted that the project’s evolution reflects the “rapidly changing energy landscape” and the shared goal of advancing a sustainable energy supply chain.

Located within the Pengerang Integrated Complex—Malaysia’s largest downstream oil and gas facility—the new biorefinery will benefit from established infrastructure, logistics, and feedstock supply networks. The investment underscores Malaysia’s broader push to attract green industry development while positioning Johor as a regional leader in clean fuels manufacturing.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced today that the charge will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from October that year.

The levy, which airlines must list as a separate line item on air tickets, will be based on flight distance and travel class — with business and first-class passengers paying up to four times more than those in economy.

For economy or premium economy travellers, the levy will range from S$1 for a flight to Bangkok to S$10.40 for one to New York. Those flying in premium cabins will pay between S$4 and S$41.60.

CAAS said the charges were lower than previously forecast due to a drop in green jet fuel prices.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.

The roll-out is timed to give airlines and travellers room to adapt, according to CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

“If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond October 1, 2026,” he said.

The fee will also not apply to transit passengers, training flights or humanitarian operations.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Despite volatile fuel prices, Han said the levy will remain fixed until the SAF target changes.

The levy will come on top of existing airport fees, bringing total charges for an economy passenger flying to New York to S$75.60 in 2026, and S$106.80 for a premium passenger.

Changi’s current S$65.20 passenger fee is set to rise gradually to S$79.20 by 2030 to help fund airport upgrades and higher operating costs.

The new charge will also apply to cargo shipments, private jets and chartered flights, with rates adjusted for aircraft size and distance.

The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds. The fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied at both of Singapore’s airports.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from Oct 1 that year, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced on Nov 10.

Passengers in economy or premium economy class will pay between $1 and $10.40, depending on their destination. Those who fly business or first class will pay between $4 and $41.60.

Passengers will pay the fee together with the ticket price, and airlines must state the levy amount as a distinct line item on the ticket sold.

Travellers who fly farther will pay more because longer flights consume more fuel, CAAS said.

Passengers in business or first class are set to pay up to four times more than those in economy class, CAAS said, based on industry norms for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabin classes.

To apply the levy, destinations worldwide have been grouped into four geographical bands, with the levy amount increasing with each successive band, based on distance travelled:

For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore, said CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng at a press conference on Nov 10.

A passenger in economy or premium economy will pay a levy of $1 for a flight to Bangkok (Band 1), $2.80 to Tokyo (Band 2), $6.40 to London (Band 3), and $10.40 to New York (Band 4).

These amounts are lower than initially estimated.

CAAS estimated in early 2024

that economy class passengers would incur a $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights.

This reflects the lower cost of the green jet fuel than when the initial estimates were made.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” CAAS director-general, Mr Han Kok Juan, told reporters at the press conference.

Those who fly in business or first class will incur a levy of $4 to fly to Bangkok, $11.20 to Tokyo, $25.60 to London, and $41.60 – the maximum amount – to New York.

Mr Han said the timing of the roll-out – for tickets sold from April 2026 for flights departing from October that year – is based on industry feedback, to give airlines and passengers time to adjust.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. It will also not be imposed on training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, CAAS said.

With the levy applying only to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, Mr Ng said: “If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond Oct 1, 2026.”

Levy won’t be raised, even if cost of fuel goes up

Singapore’s target is for sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

The goal is to raise this target to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030, depending on global developments and the availability of the green jet fuel , which is mostly made from waste materials, such as used cooking oil.

It has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without costly modifications.

Mr Han said the levy amount will not change even if the price of sustainable aviation fuel goes up.

The amount will be relooked only when the current 1 per cent target is adjusted in future, he added.

The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption. Such fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

Mr Ng said the volume of sustainable aviation fuel that Singapore buys will depend on the prevailing prices of such fuel. “We’ll buy what we can afford... (using) the levy we collect,” he added.

The levy amounts, said CAAS, were calculated based on the volume of fuel needed to meet Singapore’s 1 per cent target for 2026, and the projected price of the fuel.

Mr Han said on Nov 10 he is “very confident” that Singapore will be able to secure a supply of fuel to meet its 1 per cent target.

The levy will be applied on top of a total of $65.20 in fees that departing passengers who start their trips at Changi Airport already pay. This fee will go up in stages from April 2027, reaching $79.20 in April 2030 – a 21 per cent rise .

CAAS and airport operator Changi Airport Group said in November 2024 that the increase in fees is necessary to

fund infrastructural projects and offset rising costs

in areas such as energy and labour.

This means that when the levy kicks in, a passenger travelling to New York in economy or premium economy class will pay a total of $75.60 in charges in 2026 . A business or first class traveller on that flight will pay $106.80 in all.

Levy also applies to cargo shipments, chartered flights

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights – such as private jets and chartered services – departing Singapore.

The levy on cargo shipments is calculated on a per-kilogramme basis, and varies based on the distance travelled and according to the four geographical bands.

For general and business aviation flights, the levy is charged on a per-aircraft basis.

It will be determined by the aircraft’s wingspan, which serves as a proxy for aircraft size, CAAS said, and will be tiered according to the same four geographical bands.

The authority’s announcement on Nov 10 came nearly two weeks after it announced the

set-up of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company

(SAFCo), which will buy and manage a supply of sustainable aviation fuel for Singapore’s air hub.

The SAFCo will use the levy collected from passengers to buy the green jet fuel, which will be blended with traditional aviation fuel and used to refuel planes at Changi and Seletar airports.

Under Singapore’s sustainable air hub blueprint, launched in February 2024, the Republic will work with the aviation industry to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels in 2030, and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0805a512a78effad6a9ab3af9b80db68f35f0f32bf19187d6f9525ca9d41391e,N,,2025-11-10 05:16:57.626581

The levy will apply to tickets sold from Apr 1, 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after Oct 1, 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Monday (Nov 10).

This means that if a ticket is bought before Apr 1 for a flight departing after Oct 1, the levy will not apply. Likewise, if a ticket is bought after Apr 1 for a flight before Oct 1, there will be no levy.

All destinations from Singapore will be grouped into four geographical bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand

Band 4: the Americas.

Passengers travelling to Band 1 destinations will pay S$1 if travelling in an economy cabin, which includes economy class and premium economy, and S$4 for a premium cabin, which includes business class and first class.

Band 2 passengers will pay S$2.80 and S$11.20 for an economy cabin and a premium cabin, respectively.

Band 3 passengers will pay S$6.40 and S$25.60, and Band 4 passengers will pay S$10.40 and S$41.60 for an economy cabin and premium cabin respectively.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The announcement of the levy amounts comes after CAAS said last month that it had set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable and stable supply for Singapore and the region.

Levies collected from passengers will go into a fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel.

The airline will collect the levy and must display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold, said CAAS on Monday.

LEVIES COULD BE REVISED AS SUSTAINABLE FUEL TARGET SHIFTS

CAAS had estimated last year that the levy would be around S$3, S$6 and S$16 for a passenger in economy class travelling to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

The lower levy amounts announced on Monday reflect “the lower prevailing cost of sustainable aviation fuel compared to when the initial estimates were made”, said CAAS.

The levy amounts could be revised in future as Singapore’s sustainability fuel targets shift, said director-general of CAAS Han Kok Juan at a media conference on Monday.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

“When (the target) is 3 to 5 per cent, then the levy will have to be adjusted to achieve the 3 to 5 per cent,” said Mr Han.

“But insofar as we have set the target to 1 per cent (for 2026), the levy will be fixed regardless of the sale prices.”

Advertisement

He added that he expects the sustainable air fuel (SAF) levy to remain at the current level “for a few years”, before a review is done “some years down the road”.

When asked about the absolute volume of sustainable aviation fuel needed to hit the 1 per cent target, Mr Han said that the target will depend on the passenger volume for that period of time, and so an estimate cannot be provided now.

""The introduction of the SAF levy marks a major step forward in Singapore's effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,"" he said.

""It provides the mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.""

LEVIES FOR CARGO SHIPMENTS, GENERAL AND BUSINESS AVIATION FLIGHTS

A levy for cargo shipments is being set on a per kg basis and varies based on the distance travelled, following the same geographical bands as for passenger flights.

For Band 1, the levy will be 1 cent per kg, for Band 2 it is 4 cents per kg, 9 cents per kg for Band 3 and 15 cents per kg for Band 4.

The aircraft operator will collect the levy and must display the levy as a distinct line item on the air cargo contract.

For general and business aviation flights, which are civil aviation flights that operate outside of commercial airline services such as corporate aircraft and private jets, the levies are broken down according to their geographical bands and the aircraft’s size.

For example, for small aircraft such as a Cessna 404 Titan, the operator has to pay between S$40 and S$390, depending on the geographical band.

For passengers, it ranges from S$1 to S$10.40 for economy class, and S$4 to S$41.60 for business and first class.
The levies collected will go into a fund for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel or related offsets, and to cover associated administrative costs.
“For example, in 2026, if (sustainable aviation fuel) prices were to change, the levy that we’ve announced earlier will remain unchanged,” said Han.
The official announcement of the levy follows the Oct 30 establishment of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), a non-profit company wholly owned by CAAS that will be the central procurer of sustainable aviation fuel.","[SINGAPORE] The Republic’s previously-announced sustainable aviation fuel levy will kick in on Oct 1, 2026 for all passengers and cargo on commercial flights originating in Singapore.

This is applicable to tickets or services sold from April 1, 2026, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on Monday (Nov 10).

The levy varies by destination and class of travel. For passengers, it ranges from S$1 to S$10.40 for economy class, and S$4 to S$41.60 for business and first class.

For cargo, the levy ranges from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogramme.

First announced in 2024, the levy is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint for how to reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

At a media briefing on Monday, CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said: “As a global air hub and a council member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Singapore takes its environmental responsibilities seriously.

“We are taking firm, considered steps to play our part while maintaining the competitiveness of the Singapore air hub.”

The levy is higher for longer flights, as those consume more fuel. Destinations are categorised into four groups for simplicity and ease of administration, said CAAS.

For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be calculated based on the aircraft’s next immediate destination. Passengers transiting through Singapore will not face the levy.

For an economy or premium economy ticket, the levy ranges from S$1 for South-east Asia to S$10.40 for the Americas.

The levy for premium cabin travel – Business or First class – is four times that of economy class for the same area of travel. This is based on International Air Transport Association data for calculating carbon emissions of passengers in different cabins of travel, said CAAS.

These rates are lower than previous estimates by CAAS, as the price of sustainable aviation fuel has since decreased.

Airlines will collect the levy for passengers and aircraft operators will collect for cargo shipments. The levy must be displayed as a “distinct line item” in the air ticket or cargo contract, said CAAS.

Controlled cost

Besides commercial flights, the levy also applies to general and business aviation. General aviation refers to flights for private, non-commercial purposes including leisure; business aviation includes private jets or charters.

For these flights, the levy amount depends on the destination and size of the aircraft.

For example, a small aircraft like the Cessna 404 Titan flying to South-east Asia has to pay a levy of S$40, while a very large aircraft like the Airbus A380 flying to the Americas has to pay a levy of S$6,500.

Certain flights, such as training flights or those for humanitarian purposes, will not face the levy.

The levies collected will go into a fund for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel or related offsets, and to cover associated administrative costs.

Unlike green fuel mandates or incentives used elsewhere, the levy works on a “fixed cost envelope”. It has been calculated based on the price of sustainable aviation fuel needed to supply one per cent of total fuel use for flights departing from Singapore.

“For example, in 2026, if (sustainable aviation fuel) prices were to change, the levy that we’ve announced earlier will remain unchanged,” said Han.

“If the sustainable aviation fuel prices are higher than what we have estimated, what it means is that we will be achieving slightly less than the one per cent target,” he added – as less fuel can be purchased using the previously estimated levy collected.

“The fixed cost envelope approach is important because it allows us to manage the cost, and it allows us to provide certainty to aircraft operators as well as to passengers. They know how much they are paying when they buy a ticket.”

CAAS will not review the levy annually, but will do so in the future after deciding on updated sustainable aviation fuel targets, said Han.

Singapore’s one per cent target for sustainable aviation fuel will rise to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030, subject to global developments and wider adoption of the fuel, he noted.

Turkey declared its desire to host the COP31 climate talks in June 2023 and, until now, Australia has insisted it had “overwhelming” backing for its bid.","Australia and Turkey are locked in a Mexican stand-off over hosting next year’s United Nations climate change summit.

The Albanese government wants to stage COP31 in Adelaide, but Turkey’s entry as a candidate has put increasing pressure on the leaders’ segment of COP30, which starts this week in the Brazilian city of Belém, to settle on a host.

The Herald’s advice to the Albanese government: walk away now.

These climate change conferences theoretically have the serious and noble intent of saving the planet, but high-minded ideals have been swamped by a crass commercialism that exists simply to drum up investment. They have been turned into trade shows and public relations opportunities.

The COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 is a case in point. Meant to be a serious gathering of world leaders and their negotiators, it was as though hijacked by a grotesque mix of rent seekers, hangers-on and political wannabes.

The vast majority of the 30,000 attendees did not need to be there. And some who did attend displayed a remarkably tin ear for climate change, with some 400 choosing to arrive by private jet. Then Prince Charles, a longstanding campaigner for the environment, was one of them, flying in from Rome, with Buckingham Palace assuring the media that he flew on a private jet using sustainable aviation fuel.

Australia began campaigning to host the COP after the Albanese government won office. The bid has been seen as a mechanism to increase Australia’s impact on climate diplomacy and strengthen ties with Pacific neighbours threatened by climate change and courted by China. The conference also allows Labor to display its climate change credentials as the Coalition continues to bicker on the issue.

Meanwhile, The Australian Financial Review reported that hosting the COP would cost $1 billion, citing government sources, and cabinet is known to be divided on the potential benefits and costs.

Belém is the 30th conference under the UN framework convention on climate change since it was signed at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and will focus on the developing world over the next two weeks. Even if delegates manage to sort out the impasse between Australia and Turkey, it will probably be too late.

Previously, host nations have had a couple of years to organise and rally international support for the sort of outcomes they hope will flow from the conference.

Turkey declared its desire to host the COP31 climate talks in June 2023 and, until now, Australia has insisted it had “overwhelming” backing for its bid. But Canberra cannot secure hosting rights unless Turkey withdraws, and it is now being forced to recalibrate its pitch to stage the conference at five minutes to midnight.

Even if Turkey threw in the towel, the short run-up makes it difficult for Australia to adequately prepare. And without all our ducks in a row, there is potential for embarrassment.

Better to let Turkey have it. It is clearly no longer worth the cost or the effort.

The facility will use Enerkem gasification technology to produce 240 KTA of methanol

Clariant will supply catalysts for feed purification and its highly active MegaMax™ for methanol synthesis

MUNICH, November 10, 2025 - Clariant, a sustainability-focused specialty chemical company, today announced its collaboration in Repsol’s pioneering methanol plant in El Morell near Tarragona, Spain. The Ecoplanta project will be the first of its kind in Europe to convert municipal waste into renewable methanol. The facility will operate using Enerkem’s advanced waste gasification process, supported by a range of Clariant’s syngas purification catalysts and its highly active MegaMax methanol synthesis catalysts. Scheduled for completion in 2029, the plant will use 400,000 tons of non-recyclable solid municipal waste annually to produce 240,000 tons of methanol.

Georg Anfang, Vice President Syngas and Fuels at Clariant Catalysts, commented, “We are proud to collaborate with Repsol and Enerkem in the prestigious Ecoplanta project to support Europe’s energy transition. Leveraging our decades of innovations in methanol synthesis catalysts, Clariant is uniquely positioned to drive the large-scale deployment of low-carbon methanol technologies that will play a decisive role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries.”

Michel Chornet, CEO of Enerkem, added, “We are excited to contribute to the Ecoplanta project and set an inspiring example for others on the path to decarbonization. Our technology not only enables large-scale production of low-carbon methanol and the reduction of waste in landfills but also avoids substantial greenhouse gas emissions. According to estimates, abatement will be equivalent to 3.4 million tons of CO2 in the first 10 years of operation.”

Founded in 2000, Enerkem is a global technology provider enabling the production of low-carbon fuels and chemicals from waste. Its solutions tackle the challenges of waste management and decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors, such as aviation, marine transportation, chemicals and off-grid energy.

Clariant’s catalytic technologies are perfectly suited to the Ecoplanta process. After gasification of municipal waste, the trap and guard catalysts will be used to efficiently remove all types of impurities, such as metals, halogens, and sulfur species. The purified syngas will then be converted to methanol using the MegaMax series catalysts. Due to its high activity, the catalyst can optimize methanol yield while significantly reducing operating costs. MegaMax also offers enhanced selectivity, which greatly reduces the formation of by-products and thus improves the sustainability and economics of bio-methanol production.

Renewable methanol offers a highly adaptable pathway to support decarbonization across a broad range of industries. It can be utilized as a drop-in fuel for maritime and road transportation and as a feedstock for chemical and sustainable aviation fuel production.

The company is guided by its recently launched Strategy 2030, marking a full year of an ambitious plan. CEO for Asia Pacific, Ken Lee, explains that the strategy focuses on harnessing key strengths such as a robust and resilient network, deep industry know-how, and a dedicated workforce. Simultaneously, it emphasizes proactive investments in infrastructure, digital transformation, and sustainability in order to capture opportunities in high-growth sectors.

Strategic Highlights

Strategy 2030 outlines five primary areas of growth: capitalizing on geographic advantages, targeting life sciences and healthcare, focusing on new energy, bolstering e-commerce, and enhancing digital sales. Additionally, it introduces a new “fourth bottom line” aimed at making DHL the preferred choice for green logistics, reflecting the company’s commitment to leading in low-carbon logistics.

DHL’s investments in infrastructure, including expanding air hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur as well as modernizing the Air Hong Kong fleet, aim to increase resilience, enhance capacity, and offer seamless connectivity across its global network. These tangible improvements are reinforced by innovations in digital technology, robotics, automation, and strategic partnerships to increase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage and develop carbon-neutral facilities. These efforts have led to DHL being recognized as the first-ever Sustainability Advocate of the Year at the 2024 Payload Asia Awards.

Resilience amidst Global Trade Dynamics

Global trade continues to be influenced by changing supply chain patterns, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty. However, DHL maintains a robust position as a logistics leader and trade enabler, underpinned by three core strengths: a complete portfolio spanning air, road, and ocean transportation; a presence in over 220 countries and territories; and a seasoned, committed workforce.

Lee acknowledges the uncertainty of the current trade environment but stresses DHL’s ability to navigate it, citing their agility and flexibility in adapting to shifting customer demands and trade regulations. This resilience bolsters DHL’s capacity to make bold, forward-looking infrastructure investments across the region.

Expanding Hubs and Modernizing Fleet

DHL’s role as a trade facilitator involves assisting customers in expanding internationally. This necessitates a network of hubs and gateways at critical airports, backed by service centers and state-of-the-art ground facilities. In recent years, DHL has consistently invested ahead of demand to accommodate rising shipment volumes.

Significant developments include the second expansion of the Central Asia Hub in Hong Kong in 2023 to meet growing shipment demand within and outside Asia. DHL also opened an expanded gateway in Kuala Lumpur and upgraded its South Asia Hub in Singapore. These improvements cater to expected growth from e-commerce and the region’s increasing importance as a global trading partner.

Additionally, DHL has modernized its fleet, upgrading the Air Hong Kong-operated fleet with 14 new A330 freighters and retiring the older A300-600 aircraft. Lee notes that companies are increasingly requiring their suppliers to diversify sourcing options to minimize operational risks, and this is where DHL’s expertise comes into play.

Operational Excellence and Customer Flexibility

DHL’s success is not solely defined by its physical infrastructure. The company is also deeply integrating advanced digital technologies into its operations to streamline workflows, enhance service quality, and create a safer, more efficient working environment.

In warehouses, AI-based tools and robotics platforms are reducing travel distances for staff and speeding up robot integration. Automated guided vehicles transport shipments and cargo pallets safely, improving productivity while relieving employees from strenuous tasks.

The introduction of On-Demand Delivery (ODD) offers customers the flexibility to reschedule contactless deliveries at their convenience. This not only optimizes operational and cost efficiencies but also enhances the overall customer experience.

Green Logistics and Decarbonization

DHL Express’ commitment to sustainability is evident in its recognition as the first-ever Sustainability Advocate of the Year at the 2024 Payload Asia Awards. With a clear target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, DHL is advancing initiatives such as fleet electrification, carbon-neutral building design, and scaling of SAF adoption.

However, the scaling of SAF does pose its challenges. Lee acknowledges that supply has not yet reached economies of scale, which is why DHL is investing in SAF and other areas that can significantly reduce GHG emissions. DHL is also aiming to electrify two-thirds of its pickup and delivery fleet by 2030, although progress in some markets is limited due to the lack of mature charging infrastructure.

Future Growth and Employee Contribution

Looking ahead, DHL is focusing on 20 markets worldwide that exhibit strong geographic and economic advantages, two-thirds of which are in Asia. These markets are expected to benefit from increasing domestic and foreign investment, reshoring, and nearshoring strategies.

Life sciences and healthcare logistics remain a top priority, with DHL expanding its Health Logistics division and strengthening its pharmaceutical capabilities. Growth in e-commerce, particularly in emerging markets, also shows no signs of slowing down. “With more SMEs turning to e-commerce to engage more customer segments, we continue to put resources into capturing these opportunities,” Lee says.

Lee emphasizes that DHL’s ability to execute these ambitious plans relies on its people. Hence, the company offers training programs to ensure staff alignment with DHL’s culture and equips them with tools for continuous improvement. Emphasizing the importance of employee contribution, Lee encourages team members to contribute ideas and solutions, thereby fostering a sense of ownership over initiatives.

Shaping the Future of Logistics

Beyond its network, DHL engages with partners, regulators, and governments to strengthen the logistics ecosystem. Lee underscores the importance of public forums, workshops, and seminars to identify sector challenges and encourage collaboration. Despite global uncertainties, Lee remains optimistic, attributing DHL’s competitive edge to the strength of its group and its presence in many markets worldwide.

Taking to the skies in its unmistakable white and orange aircraft, EasyJet is celebrating 30 years since its first ever flight from Luton Airport to Glasgow.

Since 1995, the budget airline has massively grown its business and brand – in part thanks to the TV documentary Airline.

""Few recent moments in travel have been more important than the explosion of mass travel, brought about by the rise of budget airlines like EasyJet,"" said Cathy Adams, travel news features editor of the Times and Sunday Times.

Former EasyJet pilot George Hibberd said although the company has ""done some good by making flying a lot more accessible for the average person, unfortunately that has come at a cost"" to the climate.

So what are the airline's big milestones, and where is it heading in the coming decades?

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou founded EasyJet after carrying out research in the USA.

""I learned if you really want to make money in this area, you should start a low cost airline,"" he said.

He came up with the name by ""scribbling on a napkin"".

""I tried Stel-Air, CheapJet, Lite Jet, then the word 'Easy' came up and I thought, 'This is it',"" he said.

Making Luton Airport its base was ""a risky selection"" that paid off.

""Luton was considered in the middle of nowhere back then - we chose the cheapest of the London airports,"" he said.

Sir Stelios recalls the ""cold and wet November morning"" when EasyJet's first flight took off from Luton to Glasgow at 07:00 GMT on 10 November 1995.

At the time, the company owned one aircraft and employed 77 people.

Now it is the UK's largest airline with 356 aircraft, more than 1200 routes, and employs 19,000 staff – including 3,847 in Luton.

'Easy and simple'

Its fame grew through stunts such as the time its founder and friends boarded a rival's plane wearing EasyJet orange boiler suits, and the ITV series Airline.

""Letting the cameras in to a small airline - it was a free audience. That put EasyJet into every home in Britain,"" Sir Stelios said.

Jane Boulton, one of the stars of Airline, joked that the TV documentary led to the ""misconception that a lot of people missed their flight"".

""But it took a year to film six episodes.

""For the most part, we were having a great time with passengers – not telling people they'd missed their flight.""

She recalled the phone sales lines lighting up after each episode.

""Stelios is a very clever man, he couldn't have had a better marketing strategy,"" she said.

Ms Boulton remembers the heady days of working as EasyJet's check-in supervisor at Luton Airport.

""From the time the aircraft landed and took off again, we only had 20 minutes to get everybody off, people and bags back on, and refuel if necessary.

""Safety was always the priority. The passengers didn't know, but behind the scenes it was a hive of activity.""

She said the brand lived up to its name, as ""everything was easy and simple"".

""We didn't have printed boarding cards, we had plastic ones that we reused. It was much quicker to check in and board people.""

Ms Boulton said many other airlines were more ""prim and proper"", but EasyJet ""made it more casual"".

""We wore denim jeans and bomber jackets. I think they were the first of their kind.""

'Reshaped travel'

Cathy Adams said the rise of low-cost airlines like EasyJet had ""reshaped our expectations around travel"".

""I grew up in the EasyJet and Ryanair generation, where it was entirely normal to hop on £2.99 return flights to an obscure capital on the continent.

""Before budget carriers arrived, air travel was an elite pursuit for the very few, but now for millions it's possible to travel multiple times a year.""

MP for Luton South Rachel Hopkins agreed that cheap flights had ""made the opportunity to travel a real possibility for hardworking local people in Luton – when you could get a flight for less than a pair of Levi 501 jeans!""

Hopkins said it was ""a huge moment"" when EasyJet chose Luton as their base.

""They have grown significantly, becoming a key local employer in our town and providing thousands of job and apprenticeship opportunities,"" she added.

'Wrong flight path'

For all those celebrating, others are concerned that mass aviation has added millions of tonnes of excess carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

George Hibberd, 32, left his job as an EasyJet pilot to co-found Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers concerned about climate change.

""Aviation has connected cultures all around the world, it's a true gift.

""I'm glad it's no longer a privilege to fly, but the majority of emissions are made by a small minority of very frequent fliers.

""The direction the industry is going is on the wrong flight path,"" he said.

EasyJet emitted eight million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2024 – more than the total emissions of Albania or Sierra Leone.

It has launched a plan to reach net zero by 2050, admitting its ""operations are negatively contributing to climate change"".

However, Mr Hibberd said it relied too heavily on unproven technologies, and that planned passenger growth would cancel out any success.

""They're getting more efficient, but if you plot it against the projected growth overall, [emissions are] going up and up.""

He added that EasyJet's net zero pathway graph was ""quite misleading"".

""That downward line looks like their total emissions, but it's actually the 'emissions intensity' which is per passenger.""

Captain David Morgan, EasyJet's chief operating officer and one of their pilots, said: ""It's widely known that aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, because of the energy you need to power a commercial aeroplane.

He said the airline, which runs almost 2,000 flights per day in the summer, hopes to continue growing.

Having opened a new base in Southend in 2025, it will open ones in Newcastle and Marrakech in 2026.

""We're always looking to what's next, what places are popular - such as North Africa and Iceland. Markets are emerging all the time.

""Our mission is to be Europe's most loved airline,"" he said.

Despite U.S. market closures today, recent disclosures reveal substantial buying activity from institutional investors, signaling strong confidence in the refining corporation's prospects.

On October 23, Valero released stunning financial results for the third quarter of 2025 that substantially surpassed market projections. The company reported earnings per share of $3.66, dramatically exceeding the $3.15 consensus estimate among analysts. Revenue climbed to $32.17 billion, also well ahead of the anticipated $28.80 billion.

Market response was immediate and positive, with shares advancing 7.02 percent in pre-market trading. Net profit showed remarkable improvement, nearly tripling to $1.1 billion compared to $364 million in the same quarter last year.

Key operational highlights include:

* Refining Operations: Operating profits surged dramatically from $565 million to $1.6 billion

* Ethanol Production: Achieved record output averaging 4.6 million gallons daily

* Capacity Utilization: Refineries operated at 97 percent of their total capability

Leadership Transition Ensures Continuity

Valero announced a seamless management transition effective October 29. Homer Bhullar, previously serving as Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance, will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer starting January 1, 2026. He succeeds Jason Fraser, who will retire at year's end.

This carefully planned succession aims to maintain financial stability and strategic consistency during a period of strong operational performance.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Valero Energy?

AGF Management Ltd. increased its holdings by 15.0 percent during the second quarter

Fox Run Management and Soltis Investment Advisors established new positions in the company

Vanguard Group and Invesco Ltd. significantly expanded their existing stakes during the first quarter

This substantial institutional support raises questions about whether such backing could propel the stock to unprecedented valuation levels.

Shareholder Returns and Analyst Sentiment Remain Positive

Valero reaffirmed its commitment to shareholder returns by maintaining its quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share. Market analysts continue to express optimistic views:

Consensus Rating: ""Moderate Buy""

Average Price Target: $179.27

Currently, air and sea transport is largely fossil-fueled and accounts for more than one-quarter of all EU transport emissions. The Commission estimates that around 20 million metric tons of alternative fuels such as biofuel will be required by 2035 to meet green targets in those two sectors, which will require an extra investment of around 100 billion euros ($115 billion). The latest proposals will provide an additional 3 billion euros' worth of funding.

""The package is about strengthening Europe's competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future,"" said Apostolos Tzitzikostas, commissioner for sustainable transport and tourism. It showed, he continued, ""the Commission's firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport.

""Success will depend on close cooperation among member states, industry, financiers and civil society to turn this challenge into a strategic opportunity for Europe.""

The Euronews website reports that from 2035 onwards, EU airports should have 20 percent of their fuel supply coming from sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, which takes in products derived from things like used cooking oil or agricultural waste. Five percent needs to be another variant called eSAF, a type of synthetic fuel made from renewable electricity and others.

By the year 2050, the green share of aviation fuel should be 70 percent, of which half should be eSAF, but despite more than 40 projects of eSAF production being at various stages of planning, none is yet at a stage where a decision can be made about investment, and progress towards those targets is behind schedule.

The maritime sector is currently working towards a short-term target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 to 2025 by two percent, and by 2050, the figure is 80 percent.

Jim Corbett, the World Shipping Council's environmental director for Europe, said his group welcomed the investment, adding that it ""sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization"".

Sotiris Raptis, secretary-general of the European Community Shipowners' Associations, also responded positively, saying that the addition investment in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, or STIP, was ""putting investments in clean fuels at the center of the competitiveness agenda"", which could enable his group's decarbonizing ambitions to become reality.

""These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net-zero,"" he added.

FedEx (FDX): Valuation Through an Operations Lens After Moves in Sustainability and AI

FedEx has been busy. Early adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), upgrades to AI-driven operations, and a disciplined response to regulation are showing up in performance metrics and market sentiment.

The stock gained 9.2% in the past month and 14.9% over the last quarter. It's still down 4.4% year-to-date, but the three-year total shareholder return sits near 59.5%-clear payoff for patient holders despite short-term noise.

A widely followed view pegs fair value at $267.71 versus a recent close of $262.09-about 2.1% under. It's a tight gap, which says the market is watching execution more than headlines.

The Operating Levers Behind That Valuation

Structural cost-out: The DRIVE program targets $2.2B of savings in FY '25 and $4B versus the FY '23 baseline. That compounds into net margin gains if the cuts stick.

AI in the workflow: Smarter sortation, dispatch, ETA accuracy, and exception handling reduce rework and cost per stop. The bigger the network, the bigger the payoff from small accuracy improvements.

Sustainable aviation fuel: Early SAF adoption hedges against carbon costs and future rules. It also pressures competitors to catch up on fuel strategy and supplier contracts.

Regulatory posture: Proactive alignment with emissions and safety standards lowers surprise costs and keeps the network fluid under shifting rules.

What the Numbers Imply

Fair value marker: $267.71 vs. $262.09 suggests modest upside if cost savings flow through and volumes stabilize.

Margin setup: Structural reductions (not just headcount) are the difference between a one-off quarter and a durable reset. DRIVE points to the latter.

Sensitivity: Yields, fuel, and network utilization do most of the valuation work now. A slight miss on utilization can erase 2% quick.

Metrics Ops Leaders Should Track (and Act On)

On-time performance by lane and product (priority vs. economy).

Cost per stop and cost per piece (ground vs. air).

Sort productivity per labor hour and peak vs. off-peak variance.

Linehaul and aircraft utilization; empty miles and mix shift.

SAF blend percentage and per-gallon premium vs. conventional jet fuel.

Fuel surcharge lag and recovery rate.

Automation uptime (sorters, vision systems, robotics) and mean time to repair.

Exception rate, first-attempt delivery rate, and rework percentage.

Cycle time through major hubs and dwell time on trailers/containers.

Execution Risks (and Practical Mitigations)

Soft freight demand: Flex staffing, cross-training, and dynamic linehaul plans. Tie labor hours to real-time volume signals.

Key account churn: Quarterly ""red list"" reviews, executive coverage on top 20 contracts, and shared forecasting with customers.

AI model drift: Monitor feature drift, A/B guardrails, and rollback playbooks. Track ETA error bands, not just averages.

SAF supply and price volatility: Dual-source, long-dated contracts, and blend flexibility by lane.

Labor and safety: Ergonomics, near-miss tracking, and incentive structures that reward throughput without cutting corners.

Cyber and network resilience: Segment critical systems, run tabletop outages, and measure recovery time to SLA.

Operator Playbook: Convert Strategy Into P&L

Lock in DRIVE gains with standard work, checklists, and weekly variance reviews by site.

Put AI where it pays now: forecasting, dynamic routing, sortation sequencing, and exception prevention.

Clean the data: unique IDs, scan compliance, and event time-stamping. Bad scans cost more than slow conveyors.

Shift the air-ground mix with lane-level profitability, not averages. Kill sacred routes if they miss hurdle rates.

Stand up a control tower: one view of network health, with alerts tied to actions-not just dashboards.

Make SAF a sourcing program, not a press release. Blend targets, contracts, and unit economics in the same plan.

Why This Matters for Valuation

At a 2.1% discount to a widely cited fair value, the market is saying ""prove it."" The proof is operational: capture the $2.2B FY '25 savings, hold service levels, and keep capex disciplined.

If those hold while demand stabilizes, the spread can close. If freight stays soft or a major contract rolls off, the gap can widen fast.

What to Watch Next Quarter

Sequential change in cost per stop and sort productivity.

ETA accuracy and exception rate trend during peak windows.

Air-to-ground mix shift and utilization improvements in core lanes.

SAF blend percentage and any disclosed fuel cost deltas.

Since its introduction in the late 1990s, it has bridged the gap between the smaller 767 and the heavier 747, becoming the workhorse for major intercontinental routes. Airlines valued its balance of range, capacity, and operating efficiency, enabling nonstop links between continents with unprecedented reliability. Now, nearly three decades later, the industry is preparing to retire the type in favor of newer, more efficient successors. The question is which modern aircraft will inherit the 777-200ER’s global footprint.

The shift to these newer aircraft reflects the broader evolution of long-haul air travel. Passenger expectations have grown alongside environmental standards, forcing airlines to adopt cleaner, quieter jets. The 777-200ER set a high benchmark for dependability, but modern aviation requires higher fuel efficiency and shorter maintenance cycles. New materials, lighter structures, and digital systems now define success in this category. The following sections outline how each successor meets the needs of today’s airlines while respecting the legacy of Boeing’s original widebody workhorse.

A Legacy Of Long Range And Reliability

When Boeing introduced the 777-200ER in the late 1990s, it marked a new era of twin-engine intercontinental flight. Airlines appreciated its ability to operate ultra-long routes without relying on four-engine designs. It became a favorite for transpacific and transatlantic operations, offering impressive reliability and fuel capacity. According to Airliners.net, aviation enthusiasts and pilots consistently praised its balanced performance and ease of handling on long-range missions. This reputation solidified its place as one of Boeing’s most successful widebodies.

Over its service life, the 777-200ER was adopted by major carriers including British Airways, United, and Japan Airlines. The aircraft’s combination of high thrust and extended range allowed airlines to streamline operations and reduce fleet complexity. Passengers benefited from the cabin’s spacious layout and dependable schedules that defined early long-haul travel comfort. The aircraft’s twin-engine design became a proof point for ETOPS reliability across multiple oceanic corridors. Its commercial longevity shows how well Boeing balanced technology, performance, and passenger appeal.

Even so, aviation has moved on to a new generation of aircraft that prioritize sustainability and digital optimization. Airlines now favor widebodies that use composite materials and produce lower carbon emissions. The 777-200ER’s retirement from major fleets has opened the door for the 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A350, and upcoming 777X to take its place. Each successor continues the legacy of dependable, efficient global connectivity in a more environmentally responsible way. These new aircraft represent evolution rather than replacement.

How Airlines Are Reshaping Long-Haul Strategy

Japan Airlines recently began retiring older widebody aircraft, signaling a shift in fleet renewal dynamics. According to AeroTime, the airline’s phase-out of the 777 family underscores a shift toward lighter, composite-based models. The decision reflects how carriers are prioritizing sustainability and lower fuel burn over capacity alone. With newer types like the A350-900 and 787-9 now in service, the transition to next-generation aircraft is well underway. This modernization aligns with broader aviation trends emphasizing emissions reduction and cost efficiency.

Across major markets, airlines are blending aircraft types to match route performance more precisely. The A350 provides greater range and seating capacity, while the 787 Dreamliner excels on medium-density long-haul routes. This segmentation gives operators flexibility to adapt to changing passenger demand without overcommitting on size. It also helps reduce idle time by matching aircraft to specific missions rather than using one type for all. The strategy is part of a new era of data-driven fleet planning focused on operational optimization.

At the same time, the Boeing 777X is preparing to join fleets later this decade as the direct spiritual successor to the Boeing 777-200ER. Its advanced GE9X engines, larger windows, and folding wingtips represent a blend of innovation and heritage. Airlines expect it to handle flagship routes with higher payloads and reduced per-seat operating costs. Boeing’s new design ensures familiarity for pilots transitioning from older 777 models while offering major performance gains. For carriers loyal to Boeing, the 777X provides continuity with modern advantages.

Comparing The Successors To The Original Workhorse

Each of the three major replacements offers distinct advantages. The Airbus A350 is a clean-sheet design built almost entirely from lightweight composites, providing an immediate efficiency boost. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, while smaller, offers unmatched flexibility across medium- and long-haul networks. The Boeing 777X takes the traditional widebody concept and redefines it with state-of-the-art engine and wing technologies. According to Business Insider, both Airbus and Boeing are competing to dominate this evolving market segment.

Fuel efficiency remains the key differentiator between these models and the 777-200ER. The A350-900 offers roughly a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn compared to older 777 variants, thanks to its aerodynamic shape and efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. The 787-9 delivers similar savings through its GEnx powerplants and advanced composite fuselage. Both aircraft allow airlines to maintain long-range operations with significantly lower emissions. The upcoming 777-8 and 777-9 are expected to match or exceed these performance standards once deliveries begin.

Key Successor Aircraft To The Boeing 777-200ER

Passenger experience also plays a central role in determining which aircraft airlines choose. The A350’s cabin features higher humidity and lower cabin altitude, reducing fatigue on long journeys. The 787’s advanced lighting system and larger windows create a calmer environment, appealing to premium travelers. Boeing has integrated these lessons into the 777X, which will feature the largest windows ever installed on a commercial jet. Collectively, these innovations show how passenger comfort has become inseparable from efficiency in modern widebody design.

Technological Progress Driving Efficiency Gains

The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner showcase the benefits of composite manufacturing. Their structures weigh significantly less than traditional aluminum airframes, allowing higher payload and longer range without added fuel use. This design evolution reflects how materials science has transformed aviation over the past two decades. According to Quora, experts estimate that composites contribute up to 20 percent of total fuel savings. This improvement sets the standard for new aircraft development across the industry.

The 777X approaches efficiency differently by integrating proven materials with next-generation aerodynamics. Its folding wingtips extend the total wingspan to 235 feet while maintaining airport compatibility. This unique feature reduces drag and improves lift during cruise, resulting in direct fuel savings. The GE9X engine contributes another ten percent reduction in consumption compared to the previous GE90 series. The result is a widebody optimized for both range and performance without radical structural changes.

Both Airbus and Boeing are also focusing on digital monitoring systems to enhance efficiency throughout an aircraft’s life cycle. Sensors embedded within the A350 and 787 constantly collect performance data for predictive maintenance and route optimization. Airlines can adjust flight profiles based on real-time analysis to maximize engine health and minimize wear. These digital innovations extend component longevity and reduce downtime, further cutting operating costs. The 777X will expand on this approach when it enters commercial service later in the decade.

How Airlines Are Deploying The New Generation

The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner have already established themselves as core components of global long-haul networks. They enable airlines to operate thinner city pairs more profitably than ever before. United, Qatar Airways, and Singapore Airlines use them on routes that previously required larger 777s. This versatility has accelerated fleet transitions around the world. According to AeroTime, airlines are aligning their networks around these efficient widebodies to future-proof operations.

The 777X, though delayed, is viewed as Boeing’s flagship response to the A350’s success. Its larger capacity positions it as a perfect fit for high-density intercontinental routes. Airlines such as Emirates and Qatar Airways have placed significant orders, demonstrating confidence in their potential. The aircraft is expected to debut on long-haul routes between global hubs like Dubai, London, and Los Angeles. Its entry will mark a new chapter in Boeing’s twin-engine dominance.

Fleet strategies increasingly combine these aircraft types to cover every possible mission profile. Airlines use the 787 Dreamliner for medium-capacity services, the A350 for premium long-range markets, and the 777X for high-density flagship routes. This blended approach minimizes cost per seat while maximizing operational reach. Video analysis from YouTube highlights how carriers are matching aircraft types to passenger flows with greater precision. Together, they form a flexible and sustainable fleet ecosystem replacing the 777-200ER’s once-singular dominance.

The Continuing Legacy Of Boeing’s Twinjet Pioneer

The 777-200ER’s influence continues to shape how modern aircraft are built and marketed. Boeing’s experience designing the original 777 program laid the foundation for both the 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 777X families. Airbus likewise adopted similar principles in developing the A350, particularly around twin-engine range and cabin comfort. The aircraft that replaced the 777-200ER are therefore not competitors but successors in philosophy.

From an environmental standpoint, the 777-200ER’s retirement marks progress toward cleaner skies. The latest generation of widebodies emits far less CO₂ per seat while offering a longer range. Airlines are now focused on integrating sustainable aviation fuel and digital flight management to enhance these gains. This transition represents both the end of an iconic chapter and the beginning of a greener era in aviation. The A350, 787, and 777X embody this change perfectly.

The aviation landscape that once belonged to the 777-200ER is now shared by its advanced replacements. Each offers unique advantages tailored to specific airline strategies. Whether through the A350’s composite strength, the 787’s flexibility, or the 777X’s power, all three continue the mission. The 777 began connecting the world efficiently and reliably. The future of long-haul travel is therefore built upon its enduring legacy. Boeing’s iconic twinjet lives on through the aircraft designed to succeed it.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/the-aircraft-set-to-replace-the-iconic-boeing-777-200er.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-09 21:16:37.415144

Introduction

Over the past four decades, global economic governance has been shaped by neoliberal orthodoxy: market liberalization, deregulation, fiscal austerity, and the prioritization of investor confidence.

The Group of Twenty (G20), formed in 1999 and elevated to leaders’ level in 2008, became the key venue for coordinating these policies among the world’s largest economies. Since its elevation to a leaders’ forum in 2008, the G20 has cemented its purpose as the primary platform for crisis response and macroeconomic coordination. When financial crises threatened to engulf banks, creditors, or systemic markets, the forum mobilized trillions in fiscal stimulus and liquidity.

But assessed against a wider purpose of delivering economic justice, its shortfalls become clearer. The G20 has consistently failed to address the systemic inequities driving debt burdens, ecological collapse, and widening social insecurity. .

This assessment of the G20 record is a collaboration between the Institute for Policy Studies and our international partners: New Economics Foundation (UK), the Institute for Economic Justice (South Africa), , Transforma (Brazil), and the Centre for Economic and Social Rights (global).

First, it measures the G20’s delivery against its own stated aims of “strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.” Second, it applies an economic justice framework, testing outcomes across distributive, procedural, recognition, restorative, capability, and environmental dimensions.

Our main findings and recommendations are summarized below. You can read a more in-depth treatment — with more detail and sourcing — in the full version at the New Economics Foundation website.

Key Findings

We find the G20 unable to deliver structural reform because the forum negotiates often-divergent interests and delivers outcomes shaped by systemic asymmetries and dominant norms. Specifically:

International financial architecture reform: The G20 has reinforced the call to reform the network of rules, institutions, and practices that govern how finance flows across borders. In response to the global financial crisis in 2009, or the COVID-19 pandemic, the G20 mobilized resources at scale to provide liquidity and stabilization. However, there has been much more limited success in channeling funds to meet human development needs or to reform the governance and power relations at the heart of the system.

Debt restructuring: Since 2020, the G20 has initiated or co-convened several initiatives aimed at providing short-term relief and longer-term restructuring to countries facing unsustainable debt burdens. However, in all cases the development benefits have been weakened: approaches that favored voluntary engagement left out private creditors, and austerity policies — promoted as routes to regaining creditor confidence — left debtor nations with tight fiscal spaces.

Tax reform: Taxes became a visible G20 agenda at the London summit in 2009, when leaders declared “the era of banking secrecy is over.” But attempts to better tax large companies — the majority of whom are U.S.-registered — collapsed in the face of U.S. opposition, showing the divergent interests within the G20. Meanwhile, a 15 percent global minimum corporation tax rate risks entrenching rather than reversing the “race to the bottom.”

Climate finance: The G20 has consistently echoed but not delivered on the UN’s goals for climate finance. Finance is also heavily skewed toward mitigation in commercially attractive sectors, while adaptation and just transition remain neglected. Proposals for a global loss-and-damage fund, advanced at COP27, received limited traction among the G20 beyond political endorsements, with no binding commitments to scale resources.

Labor and employment: The place of labor and employment has had a checkered history, often relying on domestic lobbying and a show of strength from organized labor to get issues on the agenda. The response to the global financial crisis led to stimulus and job protection measures that helped avoid depression-level collapse. However, momentum faded as countries pivoted towards austerity. Sympathetic G20 presidencies have raised the visibility of pressing issues, from rights violations to precarious care and digital platform work, but delivered only fragile and uneven gains.

Questions About the G20’s Future

The G20 will continue to grapple with questions of purpose and legitimacy, of fragmented interests and uneven implementation. But its possibilities in the next 20 years will also be shaped by a changing world and how it meets these four interlinked questions:

Can it remain credible in a shifting global power order? Economic gravity is moving south and east. China and India together could account for around 35 percent of global GDP by 2040, alongside growing influence of Asian middle powers and regional blocs. Cooperation will depend on whether the G20 nurtures genuine pluralism or replicates old hierarchies.

What happens if economic rivalry gives way to direct confrontation among members? The G20’s legitimacy rests on dialogue among competing powers. Escalating conflict would transform it from a space of coordination into one of paralysis. Preventing this outcome demands reaffirming diplomacy, rebuilding trust in multilateral norms, and creating mechanisms for crisis prevention that go beyond financial contagion to address geopolitical risk.

Can leaders deliver multilateral commitments amid domestic inequalities and polarization? Inequality within G20 nations fuels political fragmentation and authoritarian resurgence. Decades of policies that stabilized markets while eroding social protection and collective mobilising power have hollowed out democratic trust.

Will the G20 redefine what constitutes a crisis? If the forum continues to treat crises solely as a threat to markets, it will remain reactive. To stay relevant, it must recognize the lived crises of our time — climate disasters, precarious work and housing conditions, disinformation, and forced migration — as structural threats to global stability.

These questions are joined by the growing structural dominance of private capital and wealth in our economies. As the world drifts toward its first trillionaire, the extreme accumulation of wealth in our global economy remains the missing variable in global economic governance across policy domains, and one which the G20 must address.

Recommendations

Nearly two decades of experience point to five principles for action:

Embed justice and sustainability in crisis coordination. Future G20 responses must integrate equity, debt sustainability, social protection, and ecological thresholds into their design. Justice metrics, such as debt-service ratios, regional vaccine access, reduced wealth concentration, and fiscal space for social investment, should become standard indicators of success. Applying these benchmarks would transform crisis management from reactive stabilization to proactive, distributive resilience.

Use soft power to shift norms toward equity. Use the G20’s power to influence narratives to reshape norms. Share priorities, indicators, and reporting cycles with UN bodies such as UNFCCC and the UN Framework Convention on Tax Cooperation (UNTC), thereby reinforcing, upholding and legitimising democratic governance.

Engage and legitimize coalitions advancing structural change. The G20’s visibility should be used to gain traction for progressive breakthroughs, which often originate outside formal decision-making structures. The Bridgetown Initiative, Jubilee debt campaigns, the UNTC, and the New Development Bank illustrate how coalitions of states and movements can pioneer new norms, policies and institutions.

Build fairer systems to enforce rules and accountability. Current frameworks remain largely voluntary. While fully binding global enforcement raises sovereignty constraints, graduated mechanisms — such as agreed creditor-participation clauses, regional arbitration panels, or collective-action frameworks — can combine feasibility with fairness.

Broaden the meaning of stability to include human and planetary security. The G20 continues to define crises through threats to financial stability. But the defining risks of this century are social and ecological: climate disruption, precarious work, and widening inequities.

If the G20 can integrate these lessons, it can move from a forum that prevents the collapse of the financial system to one that fosters human and planetary wellbeing.

“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically 2 or 3 times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up.
“For example, with sugarcane only 20 to 25 per cent of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel,” Professor Henry said.

“Working with different partners is an incredible opportunity to share ideas, expertise, and knowledge,” Dr Piperidis said.","A research hub at The University of Queensland is taking a unique approach to converting plant waste into carbon-based compounds like jet fuel.

Director of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon , Associate Professor Karine Chenu , said the team would focus on creating better inputs for processing

“Most of the research investment in this space has shown that processing plant biomass into aviation biofuels or other bioproducts is technically viable and should be done,” Dr Chenu said.

“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically 2 or 3 times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up.

“We need to make the more environmentally desirable option at a price that’s competitive.

""As processing methods are already in place, one of the Hub's main focuses is on using new scientific capabilities to improve plant biomass, making it easier to process.

“By understanding and modifying the biosynthesis and composition of plant cell walls, our team will increase the proportion of carbon that we can convert to a final product, whether that be a fuel or a biomaterial.”

Hub Chief Investigator Emeritus Professor Robert Henry said having a product that was easier to process and was cost effective and sustainable was where future gains could be made.

“For example, with sugarcane only 20 to 25 per cent of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel,” Professor Henry said.

“We want to increase that to 50 per cent, effectively doubling the amount of fuel we get from a tonne of bagasse and that would have a huge effect on the final price.

“We can see a path to producing sustainable aviation fuel at a price that’s competitive with the fossil product, which would greatly accelerate adoption.”

Launched on 10 November, the ARC Research Hub marks a significant step toward building a bio-based economy in Australia.

Its collaborative structure in partnership with industry in Australia and internationally is designed to support innovation and deliver practical outcomes.

“We have partners across the whole value chain from spatial genomics and technology companies to the farm and potential processors, and hopefully, all the way to through to flying planes,” Professor Henry said.

“That ensures we have industry input and feedback into what we’re doing, so that what we come up with is relevant and works for them.”

Sugar Research Australia Cytogeneticist and Partner Investigator, Dr Nathalie Piperidis, said SRA was proud to be working with the Hub to advance a shared vision of innovation.

“Working with different partners is an incredible opportunity to share ideas, expertise, and knowledge,” Dr Piperidis said.

“This initiative marks an important stride toward improving conversion efficiency, strengthening economic outcomes, and enhancing the sustainability of our sugarcane industry for growers and millers alike.”",https://news.uq.edu.au/sites/default/files/styles/card_image/public/2025-11/qaafi-engineering-plants-sugar-research-aust-1080.jpg?h=a81fead4&itok=oIo1rI0j,N,,2025-11-09 16:16:37.828557

Warga Sidokumpul Gresik sudah menyimpang minyak jelantah untuk ditukar menjadi uang melalui mesin UCollect Box di kampungnya.

Menyimpan jelantah untuk dimanfaatkan menjadi AFS itu merupakan bagian dari program Kampung Zero Waste di Gresik.

Kehadiran program ini menjadi aksi nyata dalam mendukung transisi energi baru terbarukan (EBT) berbasis limbah atau waste to energy.

SURYA.CO.ID, GRESIK - Jelantah atau minyak bekas penggorengan tidak lagi menjadi sampah yang mengotori lingkungan.

Bagi masyarakat Kelurahan Sidokumpul, Kabupaten Gresik, jelantah bak cairan bernilai uang ketika ditakar di mesin UCOllect Box.

UCollect Box adalah mesin penukaran minyak jelantah menjadi uang tunai. Di akhir pekan, warga berbondong-bondong menukarkan minyak jelantahnya ke mesin canggih milik perusahaan teknologi hijau Noovoleum itu.

UCOllect Box menjadi solusi inovatif yang mampu mengubah minyak jelantah menjadi energi bersih dan berkelanjutan, salah satunya sebagai bahan bakar Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) buatan Pertamina.

Warga dapat menukarkan minyak jelantah seharga Rp 6.000 per liter, langsung melalui mesin UCOllect Box yang terhubung dengan aplikasi di ponsel pintar.

Salah seorang warga, Yeti Nurhidayati mengaku senang dengan hadirnya UCOllect Box di lingkungannya. Menurutnya, minyak jelantah yang biasanya tidak terpakai kini bisa mendatangkan uang tambahan.

“Biasanya kalau tidak digunakan ya dibuang, Alhamdulillah ini bisa mendapat uang langsung lewat handphone,” kata Yeti, Minggu (9/11/2025).

Yeti mengungkap, selama dua bulan terakhir ia sudah memperoleh sekitar Rp 80.000 hasil penukaran minyak jelantah. Ia juga menilai cara penggunaannya sangat mudah melalui aplikasi.

“Pengoperasiannya gampang, pakai handphone dengan aplikasi, menuang minyak jelantah sendiri ke dalam mesin,” jelasnya.

Aer Lingus has pledged to use 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, while Ryanair has set a 12.5% target.","Hence, with the need to show leadership at COP 30, the European Commission last week adopted its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out a pivotal roadmap to rapidly accelerate the CO2 reduction in the aviation and maritime shipping sectors.

The plan responds to the consistent demands from airline and ship owners to boost investments into the production of renewable and low-carbon fuels for these sectors.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, has been lobbying the commissions for some years now for better support for the airline sector and was quick to welcome the EU plan, stating:

We welcome the commission’s recognition of market challenges that derive from SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] mandates that were flawed from the outset, particularly the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels, and the need for robust investment support.

Two key issues have frustrated the airlines: A lack of ready availability of sustainable aviation fuel and the high price of that fuel, which is roughly three to four times the price of conventional jet fuel.

In 2024, sustainable aviation fuel production reached approximately 1 million tonnes, but less than initial projections due to delays in the United States, which, under the Trump administration, is set to continue.

For 2025, production is forecast to reach 2.1m tonnes, but this is less than 1% of the global demand. Airlines will need 500m tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

EU's €2bn SAF plan

Sustainable aviation fuel is a type of low-carbon jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources like used cooking oil and agricultural waste.

It is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft without major modifications.

Sustainable aviation fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, and it is considered crucial for the aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The commission has proposed an investment of around €2bn for the production of sustainable fuels until 2027, to support shipping and airline demands.

Ireland currently does not have a sustainable aviation fuel production facility, but transport minister Darragh O’Brien has plans to rectify this and has published the sustainable aviation fuel policy roadmap.

Four policy pathways

The roadmap outlines four policy pathways: supporting production, providing market certainty, fostering collaboration, and driving sustainable aviation fuel uptake.

The minister sees opportunities to develop domestic sustainable aviation fuel production.

Initially, by co-processing at existing refineries using waste oils such as used cooking oil and tallow, which currently goes to fuel for road transport vehicles and investing in biofuels facilities that use agricultural and forestry residues.

The Government has already earmarked €750m in the budget for grid infrastructure to support renewable expansion, which could underpin large-scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

But the minister needs to proactively push through suitable grants to attract industry players to invest in the necessary facilities.

Better incentives for companies to produce sustainable fuels should be prioritised over carbon intensity target-setting for users.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair on board

Irish carriers have begun aligning with the roadmap. Aer Lingus has pledged to use 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, while Ryanair has set a 12.5% target.

Fuel accounts for nearly a third of airlines’ operating costs, making price support crucial to uptake.

The Department of Transport said the roadmap will evolve with “future iterations,” identifying barriers to sustainable aviation fuel imports and domestic production while aligning with EU frameworks.

At Cop30 the EU needs to persist in its regional efforts to decarbonise both the aviation and maritime shipping sectors, to maintain credibility and the continued focus by EU industry.

More than 40% of the global shipping fleet transits through the EU every year, which gives the EU a strong say in emissions from this sector.

The European Union’s emissions trading system now includes maritime transport and requires shipping companies to monitor, report, and pay for their greenhouse gas emissions.

But as it applies only to ships of 5,000 gross tonnage or greater, this should not be an important issue for Ireland, where ports can only take ships below this level.",https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9706/4853046_7_seoimageog_2022-05-31T111106Z_407761477_RC29IU9OQQBR_RTRMADP_3_AIRLINES-IATA_1_.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:16:30.798832

Sector experts, though, feel the country needs to resolve issues related to signing power purchase agreements (PPAs), transmission capacity and so on.

The country has added 256 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity so far, with addition of 30 GW last year and 40GW expected this year but experts say there is a need add at least 50 GW every year till 2030.

“It (capacity additions) has been good. Between 2010 to 2030, we as a country used to add 5GW; between 2020 to 24, we added 12-13 GW. Last year we added 30 GW. It has been growing,” said Praveer Sinha, managing director and CEO at Tata Power.

In FY25, Tata Power added 1 GW of renewable energy capacity, taking its total green energy portfolio to 6.87 GW, as per its FY25 annual report. Tata Power aims to have a green energy portfolio of 33 GW by 2030.

Vaishali Nigam Sinha, co-founder and chairperson, sustainability at ReNew said while the pace of renewable capacity additions may appear to be moderating in the short term, it’s important to view the country’s progress in the broader context.

“The country has already achieved 51% of its installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources and reduced emissions intensity by 36%, well ahead of several global peers,” she said.

The government’s recent issuance of 73 GW in utility-scale renewable tenders in 2024 marks a record pace and underscores its intent to accelerate deployment, she added.

Anujesh Dwivedi, partner with Deloitte said aside from tenders for solar, wind and hybrid projects, the central government is increasingly looking at different forms of procurement of renewable power from other sources to meet peak hour requirements of the discoms through firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE), where renewable sources are integrated with energy storage systems (ESS) to address the variable nature of renewable energy.

Viability gap funding (VGF) scheme for battery energy storage systems (BESS) projects, continued progress on schemes like National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules, National Green Hydrogen Mission etc will further support the achievement of 2030 target, Dwivedi said.

Pradeep Singhvi, executive director, energy & climate practice, Grant Thornton Bharat said the country is advancing a full-spectrum strategy, including carbon markets, scaling Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS), formalising a climate finance taxonomy, and pushing for climate finance that is flexible, fair and fit for purpose.

Needs for a shift

“India has achieved 50% non-fossil fuel capacity ahead of its 2030 target, that is five years early. That is a strong achievement,” said Amit Paithankar , chief executive officer at Waree Energies in a recent interview with FE. However, Paithankar said the target is now elevated, so further growth, grid modernisation, transmission upgrades and the full suite of grid-integration measures will indeed be essential.

On new thermal energy plans by the companies, he said the country’s appetite for energy is voracious, and it is growing by leaps and bounds. “In the interim, I think these are all going to be required,” he said .

Rahul Raizada, partner – climate and energy, PwC India said the 500GW target is achievable, but challenge is scale at which it is being executed. Since the country is adding 30-40 GW annually, the next phase will demand sustained additions of 50-60 GW each year, Raizada said.

“This calls for a shift from project-level execution to system-level readiness —where land, transmission, storage and markets move in sync,” Raizada said, adding key challenges lie in accelerating transmission build-out, resolving land and permitting delays, ensuring timely PPAs and scaling domestic supply chains for modules, inverters and batteries.

Financial discipline across utilities and deeper green market mechanisms will also be critical to attract continuous private capital, he said.

Intermittency and limited storage options have moderated short-term growth, while delays in contracting and softer merchant power prices have affected project viability, he said, adding, “Yet these are transitional issues. As grid modernization, storage deployment and digital integration accelerate, renewable capacity additions should regain momentum.”

Anish De, global head for energy, natural resources & chemicals (ENRC), KPMG said though the country is on track against the 500 GW target, more is desired given Indian demand growth and electrification trends.

“Biggest challenge is transmission and connectivity. Land remains a constraint in some key states.

“We want to prove that domestic waste such as used cooking oil can become a clean energy source for the future.
The government is already moving towards commercialising sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and Malaysia is expected to begin producing SAF before the end of 2025,” he added.","KOTA BHARU, Nov 9 — What many see as waste has become a breakthrough innovation for two Kelantan-born entrepreneurs who have successfully turned used cooking oil into a sustainable aviation fuel capable of powering aircraft.

Muhammad Arif Arman Suddin, 30, a former aircraft engineer, and his friend Mohammad Azhan Shamsu Anuar, 28, co-founders of Arjuna Dharma Global, have transformed discarded kitchen oil into an alternative energy source after recognising its vast potential.

Speaking to Bernama recently, Muhammad Arif Arman said his experience in the aviation industry inspired him and his partner to find innovative methods to convert waste into renewable energy.

“It took us about eight months last year to conduct extensive research and countless trial-and-error experiments to master the process of producing fuel from used cooking oil,” he said.

Armed with his engineering background and knowledge gained while studying at Universiti Kuala Lumpur, he said their perseverance finally paid off when, in February, their processed used oil began attracting interest from several aviation fuel suppliers.

Muhammad Arif Arman explained that the production process involves several rigorous stages, including fine filtration to ensure the product meets the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (ISCC CORSIA) standards.

He said the used cooking oil is collected from households, traders, and companies across the East Coast states and Perak before being filtered, weighed, and stored in tanks for further processing.

“We buy used cooking oil at between RM2.30 and RM3 per kilogramme, depending on the location. Every day, our team collects nearly 5,000 litres of used oil from several states for processing,” he said.

According to him, only oil derived from vegetable sources qualifies under ISCC CORSIA criteria, with preliminary checks made on the oil’s smell, colour, and density to ensure compliance with the required standards.

Once processed, the used cooking oil is delivered in batches of about 33,000 litres to the Fima Bulking Group in Port Klang, before being supplied to international aviation fuel companies.

“To date, our processed oil has received regular orders from several jet fuel suppliers in Amsterdam, Switzerland, and the United States.

“This fuel can only be supplied to companies certified under ISCC CORSIA, and its use has been proven to reduce carbon emissions by up to four times compared to conventional kerosene,” said Muhammad Arif Arman, adding that the venture now generates a six-figure monthly income.

He hopes more Malaysians will recognise the economic and environmental value of used cooking oil.

“We want to prove that domestic waste such as used cooking oil can become a clean energy source for the future.

He later joined Delta Air Lines in 1998 as the Vice President of Finance, before he left briefly in 2005 to serve as the CFO of Acuity Brands.
How Has Delta Air Lines Changed Under Ed Bastian's Leadership?","The key to Delta Air Lines' success in recent years has been the premium brand it has built. The carrier's identity today centers around Delta One Suites, glass doors, and a wine list created by master sommeliers that includes far too many bottles to count. The man behind that strategy, for the most part, is Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian. However, he is not sitting behind those doors as you might expect. Rather, he is often in the Main Cabin or perhaps Comfort+, where he walks the aisles and chats with flight attendants, all while quietly trying to examine what pieces of the experience are actually more valuable to customers. It is not a marketing stunt by any stretch of the imagination, but rather a part of Ed Bastian's recurrent and extremely visible leadership philosophy, which encourages Delta leaders to listen more than they talk and make decisions anchored in what frontline employees and everyday travelers actually live through on a Tuesday afternoon flight to Atlanta.

Bastian's philosophy calls for Delta's leadership team to look beyond what boardroom slides say and to what passengers actually care about. In an era when premium cabins are the principal profit engines for airlines across the board, Bastian's choice sounds somewhat counterintuitive. Nonetheless, that is exactly the point as he observes service flows, seat ergonomics, and the pain in the boarding process that is much harder to see from seat 1A. We analyze how the CEO of an airline synonymous with premium travel often flies at the back of the plane, and how his trips help inform strategy and culture. We further discuss what this reveals about Delta's competitive edge in the market.

Who Exactly Is Ed Bastian?

Ed Bastian is a career operator and financier whose path to Delta Air Lines runs through both auditing and consumer goods. A St. Bonaventure-trained accountant, Ed Bastian's career began at Price Waterhouse, where, as a young auditor, he was involved in the uncovering of a major fraud scandal at J. Water Thompson, before he moved to PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division as overseer of international finance. He later joined Delta Air Lines in 1998 as the Vice President of Finance, before he left briefly in 2005 to serve as the CFO of Acuity Brands. He later returned to the carrier just a few months later at the request of CEO Gerald Grinstein to steer Delta through bankruptcy.

In 2007, he became the airline's president and was later appointed CEO in May 2016. This mix of experiences at the carrier, which includes discipline, P&L ownership, and a front-row seat to a complex merger, alongside a turnaround under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, helps shape his style as an operator. He is known for walking the aisles and directly soliciting feedback in the Main Cabin, a choice consistent with his recurring advice that leadership should not be a popularity contest. He continues to cite Delta's people-first culture.

Under his tenure, the airline eventually doubled down on premium products and reliability while delivering (reducing the company's overall debt burden) and expanding its partnerships with other carriers, all while his center of gravity remained operational. He understands the customer, empowers employees, and keeps the carrier's overall schedule clean, all while profitability ultimately follows.

How Has Delta Air Lines Changed Under Ed Bastian's Leadership?

Since taking the helm at the carrier in 2016, Ed Bastian has steered the airline through a shift from being a large airline to a premium, reliability-led platform that features diversified earnings. From an operational perspective, Delta Air Lines rebuilt its schedule discipline and service consistency, pairing tighter operations with visible frontline engagement and faster operational recovery playbooks, all advantages that showed up during holiday travel peaks and irregular operations' resilience.

From a commercial standpoint, the airline leaned hard into overall product segmentation, with Delta One Suites and Premium Select on long-haul routes, a cleaner ladder between First, Comfort+, and the Main cabin in domestic markets. The airline also added Basic Economy to lower the fare fence for customers. Overall, network investments were matched by physical ones, including wholesale rebuilds at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and Los Angeles International (LAX), alongside new facilities at Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC). The airline also modernized its lounge network significantly under Bastian's leadership.

Ed Bastian pushed towards revenue diversification, pushing for a larger and more profitable SkyMiles ecosystem and scaling Delta TechOps as a third-party MRO business, alongside balance-sheet repair and overall pandemic-related deleveraging. He also kept the airline's refinery active in order to manage jet fuel exposure and advance Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) partnerships. The airline's culture remained a key part of its business model, though loyalty changes ultimately drew pushback and were modestly recalibrated.

A Deeper Look At Why Ed Bastian Flies Economy

Ed Bastian often chooses to travel economy because it keeps him close to the airline's real product and the trade-offs associated with it, according to a recent analysis from Fortune. Sitting mid-cabin allows Bastian to watch the entire passenger journey from end to end, including boarding order frictions, overhead bin availability, Wi-Fi stability, and seatback glitches, alongside galley bottlenecks and larger lavatory queues. He also believes that doing so maintains upgrade fairness, as he is not displacing a Medallion member or a paid premium customer when availability in the front cabin is tight, reinforcing the fact that revenue and loyalty should come first.

Ultimately, blending into a crowd reduces the observer effect, so he sees unscripted service and hears candid feedback from crews and travelers without the performance that follows an executive's name. It is, at the end of the day, a cultural signal that cost discipline starts at the top, especially during periods of peak passenger loads and irregular operations. This allows leaders to test the baseline before polishing fringe details within service.

From a practical standpoint, these aisle conversations surface into quick wins, including improved catering counts, cart flows, and app prompts, all of which can be fixed at last, all while chronic issues feed into larger cabin redesigns. Lastly, it helps build credibility with employees, as the CEO has felt a 31-inch pitch on a full Tuesday morning aircraft turn, debating seat intensity, boarding changes, and overall service pacing.

What Is Ed Bastian's Leadership Philosophy?

Ed Bastian's overall leadership philosophy is grounded in integrity and maintaining strong relationships with employees. He believes that leaders earn trust by showing up where work happens, listening to both customers and employees, and then making values-anchored decisions. This leads to his fairly simple leadership stack, which includes taking care of employees, who take care of customers, and thus the business ultimately takes care of itself under this model.

This eventually translates into visible, hands-on management, with regular station visits, ride-alongs, and open forums, all of which are paired with rigorous operational discipline surrounding safety, reliability, and overall costs. He prefers direct observation and data, building short feedback loops from crews and customers into its product, schedule, and technical choices. Bastian blends servant leadership with overall accountability, setting the bar high, equipping the carrier to clear it, celebrating team wins, and acknowledging his team's mistakes while taking accountability.

He especially values overall fairness and credibility, a key reason why he will often forgo special treatment on the road and experience the standard product himself. Culturally, he keeps purpose front and center, taking pride in service, dignity in his work, and sharing success through recognition and overall profit-sharing. The through-line is ultimately humble confidence, as he encourages leaders across the company to be present, keep promises, and let frontline truth guide overall strategy.

How Does Ed Bastian Present Delta To Investors?

Similar to his employee messaging, Ed Bastian positions Delta as a people-first business. He indicates that the carrier is a diversified premium travel platform that generates durable cash flows. He leads with operational credibility, which includes high completion factors, on-time rates, and safety protocols, all while pivoting to revenue quality, a mixed shift towards premium cabins, and continued loyalty monetization that allows the airline to outperform even when demand is relatively weak.

Delta SkyMiles and the American Express partnership are presented as capital-light moves, both of which emerge as recurring profit engines. Delta TechOps is a third-party Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) platform that adds industrial breadth for the carrier, underscoring cost and capacity discipline on its own, all while upgauging, engaging in fleet renewal, and improving productivity. The airline follows a relatively simple capital allocation ladder, one that involves investing in product and technology, all while delivering and then returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.

Bastian uses cohort-style key performance indicators and clear bridge charts from operations to margin to cash, all of which create continued investor confidence. Overall risks, including fuel, labor, weather, geopolitics, and loyalty policy risks, are all addressed by mitigants and diversified partnerships. Across the board, the airline pushes forward a consumer-friendly brand, with ambition that is only constrained by the airline's balance sheet.

What Are Our Key Takeaways?

At the end of the day, Ed Bastian's customer-friendly attitude is emblematic of how the CEO treats both his employees and those whom he sees as guests on his flight. As the leader of an airline synonymous with service, Bastian is the best example of how Delta wants to be viewed by its passengers.

The airline is the most financially successful carrier of the last decade, and for good reason. Maintaining strong relationships with passengers has been a critical part of this pursuit, and it has allowed the airline to ensure that it can command a price premium, even in competitive domestic markets.

Ultimately, Ed Bastian will leave a strong legacy at Delta Air Lines, and there is no sign that his time at the carrier is coming to an end. His ability to relate directly to customers and take their feedback into account over the years has continued to motivate his success.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/delta-air-lines-own-ceo-often-doesn-t-fly-in-premium-cabins-here-s-why.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-09 10:16:30.734766

Our net-zero target is set for 2046, aligned with our parent company Indian Oil Corporation. We’ve already charted a detailed roadmap and estimated the capital expenditure required to meet it.

The first step in this journey is energy conservation, which has already delivered substantial reductions in fuel and energy losses. Over the past two years, CPCL has been rated among Quartile One in the Solomon Index a benchmarking system for global oil companies placing us in the top tier for energy efficiency.

Our energy intensity index is very low, and we continue to introduce new conservation measures to further reduce it. Alongside these efforts, we are advancing initiatives in green hydrogen to support our long-term sustainability goals.

How is CPCL integrating circular economy ideas like waste reuse and water recovery into refinery modernization?

Water management has been a key focus for us. Over the last two years, we’ve reduced our water footprint by 20 per cent through improved operational efficiency. Our treatment and desalination plants have become significantly more efficient, thanks to continuous technology upgrades.

We’re committed to bringing our water usage down even further as part of our circular economy approach.

Refineries often face pollution concerns. What steps is CPCL taking to cut emissions and ensure transparency with local communities?

CPCL has operated in the Manali region for over 60 years. When the refinery was first built, it was far from the city. However, urbanization has now brought residential areas closer to our boundaries.

As a responsible corporate entity, we have installed world-class emission control systems and real-time stack monitoring. All emission data is shared live with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), ensuring complete transparency and accountability.

We remain deeply committed to protecting the environment and maintaining community trust.

With US President Donald Trump warning India against importing Russian crude, how could this impact CPCL’s operations or sourcing strategy?

Our crude oil requirements are fully met by our parent company, Indian Oil Corporation, which gives us a strong strategic advantage. IOCL operates on a large scale, securing better deals than any single refinery could.

CPCL also maintains operational flexibility. We can process over 160 different grades of crude. Recently, we processed new crude varieties from West Africa, the USA, and the Middle East, all with encouraging results.

This flexibility ensures that even if one source is disrupted, we can seamlessly switch to another without affecting operations.

CPCL embraced sustainability decades before it became mainstream. Was it driven by vision or necessity?

Sustainability has been part of CPCL’s DNA since inception. When our first refinery was commissioned in 1969, we already had a Sulphur Recovery Unit in place.

Over the years, every expansion has included sustainability investments from setting up a sewage reclamation plant in the 1980s to building a desalination plant later.

For the past 20 years, CPCL has operated without drawing a single drop of groundwater. All our water comes from reclaimed sewage and desalination a model of sustainable industrial practice.

What would you say to industries that still view sustainability as an expense rather than an investment?

Sustainability should never be treated as a cost. It must be built into the design stage of every growth plan.

For example, in our next expansion, instead of setting up a captive power plant, we are switching to green grid power. This approach ensures that sustainability and profitability reinforce each other.

Growth and sustainability are not separate goals; they work together. When designed right, sustainability drives innovation, efficiency, and long-term value creation for both the company and society.",https://thefederal.com/h-upload/2025/11/09/575781-cpcl-h-shankar.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 06:56:30.845645

By participating in voluntary sustainable aviation fuel initiatives, airlines can help businesses shrink their carbon footprints. Collecting feedstock for this eco-friendly fuel has the potential to create substantial socio-economic benefits in India. Airbus advocates for aligning corporate contributions to these programs within India's CSR legislation.

Voluntary sustainable aviation fuel programmes by airlines will provide a value proposition for corporates in reducing their carbon footprints, and feedstock collection for producing the fuel will also bring in collateral socio-economic benefits for India, according to a senior Airbus official.

European aircraft maker Airbus, which has a significant presence in India, has also pitched for bringing corporates' spending on the airlines' voluntary Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programmes under the government's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) framework.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) Development, Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, said a voluntary scheme for SAF will be an ""opportunity for airlines to differentiate and to propose something new to their corporate customers first, then to cargo customers and eventually to private customers"".

India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and Indian carriers have placed orders for more than 1,700 aircraft. As part of sustainability efforts, the government will soon be coming out with a SAF policy.

Live Events

Elaborating on the value proposition of having the voluntary SAF programmes, Manhes told PTI in an interview in the national capital that the idea is about selling business travel experience with not only good seats and meals but also with a ""lower carbon footprint"".

In the context of the airlines' grouping, IATA's view that SAF blending mandates without incentives is a ""no-go area"", Manhes opined that creating voluntary demand for SAF will not result in market distortion.

He observed that airlines are reluctant to opt for SAF schemes without incentives because they will incur more costs as the fuel itself comes at a higher cost.

""Voluntary demand is not a market distortion. It is an add-on,"" he noted.

India aims to have 1 per cent blending of SAF in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent blending by 2028 and 5 per cent blending by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in fuel in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

Manhes said the idea is to help airlines in India to develop a mechanism and products for voluntary SAF programmes, and then make sure that the demand materialises.

""If a corporate can fulfil its CSR obligation, even partially through SAF purchase, then the incentive is obvious,"" he added.

Under the Companies Law, a certain class of profitable corporates are required to shell out at least two per cent of their three-year average annual profit towards CSR activities in a financial year.

Manhes also said that feedstock collection for SAF will be a huge opportunity for collateral socio-economic benefits, and that applies to India like any other country.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue. Utilisation of feedstock for SAF production is also expected to help farmers increase their income.

A recent study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, said that India can emerge as a significant centre for sustainable aviation fuel production in South Asia, and the country's potential biomass feedstock for the fuel is projected to be 100 million tonnes by 2030.

""Regulations, targets, mandates, whatever you call it, will not get us to where we need to be to reach net zero in 2050... You need voluntary demands, "" he emphasised. PTI

For the first time in its history of three decades – the first COP was held in 1995 in Berlin – this year’s COP30 will be held without US participation.

The White House had announced on October 31 that no high-level representatives would go to COP30 – to indicate its hostility to climate mitigation. When the two-day leaders’ meeting began on Thursday (November 6) to set the tone for the summit to follow, the world’s most powerful and polluting countries – the US, China, India and Russia – were missing.

The US’s fossil fuel pivot

In fact, not only did the US not send anyone, but top US officials were in Greece with fossil fuel giant Exxon Mobil on the same day (November 6), and they signed a new deal to explore offshore for natural gas (fossil fuel), expanding the US's footprint in the eastern Mediterranean.

US President Donald Trump signed a deal with Pakistan in July to explore the latter’s oil reserves and taunted India at the time that they might be “selling oil to India someday!”

What is more ominous is that Trump is on a roll, dictating global economic and trade order. A climate denier who calls climate change a “hoax”, “con job”, and a “scam”, Trump shouted “drill, baby drill” to US oil companies from the day he assumed office. He threatened world leaders at the UN summit in September this year: “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail”.

This is no empty threat. Trump arm-twisted the European Union to exempt 90 per cent of US companies from the carbon tax (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism or CBAM) in the trade treaty signed earlier in the year – and the European Parliament duly approved it with overwhelming 564-20 votes in May, 2025.

Trump has taken several measures to stop climate mitigation in the US and globally. In his very first executive order of January 20, 2025, he unleashed the US fossil fuel industry by rolling back environmental protections.

Since then, the US has withdrawn from the COP commitments, teamed up with other oil-producing countries to oppose global plastics treaty, compel Europe to give up or weaken carbon laws, killed the first-ever proposed global fee on shipping industry to curb emissions and a recent proposal the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has sought to end US polluting industries from mandatory disclosure of pollution data, etc.

Without the backing of the US and its hold over the EU, the UK and other developed nations, the COP30 summit is unlikely to make any progress.

Unmet finance and tech transfers

The kind of transformative changes COPs fight for – although with very limited success, as would be clear soon – require huge financing and technology transfers to enable developing countries to transition to green energy, from cheaper fossil fuels. Developing nations have been fighting for such assistance with very little gain.

For one, at COP15 in 2009, developed economies pledged $100 billion a year of finance, but the actual flow remained much lower for most of the time. The UNFCCC’s latest update says, developed countries “met this goal for the first time” in 2022, providing $115.8 billion.

But here is the rub. The UNFCCC added: “However, only a small share of the total went to low-income countries and only about a quarter to Africa. Loans made up the largest funding category, mainly going to middle-income countries.

At COP29 (November 2024), developing countries had sought to raise it to $1.3 trillion – backed by an OECD expert group’s finding of the actual need. Developed countries agreed to $300 billion. It remains to be seen how much fund flow actually happens.

Underwhelming technology transfers

For another, technology transfers have been underwhelming. India’s fourth biennial update report (BUR) to the UNFCCC in December 2024 said such transfers were “slow” and “intellectual property rights (IPR) hinder the rapid adoption of these technologies”.

Also Read: Trump’s 50 pc tariff set to hit UP’s silk, carpet and brassware industries

The underlying logic for seeking funds and technology transfers from developed nations is that they are primarily responsible for climate change and are obliged to help developing nations to fight climate change – as their dependence on cheap fossil fuel resources is far greater and so is the need to raise the living standards of their people. Development and growth call for higher energy consumption.

Bank finance to fossil fuel soar

Here it gets even murkier. According to the Banking on Climate Chaos report of June 2025, brought out by climate activists from across the world, involving 480 organisations in 69 countries, who track climate finance: “In 2024, global banks walked back many of those climate pledges and significantly increased their fossil fuel financing, including ramping up finance for fossil fuel expansion.” It adds: “Since 2021, global banks have financed $1.6 trillion USD to fossil fuel expansion companies”.

This is a major setback to the “Net Zero Bank Alliance (NZBA)” formed by global banks in 2021, pledging a united fight against climate change with the support of the UNEP’s Finance Initiative.

Indian banks up financing coal mining and plants

Despite India’s push for renewable energy and a net-zero target for 2070, its banks have ramped up investment in fossil fuels, particularly in coal.

According to Bengaluru-based Climate Risk Horizons’ June 2025 report, ""Stuck in the past: Coal ties hinder Indian banks' energy transition"", Indian banks invested $29 billion during 2016-2023 in coal alone. It said, “most Indian banks remain heavily exposed to carbon-intensive sectors, with approximately 25–35 per cent of their loan books (as of October 2023) tied to coal”.

It gave a breakdown: “From January 2016 to December 2023, Indian banks disbursed approximately USD 15,218 million in coal loans and provided USD 13,560.4 million in coal underwriting services. Roughly 2.3 per cent of total global coal financing between 2021 to 2023 came from India, making it one of the top 7 countries contributing to coal financing during this period.”

On October 30, the coal ministry put 41 coal mines to auction; it privatised coal mining in 2020. In the past 11 years since 2014, 12 rounds of auction have opened up 150 mines. On May 26, 2025, Union Coal Minister G Krishna Reddy wrote in a business daily, the coal production went up by 70 per cent during these 11 years and was expected to make a record production of over 1 billion tonnes in FY25.

The Prime Minister shared this article on X with the following comment: “Union Minister Shri @kishanreddybjp traces the coal sector's journey from inefficiency to impact. An insightful piece on India's unprecedented rise under the government's decade of transformative governance!”

India aims to add 80 GW of coal-fired power plants by FY32, of which 41 GW would be Adani Power.

Predictable consequences

The consequences are predictable. Global temperature and GHG emissions make record highs.

Despite the 29 rounds of COPs, climate change is worsening by the day, pointing to its ineffectiveness.

The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) confirmed on January 10, 2025, that 2024 was the “warmest year on record” – that is, since 1850.

It said: “We have likely seen the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5°C above the 1850-1900 average”, adding, “the past ten years 2015-2024 are the ten warmest years on record”.

Before that, in January 2024, a NASA report had said, 2023 was the warmest year in recorded history when the temperature went up by 1.2°C above the average for 1951-1980. The Banking on Climate Chaos report of 2025, mentioned earlier, said 2023 witnessed “record-breaking greenhouse gas (GHG) levels”. Extreme temperature and GHG emissions contribute to the rise in frequency and severity of extreme weather events – killing people, livestock, destroying houses and crops across the globe.

Extreme weather killing millions

A 2020 report by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNODRR) said, during 2000-2019, 7,348 major disasters claimed 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion), resulting in $2.97 trillion in global economic losses.

This was a sharp rise from the previous 20 years of 1980-1999, which saw 4,212 disasters claiming 1.19 million lives and affecting 3.25 billion people, resulting in $1.63 trillion in economic losses.

The Indian story

In India, the story is not different. The MoSPI’s Envistats India 2025 report, released on June 5, 2025, said: “The annual mean temperature increased from 25.05°C in 2001 to 25.74°C in 2024. Similarly, the annual minimum and maximum temperatures rose from 19.32°C to 20.24°C and 30.78°C to 31.25°,C respectively, during the same period.”

Its data shows, in FY25 alone, extreme weather events killed 3.080 humans and 61,960 cattle, damaged 3.6 lakh houses and 14.2 lakh hectare cropped areas. In the past 11 years (from FY15), the numbers are humongous: 22,009, 7.4 lakh, 75 lakh and 420.68 lakh hectares, respectively.

COP30's agenda of action

Coming back to the COP30 summit to start from November 10, its “action agenda” is “to inaugurate a framework capable of mobilising all actors and efforts to accelerate the implementation of what has already been negotiated, based on the results of the first Global Stocktake (GST-1)”.

The GST-1 is the (COP21) Paris Agreement’s tool that assesses progress in achieving its goals and guides a global action plan in a five-year cycle. The agenda note says the COP30 Presidency (Brazil) proposes translating the results of the GST into six thematic pillars and 30 key objectives, which will be advanced through multiple solutions.

These six pillars are: transitioning energy, industry and transport, stewarding forests, oceans and biodiversity, transforming agriculture and food systems, building resilience for cities, infrastructure and water and fostering human and social development.

One of the key features of the GEnx engine is its environmental benefits. Designed with cutting-edge materials and advanced technologies, the GEnx offers a significant reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions, making it one of the most eco-friendly engines in the industry. Turkish Airlines will also utilize Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends on its 787 Dreamliners, further contributing to the airline’s commitment to sustainability and aligning with the aviation industry’s global targets to reduce carbon footprints and combat climate change.

Strengthening Turkish Airlines’ Position in the Global Aviation Industry

Mike Szucs, CEO of Turkish Airlines, expressed the airline’s confidence in this partnership, stating, “This agreement reflects our commitment to the long-term growth and sustainability of Turkish Airlines. By investing in modern, fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 787, we are positioning ourselves for continued success in the global aviation market, ensuring that we provide our passengers with the highest standards of service while maintaining our environmental responsibilities.”

The new agreement with GE Aerospace will also enhance Turkish Airlines’ operational efficiency, allowing it to optimize its fleet for cost-effective operations on high-demand routes and to maintain its competitive edge in an increasingly competitive market.

Expanding Turkish Airlines’ Partnership with GE Aerospace

This agreement deepens the long-standing relationship between Turkish Airlines and GE Aerospace, which has been providing advanced engine technology for the airline for many years. The GEnx engine is just one of many products that GE Aerospace has supplied to Turkish Airlines, contributing to the airline’s sustained growth and operational success.

The Role of the GEnx Engine in Turkish Airlines’ Global Expansion

The GEnx engine is GE Aerospace’s fastest-selling high-thrust engine to date, with more than 3,900 engines currently in service. It has accumulated over 69 million flight hours since its introduction, proving its reliability and performance across the globe. As the engine continues to gain traction among airlines worldwide, it plays a pivotal role in supporting **Turkish Airlines’ long-term regional growth and global expansion strategies.

The GEnx engine is particularly suited for high-capacity routes and airports with slot constraints, making it ideal for Turkish Airlines’ expansion in regions with growing travel demand. As the airline introduces more Boeing 787s into its fleet, it will continue to offer improved efficiency and reduced emissions, supporting both its business goals and sustainability objectives.

A Bright Future for Turkish Airlines: Enhancing Global Reach and Service Excellence

The deal with GE Aerospace and the addition of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Turkish Airlines’ fleet are likely to help solidify this carrier’s position further among the top carriers in the world.

Boeing will highlight a range of aircraft and innovations at the event, reflecting its deepening footprint in the area:

The flagship 777X wide-body jet is featured in Boeing’s exhibit — emphasising advanced passenger architecture.

Military and defence models such as the F-15 series, transports like the C-17 Globemaster and Chinook helicopters emphasise Boeing’s dual civilian/defence strategy.

Service-models: from parts supply, modifications, digital services and training to their ‘Cascade Climate Impact Model’ tool that visualises aviation’s footprint and sustainable options.

This blend of commercial and defence shows how Boeing sees the Middle East as more than a market — as a strategic partner in aerospace growth.

Travel Tips & Insider Pointers for Dubai Airshow Visit

If you’re planning to attend or just curious about the impact, here are some travel-tips (yes, I dragged myself out of the server farm for these):

Book early — the airshow drives heavy demand for accommodation in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and surrounding UAE. The official concierge service confirms this.

Venue access — The show is held at the purpose-built site in Dubai World Central (DWC) with dedicated transport such as shuttle buses from Expo metro stations.

Timing matters — The main event runs 17-21 Nov 2025. Plan your flights and stay accordingly. The UAE is ideally located for Asia-Europe travellers so you can combine business and leisure.

Explore beyond the show — Dubai is a major travel hub with world-class tourism infrastructure. Use the airshow as a springboard to explore the city’s attractions: from desert excursions, luxury stays to sometimes overlooked corners of the emirates.

Sustainability focus — As aviation heads toward greener operations, travellers may see new flight options and services stressing low-emission travel. It’s a smarter time to plan trips that leverage expanding connectivity.

Use the event as an opportunity: flying into the UAE during the show might give you upgraded travel experiences — but plan ahead because demand will spike.

Why Boeing’s Growth in the Middle East Matters

Let’s tie it back: Boeing’s thrust into the Middle East isn’t just about selling more planes. It’s about shaping regional aviation ecosystems. For the UAE and neighbouring countries, this brings:

Jobs and skill-development around aircraft services, defence systems, digital mobility.

Enhanced connectivity and tourism flows — meaning travellers benefit.

Sustainability and innovation trajectories being accelerated: once fringe ideas like hydrogen or SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) are mainstream topics at the show.

When a company like Boeing invests heavily in a region, the effect ripples: from airports to airlines, from hotels to tourism routes. For you, the traveller, the takeaway is flight-choice, comfort, and horizon-broadening.

Final Take-Off

The Boeing-Middle East link at Dubai Airshow 2025 signals more than industry growth — it flags a transport and tourism transformation. If you fly, explore, or move through the UAE and neighbouring hubs, what Boeing and the region are building now means better flights, more routes and evolving travel possibilities.

Singapore and Australia have a $13 billion opportunity in sustainable aviation fuel, but time is running out due to the need for urgent investments, regulatory action, and infrastructure development to stay ahead of global competition.","Singapore and Australia stand on the brink of a groundbreaking opportunity in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a projected market worth $13 billion. However, the window for capitalizing on this chance is closing fast. As the global aviation industry shifts toward greener practices, the race to secure SAF production and supply chains is intensifying. Both nations, with their strategic locations and strong aviation sectors, could be key players in this transformation. Yet, the urgency lies in the need for swift regulatory action, investments in infrastructure, and the alignment of industry stakeholders to prevent falling behind as competitors ramp up their SAF capabilities. Time is running out to seize this high-stakes opportunity.

Australia is at a crucial crossroads that could determine whether it capitalizes on the chance to create a $13 billion-a-year industry within just six months. However, this opportunity is at risk unless the government commits to using biofuels in aviation, according to a leading jet manufacturer.

The warning comes from a major aircraft manufacturer, which has expressed concern that without immediate government action, valuable local crops suited for biofuel production could be diverted to other countries, depriving Australia of the chance to build a homegrown sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. The jet manufacturer emphasized that this potential setback could undermine the development of an essential industry that could play a key role in both the nation’s economic future and the global fight against climate change.

The Australian government has already taken some steps toward supporting the SAF sector, with the announcement of a $1.1 billion investment in September, aimed at increasing the feedstock production necessary for sustainable aviation fuel. The government’s commitment to supporting the growth of this industry is evident, but it has indicated that the structure for production incentives will not be finalized until mid-2026, leaving the industry in a state of uncertainty. This delay could prevent the necessary investments and infrastructure from being put in place to develop a thriving SAF sector, leaving Australia lagging behind other countries in the race for cleaner aviation fuel.

Aviation leaders and industry stakeholders argue that the SAF industry offers one of the most effective ways for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions, a crucial factor in the aviation sector’s long-term sustainability. The global airline industry faces immense pressure to reduce its environmental impact, and SAF has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional jet fuel. However, without strong policy support, including a clear mandate for the use of SAF in aviation, airlines may not be able to make the transition, potentially hindering their ability to meet emissions reduction targets.

To address this challenge, the aircraft manufacturer is pushing for the Australian government to implement a SAF mandate. Such a mandate would require airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF in their fuel mix, ensuring the growth of the biofuel industry while also contributing to Australia’s carbon reduction goals. Without this mandate, the viability of the industry is uncertain, and the benefits of SAF may never fully materialize.

Research commissioned by the manufacturer, in collaboration with a major Australian airline, has shown that domestic SAF production could contribute up to $13 billion annually to Australia’s GDP by 2040. Additionally, the sector could create thousands of jobs in the feedstock supply chain, including farmers growing crops such as sugarcane and canola, as well as workers involved in the construction and operation of SAF refineries. The study also highlighted that the SAF sector could support the creation of up to 13,000 jobs directly tied to feedstock production, with another 5,000 jobs involved in building and running the necessary refining facilities. This job creation could be a significant boost to Australia’s rural economy, helping to provide new employment opportunities in regions that are currently underdeveloped or reliant on industries that are under pressure due to climate change.

Australia’s vast agricultural resources make it an ideal location for the production of SAF. The country is home to abundant crops such as sugarcane and canola, both of which can be used as feedstock for SAF production. In fact, Australia’s sugarcane production has the potential to become a major driver of the SAF sector, as this crop can be converted into biofuel in a process that produces fewer carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. Similarly, canola, another key crop, is already being exported to European countries, where it is processed into SAF. Currently, more than 70% of Australia’s canola is sent to Europe for this purpose, where it is used to meet the growing demand for biofuels.

The potential of Australia’s SAF industry is not just a theoretical one; it is already becoming a reality in other parts of the world. In the UK, for example, a two percent SAF mandate was introduced this year, with the government planning to increase this to 10 percent by 2030. This mandate has spurred a significant increase in the production and use of SAF, as well as an influx of investments in SAF-related infrastructure. Australia could follow this example and introduce a similar mandate to ensure the long-term success of its SAF industry.

By adopting a SAF mandate and committing to biofuel use in aviation, Australia could position itself as a leader in sustainable aviation. The introduction of such policies would provide the clarity and confidence needed for businesses to invest in the necessary infrastructure and technology. It would also create a clear pathway for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and ensure a greener future for the aviation industry.

Singapore and Australia have a $13 billion opportunity in sustainable aviation fuel, but time is running out due to the need for urgent investments, regulatory action, and infrastructure development to stay ahead of global competition.

The Australian government has an important decision to make. Without a clear commitment to SAF and a mandate for its use, Australia risks missing out on the chance to create a thriving biofuel sector that could support thousands of jobs, reduce carbon emissions, and contribute billions to the economy. The time for action is now, and the government must act quickly to ensure that the country does not miss out on this critical opportunity.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flight-13.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 06:57:32.345322

Вице-министр Қайырхан Тұтқышбаев Халықаралық азаматтық авиация ұйымының (ИКАО) Еуропалық және Солтүстік Атлант аймақтық бюросының директоры Николя Ралломен авиация саласын экологиялық тұрғыдан дамыту және тұрақты авиаотынды енгізу мәселесін талқылаған.

Министрліктің хабарлауынша, Қазақстан «жасыл» экономикаға көшу бағытын ұстанып, жаңартылатын энергия көздері мен экологиялық жобаларды дамытуға ерекше мән беріп келеді. Осы бағыттағы басым міндеттердің бірі – экологиялық таза авиаотын өндіруді жолға қою.

Энергетика министрлігі бұл жобаны АҚШ-тың LanzaJet компаниясымен бірлесіп жүзеге асыруға ниетті.

Қайырхан Тұтқышбаевтың айтуынша, елдегі мұнай өңдеу зауыттары жақын арада Jet A-1 маркалы авиаотын шығаруға дайын. Бұдан бөлек, 2026–2032 жылдар аралығында отандық зауыттарда авиаотын өндірісін 1,7 млн тоннаға дейін ұлғайту көзделген.

Тұрақты авиациялық отын – жаңартылатын шикізаттан алынатын, реактивті ұшақтарға қосымша техникалық өзгеріссіз құйылатын және парниктік газдар шығарындыларын айтарлықтай азайтатын экологиялық балама отын түрі.

Қазақстан экологиялық таза авиаотын шығаруға мүдделі. Өйткені 2028 жылдан Қазақстаннан Еуропаға қатынайтын әуе компанияларына экологиялық таза авиаотын пайдалану міндеттеледі. 2024 жыл басында «ҚазМұнайГаз» сынақтан өткізіп жатқанын хабарлаған.

Early results at an existing exploration well in Sharjah have shown promise, with drilling planned for 2026 to provide detailed resource data. If proven viable, natural hydrogen could provide a low-carbon energy source for energy-intensive facilities such as data centres, bypassing storage and transport costs.

H.E. Khamis Al Mazrouei, CEO of SNOC, said the potential discovery could mark a new chapter in Sharjah’s energy landscape and strengthen its role in the national energy transition:

Under the supervision of the Ministry of Energy, the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) and EDF Power Solutions consortium signed a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement with the Saudi Power Procurement Company for the 600 MW Samtah Solar PV Power Project in Jazan Province.

Once operational in early 2028, the project will supply clean electricity to over 100,000 homes annually and avoid more than 1.1 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions each year. A significant portion of materials, equipment, and services will be sourced from Saudi companies during construction, supporting local industries and job creation.

Eng. Khalid bin Salem AlGhamdi, CEO of SEC, said the project reflects the Kingdom’s strategic commitment to expanding renewable generation and advancing Vision 2030 goals:

Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) has invited proposals for the seventh phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. This phase will add 2,000 MW of photovoltaic solar panels and a 1,400 MW battery storage system with six-hour capacity, providing 8,400 megawatt-hours of storage.

The project supports Dubai’s Clean Energy Strategy 2050 and Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050, helping the emirate achieve 100% clean energy by mid-century:

-- BERNAMA TAGS: used cooking oil, fuel, aircraft, engineer, entrepreneur","KOTA BHARU, Nov 9 (Bernama) — What many see as waste has become a breakthrough innovation for two Kelantan-born entrepreneurs who have successfully turned used cooking oil into a sustainable aviation fuel capable of powering aircraft.

Muhammad Arif Arman Suddin, 30, a former aircraft engineer, and his friend Mohammad Azhan Shamsu Anuar, 28, co-founders of Arjuna Dharma Global, transformed discarded kitchen oil into an alternative energy source after recognising its vast potential.

Speaking to Bernama recently, Muhammad Arif Arman said his experience in the aviation industry inspired them to find innovative methods to convert waste into renewable energy.

“It took us about eight months from last year to conduct extensive research and countless trial-and-error experiments to master the process of producing fuel from used cooking oil,” he said.

Armed with his engineering background and knowledge gained while studying at Universiti Kuala Lumpur, he said their perseverance finally paid off when, in February, their processed used oil began attracting interest from several aviation fuel suppliers.

ENGINEER-FUEL 2 KOTA BHARU

Muhammad Arif Arman explained that the production process involves several rigorous stages, including fine filtration to ensure the product meets the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification Corsia (ISCC CORSIA) standards.

He said the used cooking oil is collected from households, traders and companies across the East Coast states and Perak before being filtered, weighed and stored in tanks for further processing.

“We buy used cooking oil at between RM2.30 and RM3 per kilogramme, depending on the location. Every day, our team collects nearly 5,000 litres of used oil from several states for processing,” he said.

According to him, only oil derived from vegetable sources qualifies under ISCC CORSIA criteria, with preliminary checks made on the oil’s smell, colour and density to ensure compliance with required standards.

Once processed, the used cooking oil is delivered in batches of about 33,000 litres to Fima Bulking Group in Port Klang, then supplied to international aviation fuel companies.

“To date, our processed oil has received regular orders from several jet fuel suppliers in Amsterdam, Switzerland and the United States.

“This fuel can only be supplied to companies certified under ISCC CORSIA, and its use has been proven to reduce carbon emissions by up to four times compared to conventional kerosene,” said Muhammad Arif Arman, adding that the venture now generates a six-figure monthly income.

He hopes more Malaysians will recognise the economic and environmental value of used cooking oil.

“We want to prove that domestic waste such as used cooking oil can become a clean energy source for the future. The government is already moving towards commercialising Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and Malaysia is expected to begin the production of SAF before the end of 2025,” he added.

This prestigious recognition highlights Accor’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint across its extensive supply chain, focusing on three critical pillars: measuring supplier carbon maturity, reducing supply chain emissions, and promoting low-carbon suppliers. As global awareness of the environmental impact of tourism continues to rise, Accor’s initiative sets a powerful example for the industry, underscoring the growing importance of sustainable practices not only in the hospitality sector but also across the broader travel ecosystem. This achievement comes at a time when both the airline and hospitality industries are accelerating efforts to meet the demands of environmentally-conscious travelers, offering a promising future for sustainable tourism.

Accor Achieving Net Zero Together is Recognized as World’s Leading Climate Action Initiative at the 2025 World Sustainable Travel & Hospitality Awards (WSTHA)

Accor Achieving Net Zero Together recognizes the awards 2025 World Sustainable Travel & Hospitality Awards (WSTHA) as the World’s Leading Climate Action Initiative for the first time. The company netted the hospitality giant award for offering “outstanding innovative sustainability solutions geared at attaining emission balance for a hospitality supply chain”. Accor’s offering balance hospitality supply chain emissions solutions is one of the many innovative solutions the company has sustainably adapted in their hospitality units. The company netted the award for offering “outstanding innovative sustainability solutions geared at attaining emission balance for a hospitality supply chain”.

Sustainability has become a media catchphrase within the hospitality sector after Accor Achieving Net Zero Together awards, yet the growing global awareness of building sustainably has made Accor trailblazing sustainability solutions within the hospitality sector widely known. The award highlights the importance of the need and increasing use of hospitality services for carbon neutral travel, inclusive of airplane, hotel and tour services. To travel sustainably as a tourist, you should understand the relationship carbon neutral services and transportation used and the hospitality services used, especially within the airline and tourist industries.

Accor’s ‘Achieving Net Zero Together’ Campaign – A Game Changer for Sustainability in the Hospitality Industry?

Accor’s ‘Achieving Net Zero Together’ Campaign is impressive among the competition. It reached out to suppliers in the decarbonization tier. This initiative launched in 2024 is responding to the hospitality industry’s carbon emissions with a tri-fold initiative. This is focused on decarbonization carbon maturity supply chain emission reduction and finally decarbonization supply chain emission reduction and promotion of low carbon suppliers and offers.

In 2025 Accor managed to onboard over 1,000 suppliers 77% of the groups total procurement in volume. This offers a good indicator of the hospitality industry’s decarbonization emission potential to the positive global net zero. Eco-conscious travelers are experiencing the return of fully ‘green’ energy in decarbonization hotels, zero waste food, and ecologically sustainable food sourced in the vicinity of accor hotels.

Visitors concerned about the environment expect that sustainability will be considered a standard part of the hospitality experience. It does not have to be an added-on option. For instance, the Accor group of companies provides luxurious accommodations and “eco- friendly ” boutique hotels and “eco- friendly” boutique properties. Accor provides proof that tourism and its adjuncts do not have to be at odds. As tourists book more eco-friendly alternatives, Accor points the way to the rest of the industry.

Accor’s Net Zero Commitment: Setting New Standards for the Airline Industry

Accor hospitality has been a leader in the industry in implementing “decarbonization” strategies. For several reasons, the airline hospitality industry has been and continues to be the “lowest” to adopt sustainable practices. This position is changing with the Accor Group. Airlines have been slow to adopt strategies to sustain their hospitality practices, just as hotels have. The airlines simply focus on “carbon offsets” as a way to bridge the gap.

More and more travelers are presented “eco-friendly” travel packages that include sustainable flights. Emirates, Qatar, and Singapore airlines have committed to completing “carbon neutral flights” and are using greener fuel and plane technologies.

How can airlines follow Accor’s example regarding sustainable procurement? Bringing all components of their business into line with sustainable practices can make a difference. Waste reduction on flights, local sourcing of inflight meal components, and emission offsetting are all sustainable practices that can lessen the airline industry’s environmental footprint.

Travel Trends: Airlines and Hotels Work Together to Offer Sustainable Travel Options

As travelers look for sustainable travel options, cooperation between hotels and airlines is bound to increase. Hotels are responding with greener practices, like sustainable operations, eco-friendly amenities, and energy-efficient rooms, while airlines are delivering more sustainable flights with better fuel efficiency. Both British Airways and Air France have set sustainability targets and are showcasing flights that meet Accor’s initiatives, demonstrating a commitment to greener tourism.

Sustainable tourism is on the rise, and with over 25 million tourists visiting France in 2025, it is being noticed. The demand for sustainable travel is increasing, and the airlines responded by offering more direct flights to popular green destinations, while eco-friendly hotels are launching green initiatives and certification programs.

Qatar Airways has started providing more eco-friendly flights to Doha, which has fancy hotels being built to green building certification. Eco-tourists can also book these green hotels for seamless eco-friendly trips.

Sustainable Tourism for Travelers

Since tourism is growing everywhere, we must also consider the negative impacts our travels have on the environment. Accor attaining this recognition at the 2025 WSTHA is a sign that the hospitality and airline industry can work together to reduce carbon gas emissions, and more importantly, for the travelers, it means more sustainable options to choose from while planning a trip.

As for eco travelers, a few important travel tips include:

Pick eco-friendly airports or airlines: More airlines are providing eco-friendly flights. Look out for airlines that are part of CORSIA like Lufthansa, Singapore, and Air New Zealand.

Book Eco-Friendly Hotels. Accor is an example of a hotel chain that offers eco-friendly options. Practicing sustainable tourism means providing green-certified hotels that give energy-efficient accommodations, waste reduction, and renewable energy.

Offset Your Carbon Emissions. Each traveler must offset flying carbon emissions, especially long-haul ones. Contributing to projects that counter balance the impact of your trip is a common offering to most airlines.

Pack Light. Carbon footprints can easily be reduced by packing light. Important to note is that airlines use less fuel and therefore, less emissions, when a plane is lighter.

Travel Off-Peak. Off-peak travel seasons reduce the environmental impact on heavily visited areas and reduce congestion at the destination.

The Importance of Sustainable Tourism

Tourism, especially in places like France, Italy, Spain, and Thailand, needs to be managed with a long-term perspective, especially in protecting the cultural and natural heritage of the planets and these areas. With the increasing trend of more sustainable tourism, tourists also need to be more responsible in their tourism choices as they impact the heritage sites and the local people.

Contributing to the planet’s conservation as a tourist is easy. First choose an eco-friendly airline, then a green certified hotel and finally a sustainable tourist spot. The climate crisis is global and pretends to be flexible, and thus, all of us in the tourism industry, including tourists, should all play our part.

Sustainable Travel Initiatives by Airlines and Hotels

Some airlines and hotels are taking the initiative to incorporate more sustainable practices. In the hotel industry, this is being spearheaded by Accor’s sustainable tourism initiative. In the airline sector, Air Canada, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines are implementing fuel-efficient aircraft, cutting down waste on flights and adopting ** eco-friendly practices** that reduce the use of plastic on flights and offer locally sourced meals to passengers.

Marriott, Hyatt, and Hilton are following closely behind Accor and starting sustainability practices, such as zero-emission buildings, plastic-free hotels, and energy-efficient lighting. Guests booking with these brands know their stay won’t hurt the environment as much.

How Airlines and Hotels Are Responding to Changing Traveler Demands

To adjust to the demand for more sustainable travel options, the hospitality and airline industries have to change. In the case of airlines, this includes more direct flights to “green” destinations, use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and better on-board waste management. In the case of hotels, this means building or renovating to reach LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, using renewable energy, and offering more sustainable options like low-flow showerheads and organic toiletries.

Both industries have also started working towards working carbon neutral. This is the first time airlines and hotels are collaborating together to reduce their carbon footprint and it will mark the beginning of a seamless sustainable travel experience.

Accor’s ‘Achieving Net Zero Together’ initiative has been recognized as the World’s Leading Climate Action Initiative at the 2025 World Sustainable Travel & Hospitality Awards (WSTHA). This prestigious award highlights the company’s commitment to sustainability, setting a new standard for the hospitality industry’s environmental efforts.

A Sustainable Future for Travel

Accor’s Achieving Net Zero Together initiative being recognized at the 2025 WSTHA is a critical moment for the airline and hospitality industries, proving that sustainability can and must be a pillar of the travel experience. Sustainable airlines and green, carbon-neutral, and waste-reducing hotels allow travelers to make environmentally responsible choices when flying and lodging.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that even more flight cuts might be needed if the government shutdown continues and more air traffic controllers are off the job.

So far, the slowdown at many of the nation’s busiest airports hasn’t caused widespread disruptions. But it has deepened the impact felt by the nation’s longest federal shutdown.

“We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” said Emmy Holguin, 36, who was flying from Miami Saturday to see family in the Dominican Republic. “I’m hoping that the government can take care of this.” Analysts warn that the upheaval will intensify and spread far beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week.

Already there are concerns about the squeeze on tourism destinations and holiday shipping.

Here’s what to know about the flight reductions:

How many flights have been cancelled?

Flight disruptions ticked up a bit on Saturday — typically a slow travel day — as each of the first two days creeped above 1,000 cancellations, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flights.

The airport serving Charlotte, North Carolina, was the hardest hit early on Saturday, with 130 arriving and departing flights canceled by mid-afternoon.

Airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, and Newark, New Jersey, also saw numerous disruptions. Ongoing staffing shortages in radar centers and control towers added to the cancellations and delays on Saturday at several East Coast airports, including those around New York City.

Not all the cancellations were due to the FAA order, and those numbers represent just a small portion of the overall flights nationwide. But they are certain to rise in the coming days if the slowdown continues.

The FAA said the reductions impacting all commercial airlines are starting at 4 per cent of flights at 40 targeted airports and will be bumped up again on Tuesday before hitting 10 per cent of flights on Friday.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that even more flight cuts might be needed if the government shutdown continues and more air traffic controllers are off the job.

Why are the flights being cancelled?

Air traffic controllers have gone without paychecks for nearly a month as the shutdown continues, leading many to call in sick and add to already existing staffing shortages.

Most controllers are working mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, and some are taking second jobs to pay their bills, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said.

How are passengers being affected?

Most were relieved to find that airlines largely stayed on schedule Friday, and those whose flights were called off were able to quickly rebook. So far, longer international flights haven’t been interrupted.

There is still a lot of uncertainty about what flights will be cancelled next.

And not everyone has the means to pay for a hotel or deal with a last-minute disruption, said Heather Xu, 46, who was in Miami on Saturday after a cruise and flying home to Puerto Rico.

“Travel is stressful enough. Then you put these disruptions in place and it really makes everything more challenging,” she said.

Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people are simply cancelling flights altogether.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/11/US-govt-shutdown-flights.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 23:16:47.203906

Calumet Specialty Products Reports Strong Earnings Amid Market Challenges

The recent earnings call of Calumet Specialty Products painted a picture of robust financial health and strategic advancements, despite some hurdles. The company reported strong financial results, with significant progress in cost reduction, production, and sustainable fuel expansion. However, challenges in the renewable diesel market and a financial reporting error were also highlighted.

Strong Financial Performance

Calumet Specialty Products announced an impressive adjusted EBITDA of $92.5 million for the quarter, marking the strongest performance in several years. This financial milestone underscores the company’s effective strategies and operational efficiencies.

Significant Cost Reduction

The company achieved a remarkable reduction in operating costs, saving $24 million in the third quarter compared to the previous year. Year-to-date, operating costs are down by $60 million, reflecting Calumet’s commitment to cost efficiency.

Record Production in Specialty Products

In the Specialty Products & Solutions segment, Calumet reached record production levels, with sales volumes surpassing 20,000 barrels per day at margins exceeding $60 per barrel. This achievement highlights the segment’s robust performance and market demand.

Successful Test for SAF Expansion

Calumet successfully completed a test run for the MaxSAF expansion, confirming the plant’s capability to produce between 120 to 150 million gallons annually. This positions the company well for future growth in sustainable aviation fuel.

PTC Monetization

The company successfully monetized $25 million in Production Tax Credits (PTCs) during the third quarter, with an additional $15 million monetized in October. This financial maneuver enhances Calumet’s cash flow and financial flexibility.

Growth in TRUFUEL and Performance Brands

Calumet’s TRUFUEL brand is experiencing a record EBITDA year, driven by its expanded presence in over 4,000 Walmart stores. This growth reflects the brand’s increasing market penetration and consumer demand.

Improved Regulatory Environment

Positive regulatory developments were noted, including progress towards a finalized Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO), which is anticipated to boost industry margins. This regulatory clarity is expected to benefit Calumet’s operations.

Weak Renewable Diesel Margins

The renewable diesel sector faced challenges with lower realized margins due to costly feedstocks, which were $0.20 per gallon more than traditional markers. This impacted the profitability of renewable diesel production.

Challenges in Renewable Diesel Production

The company faced reduced biomass-based diesel production and volatile feedstock prices, which negatively affected margins. These challenges underscore the complexities of the renewable diesel market.

Cash Flow Statement Error

Calumet identified an error in the Q1 and Q2 cash flow statements, where certain flows were misclassified, necessitating a restatement. This issue highlights the importance of accurate financial reporting.

Forward-Looking Guidance

Looking ahead, Calumet remains optimistic about its strategic direction. The company plans to continue its focus on operational improvements and deleveraging, with the MaxSAF expansion on track for the first half of 2026. Additionally, the reduction of the RIN obligation by over $320 million positions Calumet favorably for future growth.

In conclusion, Calumet Specialty Products’ earnings call reflected a strong financial performance and strategic progress, despite facing challenges in the renewable diesel market and a financial reporting error. The company’s focus on cost reduction, production efficiency, and sustainable fuel expansion positions it well for future success.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_519600637-1-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 21:16:39.134673
