Doha

Qatar has announced five new research projects aimed at accelerating the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as the country steps up efforts to curb emissions from one of the world’s fastest growing industries.

The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MECC) revealed the projects during a scientific symposium on Monday.

The initiative brings together the ministry, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Airways and the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA) in what officials describe as a national model for research-driven climate action.

Assistant Undersecretary for Climate Change Affairs, Ahamed Mohammed Al Sada, said the ministry is prioritising scientific research and innovation as essential tools to address global environmental challenges.

He noted that the new projects demonstrate the strength of collaboration between government agencies, academia and the aviation sector.

“This partnership unites academic expertise, regulatory capabilities and operational experience,” he said, adding that it will help Qatar pioneer technologies that reduce carbon emissions and support national leadership in sustainable aviation.

The projects, he added, align with Qatar’s 2024-2030 climate strategy and its commitments under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) CORSIA framework.

Dr Mohammed Saif Al Kuwari, environmental and engineering adviser to the ministry, highlighted the aviation sector’s crucial economic role and the urgent need to lower its climate footprint.

Research suggests that sustainable aviation fuels could cut carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel, he said.

Multisector cooperation, he added, is essential to making these fuels commercially viable.

From a regulatory perspective, QCAA Acting President, Mohammed bin Faleh Al Hajri, said the global aviation industry is undergoing a rapid transformation as countries work toward decarbonisation.

Qatar Airways, he noted, is a key partner in testing cleaner fuels and new technologies within its operations.

Al Hajri emphasised that low-carbon fuels can act as a practical bridge toward fully sustainable aviation fuels, helping build the infrastructure and expertise required for long-term adoption.

He also called for clearer international standards under ICAO to encourage investment, research and market development.

The five research projects span a range of priorities, including producing SAF from local resources, evaluating long-term environmental and economic impacts, and exploring how sustainable fuels can be integrated into Qatar’s aviation infrastructure.

Officials say the findings will help guide policymakers and strengthen the country’s role in the global transition to low-emissions aviation.

The initiative, they said, reflects Qatar’s broader plan to build a low-carbon economy while maintaining growth - and to position the country as a regional and international leader in environmental innovation.",https://www.qatar-tribune.com/watanqatartribune/uploads/images/2025/12/02/322537.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 21:56:10.196555

The coordination made by the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority (QCAA), the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, and Qatar Airways announced the partnership between academic research, regulatory oversight, and real-world airline operations which will make climate-driven change possible through collaboration.

The move is as much about safeguarding the planet as it is about preserving Qatar’s growing reputation as a world-class travel destination: cleaner flights, lower emissions, and a strengthened aviation hub all count as wins for travellers and the environment alike.

What the New Projects Cover

The five research streams span important areas:

Producing SAF from local resources, helping reduce dependence on imported jet fuel.

Evaluating the long-term environmental and economic impacts of SAF adoption.

Examining how sustainable fuels can be integrated into Qatar’s aviation infrastructure, from fuel supply chains to airport refuelling systems.

According to officials, these efforts align with Qatar’s broader 2024–2030 climate strategy and its obligations under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and its global carbon offsetting and reduction framework, known as CORSIA.

An adviser to the environment ministry reportedly said that SAF, when compared with conventional jet fuel, could cut carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent.

Regulatory and Industry Coordination: Why QCAA’s Role Matters

From the regulatory vantage point, QCAA’s involvement, especially under the acting leadership of its president, is crucial. The authority, in coordination with Qatar Airways, serves as a bridge between research outcomes and their operational application in real-world flights.

QCAA has previously reaffirmed Qatar’s commitment to ICAO’s roadmap for alternative aviation fuels, advocating for accelerated deployment of SAF and lower-carbon fuels while calling for a unified global SAF registry to enhance regulatory transparency.

By doing so, the authority aims not only to meet global standards but also to make SAF usage economically viable for airlines, a key step if sustainable flying is to become mainstream rather than niche.

What It Means for Travellers and Qatar as a Destination

For travellers, this could translate into more environmentally friendly flights to and from Doha, helping reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-haul air travel. As the projects mature and SAF becomes more widely adopted, tourists flying into Qatar, whether for business, leisure or events may benefit from cleaner, greener travel options.

For Qatar itself, these initiatives reinforce the country’s ambitions to be a regional leader in sustainable aviation. They help future-proof its aviation hub status by aligning with growing global demand for low-carbon travel, which may attract environmentally conscious travellers.

Furthermore, building local SAF supply and infrastructure could lead to a more self-sufficient aviation ecosystem, less reliant on imported fuel, more aligned with climate goals, and more resilient in times of global fuel supply uncertainty.

Challenges Ahead And Why This Strategy Matters

While the SAF promise is compelling up to 80 percent reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions as quoted, the path to widespread adoption faces hurdles. SAF production must be scaled up; supply chains must be adapted for SAF distribution at airports; regulatory frameworks, both local and international, must evolve to support widespread SAF integration.

Moreover, economics play a key role. As noted by QCAA in its previous policy discussions, efforts to adopt sustainable or lower-carbon fuels must avoid placing undue financial burden on airlines.

But by investing in research now, covering local feedstock, environmental impact, infrastructure integration, Qatar is seeking to address these challenges proactively. The hope is that this foundation will ease future adoption hurdles, lower costs, and encourage both airline and traveller buy-in.

What This Means for the Future of Aviation in Qatar

The launch of these five research projects signals a turning point. By integrating academic study, regulatory oversight, airline operations and environmental policy, Qatar is staking a claim to lead in sustainable aviation, not just regionally, but globally.

If successful, the outcomes could reshape commercial aviation in Qatar. Domestic and international flights could increasingly run on SAF or low-carbon fuels, significantly reducing carbon emissions without compromising the extensive global connectivity that defines the country’s aviation ambitions.

For travellers and the global tourism industry, this could also mark a shift: choosing Qatar as a hub or destination may increasingly be viewed as a greener, more responsible choice.

A New Chapter for Green Travel from Doha

The new SAF research projects of Qatar interlace ambition, science, regulation, and operational expertise thus converting the utopian dream of green aviation into a realistic and practical roadmap. By beginning at the research level and elevating it upward, the country shows its readiness not only to speak but also to effectuate long-term change.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/An-aeroplane-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 19:56:54.211883

The arrival of Alléo Energy in Brazil, as announced by FSP this Monday (01), marks an important move in the expansion of the use of sustainable aviation fuel (FAS) in the country. The initiative reinforces the growing global attention focused on reducing emissions from the aviation sector and adds to the efforts of Brazilian companies and regulatory policies that are already paving the way for the aviation energy transition.

What changes with the entry of the American company Alléo Energy into Brazil?

Alléo Energy — american company specializing in renewable energy solutions — is bringing a new SAF to the country. The information comes at a time when Brazil is seeking to expand its participation in the global market for sustainable fuels and meet international requirements for mitigating emissions.

The arrival of SAF by Alléo Energy adds to other recent developments in the sector, such as the import carried out by Vibra Energia and the tests conducted by Petrobras. The presence of more suppliers in the national market may have direct effects on supply, price competitiveness, and the acceleration of the adoption of this type of fuel by Brazilian airlines.

SAF is cited as one of the main alternatives for reducing emissions in air transport, as it can decrease the carbon footprint of flights without requiring changes to aircraft or fuel supply systems.

Understand how Alléo Energy will operate in the Brazilian market.

The company develops clean energy production units capable of transforming wood waste, crops grown for energy generation, and urban waste into various renewable fuels. In addition to SAF (synthetic anaerobic fuel), the company can also produce green diesel for road transport—meeting ASTM D975 standards—green hydrogen on a large scale, and biochar.

In Brazil, its operations will be represented by OnFresh. The future plants installed in the country should use cellulosic materials, industrial process byproducts, and municipal waste to manufacture these fuels, which, according to the company, can be produced at the lowest cost achieved so far.

According to Fernando Ochman, business director at OnFresh, the technical team is able to adapt each plant to the production needs of the companies, allowing them to choose which fuels they want to generate and even the proportion of each.

Recently, Alléo developed a method that produces more than 100 kilograms of green hydrogen for every ton of cellulosic waste used. This patented system generates hydrogen with a negative carbon balance—meaning that, in addition to not releasing CO₂, it also removes particles from the atmosphere.

Current scenario of sustainable aviation fuel in Brazil

Regulatory advances and decarbonization targets

In recent years, Brazil has been structuring policies and guidelines to produce and use sustainable aviation fuelThis aligns with international goals that seek to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The federal government, through sectoral initiatives, is already projecting commercial-scale production starting in 2027.

Furthermore, the country is discussing tax incentive models, environmental certifications, and productive partnerships, which aim to make SAF competitive with traditional aviation kerosene.

Studies show that Brazil has the potential to become a leader in global production, due to its abundance of biomass, agricultural waste, and consolidated expertise in biofuels — especially ethanol and biodiesel.

Supply and demand forecasts for the coming years

Reports from industry institutions indicate that national demand for SAF could reach between 3,2 and 9,1 billion liters by 2037...varying according to the technological roadmap and the pace of adoption by airlines. However, the current volume available meets just over a quarter of this estimated demand, highlighting a significant gap between need and supply.

Today, only a limited number of airports offer the fuel. Vibra Energia, for example, began selling SAF at Galeão Airport in Rio de Janeiro in 2025, using an internationally authorized blend of up to 10% renewable fuel with 90% fossil kerosene.

Despite these advances, experts say that the presence of new suppliers is essential to expand availability, reduce costs, and stimulate market growth.

Why is Alléo Energy's arrival in Brazil strategic for the aviation sector?

Expanding supply and increasing competitiveness.

With the entry of Alléo Energy, Brazil now has another source of SAFThis reduces dependence on occasional imports and isolated initiatives by domestic companies. This expansion of the supplier base can stimulate competitiveness and enable more affordable prices.

Furthermore, the arrival of a new american company This reinforces the internationalization of the sustainable fuels market in Brazil, opening doors for future partnerships with airlines and logistics operators.

Direct support for the decarbonization of the aviation sector.

Sustainable fuel (SF) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, depending on the raw materials and production process used. While the exact percentages vary according to technological routes, the global consensus is that sustainable fuel is one of the most viable short-term solutions to bring civil aviation closer to its targets. decarbonisation.

The arrival of SAF by Alléo Energy reinforces this movement and could accelerate the incorporation of renewable fuels in domestic and international flights in Brazil.

Airline valuation and consumer benefits

For airlines, adopting SAF represents a competitive advantage and improves public perception, as it demonstrates environmental commitment. For passengers, although there is no immediate direct impact on ticket prices, the action is part of a trend that can make aviation more sustainable and efficient.

Future paths and opportunities for sustainable aviation with Alléo Energy.

With the advancement of decarbonisation and the entry of new suppliers of sustainable aviation fuelBrazil is strategically positioned on the global stage. Alléo Energy's move not only expands the supply of SAF (Sustainable Agricultural Production), but also reinforces the country's international relevance in this market.

The trend is that, in the coming years, national production will grow, supported by investments in technology, research, and regulation. If this materializes, Brazil could become an exporter of agroforestry systems, integrating international production chains and consolidating its regional leadership.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SAF-.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:56:17.963938

Boom Supersonic actively promotes how supersonic travel with its SST, the Overture, could benefit international sports leagues like the NFL by enabling faster, more efficient global travel.
Boom Supersonic Boom Supersonic currently dominates the developing commercial supersonic market.
Its primary goal is to collect data to change current regulations that ban commercial supersonic flight over land.","The National Football League (NFL) is keeping close tabs on the development of new boomless supersonic commercial Aviation technology. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is experimenting with new designs that will nearly eliminate the sonic boom sound effect that accompanies every aircraft flying beyond the speed of sound.

At the same time, a number of private companies are also pursuing the development of airliners that will leverage the information gathered by the NASA experiments. The NFL relies heavily on commercial air charters like those provided by American Airlines during its travel season. Beyond the many domestic games, the NFL has seen progress in its European expansion with promising future potential.

A supersonic transport (SST) like the Concorde, configured as a commercial passenger airline, would be extremely valuable to the NFL as it pursues more regular international games overseas. Cutting flight times would reduce fatigue and improve recovery for players, who often travel with large parties of around 200 people.

Why Does The NFL Want SSTs?

The league has hosted regular-season games in London, Frankfurt, and Madrid to build its overseas fanbase and is exploring the possibility of placing a permanent team or division in Europe. Faster travel would ease the heavy logistical burdens for teams playing frequent transatlantic games.

Today, the NFL makes its travel season work with subsonic commercial aviation by using charter flights for teams and their large traveling party. The league makes its schedule with accommodation for the fatigue that occurs from cross-country and international travel. The time-consuming process of moving people and equipment with every travel stop also needs to be factored in.

The NFL strategically plans road games to minimize travel impact on players. They prioritize player comfort to maximize performance on the field. Teams select seating based on the needs of their players, and their charter providers offer custom catering to accommodate all dietary needs. While effective, this process remains slow and cumbersome compared to future supersonic options, especially considering international expansion efforts.

Boom Supersonic actively promotes how supersonic travel with its SST, the Overture, could benefit international sports leagues like the NFL by enabling faster, more efficient global travel. Boom is moving forward with the Overture's development, with ground and flight testing already underway and a goal of carrying passengers by 2029.

The League’s Strategy

American Airlines, one of the NFL’s biggest charter operators, is strongly interested in the Boom SST and has already placed a significant order. In August 2022, American announced an agreement to purchase 20 Overture aircraft, with an option for 40 more, following United Airlines' initial order for 15 jets with the option for 35 more.

Despite both airlines' interest in the Overture, the plane's capacity of 60 to 80 passengers is a logistical challenge for the NFL. A single Overture aircraft could not move an entire team in one flight. The team would require multiple Overtures or split the traveling party between a supersonic jet for first-string players and a conventional subsonic jet for others, as well as cargo.

Many NFL teams charter widebody aircraft, such as Boeing 767s or 777s, from major commercial airlines like United, Delta, and American. These planes can accommodate the traveling party, including players, coaches, medical staff, and other personnel. Some players are even given larger business or first-class seats due to their size.

The NFL's interest is more about monitoring the technology's feasibility for long-term international expansion, rather than immediate adoption. Likely near-term usage might include team owners or top executives using the aircraft for faster business travel related to international operations or league meetings.

The Long View

The real benefit aligns with the NFL's goal of permanent international expansion. Faster travel windows could allow for more flexible scheduling of international games without requiring extended stays abroad or disproportionate bye weeks, integrating European games more smoothly into the regular season structure.

Andrew Beaton of the Wall Street Journal remarked in a report published a few days ago that the NFL has been “been keeping a close eye on the momentum behind commercial supersonic flights” although it has no firm plans to put permanent teams in Europe yet.

Minimizing travel time directly addresses major concerns regarding player welfare, fatigue, and competitive fairness. For domestic games, teams typically travel the day before a game, holding final walk-throughs and meetings in the hotel. On top of player and staff travel, international games involve meticulously detailed logistics for transporting tons of equipment, which must be cleared through customs.

The NFL is currently in a monitoring phase, watching how airlines like United and American utilize the aircraft and if future designs could scale up in capacity, or if regulations regarding overland sonic booms change, which would open up more domestic route possibilities. The Overture is hoped to demonstrate that a commercial market for supersonic travel exists. Its success would de-risk future, larger aircraft programs.

The rollout of the Overture is aiming to drive investment in airport infrastructure that will support the growth of supersonic travel. This includes noise abatement procedures and fueling operations for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which would be necessary for any scaled-up supersonic service.

Supersonic travel is expensive, and although the Overture is designed for SAF, the limited supply and high cost of SAF could constrain scaled-up operations. Any future, larger supersonic airliner would be an entirely new design, requiring its own extensive development, testing, and certification process. This would take many years and occur well after the Overture's planned 2029 entry into service.

The Overture

The Boom Overture is a supersonic airliner under development that will use purpose-built Symphony engines to achieve a cruise speed of Mach 1.7 and carry 60 to 80 passengers, primarily on transoceanic routes. Airlines most interested in the Boom Overture are United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines, which have placed a combined total of 130 orders and pre-orders.

The Overture is designed to accommodate 60 to 80 passengers in an all-business-class configuration. The primary commercial usage will focus on transoceanic routes such as New York to London, cutting flight time to about 3.5 hours, as well as Seattle to Tokyo. The Overture is aimed at premium, high-end passengers, with fares expected to be comparable to current business-class prices.

It is designed to cruise at Mach 1.7 (around 1,122 mph or 1,806 km/h) over water and Mach 0.94 subsonically. Overture will be optimized to fly at a cruising altitude of up to 60,000 feet with a maximum range of 4,250 nautical miles (7,870 km). The engines are engineered for sustained supersonic flight without the use of afterburners, a differentiator from Concorde's design, which improves fuel efficiency.

Boom’s Overture will be powered by four newly developed Symphony engines, which are twin-spool, medium-bypass turbofans. Each engine is designed to produce approximately 40,000 pounds-force (180 kN) of thrust at takeoff. The Symphony engine is designed to be compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Boom Supersonic

Boom Supersonic currently dominates the developing commercial supersonic market. Other supersonic and hypersonic transport planes in development include business jets from Spike Aerospace and projects for military/government use that may lead to future commercial airliners, primarily from Hermeus and Lockheed Martin.

The Hermeus Halcyon is aiming for hypersonic speeds (Mach 5+) under military contracts for uncrewed demonstrators, with a commercial passenger aircraft as a long-term goal. Spike Aerospace is developing a private business jet for 12-18 passengers known as the S-512, aiming for Mach 1.6. Exosonic was focused on a passenger concept, but now primarily develops supersonic UAVs for military training exercises.

Most players in the supersonic and hypersonic development space have significant ties to the defense industry. Boom Supersonic has been awarded grants and contracts by the US Air Force's AFWERX program in partnership with Northrop Grumman to develop a special mission variant.

The Department of Defense plans to explore military and government executive transport configurations for the Overture. The Symphony engine design partner, Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT), is a subsidiary of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions.

NASA And The X-59

The NASA X-59 is a research aircraft built by Lockheed Martin Skunk Works for the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) program. Its primary goal is to collect data to change current regulations that ban commercial supersonic flight over land. NASA will fly the X-59 over select US communities to gather data on public responses to the quieter sonic boom. This data will be compiled and delivered to regulators like the Federal Aviation Administration and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The X-59 is designed to reduce the typical loud sonic ""boom"" to a gentle sonic ""thump"" on the ground, or possibly no sound at all. The program data, once released, aims to allow for new rules that open up overland routes for all future commercial supersonic aircraft, like the Boom Overture, dramatically expanding the SST market.

If the Overture proves successful, a scaled-up service could emerge in the 2030s or beyond, using larger, next-generation supersonic transports. In the future, airlines with fleets of larger supersonic transports could accommodate entire team charters for staff and essential equipment. A larger, commercial supersonic market could also lead to more frequent and accessible supersonic flights for executives and fans, solidifying the overseas league's connection to the NFL's domestic operations.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/supersonice.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 14:56:22.279784

Two more Argentine provinces have signed agreements with the federal government to advance plans to eliminate the export tax on conventional crude oil.

Neuquén and Santa Cruz have joined trailblazer Chubut.

As part of the agreements, the federal government will adjust taxation rules, while the provinces will review their local royalty and canon payment schemes. In turn, companies have committed to maintaining production, among other actions.

The initiative is designed to encourage upstream investment in conventional oil fields. Currently, most investment is concentrated in unconventional assets in the Vaca Muerta formation.

Among risks associated with reduced conventionals outlay is an eventual domestic shortfall of production of heavy crude, needed as feedstock for refineries.

In terms of oil, Neuquén, Chubut and Santa Cruz are Argentina's top-three producing jurisdictions, accouting for almost 90% of output.

In No. 1 jurisdiction Neuquén, most investment is targeted at Vaca Muerta. In September, 96% of Neuquén output was shale, according to information from the federal energy department.

Chile hydrogen

Chile's hydrogen association, H2 Chile, has presented a list of policy priorities it would like the next administration to adopt.

The 2026-30 list encompasses actions on project permitting, legal certainty, territorial planning, regulation, electricity pricing, financing and incentives, infrastructure, and demand stimulation.

More than 80 projects have been announced publicly, and several pilot and demonstration initiatives are operational.

Around US$40.0bn in projects are currently under environmental review.

So far, two large-scale projects have received licenses: the US$825mn Cabo Negro e-fuels project in Magallanes region, and the US$423mn hydrogen production project in Calama district, Antofagasta region.

Authorities are also updating Chile’s national green hydrogen strategy.

Key challenges for developers include reducing production costs and securing offtake agreements.

Former energy minister Juan Carlos Jobet, a key figure in Chile's hydrogen drive, recently said hydrogen will ""have a space,"" citing applications in heavy transport and fertilizer production.

He urged the country to preserve political consensus on hydrogen development.

Production costs have fallen more slowly than expected and green hydrogen must still compete with cheaper fossil fuel alternatives.

Both presidential candidates – conservative José Antonio Kast and communist Jeannette Jara – reference green hydrogen in their campaign programs.

Hydrogen development in the north could potentially help address electricity oversupply and drive investment in new power generation capacity.

Chile's next government is due to take office in March. According to recent polls, Kast is likely to win the December 14 runoff election.

The US Treasury and IRS released the final, critical guidance for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) tax credit, providing the regulatory certainty required by project developers and financiers. This action immediately de-risks the capital stack for new SAF production facilities by establishing the definitive methodology for calculating the fuel’s carbon intensity score. This clarity directly impacts the agricultural supply chain by validating the use of bio-oils and specific farming practices, enabling the shift from planning to construction. The most important data point demonstrating this impact is the maximum credit of $1.75 per gallon, which is now a bankable figure for financial models.

Context

The core question for industrial professionals was whether the US government would translate ambitious policy goals into a stable, bankable mechanism for the SAF tax credit. Analysts wondered if the regulatory framework would be clear enough to prevent billions in capital from stalling, as a lack of a certified carbon accounting model was the primary barrier to Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).

Analysis

This project acceleration is a direct result of targeted government policy instruments making low-carbon fuel production economically viable. The cause is the formal adoption of the 40BSAF-GREET 2024 model, which is the certified carbon accounting tool. This model provides the necessary legal and financial certainty for long-term contracts.

Manufacturers are expected to react by aggressively accelerating Final Investment Decisions on new Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) plants. Think of the GREET model like the “certified scale” at a commodity exchange; without a certified scale, no one will buy or sell the product because its value cannot be legally verified.

Outlook

This development implies that the SAF industry is shifting from policy risk to execution risk. The single most important thing to watch next is the acceleration of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) on new, large-scale SAF production facilities over the next twelve months. A surge in FIDs will confirm that the regulatory clarity has successfully unlocked the private capital pipeline.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Green-Hard-Hat-Symbolizing-Sustainable-Construction-Ecological-Integration-and-Urban-Development.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 16:57:30.908678

Market Factors - Growth, Barriers, and Opportunity Analysis

Forward-Thinking Regulatory Innovation to Transform the SAF Market

Policy incentives from governments and supranational bodies are catalyzing investment in renewable aviation fuels. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides a SAF tax credit of US$1.25/gallon plus additional credits for lifecycle GHG reduction, which can cause a marked acceleration of SAF production projects.

Similarly, the European Union (EU)’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling to 70% by 2050. At the global level, the CORSIA program of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is imposing global emissions monitoring and supporting international adoption.

These measures are lowering entry barriers, spurring multibillion-dollar investments in new bio-refineries, and encouraging partnerships between airlines, refiners, and feedstock suppliers. They are also driving rapid market scale-up by guaranteeing long-term demand and facilitating financial close for large-scale projects.

Feedstock Logistics and Supply Chain Instability Pose Critical Cost Barriers

The SAF market confronts significant near-term risks from constrained feedstock supply and complex logistics. Used cooking oil (UCO) and tallow represent the leading feedstock, but geographic unevenness and regulatory hurdles, such as the EU’s RED II anti-fraud frameworks, have created uncertainty for sourcing and certification.

Biofuel producers face volatile pricing, while alternative feedstock sources such as lignocellulosic biomass face slow commercial maturity and high conversion costs. Transport infrastructure limitations, especially cold chain and bulk storage for low-volume feedstock, raise CAPEX and OPEX burdens.

Supply chain risks are further amplified by the limited availability of dedicated bio-refining facilities, often resulting in bottlenecks and sub-scale production runs. These systemic barriers require strategic feedstock diversification and robust traceability frameworks.

PtL and e-Fuels to Unlock Scale and Carbon Mitigation Possibilities

The rapid maturation of power-to-liquids (PtL) technology offers a transformative growth opportunity. PtL enables the production of e-kerosene from captured CO2 and renewable electricity, addressing both feedstock scarcity and carbon emissions. This technology is making notable headway in the renewable aviation fuel market, catalyzed by falling renewable energy costs and expanding hydrogen availability.

The EU is providing heavy funding for PtL innovation through the Horizon Europe initiative, with the first commercial e-fuel plants in Germany and Norway slated to come online by 2026. Airlines aiming for net-zero status are partnering with fuel innovators, providing offtake agreements and joint development capital. PtL’s scalability, grid interconnection, and carbon reduction profile position it as the next major driver of SAF adoption and investment prioritization.

LONDON, Dec. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus has launched the world's first assessed price for UK sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates, expanding its coverage of the northwest European SAF market.

The new prices will help market participants optimise their compliance with the UK SAF mandate by enabling them to compare the cost of purchasing SAF certificates, blending physical bio-SAF — produced from hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) feedstock, and paying 'buy-out' costs in case of non-compliance.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""As SAF mandates ramp up, companies will increasingly need reliable prices not just for the fuel itself but also for certificates. We have worked closely with the industry to develop this new price and we are confident that it will bring much-needed transparency as participants across the aviation value chain work to comply with tightening carbon-cutting mandates.""

The new assessment will track the price of certificates acceptable for meeting the UK SAF Mandate and based on manufacture using a relevant HEFA feedstock.

These tradeable certificates are generated by supplying eligible SAF in the UK and are then redeemed by obligated parties to comply with the mandate's rules. The mandate allows companies which exceed their own quota to sell their excess certificates to others needing to comply.

From 2025, the UK requires jet fuel suppliers to blend 2pc SAF into their domestic aviation fuel deliveries to curb emissions. The mandate increases year by year, rising to 10pc by 2030 and to 22pc by 2040. Transparent pricing for the UK certificates market will therefore become increasingly valuable.

This first UK SAF certificate price complements Argus' existing suite of assessments for tradeable biofuel tickets for road transport mandates in the UK and in several EU countries. Argus also provides a range of physical SAF prices in northwest Europe, including SAF produced using the HEFA pathway and the first-ever modelled production costs for electrolytic SAF (e-SAF).

These unexpected software changes were dealt with swifter than anticipated, and most Airbus fleets are now returning to normal operations.

An Unprecedented Disruption

This was one of the broadest emergency recalls in the European plane maker’s history, prompting huge concerns around travel disruption during the Thanksgiving weekend.

The CEO of Saudi budget carrier Flyadeal, Steven Greenway shared on the matter:

“The thing hit us about 9pm (Jeddah time) and I was back in here about 9:30. I was actually quite surprised how quickly we got through it: there are always complexities.”

Due to this disruption, various airlines were affected, struggling to gauge the impact due to the general alert lacking the affected jets’ serial numbers. Engineers began working on individual jets, and Airbus initially estimated that three hours of work would be required per plane.

Nonetheless, whilst at least one major airline faced delays, many completed the updates without cancelling any flights, such as UK’s easyJet and Wizz Air.

New Updates From Airbus

Currently, there are fewer than 100 jets still requiring work, which involves reverting to an earlier version of software that handles the nose angle. However, it seems some of the older A320 jets require more than a simple software reset, and a new computer entirely will need to be installed.

CEO Guillaume Fuary has publicly apologised on the incident, as industry executives discuss the changes that have been made in the industry’s playbook after the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. During that crisis, the company was heavily criticised in its handling of fatal crashes after a software design error. Now, this sudden recall is the first time that Airbus has dealt with global safety attention on such a scale.

Ronn Torossian, chairman of New York-based 5W Public Relations, spoke on the matter:

“Is Airbus acting with the Boeing MAX crisis in mind? Absolutely – every company in the aviation sector is. Boeing paid the reputational price for hesitation and opacity. Airbus clearly wants to show… a willingness to say, ‘We could have done better’.”

In July 2025 the Portuguese government announced its decision to move ahead with the privatization process. The plan is to sell nearly half of the flag carrier through a bidding process, within a year to strengthen TAP’s ability to compete with larger European groups and to recoup financial losses.

The government has set criteria for any potential investor: companies entering the bidding process must commit to preserving the TAP brand, continuing operations in Lisbon and Portugal’s secondary airports, and supporting projects related to sustainable aviation fuel amongst others. Additionally, 5% of TAP’s shares will be reserved for employees, reinforcing the government’s plan to keep workers involved in the company’s future.

Lufthansa, IAG and Air France-KLM Among the Bidders

Amongst the European airlines biddings, the Lufthansa Group has submitted a formal request expressing its interest, confirming earlier expectations that the German aviation group would join the race. Lufthansa said it aims to form a long-term partnership with TAP should its bid move ahead. In a recent statement, CEO Carsten Spohr said the airline group “welcomes the Portuguese government’s privatization process,”adding that Lufthansa intends to strengthen Portugal’s global connectivity and protect Portuguese identity.

IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, has also joined the list of bidders, signaling its intent to expand its presence on southern European routes where TAP plays a strategic role. Another major contender is Air France-KLM, which has shown repeated interest in strengthening its footprint on Atlantic routes.

TAP Privatization Decision

Parpública, the state holding company overseeing the sale, now has 20 days to review all submitted expressions of interest and prepare a detailed report evaluating whether candidates meet the participation requirements, according to the official process.

While TAP remains a key player in transatlantic travel, the airline ranked last in Europe for flight punctuality in October 2025. The report, published by OAG, measures delays and cancellations and considers a flight late if it arrives more than 15 minutes after its scheduled time. Despite the low punctuality score, TAP’s cancellation rate was among the lowest, highlighting a noticeable contrast between delays and overall operational reliability.

The role of additives becomes more important as fuel specifications tighten and older aircraft and defense fleets continue operation. Overall, demand is rising steadily and is expected to grow further as USAge of fuel treated jet fuel increases across commercial, military and private aviation in the USA.

What are the Drivers of Demand for Aviation Fuel Additives in USA?

One key driver is increased air travel and expansion of commercial airline operations in the USA. As the number of flights and fleet size grow, larger volumes of jet fuel are consumed, raising the requirement for additives that ensure fuel stability, prevent deposits, and protect engine components. Another driver is the performance demands placed on modern jet engines, which require fuel that meets strict standards for combustion efficiency, clean burning, and minimal contamination; fuel additives help meet these standards. Additives also support safety and reliability by preventing problems such as fuel icing, corrosion of storage and fuel system components, and oxidative degradation over time. Military aviation demand also contributes because defense aircraft often operate under harsh conditions, requiring fuel formulations with robust additive packages to maintain reliability. In addition, growing interest in alternative aviation fuels, including biofuels or fuel blends, increases demand for specialized additives to ensure proper performance and compatibility with existing engines and fuel systems. These factors collectively reinforce demand for aviation fuel additives across multiple user segments in the USA.

What are the Restraints on Demand for Aviation Fuel Additives in USA?

Demand for aviation fuel additives is constrained by factors including volatility in crude oil and fuel prices. High oil prices can pressure airlines and operators to cut costs; in such cases they may limit USAge of non essential or premium additives to manage fuel expenses. Also, regulatory and environmental pressures on additive composition can restrict use of certain chemical additives if they pose environmental or health risks. The shift toward alternative fuels and fuel efficiency regulations may reduce dependence on some additive types, especially if new fuel formulations require fewer conventional additives. Costs associated with development and certification of additive packages suitable for newer or blended fuels may increase operational and compliance burdens. In addition, maintenance of fuel handling infrastructure and logistic complexity - especially for smaller operators or private aircraft - may limit adoption of additive treated fuel despite potential benefits. These restraints may limit growth of additive consumption even as overall fuel demand rises.

What are the Key Trends Influencing Demand for Aviation Fuel Additives in USA?

A prominent trend is growing adoption of advanced, multifunctional additive packages that combine anti icing, corrosion inhibition, deposit control, and fuel stability in a single treatment, allowing greater efficiency and simplified fuel management. Another trend is rising use of jet fuel blends or alternative aviation fuels, which often require specially tailored additive formulations to ensure compatibility and reliable performance; this drives demand for new additive chemistries. Demand for additives in military and defense aviation remains steady, especially where operations require fuel stability under extreme conditions. Increased focus on fuel system integrity, including measures against microbial contamination and metal induced deposits, supports demand for biocides and metal deactivators. Finally, as regulators and industry stakeholders emphasize fuel safety and quality standards, consistent use of additive treated jet fuel becomes more common across commercial airlines, cargo carriers, private jets and defense fleets - supporting long term demand growth.

India has formally approved blending targets for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and is preparing the aviation sector for mandatory global carbon-reduction rules that take effect in 2027, the Union Civil Aviation Ministry informed Parliament on Monday.

Responding to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol said India, as a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is obligated to comply with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)—a global market-based mechanism aimed at reducing emissions from international flights.

Airlines To Offset Emissions From 2027

Under the scheme, airlines will be required to offset emissions above 2019 levels starting from 2027. The scheme applies only to international flights, the minister clarified.

He added that India has already joined ICAO's Assistance, Capacity-building, and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) programme, which supports member states in adopting cleaner aviation fuels and reducing carbon emissions from international aviation.

India also participates in ICAO's technical working groups on aviation environment protection, where experts from all member countries help shape environmental standards and guidance for the global aviation sector.

SAF Blending Targets Approved

To enable a gradual shift toward green aviation, the government has approved SAF blending targets in traditional jet fuel: 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030.

These targets will apply initially to international flights departing from India.

Public sector oil marketing companies are ""actively engaged"" in meeting these targets, the minister said, acknowledging the challenges of higher production costs and limited feedstock availability for SAF.

India Aligning With Climate Commitments

The Ministry said the push for SAF and readiness for CORSIA are aligned with India's broader climate commitments, including its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

Thankfully, technological advances have helped keep airline emissions in check. Even with a long flight, air travel doesn’t have to wreak havoc on the planet’s health. Read on to look at what intercontinental travel routes reveal about sustainable emissions tech.

Cutting Emissions with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

As airlines aim to cut emissions, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as a key solution. Its low carbon footprint and limited air pollution contributions make it an appealing alternative to jet fuel. Best of all, airplanes won’t have to make big adjustments to use it. Unfortunately, though, SAF’s limited production means there’s not a lot of it to go around. And for intercontinental flights, it’s especially hard to meet fueling demands. Given the advantages offered by SAF for travel, however, it seems likely production will soon increase.

Investing in Better Long-Range Aircraft

With the advent of better long-range jets, it’s possible to use less fuel during intercontinental flights. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 are among the leading aircraft thanks to their lightweight builds and more efficient engines. These airplanes are an ideal choice for longer intercontinental flights due to their lower carbon footprint. Passengers won’t see any differences during their flight aside from the knowledge that their environmental impact is lower.

Considering the Impact of Contrails

Contrails, which look like clouds that airplanes draw in the sky, can contribute to warming in the atmosphere. The best way to intervene in this problem is to reduce the presence of contrails. Thanks to AI, it’s possible for flight crews to analyze weather and wind, and adjust their routes in response. Airplanes won’t need to burn lots of extra fuel to make these adjustments, either.

Passengers can look for Sydney–Mumbai flight deals, for instance, without feeling concerned about their environmental impact. And passengers can take matters into their own hands to look at factors like contrails. Emissions tools, like the ICAO calculator, allow passengers to visualize the climate impact of their travels more easily. They can weigh environmental impact considerations like the routes and airplanes before booking a flight.

Building Better Flight Paths

Airplanes aren’t the only key to better emissions solutions in the airline industry. Flight paths can make a difference, as well. And, increasingly, airplanes are turning to tech to ensure smooth shifts from one altitude to another. Continuous Climb Operations (CCO) and Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) enable better transitions that consume less fuel and make intercontinental flights more efficient. Ultimately, though, air traffic controllers and pilots must work together carefully to allow these altitude shifts to happen in crowded skies.

Planning a More Sustainable Flight

Intercontinental flights let passengers explore new spaces and connect with the places and people they love. But for sustainably-minded passengers, emissions matter. Passengers should look for newer planes, AI-enhanced emissions calculators, and SAF before booking flights. By gaining knowledge about the latest sustainability practices, passengers can make more informed travel choices.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 10:57:57.835019

Nils Heuer, director of sales at Deutsche Aircraft, said he saw many manufacturers of small aircraft in Canada and Europe go out of business since the early 2000s.
“Many airlines don’t have access to aircraft that can replace their ageing fleets, and therefore we, as Deutsche Aircraft, said it’s time,” said Heuer.
While Heuer said Deutsche Aircraft doesn’t publicly discuss pricing, Chris Reynolds – president of Yellowknife-based Air Tindi – said new aircraft in general can cost a pretty penny.
“If you look at the most optimum way to run an airline and a fleet of aircraft, it’s to modernize your fleet.","Small aircraft keep people in the NWT connected to each other and the rest of Canada, but some planes in the territory have been running for 40 years – and others for much longer.

Though many of those planes have been well maintained, having had so many parts replaced, they might as well be considered new.

A German company, Deutsche Aircraft, is zeroing in on a market with relatively few competitors, launching what it calls a next-generation turboprop that can take off and land on short, unpaved runways, designed specifically for the unique and harsh conditions of Canada’s North and the NWT.

Nils Heuer, director of sales at Deutsche Aircraft, said he saw many manufacturers of small aircraft in Canada and Europe go out of business since the early 2000s.

“Many airlines don’t have access to aircraft that can replace their ageing fleets, and therefore we, as Deutsche Aircraft, said it’s time,” said Heuer.

“The market urgently needs a new aircraft … that comes with 21st-century technology to replace the ageing fleets that are getting less and less reliable.”

Heuer and his team presented their new aircraft, the D328eco, at the Canadian Aviation Conference and Tradeshow in Montreal last month.

The plane includes features like a gravel kit that prevents small stones from getting kicked up into the propeller, advanced weather radar, and engines built in Canada by Pratt & Whitney, Heuer said.

It can be configured to carry passengers and cargo or used as a medevac.

Heuer said conversations with members of organizations like the Air Transport Association of Canada and the Northern Air Transport Association helped inform the design.

“It’s really one-on-one conversations about their requirements, their daily challenges, what works well with their current fleets. What would they like to improve?” he said.

The plane is being marketed as a more sustainable and more efficient option for regional airlines, since it is compatible with sustainable aviation fuel.

Heuer said the company is aiming to make the D328eco compatible with all types of sustainable aviation fuel, including ones made from products like used cooking oils, as well as power-to-liquid fuels that use renewable energy (like solar or wind) to create synthetic aviation fuel.

He said while interest in those forms of fuels is building more slowly in Canada than Europe, he saw enthusiasm at the conference in Montreal.

“I expect it will become more and more [of a] topic over the next years here in Canada and also in other parts of the world,” said Heuer.

Flight testing for the D328eco will begin in 2026, Heuer said, and the manufacturer will have to meet requirements outlined by Transport Canada such withstanding the extreme cold of the Arctic and subarctic.

Feasible to upgrade?

While Heuer said Deutsche Aircraft doesn’t publicly discuss pricing, Chris Reynolds – president of Yellowknife-based Air Tindi – said new aircraft in general can cost a pretty penny.

“If you look at the most optimum way to run an airline and a fleet of aircraft, it’s to modernize your fleet. Have as most efficient as possible and fly as much as possible,” said Reynolds.

However, in a place like the NWT, airlines are tasked with covering a large geographic area with a relatively small population, he explained.

“[It’s] a massive challenge to try and fly as many hours as possible to pay off an aircraft that costs tens of millions of dollars,” said Reynolds.

He said aircraft used by bigger national airlines might fly 3,000 to 4,000 hours every year.

“Our aircraft probably only have 1,000 to 1,500 hours a year of utilization, which makes it almost uneconomical to constantly be able to modernize your fleet. The economics just don’t make sense,” said Reynolds.

He said northern-based companies tend to have a more rugged, older fleet, though that doesn’t mean they are any less maintained.

“It’s an incredible amount of maintenance that goes into them,” he said. “But it does cost you, because they’re not as efficient as possible.”

He said this largely applies to scheduled flights, though sometimes longer-term contracts present companies with the opportunity to invest in more efficient aircraft.

Representatives from multiple other northern airlines could not be reached for this article or declined an interview request.

Air Tindi’s fleet is mainly made up of planes made by De Havilland, a Canadian manufacturer that makes the Twin Otters, Dash 7s and Dash 8s that Air Tindi flies.

The Dash 7s, Reynolds said, aren’t replaceable with what’s available on the market currently.

“They land on the shortest, the most ugly runways,” said Reynolds.

“If there were new aircraft out there that were as capable, we would replace them, but there’s none. So we’ve invested in a multitude of parts and different things like that, to just keep them going as long as we can.

“And we’re proud to do that. They’re very exceptionally well-made, tough airplanes.”",https://i0.wp.com/cabinradio.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SMFOCHUK_GMAS_03_CABIN_RADIO.jpg?fit=960%2C639&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-01 10:58:02.535232

A pair of studies published in a recent issue of the journal Science could have major implications for improving processes in which syngas is converted into fuels and olefins.
The first study took aim at the high amounts of byproduct CO2 generated with current iron catalysts for F-T synthesis.
Coupling these two processes enables in-situ conversion of water generated during the STO process into hydrogen through the WGS reaction.
This lessens the incorporation of hydrogen from water and improves hydrogen atom economy (HAE; the proportion of reactant hydrogen that ends up in the hydrocarbon product).","The production of commercially important hydrocarbons from synthesis gas (syngas; mixtures of H2 and CO) using the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process is a key strategy for making fuels and chemicals from a range of non-petroleum feedstocks. But F-T processes are relatively expensive and generate substantial amounts of carbon dioxide.

A pair of studies published in a recent issue of the journal Science could have major implications for improving processes in which syngas is converted into fuels and olefins. Both papers offer viable strategies for maximizing the incorporation of hydrogen and carbon atoms from syngas into hydrocarbon compounds, potentially opening pathways to more efficient and less polluting liquid-fuel manufacturing.

The first study took aim at the high amounts of byproduct CO2 generated with current iron catalysts for F-T synthesis. Researchers led by Ding Ma at Peking University (Beijing, China) found that introducing a small amount of halogen-containing compounds into the feed gas could suppress CO2 formation. Specifically, co-feeding 20 parts per million of methyl bromide over an iron carbide catalyst decreased the amount of CO2 formed in the F-T process from around 30% to less than 1%.

The team describes how bromine atoms can bind to the iron active sites, thus blocking the water molecules’ access to the catalyst sites and preventing the reactions that lead to CO2 formation. “This strategy provides a simple, scalable and broadly applicable route for carbon-efficient syngas conversion,” the researchers write.

In another study, researchers from Tsinghua University (Beijing) found that an iron-carbide-magnetite nanoparticle catalyst (specifically, a sodium-promoted FeCx@Fe3O4 core-shell nanoparticle catalyst with iron carbides at the core and magnetite on the surface) could couple the water-gas shift (WGS) and syngas-to-olefins (STO) reactions in situ.

The Airbus A350 is increasingly becoming a flagship for airlines all across the globe, and this airline is not different.","SWISS International Air Lines has big plans for its long-haul fleet, with the carrier set to make several major upgrades to its fleet. This includes new aircraft and a new onboard product. The newest aircraft set to join the fleet will be the Airbus A350-900, which SWISS has selected to serve as the next flagship widebody of its long-haul fleet as part of a larger modernization effort. The product itself is SWISS Senses, a full long-haul cabin and service concept set to lift comfort across the board in every cabin

All the while, this concept will give the airline a more competitive premium proposition that will allow it to compete against European rivals. The two moves, the introduction of the A350 and the launch of these new cabins, are set to come hand-in-hand, with a new interior from day one. The airline itself is already using the aircraft on flagship routes such as Zurich to Boston, a service that showcases all the possibilities this new cabin concept brings to the table.

Over the next five years, the A350 fleet will continue to grow steadily, while SWISS will also start spreading its products across long-haul types. The plan is going to come in phases, with the standard new product arriving on A350s first, before retrofits see the cabin come to A330s and, eventually, Boeing 777-300ERs closer to the end of the decade. Once the 2030s come around, the carrier hopes to be well-prepared to cater to the needs of premium travelers for the upcoming decade.

The Airbus A350-900 Will Be SWISS's New Long-Haul Flagship

The biggest headline update being made by SWISS is the airline's shift to the A350-900, with Airbus recently confirming delivery of the first A350 as part of an order for 10 aircraft. For SWISS, this number matters, as it's large enough to make the aircraft a true long-haul workhorse and not just some jet deployed on a few specific routes. It gives the airline the flexibility it needs to deploy the type on rotations all across North America while keeping maintenance costs under control.

The delivery arc for this fleet will stretch across five years, with the bulk of the impact held towards the back half of the decade. SWISS expects the first aircraft to enter the network immediately, then it will gradually scale its A350 service network as more airframes arrive. SWISS has framed the A350 story as a cornerstone of the airline's overall fleet modernization. Airbus also highlights the aircraft's efficiency and a passenger-friendly cabin as part of the model's overall market appeal.

On the airline side, the strategy is extremely clear as the A350 offers SWISS the opportunity to renew capacity while anchoring premium long-haul services around a more modern platform that can support its newest cabins. It will serve as the launch platform for the airline's long-haul next-generation premium cabins, and the potential this aircraft offers is clearly immeasurable, especially on the highest-potential nonstop services.

SWISS Senses Cabins Will Offer A Real Upgrade

The A350 is the new metal that is joining the fleet, but the introduction of SWISS Senses cabins will be the major change. These cabins offer a redesigned long-haul cabin concept that SWISS positions as a product that blends the traditional Swiss design with modern functionality. The centerpiece is a newly developed cabin that debuts on the Airbus A350 and is extended to the A330 and the Boeing 777 fleets.

This look leans into a subdued palette, and the inclusion of higher-end materials and a lighting strategy helps ease jet lag across the board for all passengers. The hardware details in these new cabins are designed with passenger needs in mind. In first class, SWISS continues to highlight that it will be introducing lockable sliding doors, higher walls, personal wardrobe space, wireless charging, and strong Bluetooth connectivity.

The airline will also introduce large 4K OLED entertainment screens. In business class, the concept will be broadened into multiple different types of seats while maintaining all-aisle direct access, updated controls, larger screens, and additional available storage.

Premium economy and economy passengers will also be able to enjoy larger entertainment screens, improved connectivity, revised ergonomics, and more, with SWISS aiming to optimize seat design that enables increased pitch in economy-class cabins. SWISS is not just treating this as a boutique refresh to its cabins, but, rather, a fleet-wide long-haul standard.

A Comprehensive Five-Year Rollout

SWISS is taking a deliberately staged approach to its gradual fleet expansion. The airline is attempting to balance modest growth while capturing near-term opportunities. First, the A350s arrive already fitted with SWISS Senses cabins, which will allow the airline to market a next-generation experience immediately on its highest-yielding long-haul routes. This is already happening, with the A350 entering service on a showcase service from Zurich (ZRH) to Boston Logan International Airport (BOS).

Up next is a wave of A330 retrofits, which external reporting indicates is due to start from the middle of 2026. This is a practical move, as the A330s are a large part of SWISS's long-haul backbone. Updating these jets quickly expands the customer touchpoints for the new product, especially when it comes to business travelers who care less about aircraft type and more about maintaining a consistent passenger experience.

Lastly, there will be the complete refurbishment of the airline's Boeing 777-300ER fleet. SWISS will be undertaking a major upgrade to its 777 fleet with new first and business suites, although most reporting suggests that this process will not begin until at least 2029. This pushes the 777 towards the end of the next five-year window. By 2030, the airline is looking to continue growing A350 capacity with its retrofit programs all well underway, which will all help the airline improve long-term profitability.

Impacts On Fuel Economics & The Airline's Sustainability Strategy

Widebody fleet decisions are, at the end of the day, financial decisions for a major airline. SWISS's timing reflects the airline's reality as a long-haul carrier. It needs aircraft that can deliver efficiency gains while supporting the needs of its global network. Airbus positions the A350 as a step-change in terms of fuel burn and operating economics in comparison to older generations. SWISS's selection of the Airbus A350-900 aligns with a broader fleet modernization narrative.

Here, efficiency supports both overall cost control and sustainability goals. The A350 is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, with longer-term ambitions to raise that certification level as fuel supply chains continue to evolve. For SWISS, these are advantages that matter because premium product upgrades on their own do not compensate for structurally higher unit costs seen on older aircraft.

The Airbus A350 gives SWISS a more modern platform to operate premium cabins, helping the carrier defend its margins, and its retrofit strategy highlights a longer-term vision. Its staged nature showcases SWISS's interest in avoiding grounding too much capacity at once, something essential for a network carrier that is looking to balance seasonality and bank structures. It is looking to continue building out its premium footprint while delivering the products that customers want and will pay high fares for.

What Does This Say About SWISS's Premium Strategy?

The SWISS story is certainly important in itself, but the bigger point is the message that the airline is sending to the market and to competitors. The carrier is highlighting that premium traffic is its specialty and that the carrier is investing accordingly. SWISS Senses is routinely framed as the airline's most important long-haul product investment, and one that the carrier believes is helping pull it ahead of some competitors.

The details of these cabin modifications lean increasingly on the upscale side, with private first-class suites and business seating options clearly catering to the modern high-end traveler. Critically, SWISS is trying to avoid a common premium pitfall, with a fantastic seat on one aircraft type and a previous-generation experience on another.

The airline plans on pretty much resolving this problem by the end of the decade. There is also something to be said about the airline's decision to reinvest in first-class cabins. The carrier's decision to keep building premium cabins highlights that it remains focused on serving not just premium travelers, but ultra-high-spending clientele.

The Bottom Line

SWISS's long-haul product refresh over the next five years is a coordinated twin-track upgrade plan. The airline's new Airbus A350s and SWISS Senses cabin concept will join forces to elevate the airline's product offerings. The Airbus A350 is increasingly becoming a flagship for airlines all across the globe, and this airline is not different. The airline's ability to deploy premium metal on high-yield routes will become a key point of attraction for investors.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/senses.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-30 22:56:50.189620

The company hopes its corn-based ethanol can power cleaner jet fuel and keep the industry afloat as the world shifts away from fossil fuels. Supporters hail SAF as the next frontier of green energy, but skeptics question whether it is truly sustainable or merely a repackaging of traditional ethanol. Turning corn into jet fuel may sound like climate progress, yet it maintains the same industrial system, one still tied to carbon, land, and water costs.

The global push for SAF gained momentum after the 2015 Paris Agreement, when world leaders committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Soon after, both the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) issued their own pledges, acknowledging aviation’s growing contribution to climate change. In 2024, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker renewed this momentum at the SAF Conference in Rosemont, announcing plans to to make Illinois a hub for sustainable fuel development. With its strong agricultural base and expanding climate incentives, including a $1.50 per gallon tax credit and CEJA provisions, which include the phase out of carbon emissions from energy and transit, Illinois appears well-positioned to take a leading role in net zero aviation.

Despite this optimism, we should be cautious about buying into the hype. Achieving net zero aviation remains a distant goal. The IATA projects that SAF must supply 65 percent of jet fuel by 2050, yet current production covers less than one percent of global demand. U.S. agencies aim to replace all domestic jet fuel with SAFs by 2050, but in 2024 output barely reached 30 million gallons, far short of the three billion gallons needed by 2030. Closing that gap would require orders of magnitude more feedstock and infrastructure than currently exists.

Most SAFs are made from fats and oils through the HEFA process, often using food-grade feedstocks such as corn and soy. This raises concerns about deforestation, competition with food production, and limited carbon reduction benefits. Even optimistic analyses acknowledge that crop-based SAF offers modest emissions reductions–if any–once land-use change and fertilizer use are factored in. And because aviation demand continues to rise, SAF doesn’t so much eliminate emissions as attempt to slow their growth.

Scaling SAF production to the levels envisioned by the aviation industry appears impractical. Meeting these targets would require a massive expansion of corn and soy cultivation, far beyond what current farmland can support without displacing food crops. Advocates suggest this could occur on marginal land, but such land is scarce, and determining what qualifies as marginal is far from straightforward. In the United States, more than 75 percent of available farmland is already dedicated to food, feed, and exports, while much of the remainder consists of grasslands, wetlands, and forests that store carbon and support biodiversity. Converting these areas would undermine the very sustainability SAF proponents claim to advance.

Policy and politics further complicate the SAF hype. The Inflation Reduction Act created a tax credit to promote SAF, starting at $1.25 per gallon for fuels cutting emissions by at least 50 percent. Initially, only SAFs meeting strict ICAO standards qualified, excluding high-emission corn ethanol. However, after lobbying by ethanol producers, the government adopted the GREET model, which downplays land-use emissions, allowing corn- and soy-based fuels to qualify. The Biden administration even funded adjustments to make this possible. Governor Pritzker’s participation in the 2024 SAF Conference, which was actually organized by IL Corn Growers Association, highlights how policy, politics, and powerful farm interests now shape the SAF public narrative.

All of this raises a fundamental question: Is SAF a climate strategy, or simply a new market for the same old system? The facts point toward the latter. SAF, as currently envisioned, relies heavily on commodity crops that already strain soils, waterways, and rural economies. Scaling corn- or soy-based aviation fuel would increase fertilizer use, accelerate erosion, and place even more pressure on marginal lands—all while delivering minimal climate benefit.

Illinois has an opportunity to lead, but leadership doesn’t mean chasing every “green” market offered by the industries we already subsidize. True climate leadership would focus on reducing aviation demand, accelerating efficiency, and developing SAF pathways that do not depend on vast quantities of food-grade crops. It would also mean investing in agricultural diversification, soil restoration, perennial crops, and regional food supply chains—strategies that strengthen rural communities rather than tying them to another volatile commodity cycle.

SAF may have a role to play in aviation’s future. But treating corn and soy as the backbone of that future is neither sustainable nor realistic. The state should resist the temptation to replicate the ethanol era at 30,000 feet. A cleaner aviation system—and a healthier agricultural system—will require innovation, not a rebranded version of the status quo.",https://prairierivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SAF-Blog-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 23:56:15.706736

The new levy will apply to air tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from October 1, 2026. The move is being hailed as a major step towards decreasing emissions in the aviation sector, especially with the country looking to achieve a 3 percent to 5 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption rate by 2030.

Singapore’s green fuel levy decoded

Here’s a quick look at who’s affected by the green fuel levy in Singapore, the amount to be paid, and more:

The amount paid will depend on the travel class and the distance travelled.

Economy and premium economy travellers will pay SGD 1 for flights to Southeast Asia.

Those travelling to Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea in an economy cabin will have to pay SGD 2.80, whereas those travelling in a premium cabin will have to pay SGD 11.20.

Passengers in an economy cabin, travelling to Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand, will have to pay SGD 2.80, whereas those in a premium cabin will have to pay SGD 25.60 for the same destinations.

Those in an economy cabin will have to pay SGD 10.40, whereas those in a premium cabin will have to pay SGD 41.60 for a flight to the Americas.

Passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore will not be charged.

For passengers travelling on flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Cargo flights will also have to pay the levy, which will be charged on a per-kg basis.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel can be made from a variety of sources, including used cooking oil, municipal waste, or directly from captured carbon.

The collected funds will go into a reserve that will be used for the centralised purchase of SAF. According to a report on Channel News Asia, the airline that collects the levy must display the charges as a distinct line item on the air ticket being sold.

This cooperation focuses on identifying natural hydrogen production zones, establishing logistics corridors, and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure.
Despite this focus on white hydrogen, SOHAR remains committed to advancing green hydrogen initiatives.
Additionally, SOHAR has partnered with a Swiss consortium to explore establishing a green hydrogen corridor between Oman and Switzerland.","MUSCAT, NOV 30 — The recent discovery of naturally occurring hydrogen, also known as native or white hydrogen, in Suhar has bolstered prospects for its development as a key resource in advancing the decarbonisation objectives of SOHAR Port and Freezone, a senior official from the maritime hub stated.

Emile Hoogsteden, CEO of SOHAR, emphasized the port’s ongoing partnership with Swiss natural hydrogen specialist HYNAT SA to explore subsurface hydrogen reserves in the area. Unlike conventional hydrogen, white hydrogen is geologically formed and naturally present within the Earth’s crust, presenting an opportunity for direct extraction from underground reservoirs as a clean, low-carbon energy source.

“Reserves in this region have been confirmed,” Hoogsteden said. “The next step involves extraction testing to evaluate feasibility and energy yield. Should this prove viable, it could supply a direct, low-carbon fuel source to industries within SOHAR,” he added during an interview with The Energy Year, a UK-based business intelligence platform.

In July, SOHAR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HYNAT SA aimed at developing a comprehensive natural hydrogen value chain in Oman. This cooperation focuses on identifying natural hydrogen production zones, establishing logistics corridors, and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure. Earlier in February, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals had also signed an MoU granting HYNAT the rights to conduct feasibility studies.

Despite this focus on white hydrogen, SOHAR remains committed to advancing green hydrogen initiatives. Hoogsteden stated, “We are also pursuing green hydrogen development at SOHAR to further strengthen its position as a green manufacturing hub.”

Dr. Abdullah al Abri, Vice President — Sustainability at SOHAR, highlighted the port’s strong existing hydrogen demand, driven by its refinery, petrochemical, and DRI-based steel industries. He described SOHAR as a natural national hub for green hydrogen production. The strategic approach involves starting with small pilot projects to build expertise and confidence. Currently, an investment proposal is being finalized to install 80–100 MW of grid-connected electrolysers, providing a continuous hydrogen supply to port industries and mitigating the intermittency challenges associated with standalone renewable sources.

On The Energy Talks platform, Dr. Al Abri explained that this strategy minimizes investment risk by leveraging the existing grid, which is already about 11% renewable and expected to reach 30% by 2030. This setup allows for the use of renewable energy certificates and guarantees a reliable, uninterrupted hydrogen supply to end users.

Additionally, SOHAR has partnered with a Swiss consortium to explore establishing a green hydrogen corridor between Oman and Switzerland. This collaboration builds on a 2023 intergovernmental framework agreement to develop a joint implementation road map and related projects, reflecting both nations’ shared carbon neutrality goals.

Dr. Al Abri underscored hydrogen’s strategic significance for SOHAR. The port currently supports various industries and LNG bunkering operations, with plans to advance methanation as the next phase. As biofuel industries expand, their biogenic CO₂ emissions could be utilized to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other green fuels. This pathway aligns closely with SOHAR’s long-term decarbonisation strategy, in which hydrogen plays a central role.

Last week in Singapore business, the Ministry of Health is set to revamp Integrated Shield Plan riders from April 2026. Full-deductible coverage will be removed, and the annual co-payment cap will increase to at least $6,000, with premiums expected to fall by around 30%.

Economists expect Singapore’s economic growth to moderate in 2026 after a strong 2025 driven by AI-related demand, electronics exports, and a robust construction pipeline. The gross domestic product growth is forecast at 2.1–3%, with potential headwinds including slowing exports and ongoing trade risks such as US tariffs.

The economy is anticipated to normalise rather than face a sharp slowdown, supported by continued activity in finance, construction, and digital services.

Inflation is also projected to rise to around 1.5% in 2026, reflecting domestic cost adjustments and policy measures including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy, higher carbon taxes, and rising electricity tariffs. Core inflation is expected to mirror this pace, though offsets such as lower childcare fee caps may help moderate overall price pressures.

The housing market will also see change, as the supply of HDB flats reaching their minimum occupation period (MOP) is set to more than double from 2026. Newer flats may command higher rents, widening estate-level disparities, whilst rising numbers of Employment Pass and work-pass holders are expected to support demand for smaller units and room rentals.

Overall rental growth is forecast to remain moderate at 1% to 3%.

With operators projecting subdued revenue and profit growth alongside rising supply and softer trading metrics, Singapore’s hotel market is also set for a weaker 2025.

Meanwhile, the rollout of robotaxis in Singapore remains a long-term prospect. Widespread adoption is unlikely within the next five years due to public trust issues, regulatory hurdles, technical limitations, and unresolved liability concerns.

Early deployments are expected in controlled environments such as university campuses, industrial parks, and last-mile shuttle routes, with longer-term opportunities in autonomous software, system development, and complementary transport services.

Supporting small businesses, CIMB Singapore has launched the CIMB Founders Card, offering sole proprietors and entrepreneurs easier access to working-capital funding.

The card provides flexible documentation, extended interest-free periods of up to 114 days, and business-friendly perks such as airport lounge access, travel insurance, and discounts on co-working spaces. Early users report that it helps manage seasonal expenses, inventory, and growth initiatives.

In media and entertainment, StarHub and Mediacorp are merging platforms to simplify TV navigation and strengthen local broadcasters against global streaming rivals. The unified system will provide easier access to premium content, including the Premier League and thousands of hours of live sports and Asian programming, whilst also enhancing audience tracking and advertising effectiveness over the coming year.

Singapore has claimed the top spot in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index, overtaking Switzerland. The city-state ranks first globally for formal education, regulatory environment, and generalist adaptive skills, while improvements in talent retention have further boosted its standing.

Leadership stability in Singapore is reflected in corporate governance, with listed-company CEOs holding the longest average tenure in Asia-Pacific at 8.8 years, well above the regional average of 5.9 years and the global average of 7.2 years.

Applicable Policy and Categorization. AIIB’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), including the Environment and Social Standards (ESSs) and the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL), will apply to this Project. ESS 1 (Environmental and Social Assessment and Management) is applicable for assessment of environmental and social (ES) impacts of Project activities. ESS 2 (Involuntary Resettlement) may be triggered for access road works and the development of an associated high voltage distribution line (DL) that will be implemented prior to operations, but ESS 3 (Indigenous Peoples) is not expected to apply to this Project as neither the biorefinery nor pipelines are located in or near Indigenous Peoples’ land. The Project has been determined as Category A in accordance with the ESF. This assignation has been made considering the sensitive social context with low income communities present in proximity to the biorefinery and pipeline route; construction on contaminated land and elevated health risks to workers during construction; elevated reputational risks around feedstock supply chain including for Soybean Oil (SBO) and Used Cooking Oil (UCO); and the nature and scale of the biorefinery process and associated emissions and health, safety and emergency risks, alone and in-combination with the existing refinery complex and pipelines.

Environmental and Social Instruments. The Client has developed a suite of ES assessments and management plans for the biorefinery and pipelines under Brazilian legislation that are largely consistent with AIIB’s ESF. The pipelines and minor works at the port facility are addressed through the Environmental Impact Analysis Report: Application for Alteration License (LA) - Expansion of operations at the Madre de Deus Terminal (Transpetro, April 2025). The biorefinery works are covered by the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Renewable Fuels Production Plant, volumes 1-4 (Acelen, September 2025). A Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) has also been prepared for conformity with ESS1 and other key instruments are available including a quantitative risk assessment and health impact assessment and management plan for works on contaminated land. Additional assessment and management instruments are committed by the Client or in development to address outstanding gaps against the ESF. These include finalization of a critical habitat assessment (CHA) and ES management instruments for the TL. The Client is developing an Integrated Management System (IMS) for construction and operation based on an existing fully developed IMS for the Mataripe Refinery. This is considered compliant with ESS1 in relation to Environmental and Social Management Systems (ESMS) and the Client has strong institutional capacity to develop, implement and monitor management system performance.

Environmental Aspects. The HEFA facility will be implemented on brownfield land that will be decontaminated. The Client is identifying and managing risks in accordance with good international industry practice (GIIP). The HEFA plant will utilize contracted Soybean Oil (SBO), Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and is capable of processing other vegetable oils and tallow as feedstock. Soybean production has been linked to deforestation in Brazil. The importance of managing feedstock risks is recognized by the Client and reflected in a suite of mitigations. Biodiversity risks have been considered and impacts on critical habitat are not presently anticipated. The HEFA plant and pipelines are located within areas of natural (although heavily anthropized) habitat and will result in the loss of ~1,500 trees. The Client is committed to achieving no net loss in accordance with ESS1. Assessment of biodiversity risk associated with the high voltage distribution line is committed. During operation, the HEFA plant will emit pollutants including carbon oxides nitrogen (NOX and NO2) and sulfur oxides (SOX and SO2) from across three stacks. Pollution abatement technologies are included in the design, and the Client is committed to achieving GIIP for emissions to air as per the World Bank Group EHS Guidelines for Oleochemical Manufacturing. The change in local air quality as a result of biorefinery emissions in combination with emissions from the existing refinery are small and not significant for human health. Additional potential environmental risks from HEFA plant construction and operations include water consumption and water discharge, energy consumption, waste management, noise emissions, hazardous materials management and risks of pollution incidents. The Client has developed outline management plans aligned with GIIP for managing these risks that will be further elaborated as the project approaches construction and then operations.

Social and Gender Aspects. The Project is expected to deliver substantial social benefits, including employment generation, local economic development, contributions to Brazil’s energy transition, and the enhancement of technical expertise in the production of SAF and RD. There is no need for land acquisition and no legacy issues related to land acquisition or resettlement for the biorefinery or the associated pipeline, which will be constructed within an existing RoW. It is possible that small areas of land may be required for access roads and the DL but this is not yet confirmed. A Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) consistent with ESS 2 is committed in case this issue is realized. The Project will not be implemented on Indigenous Peoples’ lands. Other relevant social risks include community health and safety impacts from construction activities, potential tensions related to security personnel, risks of sexual harassment and exploitation (SH&E), and the influx of non-local workers. Safeguards to mitigate these risks in relation to labor rights, gender-based violence, and worker protection are included for in Brazilian law or otherwise committed by the Client. In addition, the Project presents opportunities to advance gender equality in line with Brazil’s National Policy for Women and Bahia State’s policies on gender inclusion and equity. Gender-related risks include heightened risks of GBV, sexual harassment, and exploitation, particularly linked to the potential influx of non-local workers. The Client is committed to further assessing GBV risks and adopting GIIP for managing all gender issues.

Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Labor and Employment Conditions. The Project will involve typical construction-related OHS risks for workers, including collisions with moving machinery and vehicles, hazards associated with non-iodizing radiation, hazardous chemicals, electric shocks, working at height, confined spaces, hot works, mechanical and load-handling risks, and exposure to noise, dust, heat and vapors etc. These risks will be addressed through a comprehensive Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Program included in the Client’s Integrated Management System. In addition, Brazil has federal and state labor legislation, including requirements under the “Consolidação das Leis do Trabalho” (CLT) and “Normas Regulamentadoras” (NRs), which establish mandatory protections for workers health, safety, and fair labor conditions. In Bahia, these requirements are reinforced through the “Agenda Bahia do Trabalho Decente”, which promotes compliance with labor rights, gender equality, and safe working environments.

Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure. An SEP has been prepared and meaningful consultations on the Project were carried out in eight directly impacted communities as part of the national permitting process. In line with the SEP, stakeholder engagement will continue throughout the Project cycle to ensure transparent communication and responsiveness to community concerns. In accordance with Brazilian law, the environmental assessment and management documentation prepared to obtain the permits for the biorefinery and pipelines were published on the website of the Environment and Water Resources Institute (“Instituto do Meio Ambiente e Recursos Hídricos” -INEMA) as part of the consultation process. The pipeline LA, biorefinery EIA and a non-technical summary (in English and Portuguese), and the Project SEP were subsequently disclosed on the Acelen Renewables’ website on 29 November 2025 at: https://www.acelenrenovaveis.com.br/biorrefinaria-adicionais/.

Airlines took a hit during the pandemic, as did so many global industries. But in 2024, annual air travel returned to pre-pandemic levels and according to Bain & Company’s July 2025 report Air Travel Forecast to 2040: Geopolitics and the Carbon Challenge, the long-term outlook for air travel is expected to remain stable. The management consultancy expects global revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) to reach 14.8 trillion by 2040 or 178 percent of 2019 volume. This demand will be driven by both mature and emerging markets. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) February 2025 report Air Passenger Demand Forecasting: The Future of Global Air Travel (2024 to 2044) expects demand to be driven by both mature markets like Europe where the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of annual passenger traffic is expected to be 2.5 percent and emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific where CAGR is slated to hit 5.1 percent through 2043.

But there are headwinds as far as the industry’s ability to scale up and meet this increased demand. The first issue is aircraft supply, which isn’t keeping up with demand due to issues with aerospace supply chains and skilled labor shortages. McKinsey & Company points out in its February 2025 report How Severe Is the Aircraft Shortage and What Happens Next? that airlines are keeping older aircraft in service longer.

The other pressing issue? Sustainability.

Mandated Sustainability

“It’s not just an environmental imperative, it’s actually an economic survival strategy,” said Pedro de la Fuente, IATA’s senior manager, sustainability, The Americas. “From an industry standpoint, we need to ensure that we reduce lifecycle emissions in a way that will help aviation maintain a license to operate as we see more governments tightening climate regulations.”

Governments around the globe began implementing regulations following the signing of the Paris Agreement at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Nearly 200 countries signed a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), outlining their plans to reduce carbon emissions in order to reach the agreement's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels so emissions can reach net zero by 2050. This has since led to various net zero coalitions such as the UN-backed Race to Zero, which has been signed by thousands of companies, cities and educational institutions.

Alternative Aircraft

One way of addressing sustainability issues and the scarcity of new aircraft is by looking to electric, hydrogen-powered and hybrid aircraft. While these technologies are still in development and show some promise, de la Fuente noted that they also face an uncertain future due to scalability and adoption. “We don’t have the capacity today to charge an aircraft at a speed that allows for a quick turnaround flight, nor do we have the capacity to supply green hydrogen in our airport fuel supply,” he said.

Nevertheless, these alternatively-powered aircraft are expected to have a place in the broader aviation landscape. Medical supply delivery, passenger transport and natural disaster response in remote locations can all benefit from the efficiency of global Advanced Air Mobility, which the World Economic Forum makes a case for in its 2024 whitepaper Advanced Air Mobility: Shaping the Future of Aviation. This new air transportation system deploys automated aircraft including drones and Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) air taxis that are electric and sustainable. They also have the ability to shuttle passengers between urban and suburban locations as well as potentially offer more regional transit.

Aviation’s Reduction Efforts

After the Paris Agreement took effect, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2016. Now voluntary, this program will become mandatory for all international airlines in 2027. Intended to control carbon emissions from international flights as demand increases, CORSIA requires airlines to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or carbon offset credits. This is no small commitment.

The carbon emissions produced by the aviation industry have garnered particular attention. In September, World Travel & Tourism Council President Gloria Guevara said that transport accounts for 40 percent of the travel industry’s emissions. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), carbon emissions from aviation grew faster than rail, road or shipping between 2000 and 2019. By 2023, the IEA put aviation-produced carbon emissions at 90 percent of their pre-Covid peak.

The Carbon Offset Market

One approach to reaching net zero is the purchase of carbon offset credits or certificates. Organizations like Sustainable Travel International (STI) give both businesses, individuals and even destinations the ability to do this. The organization’s website features a calculator that can be used to measure the total carbon footprint of any given trip, including corporate travel, or business operation such as an event and then purchase an equivalent number of credits to mitigate that footprint. Credits go towards a variety of projects that ultimately provide a balance to the amount of carbon we produce. This includes reforestation, marshland and mangrove preservation, clean energy production and new climate technology.

STI’s CEO Paloma Zapata encourages travel for the experience to connect with other people and experience different cultures. She also adds “it’s important for people to be aware of the transition away from fossil fuels and to support it so that in the future, it’s not ‘sustainable travel,’ but simply how we travel.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Among the new climate tech that credits can support is sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. Unlike fossil-derived fuel, SAF is comprised of renewable or even waste products such as cooking oil, agricultural waste or captured carbon dioxide combined with hydrogen produced by solar or wind-generated electricity. SAF is purposefully designed for today’s commercial aircraft, but both expensive and limited in availability. According to the IATA roadmap, sustainable aviation fuel can represent up to 65% of the emissions reductions that the industry can achieve by 2050. “The scalability of where we are today in 2025 is mainly driven by SAF and addressing any residual emissions with carbon offsets to compensate,” said de la Fuente.

Scaling SAF production requires a greater volume of the materials used to produce it as well as greater development of and investment in the advanced technologies needed to scale up. Governmental support can accelerate SAF production at scale, but political involvement is largely limited to emissions regulations and in some cases, imposing relatively new taxes on a business’ carbon emissions.

To counter this, the aviation industry has turned to SAF certificates. Somewhat similar to purchasing carbon offset credits, SAF certificates directly and exclusively fund SAF production and the technologies and materials needed to produce it at scale. The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) is a prominent organization selling SAF certificates. “We’re focused on keeping the investment in the value chain, so SAF certificate investment goes directly to SAF production facilities and more importantly, it promotes technology change,” says Andre de Fontaine, managing director at the Center for Green Market Activation, which serves as SABA’s Secretariat. “Investment in SAF certificates creates a new revenue stream for these fuel producers to scale production.”

A Challenging Regulatory Environment

While SAF certificates are certainly beneficial, they simply aren’t enough. Some airlines give travelers the option to purchase a higher cost “green fare,” which is effectively the purchase of a SAF certificate with their ticket. But at this year’s IATA general meeting in New Delhi, CEO of Airline-FedEx and FedEx International told an audience that Americans are too cost-conscious to pay an additional cost while Europeans are more likely to make the investment.

The good news is that IATA expects SAF production to double to two million tons in 2025. That accounts for 0.7 percent of total aviation fuel demand. With EU and UK mandates taking effect at the start of 2025, the majority of that production will go to Europe. Those mandates have also led to a spike in Europe’s SAF costs.

What’s more, Bain & Company’s December 2024 analysis Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Supply Race Is On found that European production is expected to hit a 20 percent shortfall of mandate requirements by 2030. On top of that, the EU prohibits SAF production that relies on certain feedstocks such as corn, soybeans, cooking oil and animal fats because this may cause land use and food production to compete with SAF production. Without one of the most developed means of SAF production, the industry will have to quickly ramp up development of alternative feedstocks and latent technologies. The alternative is to import feedstock. As any importation generates carbon emissions, this would negate the purpose of SAF mandates. Although the UNFCCC only requires reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from domestic production, not imports. So on paper, importing SAF materials could potentially show a net positive.

“Coordination at the regulatory level globally would be helpful,” said de Fontaine. “Different regulatory jurisdictions have different views of what is sustainable and the EU has taken an aggressive view on keeping SAF focused on waste residues and avoiding associated feedstocks, which is creating some confusion among investors in SAF production. Different requirements in different jurisdictions is fragmenting the market a bit.”

At the aforementioned IATA conference, Pieter Elbers, CEO of India’s largest airline IndiGo, pointed out that SAF isn’t available in the country and he doesn’t see the point in importing. Instead, he looks to other means of driving sustainability, including maintaining a newer fleet and turning to electric ground operations.

In addition to those options, airlines globally are also looking to improve sustainability efforts by recycling plastics used onboard, composting food waste, improving flight planning and optimizing routing.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/Custom_Content/Sales/Thought_Leadership/AdobeStock_desk_468763206.jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-11-30 16:56:11.582330

Eight OPEC+ countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, recently held a virtual meeting. They discussed global market conditions and future strategies. These nations had previously announced voluntary production adjustments in April and November 2023.

The group confirmed their decision to halt production increases for January through March 2026 due to seasonal factors. They emphasised that the 1.65 million barrels per day could be reinstated partially or fully based on market developments. This approach allows for flexibility in response to changing conditions.

In their commitment to market stability, the countries stressed the importance of a cautious strategy. They plan to continue pausing or reversing voluntary production adjustments as needed. This includes the 2.2 million barrels per day adjustment announced in November 2023.

The eight countries reiterated their dedication to achieving full compliance with the Declaration of Cooperation. This includes adhering to additional voluntary production adjustments monitored by the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC). They also aim to compensate for any excess production since January 2024.

Monthly meetings will be held by these nations to evaluate market conditions, compliance levels, and compensation efforts. This ongoing assessment ensures they remain aligned with their collective goals.

The collaborative efforts of these OPEC+ members highlight their commitment to maintaining market balance while adapting to evolving circumstances. Their strategic decisions are crucial for stabilising oil markets globally.

The recent discovery of naturally occurring hydrogen — also known as native or white hydrogen — in the Wilayat of Suhar has strengthened expectations around its potential development and use in advancing the decarbonisation goals of SOHAR Port and Freezone, according to a senior official of the maritime hub.

Emile Hoogsteden, CEO of SOHAR, highlighted the port’s ongoing collaboration with Swiss natural hydrogen specialist HYNAT SA in exploring subsurface hydrogen in the region. Natural or white hydrogen is geologically generated and found naturally in the Earth’s crust, offering the prospect of direct production from underground reservoirs as a clean, low-carbon energy source.

“Reserves in the area are confirmed and the next stage is extraction testing to assess feasibility and energy potential” Hoogsteden said. “If viable, it would provide a direct, low-carbon fuel source for Sohar’s industries”, he added in an interview with The Energy Year, a UK-based business intelligence platform.

In July, SOHAR signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with HYNAT SA to advance the development of a full natural hydrogen value chain in Oman. The collaboration focuses on identifying and assessing natural hydrogen production zones, developing logistics corridors and creating dedicated storage and processing infrastructure. Earlier in February, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals had also signed an MoU granting HYNAT rights to carry out feasibility studies.

This interest in white hydrogen does not diminish SOHAR’s commitment to green hydrogen. “We are also looking to develop green hydrogen in SOHAR and further strengthen SOHAR’s position as a green manufacturing hub”, Hoogsteden noted.

According to Dr Abdullah al Abri, Vice President — Sustainability, SOHAR already hosts strong hydrogen demand from its refinery, petrochemical and DRI-based steel industries, positioning the port as a natural national hub for green hydrogen production. He said the strategy is to begin with small pilot projects to build experience and confidence, including an investment case now being finalised to install 80–100 MW of grid-connected electrolysers that can supply continuous hydrogen to port industries and avoid the intermittency associated with standalone renewables.

Speaking on The Energy Talks platform, Dr Al Abri explained that this approach de-risks investment, noting that renewables are capital-intensive and often require storage. Connecting electrolysers to a grid that is already about 11% renewable — and expected to reach 30% by 2030 — provides flexibility, enables the use of renewable energy certificates and ensures reliable, uninterrupted hydrogen supply to end users.

He added that SOHAR has also established a partnership with a Swiss consortium to explore a green corridor between Oman and Switzerland, with both countries sharing carbon-neutrality goals and building on a 2023 intergovernmental framework agreement to develop an implementation road map and associated projects.

According to Dr Al Abri, hydrogen is a strategic commodity for SOHAR. The port already supports a range of industries and LNG bunkering, with methanation identified as the next step. As biofuel industries develop, their biogenic CO₂ streams can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other green fuels — a pathway closely aligned with SOHAR’s long-term decarbonisation agenda, in which hydrogen remains a central pillar.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/11/30/thumbs/600x600/3208228.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:56:35.910136

The National Automotive and Vehicles Academy (NAVA) has partnered with CEER, Saudi Arabia's first homegrown electric vehicle brand, to introduce an Intermediate Diploma Program in Automotive Manufacturing Technology. This collaboration was formalised during the ""Generation Future Day"" at the 21st General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in Riyadh, under the auspices of Minister of Industry and Mineral Resources Bandar Alkhorayef.

This initiative aims to bolster Saudi Arabia's automotive sector by training 300 local trainees over the coming years. The program is designed to enhance national capabilities in electric vehicle manufacturing, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030's objectives to develop competitive national industries. By focusing on industrial localisation and productivity, it seeks to prepare a new generation of Saudi talent ready to lead the sector.

Mohammed Al-Suhaim, Managing Director of NAVA Academy, highlighted that this agreement extends the academy’s commitment to supporting national industrial transformation. He stated: ""At NAVA, we are proud to be an active partner in developing the electric vehicle sector in the Kingdom. Our role goes beyond delivering training programs; it extends to empowering Saudi youth to join high-quality jobs within leading national companies like CEER, which enhances the presence of national talents in modern industries.""

CEER's Chief Executive James DeLuca emphasised their dedication to nurturing local talent as a catalyst for innovation and growth. He remarked: ""As part of our role in igniting the Kingdom’s automotive industry, we believe that developing national talent is a key driver of innovation and growth. As a founding partner of NAVA, we are committed to equipping Saudi technicians with the knowledge and skills needed to lead the future of the automotive sector in the Kingdom.""

This strategic partnership not only supports industrial goals but also contributes significantly towards achieving Saudi Vision 2030. By focusing on training and qualifying local talent, it aims to create a skilled workforce capable of advancing modern industries within Saudi Arabia. The collaboration between NAVA and CEER is expected to play a crucial role in shaping the future of automotive manufacturing technology in the region.

The agreement reflects a broader effort to enhance national productivity by fostering skills development among young Saudis. It underscores a commitment to building a robust foundation for sustainable growth within the automotive sector while ensuring that local talents are well-prepared for emerging opportunities.

This initiative marks an important step towards realising Saudi Arabia's ambitions for its automotive industry. By equipping trainees with essential skills and knowledge, it lays the groundwork for future leaders who will drive innovation and progress within this vital sector.

Allt som kallas hållbart är det inte heller: vissa nya bränslen kan ge lika stora klimatutsläpp som fossila bränslen.

Miljöorganisationer har länge ifrågasatt flygbranschens visioner av ett fortsatt men hållbart flygande. Men nu görs detta även på grundval av en ekonomisk analys. Carbon Tracker, som gett ut en rapport om frågan, är en finansiell tankesmedja som hjälper företag och investerare på vägen mot ett mindre fossilberoende.

Slam, avfall och sockerrör

Hållbart flygbränsle, kallat SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), är flytande bränslen tillverkade med olika tekniker och utifrån olika råvaror. Råvarorna kan vara skogs- och jordbruksrester, avloppsslam och avfall, men även energigrödor och matgrödor som sockerrör och majs.

Den stora fördelen med dessa bränslen är att de är så lika vanligt jetbränsle: det är bara att fylla på dem i flygplanet. Den stora nackdelen är att just denna likhet ger bränslena samma utsläpp som jetbränslet när de förbränns. En eventuell klimatvinst måste därför komma från själva råvaran.

Enligt Carbon Trackers rapport finns det en rad hinder för utvecklingen av hållbart flygbränsle. Några handlar om regler och ekonomi. Somliga delar av världen, som EU, har regler som kräver en viss inblandning av SAF, men andra har det inte. Flygbranschen arbetar allmänt sett med en kort tidshorisont, men detta är ett område som kräver långsiktiga satsningar. SAF-projekt är också ofta komplicerade och dyra, vilket kan avskräcka investerare.

Begränsade mängder

Flygresenärer kan idag välja ett tillägg som ger en viss del hållbart flygbränsle i en resa. Men det kostar lite mer, och alla gör det inte – som Mattias Goldmann nyligen påpekade i en fristående krönika i Supermiljöbloggen, så gjordes det inte ens av de svenskar som deltog i COP-mötet i Brasilien. Och om många skulle efterfråga hållbart flygbränsle, så skulle detta helt enkelt inte räcka till.

De mest lätthanterliga rest-råvarorna till sådant bränsle, som överbliven frityrolja, finns nämligen inte alls i tillräckliga mängder. Jord- och skogsbruksrester finns det mer av, men dessa måste först samlas in från stora arealer och transporteras långa sträckor, vilket blir dyrt. Kommunalt avfall består av många olika ämnen och kan behöva försorteras eller förbehandlas. Och att odla råvaror särskilt för att bli bränslen ger stora utsläpp.

Vissa alternativa bränslen, särskilt de som bygger på mat- eller fodergrödor, ger nästan lika stora klimatutsläpp som fossila bränslen eller till och med mer, heter det i rapporten.

Många andra intressenter

Både branschen och politikerna måste också ta hänsyn till andra möjliga användningar av råvarorna. Skogs- och jordbruksrester kan till exempel också användas i värmeverk. Avloppsslam kan bli gödning, och överbliven matolja kan gå till plast- och kosmetikaindustrin. Här behövs en noggrann analys som kan visa var respektive råvara gör bäst klimatnytta.

Enligt Carbon Tracker lär kortare sträckor ganska snart kunna flygas på batterier eller vätebaserade bränsleceller. Då bör de begränsade mängderna av hållbart flygbränsle sparas till längre sträckor. Möjligen kan så kallade elektrobränslen, syntetiskt framställda bränslen med vätgas och koldioxid som bas, komma in i framtiden. Men andra åtgärder måste också till, menar man: en större bränsleeffektivitet, bättre trafikledning och policybeslut som kan minska efterfrågan på flygresor.",https://supermiljobloggen.se/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/airbus-8607152-1280-600x422.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:56:41.349293

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.
These measures have helped strengthen consumer confidence in original products and underscore the societal value of intellectual property rights.","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has signed a new material transfer agreement (MTA) with the Arabian Petroleum Supply Company (Apsco), under which Apsco will supply KAUST with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for research on next-generation low-emission fuels.

According to a KAUST press release, the collaboration comes at a critical time for the aviation industry.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines are required to use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050—targets that remain out of reach with today’s fuel technologies. Meanwhile, global SAF demand is expected to surge from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and 75 million by 2040, SPA reported.

Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im will lead the research, which will focus on the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the provided fuels. The new data on fuel behavior, emissions characteristics, and performance metrics will build a comprehensive database that will develop models for the creation of future SAF formulations of higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.

“This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,” said Sarathy. “Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.”

The release also highlighted that globally, the aviation industry is increasingly turning to create predictive models for fuel behavior from partial datasets, reducing development cycles from years to months. Beyond fuel design, the project will help bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently slow SAF adoption worldwide, from understanding emissions behavior to assessing how fuels perform across a range of operating environments. By answering these fundamental questions, the partnership will enable industry and regulators to make faster, more informed decisions about future SAF deployment.

Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari stated, “This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic. Through this agreement, our role goes beyond supplying fuel for testing; we are helping build the scientific and technical foundation that can enable Saudi-developed SAF technologies in the years ahead.”

Moreover, as Saudi Arabia expands its aviation network and explores domestic SAF production opportunities, the ability to test and validate fuel properties within the Kingdom scientifically becomes increasingly essential. Building local research infrastructure accelerates certification, supports national sustainability targets, and strengthens the country’s position in the future global aviation fuel market. With research facilities already in place, KAUST will provide the scientific foundation needed to accelerate domestic SAF research in the Kingdom, supporting the goals of the Saudi Aviation Strategy to advance low-carbon, next generation energy technologies.

Saudi Arabia achieved a new international milestone by ranking among the top performers in the Global intellectual property perception survey 2025 (WIPO Pulse), issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which surveyed 35,500 participants from 74 countries to assess public awareness of intellectual property and its economic and social impact.

The Kingdom ranked among the highest globally in awareness of the role of intellectual property in supporting the economy, with national awareness of its impact on economic growth and innovation reaching approximately 80%, placing it at the top of this global indicator, according to SPA.

Saudi Arabia also recorded notable growth in youth and women’s awareness of intellectual property rights, making it a leading contributor to raising the average performance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region in this area.

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.

These measures have helped strengthen consumer confidence in original products and underscore the societal value of intellectual property rights.

British finance minister Rachel Reeves on Sunday denied she misled the public over official forecasts ahead of this month's budget, saying she had been honest about the need to build up a bigger fiscal buffer.

In a speech on November 4, Reeves appeared to lay the groundwork to break the Labour Party's promise to voters before the 2024 election and raise income tax rates, citing a ""weaker than previously thought"" productivity performance.

In a letter published on Friday, the head of Britain's budget watchdog said it had also provided the government with forecasts showing that its productivity downgrade was offset by increases in real wages and inflation - which Reeves did not mention.

The letter added to questions about the government's communications ahead of Wednesday's budget. November saw big swings in the British government bond market as investors grappled with shifts in tone from the government over the prospect of tax increases.

Its publication prompted the opposition Conservative Party to demand that Reeves resign for misleading the public about the economic situation ahead of her November 26 budget.

According to Reuters, Reeves told the BBC that she intended to stay as finance minister for a long time.

""I have been underestimated all the way through my life,"" Reeves said. ""I'm proud of my budget this week.""

The confidential forecasts provided to Reeves by the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog before her November 4 speech showed she would meet her fiscal rules by a margin of 4.2 billion pounds, not including any budget measures or the reversal of welfare cuts earlier in the year.

On Sunday, Reeves told Sky News that boosting that buffer - which would have been very thin by historical standards - was her main concern, which required her to deliver a tough message to the public.

""The just over 4 billion pounds surplus was not enough,"" Reeves said. ""The headroom would not have been enough, and it would not give the Bank of England space to continue cutting interest rates.""

When the budget was announced on Wednesday, Reeves had more than doubled her headroom against the fiscal rules to 21.7 billion pounds from 9.9 billion pounds in her previous fiscal plan.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-11/1289703_0.png.webp,N,,2025-11-30 13:57:30.597958

African finance ministers attending the 2025 Africa Investment Forum (AIF) have called for a decisive shift from highlighting potential opportunities to delivering execution-ready, investment-grade projects.

Their message was clear: the continent’s transformation must be driven by private capital, not aid.

Speaking during the Ministerial Dialogue on Accelerating Private Investment Through Conducive Enabling Environments, ministers from Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mauritania, Morocco and Zambia outlined the reforms required to strengthen investor confidence, improve regulatory frameworks and build resilient business environments capable of attracting long-term funding.

Côte d’Ivoire’s Minister of Economic Planning and Development, Nialé Kaba, said Africa’s biggest obstacle remains project readiness.

“Africa’s problem is that opportunities and projects are not mature,” she said. She highlighted Côte d’Ivoire’s progress, including simplified investment codes and single-window systems that have helped lift private investment from 12% of GDP in 2020 to 20% today.

Zambia’s Minister of Finance and National Planning Situmbeko Musokotwane said the country is emerging from its debt crisis, supported by an improved credit rating.

Over the past three years, Zambia has secured nearly $2 billion in public-private partnerships and attracted more than $7 billion in new mining investment. He noted that streamlining project approvals to under 45 days has helped unlock billions in private energy investments.

Musokotwane also spotlighted the privately financed Lobito Corridor, set to become Africa’s first east-west transcontinental rail link, which will connect Zambia and the DRC to Angola’s Atlantic ports.

Morocco’s Economy and Finance Minister Nadia Fettah stressed that investors are no longer looking for potential, but for “ready projects delivered with speed and strong execution capacity.”

She urged African governments to maintain a year-round pipeline of regional projects and argued that pooling resources across borders is essential for large-scale developments in rail, aviation and data infrastructure.

Mauritania’s Minister of Economic Affairs and Development, Abdullah Suleiman Sheikh Sidiya, said Africa is increasingly seen as an investment destination rather than an aid-dependent continent.

“Africa is becoming a sought-after destination—not only for cooperation but increasingly for investment,” he said.

Guinea’s Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Ismael Nabe, underscored the role of strong project preparation in lowering investment risk. He highlighted Guinea’s UK-Export Finance-backed Administrative City as a model of replicable development, inspired by similar projects in Benin.

Nabe described the Africa Investment Forum as a “compass” for guiding co-financing and innovation. Successful initiatives in one country, he said, can be adapted across the region through blended finance tools and partnerships with institutions such as the African Development Bank Group and Middle Eastern sovereign funds.

Segundo o anúncio da Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), as passagens vendidas a partir de 1º de abril de 2026, para voos que partem de Singapura a partir de 1º de outubro de 2026, já terão incorporada a taxa.

Detalhes da medida

A taxa varia conforme destino e classe da viagem. Por exemplo, para voos dentro do Sudeste Asiático, cobrança de SGD 1 (≈ US$ 0,77) em classe econômica; para rotas longas (como às Américas) pode atingir SGD 10,40 ou mais para econômica, e valores maiores para as classes premium.

O valor arrecadado será destinado à compra centralizada de SAF, produzido a partir de óleos residuais ou biomassa, garantindo uma mistura mínima de 1% de SAF a partir de 2026, e avançando para entre 3% e 5% até 2030, conforme disponibilidade e preço do mercado.

Em paralelo, a meta da CAAS prevê que o uso obrigatório de SAF nos voos de partida de Singapura seja implementado já em 2026.

O custo da nova taxa climática para os viajantes partindo de Singapura será modesto – mas simbólico. Ela cria um mecanismo de compartilhamento de despesas entre setor aéreo, passageiros e combustíveis sustentáveis.

Embora a aviação responda por cerca de 1,2% das emissões globais de gases de efeito estufa, seu desafio de descarbonização é elevado: o SAF segue com produção limitada (em torno de 0,3% do combustível em 2023) e custo maior que o querosene fóssil tradicional.

Eventuais desafios e observações

A produção de SAF ainda está restrita: garantir mix mínimo e escala será um gargalo para que a meta de 1% em 2026 seja factível.

A comunicação ao passageiro precisa ser transparente para evitar percepções de “taxa surpresa”.

O impacto competitivo da medida será limitado em termos de preço ao consumidor, mas pode crescer se o mix de SAF precisar ser ampliado significativamente.

Com a nova taxa climática sobre passagens, Singapura buscar atuar junto à aviação de maneira mais verde. A introdução da cobrança a partir de 2026 e a obrigatoriedade do SAF representam um modelo inovador para o setor aéreo. Acompanhar como será implementada e se outras regiões seguirão será crucial para o futuro da aviação sustentável.

The growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has driven innovation in alternative fuel technologies, with synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) emerging as a viable candidate as it offers a reduction in environmental footprint compared to conventional fossil fuels. In this study, the feasibility of biomass-derived SPK was explored, utilizing corn stover as the process feedstock. The designed process integrates key thermochemical processes such as gasification, Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and hydrocracking, to convert corn stover into SPK. The process was simulated in commercial software Aspen Plus V12, where its material and energy flows were analyzed. Moreover, the Anderson-Schulz Flory distribution model was used to determine the FT product distribution. The simulation results show a 75 % molar conversion of carbon monoxide and a biomass-to-SPK conversion of 6 % was achieved. The sustainability of the developed process was assessed through its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, with syngas cleaning reducing emissions by 30.70 %, resulting in a carbon footprint of 0.58 kg CO2/kg syngas. The remaining CO2 in the FT fuel underwent flashing and adsorption, enabling 63.27 % recovery for reuse in steam and power plants. Subsequently, the total capital investment, including working and fixed capitals, were estimated. The FT-SPK pathway was proven to be costly due to the energy-intensive processes. However, a positive ROI and a payback period within 5 y were achieved. The product selling prices were also ascertained alongside a breakeven analysis to ensure that the manufacturing operation remains economically viable.",https://www.cetjournal.it/public/journals/1/favicon_en_US.png,N,,2025-11-30 13:57:35.769514

OVER 3 MLN BPD OF OUTPUT CUTS STILL IN PLACE

Brent crude closed on Friday near $63 a barrel, down 15% this year.

OPEC+ has paused oil output hikes for the first quarter of 2026 after releasing some 2.9 million barrels per day into the market since April 2025.

The group still has about 3.24 million bpd of output cuts in place, representing around 3% of global demand, and the Sunday meeting did not alter those.

OPEC said the group had approved a mechanism to assess members' maximum production capacity to be used for setting output quotas from 2027.

Saudi Arabia achieved a new international milestone by ranking among the top performers in the Global intellectual property perception survey 2025 (WIPO Pulse), issued by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which surveyed 35,500 participants from 74 countries to assess public awareness of intellectual property and its economic and social impact.

The Kingdom ranked among the highest globally in awareness of the role of intellectual property in supporting the economy, with national awareness of its impact on economic growth and innovation reaching approximately 80%, placing it at the top of this global indicator, according to SPA.

Saudi Arabia also recorded notable growth in youth and women’s awareness of intellectual property rights, making it a leading contributor to raising the average performance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region in this area.

This advanced performance reflects the efforts of the Saudi Authority for Intellectual Property to enhance public awareness of and respect for intellectual property rights, as well as to expand national initiatives aimed at improving compliance and reducing violations.

These measures have helped strengthen consumer confidence in original products and underscore the societal value of intellectual property rights.

British finance minister Rachel Reeves on Sunday denied she misled the public over official forecasts ahead of this month's budget, saying she had been honest about the need to build up a bigger fiscal buffer.

In a speech on November 4, Reeves appeared to lay the groundwork to break the Labour Party's promise to voters before the 2024 election and raise income tax rates, citing a ""weaker than previously thought"" productivity performance.

In a letter published on Friday, the head of Britain's budget watchdog said it had also provided the government with forecasts showing that its productivity downgrade was offset by increases in real wages and inflation - which Reeves did not mention.

The letter added to questions about the government's communications ahead of Wednesday's budget. November saw big swings in the British government bond market as investors grappled with shifts in tone from the government over the prospect of tax increases.

Its publication prompted the opposition Conservative Party to demand that Reeves resign for misleading the public about the economic situation ahead of her November 26 budget.

According to Reuters, Reeves told the BBC that she intended to stay as finance minister for a long time.

""I have been underestimated all the way through my life,"" Reeves said. ""I'm proud of my budget this week.""

The confidential forecasts provided to Reeves by the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog before her November 4 speech showed she would meet her fiscal rules by a margin of 4.2 billion pounds, not including any budget measures or the reversal of welfare cuts earlier in the year.

On Sunday, Reeves told Sky News that boosting that buffer - which would have been very thin by historical standards - was her main concern, which required her to deliver a tough message to the public.

""The just over 4 billion pounds surplus was not enough,"" Reeves said. ""The headroom would not have been enough, and it would not give the Bank of England space to continue cutting interest rates.""

When the budget was announced on Wednesday, Reeves had more than doubled her headroom against the fiscal rules to 21.7 billion pounds from 9.9 billion pounds in her previous fiscal plan.",https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2025-11/1289466_0.png.webp,N,,2025-11-30 12:57:12.144500

For the first time, he no longer relies on grid electricity, and year-round farming has become possible.
Young people, once determined to flee the village, are beginning to see farming as a viable livelihood rather than a last resort.
He had saved what little he could from long shifts, fully prepared to attempt the clandestine route through Djibouti.
“Now I see young people making something of themselves here, if they can get land.","In a quiet village just outside the bustling town of Batu—where Dutch-owned flower farms dominate the landscape—23-year-old Alemu Baba has chosen a path that many of his peers have long abandoned: he has become a farmer.

While most young men from his community embark on perilous journeys toward Yemen and Libya, gambling their lives for a chance to reach Europe or the Gulf, Alemu returned home. After months working as a construction laborer in Bishoftu for a wage he says “barely covered daily expenses,” he faced a future that, in his words, “looked completely empty.”

“I didn’t see a way forward in the city, and people my age thought farming had no future,” he said. “But now I’m earning enough to support my family, and I’m even planning to expand into bee farming.”

Alemu is part of a growing cohort of young people finding new promise in agriculture, aided by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), a Seoul-based organization working to modernize farming in low-income communities. Over the past two years, the Institute has introduced training and technology to roughly 400 farmers in the region, helping them shift from subsistence production to sustainable, market-oriented agriculture. The effort—funded by the Italian government under a project titled Fostering Food Security to Prevent Conflict and Ensure Stability—includes access to vermicompost, climate-smart tools, and support to help farmers become food secure and profitable.

Among the beneficiaries is Alemu’s father, 50-year-old Baba Morki, a lifelong farmer in AbjataKebele of Adami Tulu JidoKombolchaWoreda. He has witnessed not only his own transformation but that of his neighbors.

Baba has been part of the program from the start, receiving training in entrepreneurship, organic market linkages, and the use of solar-powered irrigation systems—three of which now irrigate a combined 130 hectares in an area once defined by chronic water shortages. For the first time, he no longer relies on grid electricity, and year-round farming has become possible.

“In the past, if the weather failed us, we sold livestock just to survive,” he said. “It kept us poor and without hope.”

Today, Baba says, the change is visible everywhere. Herds are growing. Income is more stable. Young people, once determined to flee the village, are beginning to see farming as a viable livelihood rather than a last resort.

“Before, our work was seasonal and labor intensive. Now we farm continuously, earn more, and finally dream bigger for our children,” he said. “They no longer need to leave home to build a future.”

Both Baba and his son have earned enough from their fields to build modern homes—an unlikely outcome just a few years ago.

GGGI, which began operations in Ethiopia in 2010, aims to help the country build a climate-resilient green economy by 2030 and reduce its reliance on emergency food aid. More than 10 million Ethiopians currently require humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.

The shift toward sustainable agriculture is also reshaping young people’s aspirations beyond the farms themselves. In Batu, 21-year-old waiter and tourism graduate Brook Teshome recalls planning his own journey abroad. He had saved what little he could from long shifts, fully prepared to attempt the clandestine route through Djibouti.

But watching farmers—including his older brother—reap the benefits of the new practices has changed his thinking.

“I used to believe the only way to succeed was to leave,” he said. “Now I see young people making something of themselves here, if they can get land. I’m even considering becoming a farmer instead of working for someone else.”

A similar transformation is underway in Bulbula, where farmer AmanGemeda has expanded his operations with the help of solar irrigation and vermicompost on land that now sits alongside the new Batu–Hawassa freeway.

Aman says that many people are seeing farming in a different light.“My experience is showing others that farming can be different—that we’re not defined by the shortages and hunger that once shaped our lives,” Aman said.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Reporter-Ethiopia.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:56:49.785182

King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has entered into a material transfer agreement with the Arabian Petroleum Supply Company (Apsco). This partnership will see Apsco supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to KAUST for research on advanced low-emission fuels. The collaboration is timely, as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to adopt cleaner fuel technologies.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines must use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, which will rise to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Current fuel technologies are insufficient to meet these targets. Global demand for SAF is projected to grow significantly, from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and reaching 75 million by 2040.

The research at KAUST will be led by Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im. Their work will concentrate on understanding the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the supplied fuels. This research aims to develop a comprehensive database that will aid in creating future SAF formulations with higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.

""This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,"" said Sarathy. ""Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.""

The aviation industry worldwide is increasingly using predictive models for fuel behavior based on partial datasets. This approach reduces development cycles from years to months. The project aims not only at designing better fuels but also at addressing knowledge gaps that hinder SAF adoption globally. By understanding emissions behavior and assessing performance across various environments, the partnership seeks to enable faster decision-making regarding SAF deployment.

Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari remarked, ""This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic.""

Strategic Importance for Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia's expanding aviation network and exploration of domestic SAF production opportunities make scientific testing of fuel properties within the Kingdom increasingly vital. Developing local research infrastructure accelerates certification processes, supports national sustainability goals, and strengthens Saudi Arabia's position in the future global aviation fuel market.

KAUST's existing research facilities provide a solid foundation for advancing domestic SAF research in line with the Saudi Aviation Strategy's objectives of promoting low-carbon energy technologies. This initiative is crucial as Saudi Arabia aims to enhance its role in sustainable aviation fuel development globally.

The alert landed at a time of day when many European airlines and Asian airlines are winding down their schedules, leaving time for repairs. In the United States, however, it came during the day ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel weekend.

U.S. carrier JetBlue said it cancelled about 70 flights that were scheduled for Sunday, with more cancellations possible. JetBlue expects to finish software updates for 120 planes by Sunday morning, but said fixes for about 30 aircraft would still be ""in progress"" at that point.

About 140 jets in the company's fleet of A320, A321 and A220 aircraft did not need the fix, the company said.

American Airlines, the world's largest A320 operator, said 209 of its 480 jets needed the fix, below initial estimates, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. United Airlines told Reuters on Saturday that all its aircraft had been updated.

AirAsia, one of the world's largest A320 customers, said it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours. India's aviation regulator said on Saturday that carriers IndiGo INGL.NS and Air India were expected to complete the process on Saturday. ANA Holdings 9202.T cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers.

Taiwan's low-cost airline Tigerair said eight flights would be delayed on Sunday due to the software issue.

Airlines must revert to a previous version of software in a computer that helps determine the nose angle of the affected jets and in some cases must also change the hardware itself, mainly on older planes in service. The fix must be completed before the planes can fly again with passengers, a process needing two to three hours per jet.

Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. Those include some of the largest and busiest low-cost carriers.

Tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays.

By Saturday, Airbus was telling airlines that repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than the original estimate of 1,000 needing the time-consuming hardware changes.

There were also unresolved questions about the impact of solar flare radiation blamed for the JetBlue incident, which is being treated by French investigators as an ""incident,"" the lowest of three categories of potential safety emergency.

""Any operational challenges that come at short notice and affecting a large part of your operation is tough to deal with,"" said UK-based aviation consultant John Strickland.

Recent Developments In Aviation Fuel Market Trends, Segmentation & Forecast 2034

Recent activity in the aviation fuel sector has been shaped strongly by new long-term supply agreements and strategic fuel-trade partnerships. One of the most significant developments came when Unipec, the trading arm of Sinopec, finalized a multi-year agreement to supply Lufthansa with around 60,000 metric tons of jet fuel per year, reinforcing stable jet-fuel availability across key airports in Germany and Belgium. This deal also reflects an expansion of Unipec’s broader aviation-fuel footprint, as the company has been supplying millions of tons of jet fuel annually across Europe and North Africa. At the same time, major airlines such as KLM have deepened cooperation with fuel traders to secure consistent access to both conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), highlighting the continued need for diversified supply channels.

Investments in sustainable aviation fuel production have accelerated sharply, with multiple energy companies and aircraft manufacturers backing large-scale commercial SAF projects. One of the largest commitments came from Ecopetrol, Colombia’s national oil company, which approved US $500-700 million for constructing a new SAF production plant integrated into its Barrancabermeja refinery. The plant is being designed to produce roughly 6,000 barrels per day once operational — a milestone that would position Colombia as a key regional supplier. Parallel to this, Airbus expanded its role beyond aircraft manufacturing by co-founding a dedicated financing alliance for SAF projects and investing directly in LanzaJet to scale its Alcohol-to-Jet production pathway. These investments illustrate how the aviation ecosystem is moving from pilot projects to industrial-scale SAF capacity backed by major energy and aerospace stakeholders.

Regulatory and operational developments have also transformed the aviation fuel landscape across major regions. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation entered key implementation phases in 2025, with mandated SAF blending requirements beginning at 2% for all EU airports and preparing for higher obligations in the coming years. This regulatory pressure has already driven airports and fuel suppliers to adjust logistics, certification, and blending infrastructure. Meanwhile, in India, Boeing partnered with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited to advance a domestic SAF ecosystem, working on certification pathways, feedstock optimization, and nationwide supply-chain planning. Boeing additionally highlighted India’s potential to produce up to 8-10 million metric tons of SAF annually due to its agricultural-residue base, indicating that new producer nations are emerging beyond the traditional jet-fuel hubs. Collectively, these developments show a global shift in how aviation fuel is produced, regulated, and supplied — with SAF integration now embedded in national strategies, airline procurement models, and manufacturer-led innovation programs.

Fluor Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Fluor shareholder, you need to trust in the company’s ability to secure and deliver large-scale infrastructure and industrial projects, while actively managing project risks and maintaining healthy cash flow. The recently announced State Highway 6 expansion in Texas underscores the strength of Fluor’s backlog, but it does not directly alter the most important short-term catalyst, cash generation from ongoing project execution, or diminish the biggest risk, which remains project delays and cost overruns that can impact margins and liquidity.

Among recent announcements, Fluor’s contract win for Project Speedbird, focusing on sustainable aviation fuel production in England, stands out as the most relevant to the SH-6 news since both demonstrate momentum in capturing diverse, high-value contracts. These awards reinforce the catalyst of growing Fluor’s backlog in critical infrastructure and industrial markets, although the timing and profitability of project delivery stay central to near-term investor focus.

However, with Fluor’s ongoing challenges around project delays and cost controls, investors should also be aware that...

Fluor's outlook anticipates $19.6 billion in revenue and $511.6 million in earnings by 2028. This scenario assumes a yearly revenue growth rate of 6.2% alongside a significant decrease in earnings of $3.6 billion from the current $4.1 billion.

The story of the United States corn ethanol industry is a story about a sector that grew rapidly under a very specific set of policy, technology and market conditions. It filled a gap when gasoline demand was rising, when climate policy focused on incremental change, and when EVs were still a niche. It became a major part of the Midwestern political economy. It shaped land use patterns. It supported thousands of farmers and dozens of rural communities built around steady demand for transport fuel. That world is shifting and the signals point toward a twenty year horizon that looks very different from the previous twenty, with very significant implications for the Midwest’s economies and likely politics.

Corn ethanol grew from a small program focused on oxygenates into a national industry producing over 16 billion gallons annually, about 48 million metric tons. The Renewable Fuel Standard created guaranteed demand by requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of ethanol into gasoline. Direct subsidies through the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit helped expand capacity. By the late 2000s the industry had become large enough to hold political weight in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Nebraska. Ethanol plants became anchor employers. Farmers gained a new buyer that consumed nearly 40% of the national corn crop. The system became predictable and self reinforcing. All gasoline sold in the country now has about 10% ethanol added, with some higher blends available in some places. Once direct subsidies expired, the mandate and a large fleet of internal combustion vehicles kept the industry stable. That stability is now being tested by structural changes in transportation and energy.

The first challenge appears in the gasoline market itself. EIA data from 2015 through 2019 shows finished motor gasoline stabilizing at roughly 140 billion gallons a year. The post pandemic rebound never reached that range again. By 2024 gasoline demand had slipped below pre pandemic levels even though the population was larger than in 2019. The shift is not a statistical quirk. Efficiency gains, hybrid penetration and improved powertrain design are pushing gasoline demand down. Even modest EV adoption affects fuel consumption more than most people expect because each EV replaces an entire household’s gasoline demand, not a small slice of it. Hybrid and work from home models that are common after COVID also inhibit demand. Gasoline peaks are rarely jagged events. They plateau and then begin slow but durable declines. Ethanol demand sits inside that shrinking pool. Rising blend rates cannot compensate if the base declines year after year.

E15, a blend of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, creates a small lift for producers, but there is no serious national move toward E30 or higher mid level blends. The political energy behind E15 has come from arguments about supply expansion and consumer cost, not carbon intensity or long term strategy. E30 requires different infrastructure and testing. It requires automakers to warrant engines for higher blends. It requires retail investments that stations are reluctant to make without guarantees. None of that is materializing. States like California and New York now permit E15, but these decisions were framed as cost and supply flexibilities rather than a new energy direction. Ethanol sits in these states as an accepted part of the gasoline era, not a central element of long term climate policy. In markets that matter most for future trends the direction is clear. The strategic focus is electrification.

California and New York are often treated as outliers in national conversations. They are not outliers. They are lead indicators in vehicle transition. California’s advanced clean cars policy will push new car sales toward 100% zero emission by 2035. New York has adopted the same path. These are affluent states with large populations and lots of cars. Higher ethanol blends in these states amount to small adjustments on the margins of a system that is already pivoting toward EVs. As EV shares rise in coastal states, gasoline consumption falls in absolute terms. Even if some drivers hold on to older vehicles for longer, the weight of new sales changes the slope of long term demand. These states represent enough vehicles that their choices influence national averages. Ethanol fits into their near term fuel mix, but it is not shaping their long term direction.

Export markets, something that grew in recent years, see similar headwinds. In the past few years US ethanol exporters have enjoyed strong demand from Canada, the UK and parts of Southeast Asia. These markets are shifting. Canada is tightening its clean fuel regulations and increasing its EV penetration. The UK and EU have sustainability criteria that limit long term expansion of food based biofuels. India is building a domestic ethanol industry using sugarcane and grain feedstocks. Brazil is expanding corn ethanol capacity of its own. OECD and FAO analyses project that most future global ethanol growth will be met domestically rather than through imports. They also project that total global ethanol trade will remain only a small fraction of production. Export contraction is more likely than export growth, and the rest of the world is moving faster to EVs and now, with Trump’s tariffs, moving away from dependency on US imports.

The ethanol to jet pathway appeared to be the most promising new outlet, but it depends heavily on regulatory certainty. Alcohol to jet fuel can meet ASTM standards and blend seamlessly with petroleum jet. Airlines are interested in any supply that can help them meet long term climate pledges. The economics are fragile. Production costs remain higher than petroleum jet. Carbon intensity scoring determines eligibility for tax credits, and it requires both farming changes and capture and sequestration of CO2 from fermenters to achieve sufficiently low intensity. Those credits require stable policy. The removal of the sustainable aviation fuel bonus credit at the end of 2025 under Trump omnibus bill shifted the economics significantly. The reduction from a potential $1.75 a gallon credit to a $1.00 credit cut the margin for most proposed projects. Developers now face a shorter policy horizon, more uncertainty and capital markets that are increasingly sensitive to policy volatility. Some high profile projects have already stalled or been rescoped. Ethanol to jet remains a possible growth area but it is not a firm foundation for the entire industry.

In other work on aviation I have projected that global passenger and cargo demand will not keep rising on historic 4% annual curves, but will flatten as China’s growth slows, remote work persists and population peaks. In that scenario fossil kerosene peaks around 2030 below 2019 levels and then declines over the rest of the century as batteries and biofuels take over most of the energy demand for flights. Electric flight will be cheaper, 1,000 km hybrid electric turboprop ranges mostly on batteries viable, while international flights with sustainable aviation fuels will be more expensive. While the USA has the highest passenger kilometers per resident the world by a hefty margin, 60% to 70% are in the range to be electrified, and ticket price differential will favor those flights with more traffic. Globally, high speed rail is removing passengers from airplane seats, and global population growth is already slowing, with the flight heavy west seeing aging demographics.

All of these factors will reduce the demand for liquid fuels for aviation. Biokerosenes including ethanol to jet bridge the remaining long haul missions across existing airframes. The result is a long tail of liquid fuel use concentrated almost entirely in intercontinental aviation by 2100, with short haul and regional services fully electrified and many small airports revived as electric regional mobility hubs.

I have also argued that personal transportation in the United States is uniquely hard to decarbonize compared to Europe or China because of structural choices made after World War II. Cheap oil, racialized planning and deliberate dispersion policies pushed people into very low density suburbs and weakened passenger rail so thoroughly that Americans now rely on very large cars and frequent domestic flights for basic mobility. Cars and light trucks account for well over half of US transport emissions and road vehicles of all sizes contribute more than 80% of the sector total, yet the country still lags peers on EV adoption and transit investment.

That combination of extreme sprawl, large vehicles, weak rail and entrenched highway infrastructure means the United States has to push harder on both electrification and urban form just to get to the starting line that other rich countries are already standing on. It also means that in the United States, liquid fuels for cars and aviation stay in the picture longer than they would in a denser, rail oriented system, which is one more reason to expect corn ethanol and other biofuels to face a long, messy transition instead of a clean break. But it doesn’t mean that electrification won’t eat internal combustion fuel demand for lunch, it just means it will be a more leisurely meal.

Marine fuels are sometimes presented as a major opportunity, but here too the outlook is not for growth and ethanol is not the molecule of choice. Starting with demand, 40% of all shipping tonnage is of fossil fuels, and that is in structural decline. Another 15% is raw iron ore, usually steaming to the same ports coal is headed to. That too is in structural decline with renewable electricity based derusting of iron ore to make iron much more viable nearer to coal mines, increasing the value while reducing the tonnage of exports. Global steel demand is also in decline, as China has finished the massive infrastructure boom and is entering a lower maintenance cycle as the developed world did in the second half of the 20th Century. Other countries have access to cheap software and mass timber that significantly reduces steel demand in new buildings, and aren’t going to be building the massive factors, heavy industry and ports that China did. Structurally, 55% of total shipping tonnage is in decline.

Further, electrification is coming for shipping as well. 700 unit container ships with swappable containerized batteries are servicing 1,000 km routes on the Yangtze in China. 2,100 passenger fully electric ferries are on order and being tested in the water already. Hybridization of ocean going ships is almost inevitable as the economics of dirt cheap batteries, clean and inexpensive electrons, and much more costly biofuels radically alter current assumptions. The combination results in much less shipping fuel in the future than today. It’s not a growth market looking in desperation for ethanol.

US corn ethanol rhetoric points to large shipping companies experimenting with multi fuel blends that include ethanol. The global shipping sector will use enormous amounts of fuel even with declines and small blend shares imply large potential ethanol volumes. The caveat is that shipping is already moving toward biomethanol and electrification. Those energy carriers offer better energy density or simpler handling and are aligned with long term zero carbon strategies. Trials that include ethanol are exploratory. There is no regulatory anchor for ethanol in shipping comparable to the mandates in road transport in the early 2000s. There is also a competitive disadvantage. Sugarcane ethanol from more tropical regions has a lower carbon intensity than US corn ethanol and fits more comfortably within international carbon accounting. Marine fuels might absorb some gallons, but they do not plausibly absorb the multi billion gallon gap created by declining road fuel use.

Chemical feedstocks are a real but limited opportunity. Ethanol can serve as a platform for ethylene, acetic acid and other industrial chemicals. Some companies in Brazil already operate this way at commercial scale. These markets value carbon intensity, traceability and stable supply. They do not require the volumes that road transport does. Even optimistic scenarios for ethanol based chemicals only absorb one or two billion gallons. The gap between that figure and current fuel use is too large to bridge.

A useful way to think about the next twenty years is through scenario analysis. In a reference case based on current federal policy and modest EV adoption, ethanol production holds roughly flat. Blend rates climb slightly. Exports remain steady. SAF adds a small amount of extra demand. The industry looks a lot like today with slightly more pressure at the margins. In a moderate case, EV adoption accelerates in line with global patterns. Gasoline demand falls 30% to 40%. Blend rates rise toward E15 but go no further. Exports plateau. SAF struggles with policy instability. Ethanol production falls 20% to 35%. In a high transition case, EVs scale quickly across the United States, coastal states accelerate their mandates and global automotive supply chains deliver lower cost EVs faster than expected. Export markets build domestic production. SAF policy remains unstable. Ethanol production falls on the order of 40% to 50%. None of these numbers are precise forecasts, but they describe reasonable envelopes for planning.

The regional economic effects of even a moderate contraction will be significant. Ethanol plants anchor many rural communities. They form part of the basis that supports grain handlers, trucking firms and equipment dealers. A reduction in ethanol demand reduces local corn prices and affects land values. Farmers will shift into other crops or adjust rotations but that takes time. Some ethanol plants will diversify into higher value co products like protein concentrates or biochemicals. Others will close or consolidate. The transition will not be even across the Midwest. Plants with access to low carbon electricity, carbon capture pathways or diversified product streams will adapt more readily. Plants with high operating costs or limited access to low carbon inputs will struggle.

Most of the communities built around corn-ethanol plants are not affluent today. They are generally stable, middle-income rural towns whose economies depend on agriculture, a few industrial anchors and a small service base. Ethanol plants raise local incomes relative to purely farming counties because they add processing jobs, support a network of trucking, maintenance and engineering firms and strengthen corn prices within a 30 to 60 mile radius. That effect improves household earnings and local tax revenue, but it does not turn these areas into high-income regions. Many of the counties with the heaviest ethanol concentration still have below-average median household incomes compared to national figures, lower population growth and limited economic diversification. Ethanol plants provide stability rather than affluence, which is why the prospect of long-term demand decline matters so much. If the primary industrial buyer in an already thin local economy begins to shrink, the communities around it have little buffer and fewer alternative employers to absorb the shift. The combination has the potential to mean a further rural hollowing out and depopulation.

There is a credible, long-run possibility that declining corn ethanol demand could open the door to large scale rewilding in parts of the Midwest, but it would occur unevenly without strong federal and state guidance, and only under certain economic conditions. A significant share of the land used for continuous corn today is not prime cropland. Much of it sits on marginal soils, areas prone to erosion, floodplains, former prairie that was brought under cultivation during the ethanol boom, or regions where profitability depends on high fertilizer inputs and steady local buyers. When an ethanol plant closes or reduces intake by half, the weakest ground becomes hard to justify financially. Farmers faced with lower local corn prices, higher transport costs to reach distant markets, and lower returns per acre often transition marginal parcels first. That transition can take the form of reduced tillage, grassland restoration, enrollment in conservation programs or leasing land to wildlife agencies or private conservation groups. Federal conservation programs already have waiting lists in many states, and a sustained decline in corn demand would increase interest in enrolling acres that no longer generate reliable profits.

Rewilding does not mean a full return to tallgrass prairie across entire counties. It usually begins with patches of land taken out of annual row cropping and converted to mixed grasses, wetlands or riparian buffers. Over time, these areas provide habitat, improve water quality and reduce nutrient runoff. In regions with chronic flood risks or groundwater stress, reverting portions of corn acreage to natural cover can also ease public infrastructure costs. Some landowners will see value in carbon markets if those markets become more credible. Others will partner with conservation organizations that combine ecological restoration with recreational or grazing leases. There will still be strong agricultural production on the best land, but the overall mosaic shifts. A sustained 40% to 50% decline in ethanol demand over twenty years would gradually release millions of acres from strict commodity production pressure, and a portion of those acres would flow into rewilding because it becomes the most rational economic choice for land that cannot compete well in a post ethanol landscape.

There are viable paths forward for many producers. Some will invest in carbon capture to lower their fuel’s measured carbon intensity. Some will pursue biorefinery strategies that treat ethanol as one output in a broader product mix. Others will explore partnerships in chemicals, specialty proteins or green ammonia. The industry that emerges will be leaner and more varied than the one that grew under the Renewable Fuel Standard. The skill sets, infrastructure and experience inside these companies are valuable in new energy and materials markets. The question is how fast they can pivot.

The large scale conditions that supported corn ethanol for two decades are changing. The global automotive industry is electrifying. Regulatory frameworks in major importing countries are turning toward zero emission vehicles and low carbon fuels with strict sustainability criteria. Domestic gasoline demand is softening in ways that will continue and likely accelerate. The policy foundation for ethanol to jet remains unstable. These factors add up to a long term environment where a contraction of the US corn ethanol sector is more plausible than continued growth. A decline of 20% to 50% is a reasonable planning range depending on how quickly EVs scale and how successfully producers diversify. The next twenty years will test the industry’s ability to adapt to a world where road fuels are no longer the primary engine of energy demand.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-29-2025-10_29_06-AM-800x445.png,N,,2025-11-29 19:56:11.037126

The European Union has committed a €3 billion investment package to accelerate the commercial scale-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This public capital directly addresses the high initial cost and infrastructure gap, de-risking the Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for new production facilities, especially those using the Power-to-Liquid (e-fuels) pathway. This intervention secures the long-term supply chain for aviation, with the most important data point being that the funding is explicitly designed to help meet the binding 70% SAF blending mandate by 2050.

Context

The core question for the aviation and energy sectors has been whether the industry can meet its aggressive fuel mandates without a massive public capital infusion to bridge the cost and production gap. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation created a clear demand signal, but the high capital expenditure for new plants and the cost premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel had stalled the necessary private investment to scale production. Informed professionals were waiting for a mechanism to convert policy risk into commercial certainty.

Analysis

This development is a direct policy-to-market intervention. The cause is the binding ReFuelEU mandate, which created a future demand that the current supply chain cannot meet. The effect is the €3 billion funding, which acts as the necessary mechanism to build that supply.

Manufacturers are now expected to accelerate Final Investment Decisions on new SAF plants, particularly those focused on advanced biofuels and synthetic e-fuels. Think of this funding like a down payment on a new factory, immediately improving the risk-return profile for private investors.

Outlook

This development implies a major acceleration in the industrial build-out of synthetic fuel capacity. The simple thing to watch for next is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for large-scale SAF production facilities, especially those focused on the synthetic e-fuel pathway. A sustained flow of FIDs and new, long-term offtake agreements between airlines and SAF producers will confirm that the public capital has successfully de-risked the market and that the industrial transition is now in motion.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-Urban-Mobility-Public-Transit-Decarbonization-Green-Infrastructure-Ecological-Transition-Hydrological-Cycle.jpeg,N,,2025-11-30 04:56:31.328628

De Boeing 747-200, registratie N787RR, vliegt al sinds 2005 bij Rolls Royce. Het iconische toestel diende als testvliegtuig voor motoren. Zo konden er verschillende nieuwe testmotoren in het vliegtuig worden geïnstalleerd, en daarmee werden prestatiegegevens verzameld. Eén testvlucht leverde gemiddeld zo’n twintig gigabite aan data op. Daarnaast werd het vliegende testplatform ingezet om allerlei nieuwe technologische snufjes te testen.

In 2021 werd er een bijzondere vlucht uitgevoerd met een Trent 1000-motor. Deze motor draaide volledig op duurzame brandstof (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Uit data van deze testvlucht bleek dat de motor niet anders fungeerde dan de andere drie RB211-motoren die onder de Boeing 747 hingen. Het was de opmaat naar de eerste transatlantische vlucht van Virgin Atlantic die volledig op duurzame brandstof vloog. De Dreamliner waagde de oversteek van Londen Heathrow naar New York JFK met Trent 1000-motoren. Daarmee werd Rolls Royce de eerste fabrikant van wie alle motoren compatibel zijn met honderd procent SAF.

De Queen of the Skies van Rolls Royce vloog haar laatste testvlucht in juli 2025. Deze testvlucht ondersteunde de Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) motordemonstrator. Hiermee werd een belangrijke bijdrage geleverd aan de ontwikkeling van meer efficiënte en duurzame motoren.

Several carriers suspended flights in response, triggering Venezuela’s National Institute of Civil Aviation (INAC) to revoke their operating permits, a decisive step in asserting control over Venezuela airspace.

Airspace Control as a Strategic Tool

On November 21, 2025, the U.S. FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) warning of a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace, citing increased military readiness, GPS interference, and U.S. deployments in the Caribbean targeting alleged drug trafficking. In response, several international carriers including Iberia, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines, Avianca, LATAM, and Gol temporarily suspended flights to Caracas (more details here).

Venezuela’s National Institute of Civil Aviation (INAC) responded by issuing a 48-hour ultimatum for the carriers to resume service. When the deadline passed without the airlines complying, INAC revoked their operating rights. Venezuela’s government accused the airlines of joining “actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States”

President Nicolás Maduro framed the Venezuela aviation ban as a demonstration of sovereignty. In a televised address, he declared Venezuela “invincible,” signalling to both domestic and international audiences that foreign carriers would not dictate operations within Venezuelan airspace. The government’s measures reflect how aviation is used as political leverage in ongoing negotiations with the U.S.

The move follows other actions in 2025, including public references to a “prolonged resistance” strategy. By grounding airlines and controlling flight routes, Venezuela ensures that Venezuela airline restrictions 2025 directly influence international mobility while amplifying its political stance.

Venezuela-US mounting Tensions

The airline ban comes amid growing U.S.-Venezuela tensions. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Caribbean, assembling its largest military presence in the Caribbean since the 1989 invasion of Panama. This build-up, part of “Operation Southern Spear,” began in August 2025 with the deployment of the USS Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, and was bolstered in November by the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group.

Sanctions and legal measures remain in place: U.S. indictments of senior Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, and a $50 million bounty on the president, continue to escalate pressures. These actions prompted the FAA advisory, which in turn sparked the Venezuela aviation ban and broader Venezuela airline restrictions 2025.

Aviation at the Center of the Standoff

After major international airlines voluntarily suspended flights to Venezuela following a U.S. safety warning, Venezuela retaliated by revoking their operating permits, demonstrating how aviation is used as a tool of political leverage. The decisions highlight the key strategic power commercial aviation can have in international diplomacy: controlling flight operations can send messages and enforce pressure without deploying hard military power.

Lo dice Gianfranco Battisti, amministratore delegato di Gesap, la società di gestione dell’aeroporto di Palermo, che in questi giorni ha partecipato a Bologna agli stati generali della ripartenza, portando la visione strategica dello scalo palermitano sui temi della transizione ecologica e dell’innovazione digitale. Nel suo intervento, Battisti ha portato come esempio la pianificazione del piano industriale dello scalo aereo palermitano, che verrà definito nel primo semestre del 2026, dove si punterà molto sull’innovazione ambientale. “La sostenibilità non è più un’opzione ma è un fattore competitivo – ha detto il manager – Per questo motivo stiamo pianificando infrastrutture dedicate allo stoccaggio e alla distribuzione del carburante sostenibile in aviazione (sustainable aviation fuel – Saf), ai sistemi di miscelazione, partnership industriali con produttori e compagnie aeree. Con il Saf si possono ridurre fino all’80% le emissioni degli aeromobili. Accanto al Saf, stanno maturando e-fuels e biocarburanti avanzati che potenzieranno ulteriormente la decarbonizzazione.

Ritengo che un aeroporto che digitalizza è un aeroporto che riduce consumi, emissioni e costi”.

Ma la tecnologia da sola non basta se non crescono e si evolvono anche le competenze delle risorse umane. “Servono academy interne, partnership con università e nuove tecnologie, programmi di formazione su Saf, e-fuels. Un ecosistema forte si costruisce sulle persone, non solo sulle infrastrutture – continua Battisti – Quando un aeroporto diventa un laboratorio operativo, cosa sulla quale ci stiamo muovendo, e non rimane un progetto sulla carta ma un luogo dove la transizione si realizza davvero, accadono in genere tre cose immediate: arrivano capitali, arrivano nuove rotte, arrivano nuove competenze. Questo ha un impatto diretto sulla mobilità nazionale decarbonizzazione dei collegamenti, integrazione delle infrastrutture, sviluppo dell’intermodalità, crescita dell’attrattività territoriale e posizionamento dell’Italia come hub di innovazione sostenibile nel Mediterraneo.

London Heathrow said its operations remain unaffected, while Gatwick Airport expects some disruption.

Airbus says the majority of affected aircraft only require a software installation, normally a three-hour process. But around 900 older planes will need computer hardware replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers until that is done. Availability of parts remains a concern, and it is currently unclear whether replacements can be sourced in time.

BBC reported that the software directive primarily targets the A320 family, which Airbus describes as the “aircraft family of choice for airlines around the world.” These planes can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km) and seat between 120 and 244 passengers. The A320 also flies using 50% sustainable aviation fuel, a figure Airbus hopes to raise to 100% by 2030.

The aircraft features advanced turbofan engines that offer 20% lower fuel burn compared with previous generations, one reason why it remains central to commercial fleets worldwide. With thousands of aircraft grounded or awaiting updates, passengers across continents have been urged to monitor flight schedules and allow extra time at airports.",https://greaterkashmir.imagibyte.sortdcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Airport-KL-e1747033317387.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 14:57:06.668958

In Central Asia, Siddiqui emphasized, such mechanisms do not yet exist.
Meanwhile, Uzbekistan has taken a significant step toward sustainable aviation fuel production.

This was stated by Rizwan Siddiqui, IATA Country Manager for Central Asia, during a discussion at the Central Asia Aviation Summit in Tashkent. He emphasized that without government incentives and a regulatory framework, the region risks missing a crucial stage in the global transformation of the aviation industry.

According to Siddiqui, SAF currently accounts for about 0.7 percent of global aviation fuel — a figure that must rise to 65 percent by 2050 under the industry’s commitments to achieve net-zero emissions. Achieving this will require US$1.5 trillion in investments and the large-scale construction of production facilities.

However, as the IATA representative noted, investors expect transparent rules, incentive mechanisms, and long-term political guarantees from governments.

Siddiqui highlighted the experience of the United States and the European Union, where governments have already implemented support measures for SAF producers. In the U.S., the creation of production capacity was made possible through tax benefits and direct incentives. In the EU, mandatory SAF usage requirements have been introduced: by 2025, European airports must ensure at least 2 percent of fuel is sustainable. A similar approach is emerging in Asia: Singapore is introducing a flight-distance–based tax, and Malaysia requires airlines to supply a minimum of 1 percent SAF in refueling operations.

In Central Asia, Siddiqui emphasized, such mechanisms do not yet exist. Kazakhstan is the only country in the region to have joined the global ICAO initiative, CORSIA, which imposes obligations for carbon offsetting. Uzbekistan, he said, continues to study the possibilities of joining, but its regulatory framework is not yet in place. Nonetheless, initial industry initiatives are appearing in Kazakhstan: companies LanzaJet and KazMunayGas are considering building an SAF production facility in Kostanay Region.

The absence of subsidies, investment incentives, and a clear governmental position continues to hinder the development of sustainable fuels in the region. “So far, no Central Asian country has announced either mandates or financial support measures,” Siddiqui noted.

He stressed that the cost of SAF remains a key barrier: one ton of sustainable fuel currently costs US$2,000–2,500, whereas conventional aviation fuel costs about US$750 per ton. Prices can only decrease with large-scale construction of production facilities, which is impossible without government intervention.

Siddiqui also urged countries in the region to more actively study and implement international emissions regulatory tools, noting that many aviation regulators in Central Asia still do not fully understand the scale and importance of transitioning to green technologies. “CORSIA is not a declaration but a tool for implementation. And it is the implementation, not the signing, that is the most challenging part,” he said.

Meanwhile, Uzbekistan has taken a significant step toward sustainable aviation fuel production. Allied Biofuels FE LLC Uzbekistan signed an agreement with the Khorezm regional government regarding land and water resources for the implementation of a biorefinery complex in Tuproqqalin District. The investment is estimated at US$5.9 billion.

The project envisages the construction of the first fully integrated zero-emission aviation fuel plant in Central Asia. The facility will be capable of producing 382,000 tons of SAF annually, 152,000 tons of e-SAF (electro-synthetic fuel), and 11,000 tons of “green” diesel powered by 2 GW PEM electrolyzers.

The initiative aims to establish a climate-oriented aviation fuel supply chain in Uzbekistan and strengthen Khorezm Region’s role as a hub for sustainable energy and industrial innovation.",https://www.uzdaily.uz/media/filer_public/3b/8d/3b8dd3c5-bb12-4734-849c-4e2b06278ff3/iata_29-11-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 16:56:46.863520

The move follows the discovery that intense solar radiation could interfere with data used by flight control systems, prompting a rapid response from the manufacturer.

The directive covers nearly 6,000 aircraft, almost half of Airbus’s global fleet, making it an unusual and large-scale recall. More airlines have begun reporting likely disruptions as affected jets are pulled from service for updates.

Indian carriers issue advisories

Air India and IndiGo have warned of longer turnaround times and possible delays. Both airlines urged passengers to check their flight status before leaving for the airport. Air India said the software and hardware adjustments required for part of its fleet will slow operations and apologised for the inconvenience.

Other global carriers are taking similar steps. American Airlines said about 340 of its planes are affected and expects “some operational delays,” though most updates should be wrapped up within a day or two. Delta Airlines expects only limited impact. London Heathrow reported normal operations, while Gatwick Airport flagged potential disruption.

Most aircraft will need only a software installation, a process that generally takes about three hours. Older jets — roughly 900 of them — require a hardware replacement and cannot carry passengers until that work is completed. The availability of parts remains uncertain, raising concerns about how long some planes may remain grounded.

The directive mainly affects the A320 family, a core part of many global fleets. These aircraft typically carry between 120 and 244 passengers and can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles.

LanzaJet, a leading U.S. sustainable fuel innovator, has announced a major breakthrough: the successful production of jet fuel made from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia. This achievement marks the world’s first commercial-scale output of ethanol-derived jet fuel, delivering a renewable, non-petroleum aviation fuel that works seamlessly with today’s aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Backed by more than 15 years of research and development, the milestone validates LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, a platform capable of converting a wide range of sustainable feedstocks—including agricultural waste, purpose-grown energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon—into drop-in aviation fuel. LanzaJet highlights this advancement as a major step forward for farmers, biofuels producers, aviation stakeholders, and climate-focused innovators. “This achievement represents the culmination of 15 years of research, collaboration, investment, and scale-up—and it proves ethanol can be transformed into jet fuel at true commercial scale,” the company stated.

Why ethanol matters: a scalable solution for SAF production

Aviation faces urgent pressure to decarbonize, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains the only scalable near-term solution for reducing emissions from long-haul flights. However, the current dominant SAF pathway—HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)—depends heavily on limited feedstocks such as used cooking oil and waste fats. With global demand rising, these resources are quickly being constrained. LanzaJet’s ATJ pathway offers a critical alternative by leveraging widely available ethanol. Through a continuous catalytic conversion process, ethanol is transformed into Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) via: • Dehydration – converting ethanol into ethylene • Oligomerization – building longer hydrocarbon chains • Hydrogenation/Hydrotreating – refining chains into kerosene-range molecules The result is a fully certified SAF compatible with existing turbines, pipelines, and airport systems. CEO Jimmy Samartzis noted, “This milestone is a major win for global aviation and a sign of what’s possible for the industry’s future.” According to LanzaJet, ATJ is the most commercially ready, scalable SAF solution developed in the past decade, supporting energy security, domestic fuel production, and growth in agricultural economies.

Higher-quality fuel with lower emissions

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility stands as a first-of-its-kind (FOAK) integrated biorefinery, representing more than $300 million in investment. The plant incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as: • Technip Energies’ Hummingbird system (Ethanol-to-Ethylene) • A combined DOE/LanzaTech Oligomerization process By sourcing from a diverse blend of sustainable feedstocks, the plant delivers SAF with substantially lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-based jet fuel. When blended with Jet A-1, the resulting fuel meets all international aviation standards, offering a drop-in solution for airlines worldwide. LanzaJet reports that its SAF delivers higher energy density than conventional Jet-A, providing a superior-quality fuel while reducing environmental impact. Beyond its climate benefits, the Freedom Pines facility is generating economic value in rural Georgia—creating hundreds of construction jobs and supporting more than 65 permanent direct and indirect jobs in Treutlen County.

Global deployment and the road to net zero aviation

LanzaJet is scaling its ATJ technology worldwide, with projects already underway across: • United States • Australia • Japan • India • United Kingdom • Colombia • European Union • Middle East • Kazakhstan As the aviation sector targets Net Zero by 2050, LanzaJet’s success demonstrates that the technologies needed to accelerate deep decarbonization are not theoretical—they exist today.",,N,,2025-11-29 10:56:50.066521

The recall covers more than half of all A320-family jets in service and comes after an incident last month in which a JetBlue flight experienced an unexpected loss of altitude and diverted for an emergency landing.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency is preparing an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that will mandate inspections and software updates before affected aircraft can return to service.

Flight-Control Failure Triggers Global Response

The recall stems from an October 30 incident involving a JetBlue flight en route from Cancun to Newark. The aircraft abruptly descended due to corrupted flight-control data believed to have been caused by intense solar radiation exposure. Several passengers were hospitalized after the emergency landing in Tampa.

Airbus said the issue, while rare, could potentially affect any A320-family jet operating under certain environmental conditions. The manufacturer emphasized that correcting the vulnerability requires immediate action across the global fleet.

In a statement, the manufacturer said:

“Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Airbus has consequently identified a significant number of A320 Family aircraft currently in-service which may be impacted.”

Software Rollbacks and Hardware Fixes Expected

Airbus has instructed operators to install updated software without delay. Roughly two-thirds of affected aircraft will need only a rapid software rollback, allowing them to return to service quickly. However, hundreds of jets will require hardware modifications, a process that could ground them for weeks.

The company warned that the recall will likely cause schedule disruptions for airlines and passengers but reiterated that safety remains its top priority.

This, IATA said, would reduce incentives for airlines to cancel delayed flights, while aligning with passengers’ clear preference to arrive late rather than not at all.
This, it argued, includes phasing out passenger taxes that undermine connectivity; Sweden removed its levy in July, and IATA urged others to follow.
At present, airlines face a USD 2.9 billion premium for purchasing SAF compared with conventional jet fuel, on top of ETS costs.
IATA described the Commission’s recent STIP proposal as a positive signal, although it said concrete action remains to be seen.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the European Parliament’s proposed overhaul of EU261 risks moving the bloc’s passenger-rights rules in the wrong direction, arguing that the changes would raise costs for travellers and airlines while failing to address the issues passengers actually face.

According to IATA, the regulation’s shortcomings have been evident for years. European governments attempted to address these in June, when the European Council backed amendments designed to safeguard connectivity and strengthen the competitiveness of European aviation.

Although not perfect, that position aimed for a more balanced framework, notably by increasing the delay thresholds for compensation from three hours to four hours for short-haul flights, and to six hours for long-haul services.

This, IATA said, would reduce incentives for airlines to cancel delayed flights, while aligning with passengers’ clear preference to arrive late rather than not at all.

The Parliament, however, is pushing to scrap these threshold changes and introduce additional obligations, including a right to bring a cabin bag for free.

IATA noted that there is no evidence passengers are asking for such measures, and even less that they are willing to pay higher fares for them.

In its May passenger survey, 72 per cent said they preferred the lowest fare with the option to pay for extra services when needed.

At the same time, 97 per cent reported being satisfied with their most recent flight.

Eurocontrol data also shows that fewer than 1 per cent of flights face delays longer than three hours, meaning the remaining 99 per cent of passengers are funding a compensation scheme that only a small minority ever uses.

IATA argues this makes value for money even more important.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said the Parliament’s approach effectively “works as a reverse Robin Hood”, adding that “there is no such thing as a ‘free’ bag or ‘free’ compensation thresholds”.

He stressed that “MEPs are imposing things people haven’t asked for, and don’t want to pay for unless they choose to”, noting that passengers would rather pay lower fares in exchange for a less “gold-plated” scheme.

He added that the Council’s position should be upheld to support competitiveness and reflect the calls in last year’s Draghi report for fewer and smarter regulations.

IATA also linked the debate to broader concerns over Europe’s slowing air-connectivity growth. Its research shows that between 2014 and 2024, connectivity grew by only 2.2 per cent a year in France, 2.9 per cent in the Netherlands, and just 0.4 per cent in Germany, trends it says emphasise the need for action to help the industry remain competitive.

This, it argued, includes phasing out passenger taxes that undermine connectivity; Sweden removed its levy in July, and IATA urged others to follow.

It also called for changes to the ReFuelEU “Green Deal” Regulation and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, saying fuel producers should be incentivised to supply affordable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while airlines need to benefit from using it.

At present, airlines face a USD 2.9 billion premium for purchasing SAF compared with conventional jet fuel, on top of ETS costs. IATA described the Commission’s recent STIP proposal as a positive signal, although it said concrete action remains to be seen.

The precautionary move follows concerns about a potential flight-control issue linked to intense solar radiation. Airlines, regulators, and passengers across continents are monitoring the developments, with up to 6,000 jets worldwide requiring software or hardware modifications.

While some disruptions are expected, UAE carriers have responded quickly, prioritising safety and operational continuity.

Airbus issued the directive on Friday, calling for an immediate software update across the A320 fleet. The update affects aircraft equipped with a specific flight-control component known as the Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC). The precautionary order is being treated with urgency by operators across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Most jets will receive a software update taking approximately three hours, while around 900 older aircraft will require hardware replacement, temporarily grounding affected planes.

Airline responses

UAE-based confirmed it has initiated mandatory software and technical upgrades across its affected A320 aircraft. The Sharjah-based budget carrier operates 67 A320 family aircraft through its operations in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, making it one of the UAE’s largest operators of the model.

“We confirm that we have received the directive issued by Airbus concerning the A320 aircraft type operated by airlines worldwide, which requires a number of aircraft to undergo specific software and technical updates,” a spokesperson said. The airline assured travellers that measures were being implemented across the impacted fleet and that any schedule adjustments would be communicated directly to affected passengers. “We are working to ensure minimal impact on our customers. In the event of any schedule adjustments, affected passengers will be notified directly.”

Air Arabia expressed regret for any inconvenience, emphasising its commitment to the highest levels of safety.

Meanwhile, Airways announced that its A320 operations have already returned to a normal schedule after completing the required update swiftly. The Abu Dhabi-based airline credited its operational teams for minimising disruption, especially during one of the busiest travel periods at Zayed International Airport ahead of the long weekend.

“Thanks to the exceptional efforts of our operational and technical teams, the update was completed quickly and with minimal disruption,” Etihad said. The carrier highlighted the importance of passenger understanding and reaffirmed that safety remains the airline’s top priority.

According to aviation data and analytics firm Cirium, UAE airlines collectively operate 106 Airbus A320-family aircraft, a significant portion of the regional fleet. The A320 is a preferred model globally, known for its fuel efficiency, versatility, and range of up to 4,700 nautical miles. Globally, around half of Airbus’s total commercial fleet—some 6,000 aircraft—fall under the recall directive.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) explained that intense solar radiation may, in rare cases, affect data used by the ELAC system, potentially leading to uncommanded movement of the aircraft’s control surfaces. While no major accidents have been directly attributed to the issue, the advisory was issued under safety precaution guidelines.

Global response

Carriers across Europe, Asia, and North America have begun fleet assessments to determine the number of affected aircraft. In , operators including IndiGo, Air India, and Air India Express are implementing software and hardware realignments across around 200–250 aircraft, according to aviation authorities. Air India confirmed that over 40 per cent of its affected fleet has already been updated, with no flight cancellations reported so far. However, travellers have been advised to expect possible delays.

Similarly, Flynas in Saudi Arabia has begun carrying out software and technical recalibrations across part of its A320 fleet. The airline warned of longer turnaround times on a limited number of flights and said that any affected passengers would be contacted via SMS or email.

In Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) reported the cancellation of 65 domestic flights. The carrier confirmed that 34 of its A320-family aircraft required the update, affecting thousands of passengers travelling in and out of Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Japan Airlines, however, confirmed its fleet was unaffected.

Impact on airports

In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airport reported that approximately 80 aircraft were affected. While Heathrow confirmed no major operational impact, airlines are coordinating parking and overnight update schedules to minimise disruption.

In the United States, American Airlines reported that 340 aircraft would undergo inspection and update, with many expected to be completed by Saturday. Delta said fewer than 50 of its A321neo aircraft were affected and anticipates limited disruption. United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines said their fleets were unaffected.

Technical fixes

The required repair process primarily involves reverting aircraft systems to earlier software versions. The ELAC units receive a software patch to safeguard against corrupted flight-control data. For the older aircraft requiring hardware replacement, the process is more complex and may involve transporting aircraft to maintenance facilities. Ferry flights, where aircraft are flown without passengers to maintenance hubs, are permitted under regulated safety guidelines.

Regulatory oversight

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India has issued an airworthiness directive banning the operation of certain A320-family aircraft without the mandated modification. “No person shall operate any aircraft that falls under the applicability of this mandatory modification except those complying with the requirements,” the order said.

The directive listed multiple Airbus models, including A319, A320 ceos and neos, and A321 variants, underscoring the scale of the global impact.

Passenger advisory

As airlines work to implement the updates, passengers are advised to monitor notifications, maintain updated contact details, and check flight statuses before travelling to the airport. Carriers have reiterated that no major safety incidents have been linked to the issue and that the directive is precautionary.

The software anomaly came into focus after a JetBlue A320 experienced a sudden drop in altitude during a flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, in late October. The aircraft made an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida, with minor injuries reported for 15 passengers. The investigation pointed to potential data corruption within the ELAC system, prompting Airbus and EASA to issue a global directive.

Airbus describes the A320 family as the “aircraft of choice for airlines around the world.” With seating for 120 to 244 passengers, modern A320 aircraft already operate partially using sustainable aviation fuel, with Airbus targeting 100 per cent use by 2030. Its advanced turbofan engines offer up to 20 per cent reductions in fuel burn compared with earlier models.

During a multi-stakeholder validation workshop held in Addis Ababa’s Skylight Hotel on Thursday November 27, experts presenting the feasibility study told officials and industry representatives that Ethiopia could produce low-carbon aviation fuel using local agricultural crops, municipal waste, sugar byproducts and renewable energy sources.

The findings were presented to senior representatives from the ministries of Transport and Logistics, Agriculture, the Civil Aviation Authority, universities and private investors during a final validation workshop attended by international consultants and donors, including the European Union, which funded the study through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

The feasibility study launched in December 2024 with a national workshop and followed by field consultations and a March 2025 stakeholder conference, where Ethiopian officials engaged with technical experts to review data and evaluate business readiness for domestic SAF production.

The research built on three previous studies including a 2019 WWF-South Africa assessment and two Ethiopian roadmap and feasibility studies conducted in 2021 and 2022, which first identified Ethiopian mustard as a viable aviation fuel crop.

Lead consultant John McKechnie stated that Ethiopia was selected for deeper analysis because of its agricultural base, expanding industrial capacity and unexploited renewable energy resources, which together position the country strategically in Africa’s energy transition.

Researchers confirmed that more than 30 million hectares of Ethiopian land are suitable for cultivating Ethiopian mustard without interfering with food production, making it one of the most promising non-food crops identified for sustainable aviation fuel feedstock.

Field trials already show the crop can be produced at scale, though further research is required to determine how national production can be expanded to serve commercial aviation demand.

Officials acknowledged challenges related to logistics and supply chains, noting that Ethiopia’s farmers are geographically dispersed and current transport infrastructure makes bulk feedstock collection difficult.

The study examined multiple production routes including alcohol-to-jet fuel derived from sugar molasses, waste-to-fuel systems using municipal landfill material, and electricity-based fuels derived from renewable sources.

Ethiopia’s sugar sector already has an annual ethanol production capacity of approximately 32.5 million liters, though current output remains constrained due to competition from food and beverage manufacturers willing to pay higher prices.

Municipal waste presented a dual opportunity allowing the country to simultaneously address urban waste problems while generating clean aviation fuel, according to the technical team.

Electricity-based fuel production was identified as one of Ethiopia’s strongest long-term options due to its high renewable energy potential, offering a future route for hydrogen-based synthetic fuel manufacturing.

Power-to-liquid technology is projected to be certified between mid-2026 and late-2026, placing Ethiopia within range of early commercial adoption provided investment mobilization begins promptly.

Consultants acknowledged current market prices for sustainable aviation fuel are roughly double conventional jet fuel rates, though they expect long-term costs to fall once production maturity is achieved.

An international benchmark drawn from India revealed that mandatory aviation fuel blending will begin at one percent in 2027 and rise to five percent by 2030.

Experts warned airlines that regulatory pressure will intensify across international airspace, with compliance becoming unavoidable by 2030 if Ethiopian carriers are to maintain global competitiveness.

The government confirmed the formation of a national technical committee on sustainable aviation fuel and announced plans to establish a project office staffed by aviation and energy specialists in the coming weeks.

Officials stated development partners would be invited to finance the project office and assist in converting research findings into industrial investment programs. Transport Ministry officials reiterated that aviation alone accounts for a large share of global emissions and that Ethiopia has committed to carbon-reduction targets under international climate agreements.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ETHIOPIA-READY-TO-GAMBLE-ON-SUSTAINABLE-AVIATION-FUEL.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 04:56:10.333204

Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.
Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.
Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.","Asian airlines scrambled on Saturday to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets as a sweeping recall by the European planemaker grounded aircraft across the region after disrupting travel in the U.S. during the busiest weekend of the year.

The recall of 6,000 planes covers more than half of Airbus' global A320 family fleet, the backbone of Asian short-haul aviation, particularly in China and India where economic growth has brought millions of new travellers into the skies.

Regulators around the world followed the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in directing their carriers to remedy the A320 software problem before resuming flights.

The Airbus recall, issued to 350 operators around the world, appears to be one of the biggest in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.

FIX IS SIMPLE BUT NECESSARY

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration told carriers to replace or modify software that controls the elevators and ailerons on A319, A320 and A321 airplanes.

India's aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected by the glitch but said the software reset will be completed by Sunday. The country's largest airline, IndiGo, has completed the software reset on 143 out of 200 aircraft, the regulator said.

Air India, which has 113 impacted aircraft, has completed the reset on 42 aircraft. Both airlines warned of delays on Saturday.

""There isn't any major impact on schedule integrity across our network,"" Air India posted on X. ""However, some of our flights may be slightly delayed or rescheduled.""

Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island's carriers are affected.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers.

ANA Holdings, Japan's biggest airline, cancelled 65 flights on Saturday and warned of more disruption on Sunday.

ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. Nationwide, 95 flights were cancelled, according to public broadcaster NHK.

Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again.

OCTOBER INCIDENT TRIGGERED RECALL, SOURCES SAY

Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia's flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected by the recall. The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported significant delays at Melbourne airport.

South Korea's Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule, with only 17 of its aircraft affected by the recall. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service.

South Korea's Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning.

Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.

The world's largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday.

U.S. carriers American, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue and United Airlines are among the world's 10 biggest A320-family operators.

Other airlines that said they would do the repairs include Germany's Lufthansa, and Britain-based easyJet.

Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.

Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.
