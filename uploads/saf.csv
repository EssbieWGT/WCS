The Eagle County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday signed a letter of interest with SynTec Holdings of Morris, Illinois. That non-binding agreement is the first step toward SynTec building a plant on 13 acres of property at the landfill and using up to 90 tons per day of municipal solid waste to convert into aviation fuel.

According to the letter, which is a non-binding agreement, the county will authorize a 10-year lease with a 10-year renewal option with SynTec, which will build and operate a facility to convert solid waste into aviation fuel. That fuel would then be transported to Signature Aviation’s private aviation facility at the Eagle County Regional Airport, formerly the Vail Valley Jet Center. That fuel will then be mixed with standard aviation fuel and used in the private jets that use the facility. Signature Aviation has had a sustainable fuel program since 2022, but that fuel is trucked in from outside Eagle County.

According to the document, SynTec will be responsible for obtaining all necessary county land use approvals and will also be responsible for all project financing.

The letter states that the county will benefit from extending the life of the landfill. Syntec’s plant will use only “clean” household waste. No hazardous or construction waste will be allowed.

Asked by Commissioner Jeanne McQueeney to define “sustainable aviation fuel,” SynTec CEO Wayne McFarland said that his firm’s process “puts less or no new carbon into the environment.” Another gallon of fossil fuel drilled, refined and put into a vehicle puts more carbon into the environment, McFarland said. Sustainable fuel uses material that has already put carbon into the environment, extracts energy from it, and uses it as fuel.

McFarland said the project will ultimately be an “amazing” one for Eagle County.

“There are no downsides to this,” he said, noting that the amount of waste used will allow the county to be almost “landfill-free.” And, he added, with people flying out of the Eagle County Regional Airport on sustainable fuel, “Everybody’s going to want to be you.”

Commissioner Matt Scherr noted that the document approved Tuesday is just a letter of intent. But, he added, the SynTec proposal is “an exciting idea.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/7/2022/08/28053204/75e0756b-9374-54f6-ae55-9ac2e1cbc797-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 21:08:26.800635

Trump threatens 50pc Brazil tariff

Washington, 9 July (Argus) — US president Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 50pc tariff on imports from Brazil from 1 August, citing the ongoing trial of that country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's letter to Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, released on Wednesday, is one of the 22 that the US leader sent to his foreign counterparts since 7 July, announcing new tariff rates that the US will be charging on imports from those countries. But his letter to Brazil stands out for allegations of a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro, who — much like Trump — disputed his electoral defeat and attempted to stay in office. Brazil's supreme court qualified Bolsonaro's actions in 2022 as an attempted coup, ordering him to stand trial. Trump said he will impose the 50pc tariff because ""in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"". The latter is a reference to orders by judges in Brazil to suspend social media accounts for spreading ""misinformation"". Trump separately said he would direct US trade authorities to launch an investigation of Brazil's treatment of US social media platforms — an action likely to result in additional tariffs. Trump's letter to Lula also contains language similar to that included in letters sent to 21 other foreign leaders, accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and suggesting that the only way to avoid payments of tariffs is if Brazilian companies ""decide to build or manufacture product within the US"". The Trump administration since 5 April has been charging a 10pc extra ""Liberation Day"" tariff on most imports — energy commodities and critical minerals are exceptions — from Brazil and nearly every foreign trade partner. Trump on 9 April imposed even higher tariffs on key trading partners, only to delay them the same day until 9 July. On 7 July, Trump signed an executive order further delaying the implementation of higher rates until 12:01am ET (04:01 GMT) on 1 August. Brasilia did not immediately react to Trump's threat of higher tariffs. Trump earlier this week threatened to impose 10pc tariffs on any country cooperating with the Brics group, which includes Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa. Lula hosted a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July. By Haik Gugarats Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025. Argus Media group .

Australian liquid fuels policy to free up ACCUs: CEFC

Sydney, 9 July (Argus) — Annual demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) could be reduced by as much as 7.5mn t of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2050 if Australia adopted policy changes to develop a low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry, according to a report this week. Encouraging companies to reduce direct scope 1 emissions through changes to the federal safeguard mechanism and/or voluntary adoption would drive the development of an Australian LCLF market and free up ACCUs for use in sectors that cannot achieve on-site decarbonisation due to technical challenges, state-owned green investment fund Clean Energy Finance (CEFC) said in a report authored by consultancy Deloitte . Under its central case scenario, which would involve constraining the use of carbon offsets, CEFC said that a 7bn litres/yr LCLF market could be created by 2050, abating up to 12mn t CO2e in 2040 and 20mn t CO2e in 2050 as a result. Annual ACCU demand across six sectors covered by the report — mining, aviation, rail, heavy freight, maritime, and construction — could be reduced by around 6.8mn t CO2e by 2050 in that case, to 2.4mn t CO2e/yr. Demand for ACCUs could reach as low as 1.7mn t CO2e by 2050 under an accelerated scenario, which would involve EU-style mandates for LCLF. Demand for ACCUs would be around 9.2mn t CO2e/yr under the base scenario, which assumes a market-led transition in which carbon prices remain low and LCLF demand is driven by a small group of customers willing to pay significant premiums to reduce their scope 3 emissions. 30pc cap under the safeguard mechanism The central case scenario assumes a hypothetical government intervention to cap the use of ACCUs under the safeguard mechanism at 30pc of the baseline for liquid fuel-related emissions. Currently, there is no limit to the number of ACCUs or safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs) that facilities can use to manage their excess emissions under the scheme, but those that surrender carbon units equivalent to 30pc or more of their baselines need to publish a statement explaining why they have not undertaken more on-site abatement activities . The central case scenario also assumes the removal of baseline adjustments for trade-exposed baseline-adjusted facilities . Adopting a minimum 70pc direct on-site decarbonisation would trigger a positive supply-side response, driving significant technology deployment and competition between pathways and feedstocks, the CEFC said. Stakeholders claim that the current safeguard mechanism and ACCU pricing are not enough to drive early LCLF uptake, the report said. Policy intervention is needed to accelerate the bridging of the cost gap between the LCLF production cost and the ACCU price, which is currently not expected to happen until the 2040s, the report said. A market-led transition, on the other hand, would lead to greater pressure on the ACCU market, with up to 7.35mn t CO2e of ACCUs needed to meet demand in 2035 and 15.5mn t CO2e in 2050. ACCU supply reached an all-time high of 18.78mn in 2024 and is forecast at 19mn-24mn for 2025 . But the industry needs to boost future issuances to address an expected shift in the supply-demand balance within a few years .

EIA cuts 2025 US biofuel outlook, ups 2026 view

New York, 8 July (Argus) — The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year. US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook . That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production. EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth. The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import. Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years. In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation. Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report. EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption. But the agency now sees US production and consumption balanced at 49,000 b/d next year, a 1,000 b/d increase from its June expectations. The Environmental Protection Agency last month proposed substantially raising biomass-based diesel mandates in the next two years, while also potentially throttling credits for biofuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. And President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend a sprawling budget bill that extends a tax credit for biofuels through 2029 and, starting next year, ups subsidies for crop-based fuels while limiting eligibility to North American feedstocks.

French diesel, HVO customs data mislabelled: Eurostat

Barcelona, 8 July (Argus) — French firms have mislabelled imports of 10ppm diesel as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) this year, following confusion over new customs codes, EU data service Eurostat has said. The confusion has come about after the introduction of a new import-export (CN) code for HVO that took effect at the start of 2025. Some French data will be restated. A diesel code of 27101943 was discontinued at the end of 2024 and was replaced by 27101944. A new CN code 27101942 for HVO was introduced. HVO is produced by treating vegetable oil with hydrogen, counts against biodiesel blend mandates, but is molecularly separate from biodiesel output by esterification. When customs data for 2025 began to be published at the end of the first quarter, France appeared to be importing large amounts of HVO from Saudi Arabia and the US. Cargoes from the former amounted to around 255,000t in the first quarter. Saudi Arabia has no HVO production known by Argus , nor does it re-export cargoes. It is France's largest diesel supplier. There were also 140,000t labelled as HVO from the US in January-March. But because the EU has anti-dumping and countervailing duties on US HVO imports, shipments of this size appeared questionable. The US is the second biggest diesel supplier to France. The mislabelling has made French and EU HVO traffic difficult to track. It has distorted French diesel import data , which show imports have fallen sharply. Argus first questioned the numbers in March when initial 2025 customs data were released. These queries were rebuffed, but after a follow up in May Eurostat said French customs had ""confirmed that there has been an input error"". New data will be supplied by France at an unspecified time this year, it said. By Adam Porter Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

The advocacy supports the business action and the business action strengthens the advocacy while both accelerate results.","Circularity isn’t just about environmental responsibility; it’s a competitive business strategy.

Individual business action is important but true transformation happens at the market level.

The most effective leaders are combining internal circular initiatives with external collective advocacy.

We don’t have time for incremental change. In addition to its devastating planetary impacts, the linear “take, make, waste” system does not offer the long-term stability and resilience our economy needs to deliver prosperity.

The business case for change has never been stronger: economic headwinds, supply chain disruptions, consumer distrust and geopolitical conflict are reshaping the landscape. In times of disruption, entrenched systems are questioned, opening the door for innovation and new market leadership.

Leaders have two choices: act with urgency to accelerate change or adapt to markets that will change around them.

Risk-savvy industries are sounding the alarm

Business leaders increasingly agree that finding ways to succeed commercially while respecting planetary boundaries is a key business imperative. Just ask anyone in the insurance industry – the supreme arbiters of risk.

Insurance leaders have been consistently warning that the effects of climate change will make insurance premiums unviable, potentially undermining the entire financial system and putting capital at risk. In the food industry, manufacturers are seeing that unless they act to help nature thrive, their supply chains will literally dry up.

“

The most visionary business leaders are looking beyond their own operations to transform the conditions in which they compete.

”

Innovative leadership can shape the future of markets but it requires a shift in mindset.

The circular economy is not a nice-to-have sustainability play; it’s a competitive strategy to generate long-term value, reduce risk to capital and build resilience, balancing commercial interests with the needs of the planet.

Through design, we can eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials at their highest value and regenerate nature, creating an economy that benefits people, businesses and the natural world.

It’s firmly on leaders’ agendas. Today, 75% of businesses recognize circularity as important, up from 40% just three years ago. Capital investment in circular initiatives has grown by over 70% in the same period. The shift is real and it’s happening now.

Scale over individual action unlocks potential

Here’s what we’ve learned: individual business transformation gets you started but market transformation gets you results. The more businesses prioritise reuse initiatives, the easier it becomes for the entire market.

The most visionary business leaders are looking beyond their own operations to transform the conditions in which they compete. Because while markets continue to externalize environmental costs and undervalue crucial transition investments, even the most committed businesses hit systemic barriers.

This requires more than just agreeing on a vision – it’s a new type of leadership. Businesses need to collaborate and cooperate in new ways to break down shared barriers.

Individual business action towards a shared vision is crucial to identifying systemic barriers and can accelerate solution development. However, it’s time to take the next step, to take everything we’ve learned about roadblocks to change and build shared pathways through them.

Commercial collaboration changes the game

Commercial collaboration paired with collective advocacy can unlock circular solutions at scale. When businesses align on systemic barriers, we can present a unified voice to policymakers, who need clear evidence of positive business intent to create supportive policies.

Policy alone will not move fast enough, though – businesses can go further. By working together, companies can invest in solutions, launch joint ventures, share infrastructure or co-develop products and services that create new circular value.

“

The circular economy is a strategic business imperative.

”

Take critical minerals. Tech and energy firms, as well as governments, are seeking to safeguard access to critical minerals such as copper, nickel, and lithium, in the face of an expected fivefold rise in demand by 2040.

A circular economy for these materials could keep them circulating at their highest value, closing the supply-demand gap while insulating companies against supply shocks and price volatility. The environmental wins are substantial but the business case drives action.

Collaboration the catalyst for circular scale

Commercial collaboration can accelerate innovation, create new markets, build key infrastructure and drive customer adoption much more efficiently and effectively than businesses focusing only on transforming themselves. And they can still compete robustly in the marketplace.

With the right governance, safeguards and ambition, commercial collaboration can expedite system change well within the bounds of competition laws.

We have to redesign the “rules” and how businesses operate within them. To achieve a thriving circular economy, we need policies that support innovation and innovation that supports infrastructure.

The plastics industry is working towards this right now. Over 280 companies, including market leaders such as PepsiCo and Unilever, have joined the Business Coalition for a Plastics Treaty to speak with an aligned voice in advocating for global regulatory changes for every business using plastic.

In parallel, these businesses continue to work towards reducing their own use of virgin plastic. The advocacy supports the business action and the business action strengthens the advocacy while both accelerate results.

Towards market transformation

This twin strategy of working towards changes at the market level while pursuing parallel investments within businesses can break markets out of linear limitations. It takes negotiating skills and new thinking but next-gen collaboration and cooperation create unstoppable momentum.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_6uIwcv_i75P65cl_ty65hMgzIe1pKI9yimAcAtCM0G0.jpeg,N,,2025-07-09 17:20:11.816963

As part of their ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship and innovation in aviation, Integrity Flight Support is proud to announce its partnership with 4AIR, offering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through a flexible and accessible program known as Book & Claim.

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel. Rather than being derived from petroleum, SAF is made from sustainable feedstocks, including used cooking oils, tallow, and municipal waste, with the potential to include algae or power-to-liquid fuels in the future.

SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works seamlessly with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. When blended with conventional Jet-A fuel, SAF meets all safety and performance standards (ASTM D1655 or DEFSTAN 91-91), and significantly reduces lifecycle carbon emissions — up to 90% with neat SAF, and typically 20–25% when blended.

Despite its benefits, SAF remains scarce at most airports due to logistical and supply challenges — that’s where Book & Claim comes in.

✈️ What is Book & Claim — and How Does It Work?

Book & Claim is a long-standing chain of custody model that enables flight operators to purchase the environmental benefits of SAF, even when physical SAF isn’t available at their airport.

Here’s how it works:

Producers deliver SAF into a local pipeline or airport fuel system near where it’s made, minimizing transportation emissions and costs.

The fuel is sold as regular Jet-A (without its sustainability attributes) to a third party.

You, the operator, purchase the environmental attributes of that SAF, known as a “green premium.”

You get to claim the emissions reductions as part of your carbon footprint reduction strategy, while contributing to increased demand and future scalability of SAF.

This approach is similar to how Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) work in the electricity market. The actual molecules of SAF don’t reach your aircraft, but your purchase helps displace fossil fuel use globally, encourages more SAF production, and allows you to meet sustainability targets — all without changing where or how you fuel.

✅ Why Book & Claim Makes Sense

Immediate Emission Reductions: Supports decarbonization goals without needing physical SAF delivery.

Market Expansion: Helps SAF producers reach broader markets, boosting industry viability.

Cost Efficiency: Reduces distribution costs and makes SAF more affordable over time.

Verifiable Transactions: All transactions are third-party verified through platforms like 4AIR’s Assure SAF Registry, ensuring emissions reductions are never double-counted

This facility will enable the domestic production of aviation fuel from used cooking oils, reducing reliance on imported SAF components.","ORLEN, a leading multi-energy company, has taken a significant stride towards a greener aviation future by introducing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to its commercial offering at key Polish airports. Aircraft departing from Warsaw Chopin Airport, Kraków, and Katowice can now refuel with this innovative fuel, which promises a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from both its production and combustion.

The strategic launch underscores ORLEN's commitment to its 2035 strategy, which prioritizes the expansion of its product portfolio while addressing the urgent need for decarbonization across both supply and demand chains

SAF is distinguished by its production from renewable or waste-derived feedstocks, adhering to strict sustainability criteria that prevent deforestation or the depletion of vital food and water resources. These feedstocks can include a diverse range of materials such as used cooking oils, as well as municipal, industrial, agricultural, and forestry waste. Crucially, the renewable component of SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel, making it fully compatible with existing aircraft engine technologies. This seamless integration allows for immediate adoption by airlines, facilitating an instant reduction in emissions from flight operations. SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% throughout its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and production method.

The introduction of SAF has been met with enthusiasm from key stakeholders in the Polish aviation sector.

Beyond its environmental benefits, ORLEN's introduction of SAF is also a proactive measure to comply with the European Union's ambitious ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. This regulation mandates that sustainable aviation fuels must constitute at least 2% of total jet fuel sales by 2025, with further increments planned to reach 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and a significant 70% by 2050. The regulation applies to EU airports that handled over 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tonnes of cargo in the preceding year.

To meet the increasing demand and regulatory obligations, ORLEN is actively developing a hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) facility at its Plock refinery. This facility will enable the domestic production of aviation fuel from used cooking oils, reducing reliance on imported SAF components. The HVO project, with an estimated value of over PLN 1.4 billion, is slated for completion in 2025. Until the facility becomes operational, ORLEN will continue to source SAF components from abroad.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:12.109814

The Royal Air Force display team, the Red Arrows, will make aviation history at the forthcoming Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), as the display will be powered entirely by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The performances will be the first time a national aerobatic team has not only flown on SAF, but also used a biofuel in the production of the iconic vapour trails.

Usually created by injecting a mixture of diesel and dye into the hot exhaust of the Hawk, for RIAT the Red Arrows will use a hydrotreated vegetable oil, a renewable biofuel, to paint the skies.

It follows the Red Arrows’ first 100% SAF flight in June, as part of King Charles’ official birthday celebrations.

The RAF pushes forward with sustainable aviation fuel

While civilian aviation led much of the early work on sustainable aviation fuel, air forces around the world are now taking steps to modernise fleets and reduce carbon footprints. It’s not just about saving the planet, but also delivers fuel resiliency in a time of geopolitical instability.

The Royal Air Force (RAF) has been particularly proactive on sustainability. In 2022, it flew a Voyager, the military version of the A330, on 100% SAF in a world-first for the type.

Then, in 2023, in conjunction with the Sustainable Skies World Summit, a Voyager powered by 43% SAF successfully completed an air-to-air refuelling flight from Brize Norton.

In 2023, the RAF conducted mid-air refuelling of both the Typhoon and the C-130 Hercules, and the Typhoon first flew a display on 100% SAF at RIAT in 2024.

The Typhoon is set to display using 100% SAF again this year. Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said:

“In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Red-Arrows-vapour-trails-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:16.660071

This will not be their first use of SAF at a public event. The Red Arrows made their first SAF-powered flypast over London on June 14, 2025, for HM King Charles.

During the RIAT airshow, the Red Arrows will use both SAF and a renewable biofuel called Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) to create their signature vapour trails. This will mark the first-ever aerobatic performances by the Red Arrows at the airshow using both SAF and HVO.

Three Air Displays Powered By SAF

The RAF is exploring alternative fuels to power both current and future aircraft, aiming to reduce dependence on global fossil fuel supply chains and enhance energy security, ultimately strengthening operational resilience. According to a statement by the RIAT, the Red Arrows will perform three times on the SAF, as well as feature in various special formation flypasts across the weekend event.

Also flying on SAF will be the RAF’s Typhoon display team, which made history by performing its first full routine using sustainable fuel at last year’s show. More than 170,000 people are expected at RAF Fairford for the aviation showcase, which is due to take place on Friday 18th, Saturday 19th, and Sunday 20th.

The flights are being made possible through the support of Air Space Intelligence, Intel Foundry, and Team Lewis, with HVO supplied by Power Electrics and SAF provided by AFS Aviation. Commenting on the news, Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said:

“Their nine-ship team are known across the world, so we are delighted to be hosting this landmark display here at RAF Fairford. In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”

The RAF Started Testing SAF In 2021

The RAF has been steadily advancing its testing of sustainable aviation fuel on military aircraft. In November 2021, it successfully flew a microlight powered by synthetic fuel derived from air and water. A major milestone followed in 2022, when an RAF Voyager (Airbus A330 MRTT) became the first large military aircraft to complete a 90-minute flight powered entirely by 100% SAF.

Less than a year later, the RAF expanded its SAF trials to include air-to-air refueling missions. It conducted its first such operation using a SAF blend of 46 to 48%, refueling both a Eurofighter Typhoon and a C-130J Hercules. During 2023, the RAF’s Voyager was used in a routine training mission with a 43% SAF blend for air-to-air refueling of Typhoon fighter jets.

SAF is made from a variety of renewable and waste-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, animal fats, agricultural and forestry residues, and even municipal waste. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute up to 65% of reductions by 2050.

Net-Zero Emissions By 2050: A Pipe Dream?

ambitious and far from easy. While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising part of the solution, it is not a silver bullet. SAF faces significant hurdles, including high production costs, limited scalability, and concerns about its true environmental impact.

In the UK, for instance, SAF is primarily produced from used cooking oil, some of which is imported from Asia. This long-distance shipping contributes to carbon emissions, with maritime transport accounting for about 2% of global CO2 output. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, expressed skepticism: “It's very hard to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel. There are aviation fuels that are less polluting than those currently used, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.”",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/red-20250505-255-ve_day_80_flypast-295_1-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:19.755090

""This RFS proposal is the most exciting since the RFS was expanded in 2007,"" Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw told the EPA.
Finalizing the proposed renewable fuels blending levels will provide the right boost at the right time for our farmers.
And 24 billion gallons must mean 24 billion gallons for total RFS volumes.
Cooper also said the RFA ""strongly supports"" EPA's proposed 50% reduction in RINs generated for import-based renewable fuels and fully agrees that there are ""reduced economic, energy security, and environmental benefits"" provided by imported renewable fuels.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Biofuels groups testifying in a public hearing on Tuesday on the Renewable Fuel Standard volumes proposal could hardly contain their excitement about what they say is one of the strongest-ever RFS proposals for 2026-2027 volumes.

All the while, the groups expressed concern about how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will address a backlog of more than 180 small-refinery exemptions still pending from previous years.

Biofuels interests told the agency they supported the commitment to account for prospective SREs in the final rule and to reallocate gallons exempted.

""This RFS proposal is the most exciting since the RFS was expanded in 2007,"" Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw told the EPA.

""I cannot overstate the optimism it has caused in rural America at a time when farm income has plummeted and talk of tariffs triggers uncertainty. Finalizing the proposed renewable fuels blending levels will provide the right boost at the right time for our farmers. It will enhance American energy dominance, lower prices for consumers and improve the environment. IRFA urges the EPA to maintain the robust RFS levels in the final rule.""

When it comes to RFS volumes and the effect SREs can have, Shaw said ""at the end of the day, 15 billion gallons needs to mean 15 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuels like ethanol. And 24 billion gallons must mean 24 billion gallons for total RFS volumes. SREs should be few and far between.""

Shaw said the agency could reallocate gallons lost to any exemptions.

""The optimism around the RFS is real today and it would be a mistake to pull the rug out from under one of the only bright spots in the current ag economy,"" he said.

Shaw also called on the EPA to unleash E15 access by eliminating regulations.

""EPA needs to reboot the effort begun during President Trump's first term to remove outdated regulations limiting E15 sales,"" Shaw said.

""E15 should be allowed in all fueling infrastructure from the storage tank through the nozzle. Requiring retailers to spend thousands of dollars to replace perfectly compatible equipment serves only to slow down the growth of consumer access to E15.""

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said during the hearing that ""strong"" renewable volume obligations will play a key role in delivering on President Trump's vision for U.S. ""energy dominance and rural prosperity.""

""If finalized, these RVOs would unlock investments, create jobs and support growth in rural America by expanding our country's renewable fuel production and use,"" she said.

""By setting conventional biofuel blending volumes at 15 billion gallons for two years, this proposal will create the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. This is the strongest RFS proposal we've ever seen, with the highest volumes ever, showing this administration's commitment to American biofuel producers and the farmers that depend on them.""

Skor joined other biofuels interests in urging the EPA to make it clear that small-refinery exemptions will not be ""granted recklessly"" and that any gallons lost will be accounted for in the market.

""Only with these pieces in place can this proposal truly deliver the game-changing impact the president wants it to have and that the nation's biofuel producers and rural communities are counting on,"" Skor said.

Clean Fuels Alliance America CEO Donnell Rehagen said the proposed bump in biomass-based diesel volumes have already had a positive effect on the markets.

""Our industry has made substantial investments over the past several years in both biofuel production, feedstock supply, and distribution infrastructure,"" he said during the virtual hearing.

""Domestic production of biodiesel and renewable diesel has doubled since 2020 and continues to grow. We supplied more than 5 billion gallons of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) to the U.S. market in 2024 and we are poised to deliver more in 2026. We are pleased that since the proposed rule came out the markets have reacted in a positive fashion. However, uncertainty around small-refinery exemptions still hangs over the industry. We ask that you sustain the volumes as proposed to ensure that our capacity is fully utilized.""

Brian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol, said while his group supports EPA's proposal, he encouraged the agency to consider using its statutory authority to exceed the 15-billion-gallon conventional biofuel threshold.

Jennings said that would help offset the potential impact of lost export markets and ensure U.S. ethanol producers are not displaced by surplus renewable identification numbers, or RINs, from other categories.

Jennings highlighted ACE's ongoing efforts to establish the link between low-carbon farming practices and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production tax credit recently extended by Congress.

Jennings emphasized the importance of rewarding farmers for implementing practices that reduce the carbon intensity of ethanol.

""In partnership with USDA, DOE, 13 ethanol companies and hundreds of farmers, ACE is currently leading a project to unlock new markets and tax credits, such as 45Z, based on low-carbon farming,"" Jennings said.

Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said the proposal was ""an important step toward achieving President Trump's vision for lower gas prices, a stronger agriculture industry, and American energy dominance.""

While the RFA applauded EPA's decision to prospectively reallocate any renewable fuel volumes lost to small-refinery exemptions in the final rule, Cooper cautioned that the EPA must be ""extremely judicious"" in determining whether any refiners have truly suffered, or will suffer, ""disproportionate economic hardship"" related to compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, adding that ""it is critically important that EPA accurately estimate exempted volumes in the final rule to ensure that the volume requirements that are actually implemented in 2026 and 2027 match those that are published in the rule.""

Cooper also said the RFA ""strongly supports"" EPA's proposed 50% reduction in RINs generated for import-based renewable fuels and fully agrees that there are ""reduced economic, energy security, and environmental benefits"" provided by imported renewable fuels.

He said the enhanced recordkeeping and reporting procedures in the proposal, however, are not needed for corn-based ethanol given that the U.S. does not import corn ethanol and corn imports make up just one 10th of 1% of the U.S. corn supply.

It will serve as a central marketplace for energy and raw materials, starting with the launch of its first mechanism – the hydrogen mechanism.

Garrett Monaghan, renewable energy expert at Pinsent Masons, said: “The mechanism will enhance security of supply while also enabling the decarbonisation of sectors such as industry and transport where reducing carbon emissions is both difficult and urgently needed.”

The hydrogen initiative, launched on 2 July, will match suppliers of hydrogen and its derivatives, such as ammonia, methanol and electro-sustainable aviation fuel, to offtakers, building on the success of the AggregateEU platform that achieved similar goals within the gas market. The platform will also perform a number of other services, such as displaying information about available financing solutions as well as collecting and using market data to assess supply and demand. The hub will also use market insights to support the development of infrastructure for hydrogen transport and storage, providing a platform for assessing potential interest in infrastructure projects.

By aggregating and matching supply and demand, it is hoped that the hydrogen mechanism will help firms identify infrastructure needs, access financial solutions, and build long term partnerships. The first round of matching supply and demand is planned for September, and the mechanism is authorised to operate under the European Hydrogen Bank until 31 December 2029.

The hydrogen mechanism is just the first step, with the Commission set to roll out additional tools in the coming months. This includes a raw materials mechanism - to help industries secure access to essential minerals and metals – and the gas mechanism – to support the transition from natural gas to renewable gases like biomethane. These mechanisms will be integrated into the same online hub.

Stakeholders can now register on the platform and subscribe to the hydrogen mechanism, with the Commission encouraging companies of all sizes – from energy producers to industrial consumers – to participate.

The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.
In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.
The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.","The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year.

US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production.

EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth.

The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import.

Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years.

In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.

Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.

EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.

This move aims to diversify Mexico's energy mix and reduce its reliance on fossil fuel production.

The updated statute outlines PEMEX's participation in the exploration of hydrogen fields and geoenergy projects. The NOC will also explore electricity generation projects based on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Additionally, PEMEX plans to engage in the generation of biofuels, including biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

One initiative to promote clean energy use includes establishing a photovoltaic generation network for self-consumption. This involves installing solar panels on the rooftops of PEMEX franchised service stations, aiming for energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

In geoenergy, PEMEX anticipates geothermal projects and electricity generation at existing assets, such as disused offshore platforms. Mexico possesses high meteorological and oceanic potential from tides, currents, waves, and wind, which can be leveraged with these out-of-operation platforms. The company also plans specific projects to reduce gas flaring.

Furthermore, PEMEX is collaborating with the Federal Electricity Commission on three cogeneration power plants. These, located at the Tula and Salina Cruz refineries and the Cangrejera Petrochemical Complex, are projected to generate an estimated 2,422MW. Their purpose is to use residual heat from industrial plants to produce electricity efficiently. Operations for these plants are expected to begin in 2029 and 2030.

SAF and Brazil’s Potential as a Sustainable Fuel Hub A particularly insightful discussion during the summit centered on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), underscoring Brazil’s potential to become a global SAF leader.","By Victoria Moura, Agritecture | Post–World Agri-Tech South America 2025 Recap

At the World Agri-Tech South America Summit in São Paulo, one message resonated above all: Brazil’s agriculture is evolving into a new agri-culture—one defined not merely by yields and exports but by how technology, sustainability, and collaboration converge to future-proof food systems in a climate-challenged world. Brazil already feeds 10% of the global population while using land with remarkable efficiency, having increased its agricultural production by nearly 600% over the past 40 years while expanding its planted area by only around 100% (Embrapa, 2023). However, to maintain its competitiveness while meeting growing international demands for traceability, quality, and environmental stewardship, systemic transformation is essential, and technology will be at the heart of this transition.

Building the Right Tech for Real Farmer Needs

Brazilian agrifoodtech funding surged in early 2025, with US $76.8 million raised in Q1 alone—a 32% increase from the previous quarter and an 85% year-over-year rise—positioning Brazil to capture 55% of all Latin American agtech funding in 2024, despite representing just 1.5% of global agtech investment (AgFunderNews, The Brazilian Report). Additionally, consultancy Liga Ventures reported that Brazilian agtech startups received over BRL 1 billion (~US $177 million) in 2024, the second-highest year on record.

This momentum reflects growing confidence in agtech’s potential to drive transformation in Brazil’s agriculture. Yet, as emphasized during summit discussions with Embrapa, Danone, and ABAG leaders, a critical disconnect remains: many startups focus on developing sophisticated, capital-intensive technologies designed to attract investors, while often overlooking the urgent, practical needs of farmers on the ground. This gap is particularly relevant in Brazil, where over 80% of the country’s more than 5 million agricultural establishments are smallholder farms (IBGE Agricultural Census, 2023).

Smallholder farmers require affordable, low-complexity technologies that can address critical challenges such as irrigation, pest management, and soil health while enabling adaptation to climate variability and water stress. For example, a 2020 Embrapa survey found that only ~3% of irrigating producers had properties over 1,000 hectares, while 64% irrigated less than 5 hectares, underscoring that irrigation in Brazil is predominantly practiced by small- to mid-scale farmers (Embrapa). Research by the World Bank (2024) highlights that prioritizing irrigation and basic mechanization in smallholder systems can increase yields by up to 50% while reducing labor demands and post-harvest losses by 30%.

Silvia Dávila of Danone highlighted this need for targeted, appropriate technologies, citing Danone's Flora Project as an example, which increased smallholder milk farmers’ incomes by 17% while reducing methane emissions by 40%. “Supporting farmers with the right tools transforms communities while advancing climate goals,” Dávila emphasized, underlining that impactful technology must be designed with, not just for, farmers.

A key discussion point arising from these insights is the need for startups and investors to collaborate with cooperatives, extension services, and local governments to design solutions that consider Brazil’s geographic and socioeconomic diversity while building viable business models for rural communities.

Integrating Technology Across the Supply Chain

Brazil’s agricultural supply chain is vast, complex, and costly, with logistics—including road and port expenses—accounting for 30–40% of the total cost of soybeans, according to a USP/Esalq study, with overall transport costs estimated to be 8–9 times higher than in the United States, significantly reducing competitiveness (Datamar News). Road transport, predominantly reliant on diesel trucks, forms the backbone of Brazil’s export logistics, leaving the sector heavily exposed to fuel price volatility and infrastructure bottlenecks.

Meanwhile, Brazil imports about 85% of its fertilizer needs, making input costs highly vulnerable to global price swings, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical disruptions (University of Navarra). During the World Agri-Tech South America Summit, Embrapa’s leadership emphasized that fostering local bioinput industries and expanding domestic fertilizer production are critical strategies to reduce Brazil’s vulnerability while promoting sustainability and climate resilience within the sector.

Otavio Lopes of EY argued for a paradigm shift: moving from a linear, reactive supply chain toward an interconnected, predictive ecosystem. “We need to transition from cost-focused to resilience-focused systems,” he noted, emphasizing the necessity for digital integration, real-time data visibility, and blockchain-enabled traceability across the supply chain to meet the evolving expectations of global markets and consumers demanding deforestation-free, ethically sourced products.

A critical insight is that technology integration must align with infrastructure development and policy frameworks, enabling supply chains to evolve into systems that are efficient, climate-resilient, and inclusive of smallholders, who collectively produce a significant share of Brazil’s coffee, fruits, vegetables, and dairy exports.

“Digitization in agriculture is not just about software adoption; it is about a cultural change within organizations. As an export leader, Brazil’s continued strength globally will depend on tech integration, digitalization, and innovation. With climate pressures, rising consumer expectations for quality, and tightening sustainability regulations globally, efficiency and traceability are not luxuries—they are prerequisites for remaining competitive.” (Victoria Moura, South America Representative at Agritecture).

Financing Innovation: The Role of Credit

Adopting technology and sustainability practices requires financing structures aligned with the realities of Brazil’s farmers. In its 2025/26 agricultural plan, the Brazilian government allocated a record R$78.2 billion to PRONAF, a 3% increase from the previous cycle. However, while credit lines for essential food production remain relatively low—around 2% for organic and 3% for staple crops—other lines, including some family-farming commodity and investment loans, now carry rates ranging from 5–6.5%, and even up to 8% in certain categories (Exame, 2025). These higher rates, introduced amid broader economic tightening, risk limiting access for low-income farmers who depend on affordable credit to modernize, invest in sustainable practices, and adopt new technologies.

Brazil’s rural credit system remains heavily dependent on public policy, but private financial institutions are increasingly stepping in to complement these efforts. As Bradesco’s Head of Agribusiness, Nadege Saad, emphasized during the summit, “credit is a tool, but without guidance and data, it becomes a burden rather than a solution.” This reflects a key point raised during the event: credit accessibility must be paired with technical assistance and digital tools to ensure effective capital allocation, improve productivity, and reduce default risks.

IFC specialists in 2024 further underscored that integrating climate-smart criteria and fintech innovations into rural credit structures can create a virtuous cycle of sustainability and financial resilience. This includes redesigning credit lines to incentivize eco-friendly practices—such as offering preferential rates or rebates for farmers adopting drought-resistant crops or efficient irrigation systems—and leveraging digital farm management and risk assessment platforms, enabling lenders to track crop conditions and climate risks in real time for improved credit decisions (World Bank Blogs).

Additionally, IFC and its partners are exploring carbon credit integration within rural credit programs, allowing farmers who adopt regenerative practices to generate tradable carbon credits that can supplement loan repayments or farm income, making sustainable investments more financially attractive (World Bank Blogs, Agreena). These blended approaches—linking financial incentives, digital monitoring, and carbon markets—can accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices while lowering the risk profile of loans by enhancing farm resilience and diversification.

This signals an opportunity for agritech startups and financial institutions in Brazil to collaborate on embedded fintech solutions, offering credit products tied to technology adoption for irrigation, bioinputs, precision tools, and renewable energy systems.

Automation and the Workforce: A Brazilian Perspective

Although Brazil has historically benefited from affordable and abundant rural labor, the reality is shifting. The rural population declined from 15.3% in 2012 to 12.7% in 2022 (IBGE, 2023), driven by rural-to-urban migration and aging demographics, with over 33% of farmers now above the age of 55 (MAPA, 2024). The lack of generational renewal is evident, with young people discouraged by legal restrictions on youth labor, limited infrastructure in rural areas, and a desire for urban employment opportunities. According to IPEA (2024), this trend risks a 12% reduction in Brazil’s agricultural workforce over the next decade if interventions are not made.

Furthermore, the high cost of formal employment due to CLT labor laws and taxes means hiring a worker can cost employers 100-150% more than the nominal wage (CNA, 2023). This structural burden pressures producers, making automation an increasingly attractive option.

Automation in agriculture is not about replacing labor—it’s about enhancing it. According to McKinsey (2024), automation can increase productivity by 25% while reducing operational costs by 15-20%, allowing workers to shift to higher-value roles such as farm oversight, data analysis, and precision operations management.

“Automation allows us to manage complexity, reduce human error, and optimize decision-making in a way that manual processes simply can’t match,” said Marcelo Batistella of BASF during the summit, emphasizing that automation is not a threat but a tool to improve efficiency, quality, and competitiveness.

An additional dimension is that precision agriculture and site-specific management practices, enabled by automation, are crucial for scaling regenerative agriculture across Brazil’s large farming areas while maintaining environmental stewardship, as variable-rate irrigation and nutrient management can reduce input use by 20-30% while improving yields (CGEE, 2024).

Regenerative Practices, Bioinputs, and Climate Goals

Latin America holds 31% of the world's freshwater resources and 40% of the world’s biodiversity (along the Caribbean). Comprising almost half of South America's territory (47.3%), Brazil is positioned at the frontline of climate action within agriculture. Regenerative agriculture practices, including no-till farming, cover cropping, integrated crop-livestock systems, and bioinputs, are central to building climate resilience while supporting soil health and carbon sequestration.

Brazil’s National Bioeconomy Strategy aims to reduce dependence on imported synthetic fertilizers and promote the use of bioinputs, with Embrapa reporting that biological nitrogen fixation in soybeans alone saves Brazilian farmers approximately US$15 billion annually while reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Embrapa, 2024). “Bioinputs are not just environmentally sound; they’re economically smart, reducing reliance on imports and building resilience,” emphasized Alessandro Cruvinel of the Ministry of Agriculture.

Adopting regenerative practices also aligns with market trends, as global buyers increasingly demand deforestation-free, low-carbon supply chains. In fact, studies have found that sustainability certifications often translate into sizable price uplifts – e.g. coffee farmers under Fairtrade or organic standards have earned 20–30% higher prices than conventional growers (MDPI, 2024).

Key discussion points include the need for scalable models that align regenerative practices with credit incentives and digital monitoring tools to measure soil health and carbon sequestration for carbon credit programs.

SAF and Brazil’s Potential as a Sustainable Fuel Hub

A particularly insightful discussion during the summit centered on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), underscoring Brazil’s potential to become a global SAF leader. Brazil’s experience with ethanol and biofuel leadership positions it well to align energy, food, and climate strategies efficiently.

Brazil has officially moved to raise the mandatory ethanol blend in gasoline from 27% to 30% (E27 to E30) as of August 2025 (Reuters, 2025). Approved by the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE), this policy is framed as a step toward cleaner energy and reduced fossil-fuel dependence. According to the Brazilian government, increasing the ethanol content “eliminates [fuel] imports, reduces emissions, [and] strengthens national biofuel production” (gov.br). Practically, the E30 mandate is expected to drive over R$10 billion in new investments and create more than 50,000 jobs as biofuel supply expands (gov.br), underscoring Brazil’s commitment to sustainable energy transitions while also supporting domestic agriculture and benefiting sugarcane and corn ethanol producers (Reuters, 2025).

In the aviation sector, global demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to soar to 449–500 billion liters annually by 2050, aligning with the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) net-zero carbon goals and representing about 65% of total aviation fuel needs by mid-century (AirInsight, LH Consulting). This surge in demand offers a significant export opportunity for biofuel-producing nations like Brazil. Analysts note Brazil’s SAF production potential could exceed its domestic jet-fuel consumption, positioning it as a major SAF exporter if scalability challenges are addressed (Sustainable Aviation Futures). One study found Brazil could produce around 9 billion liters of SAF from residual feedstocks alone—enough to meet the country’s annual jet fuel demand of 7.8 billion liters while generating a surplus for export (Revista Pesquisa FAPESP). Leveraging its abundant sugarcane, corn, and other biomass resources, Brazil has a competitive advantage in SAF production.

However, realizing this potential will require investment in new biorefineries, supportive policies, and technological scale-up to bring down costs. Panelists in the Sustainable Fuels: Scaling Biofuels and Tapping into Carbon Markets for Sustainable Growth session at the summit emphasized the need for blended finance models, clear policy frameworks, and stable demand signals to build investor confidence in SAF infrastructure, alongside supply chain integration to secure consistent biomass supply without disrupting food production. This points to a broader insight: the future of sustainable fuels must intersect with food systems planning to ensure synergies rather than trade-offs.

A Well-Rounded Event Fostering Connection and Collaboration

The World Agri-Tech South America Summit was a comprehensive gathering of stakeholders shaping the future of agriculture. The event brought together C-suite leaders, cooperative heads, startup CEOs, policymakers, and research institutions such as Embrapa and the Ministry of Agriculture, creating a platform for collaboration across the sector’s most pressing challenges and opportunities.

Panel discussions explored critical topics from financing and bioinputs to regenerative practices, SAF production, and precision agriculture. The event also offered startup pitches, interactive roundtables, and targeted networking opportunities, including a Women in AgriTech brunch, facilitating deeper collaboration among participants. Networking moments—whether during pre-booked 1:1 sessions, over high-quality Brazilian meals, or at the lively closing party with live music—were invaluable for turning ideas into action and building enduring partnerships.

The June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to develop an electro-synthetic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) facility in Jesup, Georgia, marks a pivotal shift for RYAM—from a traditional cellulose producer to a leader in carbon-negative infrastructure. While the partnership's immediate focus is on decarbonization and renewable fuel production, its long-term potential as an overlooked “AI-infrastructure play” lies in its ability to leverage emerging technologies to optimize energy systems. Here's why investors should take notice.

The Strategic Pivot: From Cellulose to Carbon Capture

RYAM's collaboration with Verso Energy targets three interconnected projects at its Jesup, Georgia, site:

1. Biogenic CO₂ Capture and Storage (CCS): RYAM's existing manufacturing processes produce biogenic CO₂, a byproduct of its cellulose production. The CCS project aims to capture this CO₂, which is carbon-neutral due to its origin from biomass, and store it permanently.

2. Renewable Hydrogen Production: A green hydrogen unit will use renewable energy (likely solar or wind) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This hydrogen will serve as a critical feedstock for the e-SAF production process.

3. e-Fuel Synthesis: The final facility will convert captured CO₂ and green hydrogen into e-SAF via Power-to-Liquid technology. This fuel, with lifecycle emissions 90% lower than conventional jet fuel, could meet growing demand from airlines and governments under EU ReFuelEU and U.S. tax incentive frameworks.

The project's genius lies in its use of RYAM's existing infrastructure—a $1.6 billion asset base—as a launchpad for these new ventures. By repurposing its Jesup site, RYAM avoids costly greenfield construction and taps into a steady supply of biogenic CO₂, turning waste into revenue.

The AI-Infrastructure Angle: A Subtle but Strategic Edge

While the MoU does not explicitly mention artificial intelligence, the broader trend in energy infrastructure increasingly relies on smart systems to optimize efficiency, predict maintenance needs, and manage complex supply chains. For instance:

- Process Optimization: AI-driven algorithms could refine the electrolysis process for hydrogen production or fine-tune CO₂ capture efficiency.

- Grid Management: As renewable energy sources power the plant, AI could balance energy demand and storage to minimize grid strain.

- Carbon Accounting: Blockchain and AI could enable real-time tracking of carbon credits, a critical feature for compliance with global emissions targets.

RYAM's pivot to infrastructure—where scalability and operational precision are paramount—positions it to integrate such tools as the market matures. This could give it an edge over competitors still reliant on static, legacy systems.

Market Catalysts and Risks

RYAM's stock has lagged behind broader markets, trading at a valuation that ignores its clean energy potential. Key catalysts include:

- Feasibility Study Results (2025–2026): A positive outcome could trigger a final investment decision (FID) by early 2027, unlocking a potential 50–100% upside as CO₂ monetization begins.

- Regulatory Tailwinds: The EU's ReFuelEU mandate, which requires 2% SAF blending by 2028, and U.S. tax incentives for SAF producers create a $15–20 billion market opportunity by 2030.

Risks remain, however:

- Capital Costs: The project's estimated €1–2 billion price tag requires securing financing amid a volatile credit market.

- Technology Scaling: While Power-to-Liquid is proven in labs, industrial-scale deployment faces hurdles like hydrogen storage and grid integration.

Investment Thesis: A Hidden Gem in the Energy Transition

RYAM's undervalued stock and strategic foresight make it a compelling play on clean energy infrastructure. Investors should:

1. Buy on dips below $15/share: Current valuation does not reflect the CO₂ monetization opportunity or the scalability of Jesup's model.

2. Watch for FID announcements: A green light by early 2027 could catalyze a re-rating.

3. Consider ESG-focused ETFs: Pair RYAM with broader energy transition plays like NIO or Plug Power (PLUG) for diversification.

Conclusion: RYAM's Quiet Revolution

Rayonier Advanced Materials is not just a cellulose supplier—it's a pioneer in repurposing legacy infrastructure for the green economy. While AI may not yet be part of its toolkit, its strategic bet on carbon-negative energy systems aligns with the broader trend toward smart, data-driven infrastructure. Investors who recognize this shift early could benefit as RYAM transitions from a overlooked mid-cap stock to a cornerstone of the $1 trillion sustainable fuels market.

Sees new opportunities in Malaysia for growth in life sciences and healthcare as well as new energy

DHL is well-positioned to support Malaysia’s trade and logistics ambitions with expanded investments and capabilities

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA – Media OutReach Newswire – 9 July 2025 – DHL, the world’s leading logistics provider, has reaffirmed its commitment to Malaysia through Strategy 2030, a five-year roadmap aimed at accelerating sustainable growth with an expanded focus on high-value sectors. The country is a vital link in DHL’s network, poised to capitalize on opportunities as a leading hub for trade and an emerging destination for supply chain diversification.

Malaysia has long been strategically important for DHL and hosts four of DHL Group’s globally operating divisions, which together command a portfolio of solutions encompassing domestic delivery, e-commerce shipping and fulfilment, road, air, and sea freight, international express, and industrial supply chain management. These are underpinned by an IT data centre and regional shared services that drive backend functions for DHL’s cross-border presence.

Since the company established its roots here in 1968, it has grown in tandem with a vibrant economy that is now the fifth-largest in Southeast Asia. Across the four divisions, DHL employs a workforce of over 4,500. Continued investments in infrastructure and capabilities reflect confidence in Malaysia as an attractive destination for facilitating global trade and logistics.

Recognizing Malaysia’s competitive advantages and business potential, DHL plans to further enhance its product offerings and operational capabilities in the local market, focusing on several key drivers.

Geographic Tailwinds

Emerging geographical and economic developments continue to have profound effects on companies’ supply chain diversification strategy, omnishoring as well as domestic and foreign direct investment. To help businesses capitalize on these developments, DHL will build on its strong global footprint and local expertise. DHL has identified Malaysia as one of the 20 high-growth markets that could stand to benefit the most from these changes. This is solidified by Malaysia’s record of a historic high of RM378.5 billion in approved investments in 2024. FDI accounted for 45 percent of the figure, led by the United States, Germany, China, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

In fact, DHL has long contributed to such foreign inflows through its partnership with the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA). In May, both parties signed a renewed memorandum of understanding, building on joint efforts since 2023 that have yielded significant investment outcomes in key priority sectors across eight states: Kedah, Penang, Perak, Johor, Melaka, Sabah, Sarawak, and Selangor.

In recent years, DHL has consistently invested ahead of the curve to support the growing needs of businesses expanding their operations in Malaysia. These investments include:

A new Kuala Lumpur Gateway in 2024, the largest local DHL Express investment to date at EUR60 million (MYR300 million)

EUR131 million (MYR655 million) investment by DHL Supply Chain allocated until 2028 towards expanding warehousing capacity, staff, and sustainability activities. These include the new Penang Logistics Hub 5 and South Region Hub opened earlier this year, with one more planned for Penang and another in the Central region

Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, said: “Trade has remained resilient across the region, boosted by shifting attention to these parts of the world for manufacturing and sourcing operations. Thanks to our forward-looking approach, we are in a strong position to respond with the timely and strategic improvements we made. With a presence that spans more than 220 countries and territories, we retain a crucial role in connecting businesses seamlessly to international value chains.”

Life sciences and healthcare (LSHC)

The biopharma, cell and gene, and clinical trials market is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 10 percent until 2030. DHL is well-positioned to address these shifts, with its track record of over 30 years in specialized pharma logistics. In 2025, the company acquired specialty courier CRYOPDP and announced an investment of EUR 500 million (approximately MYR 2.4 billion) to enhance its LSH capacity in the Asia Pacific region. Currently, DHL has 300,000 square metres of fully compliant warehousing space in 15 countries across the region.

Christopher Lim, Managing Director of DHL Global Forwarding Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei said: “Today, 10 of the world’s top medical device companies have established operations here, elevating Malaysia into the league of global medical device hubs. These MNCs are driving innovation, diversifying the nation’s export portfolio and shifting the focus beyond glove production to high-value advanced devices manufacturing. We are ready to support Malaysia’s ambitions to grow this sector, backed by our team of trained life sciences specialists, a globally validated IT platform, and stringent operational protocols, we ensure the integrity and compliance of every shipment.”

In Malaysia, these cover end-to-end solutions including cold chain management for DHL Supply Chain’s customers, the latest being a global medical device manufacturer. DHL Global Forwarding also has a cold room at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the only one of its kind on the premises, compliant with Good Distribution Practice and World Health Organization standards. DHL Express extends its Medical Express service (otherwise known as WMX) locally, achieving speed and reliability for research, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Leveraging their expertise in parcel delivery and returns, DHL eCommerce is a partner to a local healthtech company, Esyms, where DHL enables safe and timely delivery of medications from hospitals and clinics to patients’ doorsteps.

New energy and auto-mobility

New Energy is a key growth sector under DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, where the Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage system, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen.

In Malaysia, dedicated logistics solutions are increasing in demand with the transformation of the renewable energy and auto-mobility sectors, bolstered by positive momentum in the country’s EV agenda. This can be attributed to favourable government initiatives, including the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021–2030, the National Automotive Policy 2020, and the National Energy Transition Roadmap. DHL is a leader in the local automotive industry from freight solutions to being an MNC pioneer in the 3PL (third-party logistics) space, offering a comprehensive range of services from spare parts fulfillment to setup and management of regional distribution centers.

Mario Lorenz, Managing Director for DHL Supply Chain Malaysia, said: “Last year, Malaysia’s vehicle market hit a record high of more than 800,000 units sold[1], so it is still a high-growth segment for us. However, we are not just focusing on internal combustion engines; we have developed solutions for the industry of the future – electric vehicles. Our expertise in managing the movement of spare parts, service logistics, and handling regional distribution is transferable to EVs. Malaysia is also in the pipeline for a DHL EV Centre of Excellence, joining a network of similar facilities in 10 countries that cover capital equipment for new EV-related factories, inbound-to-manufacturing (I2M), finished vehicles, and aftermarket logistics.”

E-commerce

B2C and B2B digital sales continue to be a steady contributor to profitability for DHL. Malaysia’s e-commerce market maintains a bullish outlook with a projected CAGR of 11.25 percent until 2029[2]. The company has long been an ecosystem partner for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, with an eye on increasing their share of national exports.

To this end, DHL developed the GoTrade program to equip entrepreneurs with practical knowledge and resources to navigate the complexities of shipping abroad and accessing overseas consumers. Since its inception in 2020, the initiative has trained over 9,100 SMEs across the United States, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia Pacific. Locally, DHL has partnered the Malaysia External Trade Development Corp (MATRADE), reaching more than 2,000 participants through 18 workshops from 2023 to 2024.

Saurabh Kumar, Managing Director of DHL eCommerce Malaysia, said, “As online shopping continues to shape the way we live and work, we are perfectly equipped to help homegrown B2B and B2C brands thrive in the digital marketplace through innovation and best-in-class delivery services. We currently work with a diverse range of customers from global names to local brands across industries. This breadth of experience reflects our ability to meet the evolving needs of the domestic e-commerce ecosystem.”

Leading the way in sustainable logistics

In recognizing the heightened importance that logistics plays in global trade, equal attention must be given to its adverse effects on the climate. The industry as a whole generates an estimated 3.4 billion[3] tons of CO2e annually, with DHL contributing one percent of the total. The company became the first logistics business to pledge to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050, and is pursuing measurable goals to decarbonize its operations towards 2030 interim milestones. With Strategy 2030, DHL added a fourth bottom line, “Green Logistics of Choice”, to the existing “Employer of Choice,” “Provider of Choice”, and “Investment of Choice”.

In Malaysia, the pursuit of more sustainable logistics operations took shape in 2022 with the introduction of six electric vans as DHL Express became the first company in the country to implement EVs for logistics use. The number has since risen to 74 electric vans and nine electric scooters. This puts the local division squarely on track to achieve the groupwide target of electrifying two-thirds of the pickup and delivery fleet by 2030.

DHL Express and DHL Global Forwarding also support customers in reducing their Scope 3 emissions via GoGreen Plus service, utilizing sustainable aviation fuel and sustainable marine fuel. To date, more than 90,000 customers in Asia Pacific have used the service for their time-definite international shipments, while 180,000 tons of TtW-CO2e on Full Container Load and Less than Container Load shipping have been mitigated.

India can potentially manufacture 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, which positions it as a key player in shaping a greener, more resilient aviation future. Let’s understand SAF and its key environmental benefits.

SAF for reducing airline emissions

Aircraft emit water vapour, soot, sulfur aerosols, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which contribute to the formation of contrails – clouds that form when water vapour condenses and freezes around small particles (aerosols) in aircraft exhaust. All of these factors have additional warming effects on the atmosphere.

Moreover, aviation’s share in global emissions is expected to increase due to two key reasons. Currently, less than 10 per cent of the global population relies on air travel. But this number is projected to more than double in the coming decades. Second, unlike aviation, other high-emission sectors such as electricity, cement, and steel production are gradually moving to greener alternatives.

In this context, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), also known as aviation biofuel, has emerged as a credible alternative with the potential to reduce aviation-related emissions. SAF is made from sustainable sources and has characteristics similar to Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), but with a significantly lesser carbon footprint. It is a ‘drop in’ fuel, meaning it can be blended with ATF without requiring any change in the existing machinery of aircraft.

SAF can be derived from a range of materials, including

— Oils and fats such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO), oil-rich seeds from plants, algae oils, animal fats

— Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)

— Agricultural and forestry residues such as wood waste, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, husks and straw, sugars and starches.

There are various methods to produce SAF, with each using different combinations of raw materials. For SAF to be truly sustainable, it is important that the feedstock used in its production does not compete with food production, cause deforestation, or harm biodiversity.

Toward net-negative emissions

SAF offers multiple benefits. The primary advantage is its ability to significantly reduce emissions and its compatibility with the current global aircraft fleet. It means SAF can be used without modifications to existing planes, engines, or fueling infrastructure. It is estimated that SAF has the potential to reduce GHG emissions in air travel by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

In addition to SAF, there are other innovations like Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origins (RFNBOs). It is produced using renewable electricity through Power to Liquid PtL technology that combines Green Hydrogen with Carbon captured from atmospheric CO₂. It offers the potential for even net negative emissions. SAF combustion produces far less harmful gases and particulate matter, contributing to cleaner skies.

The adoption of these biofuels can lead to new demand for feedstock and open new revenue streams in agriculture and waste management. In addition, diversification of fuel sources in the aviation sector can help reduce import dependence and protect the sector from global oil price volatility. This, in turn, could lead to a more stable aviation sector, possibly making air travel accessible to larger sections of society. Moreover, SAF adoption will also generate employment opportunities in the sustainability sector.

However, despite these benefits, there are a few barriers to the widespread adoption of SAF. First, the cost of producing these biofuels, which is more than double that of conventional fuels, makes its large-scale adoption difficult for airlines without passing the burden onto consumers.

The production, storage, blending, and transportation of SAF require the development of new infrastructure, which would add significantly to the initial cost of adoption. Another key issue is the availability and sustainability of feedstock required for SAF production. The characteristics and variety of necessary feedstock mean that there is no guarantee of year-round supply.

Further, there is a significant risk that the production process can have adverse environmental impacts if not managed properly. For SAF to be considered truly sustainable and to ensure a significant reduction in GHG emissions, it is crucial to ensure that its production does not have negative social or environmental impacts.

How SAF reshapes global and Indian aviation

Notably, there is now a global push to increase the blending of SAF in commercial aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) – the UN’s specialised agency for the development of air transport – has established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). It mandates that international airlines must offset their emissions growth post-2020, and the use of SAF is incentivised as a compliance mechanism.

Similarly, the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative has introduced binding SAF blending targets, aiming for 2 per cent SAF by 2025, 6 per cent by 2030, and 70 per cent by 2050, with sub-mandates for synthetic fuels. Another innovative mechanism is the World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, which has set the blending target of 10 per cent SAF by 2030. It also seeks to address the high cost of SAF through innovative financing and supportive policy frameworks.

However, India has a nuanced and pragmatic approach to SAF, advocating for nationally determined targets rather than binding international mandates. India’s position is based on the twin goals of prioritising energy security and food security, and seeking to balance sustainability goals with passenger demand. Despite these reservations, India is a party to the CORSIA and is positioning itself to be a key player in the global SAF landscape. Notably, the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) was launched by India during the G20 Summit in New Delhi in 2023 with the aim to expedite the worldwide adoption of biofuels, including SAF.

India has also set SAF blending targets of 1 per cent for domestic airlines by 2025 and 1-2 per cent for international flights by 2027-2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 and the potential to scale up to 15 per cent by 2040. The abundant supply of agricultural residues bolsters India’s goal of becoming SAF exporter. However, challenges like high costs and underdeveloped supply chains need to be taken care of.

To address such issues, policies like tax incentives and public-private partnerships have been proposed. SAF presents a near-term, drop-in solution to reduce emissions from the aviation sector while longer term decarbonisation technologies continue to evolve. Despite existing challenges, the international consensus to push for SAF through initiatives like the CORSIA and ReFuelEU offers hope for overcoming barriers to large-scale adoption. For India, SAF provides an opportunity to leverage its resources to be a market leader in the sector and make meaningful contributions to global decarbonisation efforts, while also keeping local realities and national priorities in mind.

The usually diesel-fueled smoke pod will also switch to a biofuel based on vegetable oil.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been trialed by the Royal Air Force since 2020, when the Ministry of Defence’s aviation fuel standards were updated to permit its use in defence aircraft. Blends of conventional fuel and SAF have since been used to fill Typhoon fighter aircraft, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, and C-130 transports (retired 2023) – including delivery through air to air refueling. A 100% sustainable fuel flight took place in November 2022 utilising an A330 Voyager from RAF Brize Norton.

SAF can reduce the carbon emissions generated by an aircraft by around 80%. It is produced from agricultural and industrial byproducts, including waste cooking oils, animal fats, and even municipal solid waste. While helping to fulfil government and service objectives related to combating climate change, SAF also provides a way to reduce reliance on foreign supplies of crude oil and general fossil fuel products. It is designed to blend with conventional fuel to allow mixed supplies, easing logistical burdens, and offer the opportunity of a gradual introduction.

The Red Arrows’ planned full display powered by sustainable fuel at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), the UK’s largest airshow, follows a successful flypast conducted over London in June using a SAF blend.

Squadron Leader Andy King, Senior Engineering Officer for the Red Arrows team, said “At the heart of the Royal International Air Tattoo is a mission to inspire future generations of aviators – a goal shared by the Red Arrows.”

“This makes this year’s Air Tattoo an ideal occasion to showcase the Red Arrows’ ground-breaking, world-leading move to more sustainable fuels – powering a display that has the same thrilling, entertaining and exciting aerobatics and teamwork that has captivated millions of enthusiasts at the show across the decades.”

Three displays will be flown at RIAT using sustainable fuel, along with a number of formation flypasts over the weekend. The Royal Air Force Typhoon display team will also use a SAF blend, mirroring their first use of the fuel during last years’ display. At that time, Air Vice-Marshal Shaun Harris remarked that “As well as contributing to reduced carbon emissions as part of the Defence Aviation Net Zero Strategy, our ability to use new fuels ensures that the Royal Air Force can continue to operate anywhere we are needed globally.”

In addition to using SAF to power the aircraft, the Red Arrows’ signature red, white, and blue smoke will also be generated using sustainable Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) fuel. This fuel is carried in a pod underneath the teams’ Hawk T1 aircraft, and is injected into the engine exhaust through three small pipes. The instant vaporization of the fuel creates a thick white smoke trail – dye is added to two of the three tanks inside the belly pod to create the red and blue trails. Each aircraft can generate five minutes of white smoke, and one minute each of red and blue.

Making the smoke trails ‘green’ has been an aim for the team since at least 2022, as part of the Royal Air Force’s overall aim to be a net-zero force by 2040. As stated above, this strategy is important both from a climate perspective as well as from a national security one.

Sustainable fuels in other forces

The Royal Air Force is not alone in seeking the expansion in use of sustainable fuels. The U.S. Department of Defense has issued a number of contracts seeking development work in this area, eyeing similar goals to the RAF in reducing reliance on singular fuel sources. It’s additionally noted that SAF could be a safer option, able to be produced at airfields themselves essentially on demand and reducing the need for extremely vulnerable fuel transport trucks.

Lockheed Martin cleared the F-35 Lightning II for synthetic fuels in January of this year, with Norway becoming the first operator of the aircraft to utilize the fuel in their aircraft.

Commercial aviation is also investing in sustainable fuels. Virgin Atlantic completed their first transatlantic flight with SAF in 2023, using a Boeing 787 flying a routine service between London Heathrow Airport and New York John F. Kennedy Airport. The flight took place in cooperation with the UK Government and with support from aircraft and engine manufacturers Boeing and Rolls-Royce.",https://theaviationist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RedArrowsSAF_1-706x397.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 13:22:18.688499

The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits.
Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBB), which significantly rolls back many of the core tax incentives that clean energy projects have relied on since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Under the new law, tax credits for wind and solar projects phase out much sooner. To qualify, these projects must either be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction within the next 12 months. This compressed timeline will likely force developers to accelerate their project schedules or risk losing critical tax credits. In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.

However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, and limited to electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing tax credits, these “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules have now been expanded under the OBBB to cover virtually all tax credits. The expanded FEOC rules deny credits to projects that are owned or controlled by certain foreign entities — or that purchase components from or make payment to these foreign entities. Notably, the list of FEOCs includes all companies owned or controlled by the Chinese government or its citizens.

Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects face a shorter window to qualify for tax credits. Projects that were under construction by the end of 2024 are largely unaffected by the new law. Projects first starting construction in 2025 must generally comply with the FEOC ownership requirements, and projects beginning construction in 2026 or later must navigate a complex set of FEOC sourcing and payment rules, including proving that an increasing share of components are sourced outside of China.

Going forward, a key factor for most clean energy projects will be the date they begin construction, as this will determine both their eligibility for tax credits and the extent to which they must comply with the FEOC rules. Over the past 12 years, the IRS has issued a series of notices that define what it means for a project to be “under construction” along with related rules on transfers and completion deadlines. The OBBB clarifies that this existing guidance continues to apply for purposes of the effective date of the “material assistance” FEOC rules described below.

However, the Trump administration issued an executive order on July 7, 2026, directing the US Treasury department to revisit the begun construction rules with respect to solar and wind facilities within 45 days, including by “restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” These guidelines (and the extent to which they are changed for solar and wind) are now likely to become central to how developers assess the value of their pipelines and plan future investments. Many in the industry will now rely on these IRS rules to guide investment decisions and accelerate project timelines, as construction start dates become a critical factor in securing favorable tax treatment under the new law.

This Client Alert provides a detailed description of the OBBB’s changes to the tax credits across different technologies and the FEOC rules.

Solar and Wind ITC and PTC

Projects that began construction before 2025 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. Projects that start construction in 2025 or later are eligible under existing law for tax credits that are similar to the investment tax credit (ITC) or production tax credit (PTC) and referred to as “technology neutral credits.” Most of the restrictions in the new law related to renewables are aimed at curtailing these technology neutral credits.

Despite the technology neutral focus of existing law, solar and wind are subject to different — and harsher — treatment under the OBBB than other technologies. Projects have to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. Under pre-OBBB law, projects beginning construction in 2025 or 2026 would have until the end of 2029 or the end of 2030, respectively, to be placed in service, or else their developers must demonstrate that work is continuous based on the facts.

Solar and wind projects, as well as other projects eligible for technology neutral tax credits, will also become subject to the FEOC requirements, which are described in further detail below.

Helpfully, the OBBB does not affect eligibility for tax credit adders (e.g., for projects located in an energy community or that meet domestic content requirements), eligibility for accelerated depreciation, the ability to transfer tax credits to third parties for cash, or place restrictions on residential solar leasing. Restrictions on the latter three had been proposed in prior iterations of the bill. The final bill focuses the leasing restriction on solar water heating property or small wind energy property.

Although the domestic content tax credit bonus is retained, the OBBB fixes an apparent glitch from the Inflation Reduction Act that would have increased the qualification threshold to up to 55% over time for PTC projects but left the ITC threshold static at 40%. ITC projects that began construction before June 16, 2025, can still rely on a 40% threshold, but projects seeking to claim a domestic content adder that began construction after that date must meet a domestic content threshold of 45%, with increasing annual thresholds that match the PTC version thereafter.

Storage and Other Technologies Eligible for the ITC and PTC

Non-solar and wind technologies (e.g., storage, hydropower, and geothermal) fare much better under the OBBB. Tax credits for these projects are subject to a phase-down schedule that begins for projects that commence construction after 2033. Projects beginning construction in 2034 and 2035 will still qualify for tax credits but with a 75% and 50% haircut, respectively. These projects must meet the traditional continuity test, which requires placement in service by the end of the fourth year after the end of the year in which construction starts, or else demonstrate that construction was continuous based on the facts.

Fuel cells (including linear generators) were added as a special category of ITC-eligible technology. Fuel cell projects generally involve some level of greenhouse gas emissions, which would make them ineligible for the technology neutral ITC pre-OBBB. They are newly eligible for a 30% ITC without regard to emissions and are also exempt from prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. They cannot qualify for tax credit adders. Eligibility begins for projects that start construction after 2025.

Clean Fuels

The OBBB significantly modifies the section 45Z PTC for clean transportation fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is extended by two years to cover fuel sold through December 31, 2029, but reduces the value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon beginning for fuel produced after 2025. The OBBB also eliminates the excise tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel with respect to any sale or use after September 30, 2025, and prohibits double counting by barring 45Z credits on any fuel produced from fuel that would have qualified for 45Z credits on its own. Fuel feedstock will have to come from the United States, Mexico, or Canada to qualify for a credit.

The new law forecloses the possibility of claiming additional 45Z credits based on “negative emissions.” The credit amount is calculated according to the “emissions factor” of the fuel, with a floor of 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU to qualify. The greater the emissions rate, the smaller the emissions factor and the smaller the tax credit. Conversely, if the emissions rate is negative, prior law appears to allow taxpayers to claim a credit above $1.00 for clean fuel and above $1.75 for sustainable aviation fuel. The OBBB prevents this result.

The OBBB also restores the expired tax credit under section 40A for small agri-biodiesel producers through 2026 and increases the credit amount from 10 cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon. The tax credit will be newly eligible to be sold to third parties for cash.

As described in further detail below, projects intending to claim 45Z credits will become subject to FEOC ownership restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture receives relatively favorable treatment under the OBBB compared to other credits. The credit is available for carbon dioxide that is captured and then permanently sequestered, used in enhanced oil recovery, or put to another commercial use. The credit amount had been higher for a sequestration use case compared to the others on the theory that sequestration is uneconomic without the tax incentive. The OBBB puts all use cases on equal footing so that both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for a credit of up to $85 per metric ton (or more in the case of direct air capture).

Similar to the 45Z tax credit for clean fuels, projects will become subject to the ownership-related FEOC restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit

The OBBB makes numerous changes to the section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which provides a tax credit for the production and sale of certain solar, wind, and battery components, as well as the production and purification of certain critical minerals. Among other changes, the OBBB:

terminates the tax credit for wind components sold after 2027;

creates a new category of eligible critical minerals for “metallurgical coal”;

begins phasing out tax credits for critical mineral production (other than metallurgical coal, which terminates after 2029) after 2030, with termination after 2033;

subjects manufacturers to similar FEOC rules as those that apply to the technology neutral ITC and PTC; and

requires battery modules to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment,” as a condition for tax credit eligibility.

Metallurgical coal is unique compared to the other critical minerals in that it is allowed to be produced outside of the United States. Federal tax credit eligibility in general, even outside of the critical minerals context, usually requires the activity being subsidized to occur in the United States. However, the credit is only worth 2.5% of the cost compared to 10% with respect to other critical minerals. The coal must be suitable for use in the production of steel.

Notably, the OBBB does not fully restrict the sale of integrated components, which had been proposed in the initial Senate bill. The initial Senate bill would have essentially prevented manufacturers of multiple components that are integrated into an end product from claiming credits on each individual component. Instead, the OBBB permits the stacking of credits provided that the components that are integrated together are produced in the same facility, the end product is sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65% of the direct material costs of the underlying components are attributable to US mining, production, or manufacturing.

Foreign Entities of Concern

The OBBB imposes important new restrictions limiting the ability of projects to generate tax credits if certain FEOCs are involved. These restrictions fall into two categories: (1) those relating to ownership or control, and (2) those relating to assistance during construction. To the extent an FEOC restriction contains a beginning of construction concept, the OBBB memorializes long-standing IRS guidance that allows a project owner to begin construction by either incurring 5% of project costs or else beginning physical work of a significant nature.

1. FEOC — Ownership Restrictions

The first FEOC restriction generally prohibits a project owner from claiming technology neutral tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, clean fuel production tax credits, and tax credits for carbon sequestration for any tax year in which the person otherwise generating the tax credit is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign influenced entity.” These restrictions generally apply to tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, though the restrictions relating to foreign-influenced entities do not restrict clean fuel production tax credits until tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Specified foreign entities should be relatively easy to identify. These include entities owned by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia; entities owned by citizens of those countries or otherwise organized or having a principal place of business in one of those countries; certain battery manufacturers; and certain other similar entities.

An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if: a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint board members or officers; a single specified entity owns more than 25% of the entity; one or more specified foreign entities owns an aggregate of 40% of the entity; or at least 15% of the entity’s debt is held by specified foreign entities (in the aggregate).

An entity is also a foreign-influenced entity if during the prior taxable year the entity made payments to a specified foreign entity pursuant to an arrangement that allowed the specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a project (in the case of technology neutral tax credits) or production of any components (in the case of advanced manufacturing tax credits). The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits. Because effective control requires examination of payments made in the prior taxable year, project owners should closely scrutinize any contract that requires a payment, or any payments recently made, which could provide a contractual counterparty with any specific authority over production of components, energy generation, or energy storage.

Contractual rights that allow a counterparty to determine the amount or timing of production, restrict access to data relating to production, determine the purchase of power output, or maintain or otherwise operate a project on an exclusive basis can create effective control. Effective control can also be granted by licensing arrangements that specify or direct material or other components in a project, allow the licensor to direct the operation of the project, limit the taxpayer’s use of the licensed property, provide a right to royalties for more than 10 years, or otherwise require the project owner to hire a project operator for more than two years at the licensor’s direction.

Finally, for projects claiming the technology neutral ITC, the OBBB imposes a recapture of 100% of the tax credit value if payments conveying effective control are made within 10 years of the project being placed in service.

2. FEOC — Material Assistance Rules

The second set of FEOC restrictions prohibits project owners from claiming technology neutral tax credits if construction on the project started after December 31, 2025, and the project receives material assistance from a specified foreign entity. A similar prohibition limits project owners from claiming advanced manufacturing tax credits for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2025, if the owner received material assistance from a specified foreign entity.

An entity receives material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity if the material assistance cost ratio applicable either to the power generation project or the manufacturing project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The applicable threshold percentages are shown in Exhibit A (below), which can be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury in the case of the applicable threshold relating to critical minerals.

The material assistance cost ratio for a power plant or battery is generally the difference between the total direct costs for manufactured products less the direct costs attributable to a specified foreign entity, divided by the total direct costs. This effectively examines the “good” costs over the total costs. The material assistance cost ratio for a manufactured component is the “good” material costs over the total material costs.

The OBBB directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue safe harbor tables applying a methodology similar to that adopted with respect to the calculation of domestic content under Notice 2025-08 for material assistance. Before these tables are issued, taxpayers can rely on Notice 2025-08 along with a supplier certification, though this has an obvious shortcoming in that Notice 2025-08 has tables for a limited subset of power production technologies. Developers of other technologies will have to rely on actual labor and materials costs to run the calculations.

Other Changes

The clean hydrogen PTC terminates for projects that begin construction after 2027. Prior iterations of the bill in both the House and Senate would have terminated the credit if construction did not begin by the end of 2025.

Bonus depreciation — the ability to write off 100% of the cost of certain business property, including renewables projects, as a depreciation deduction — is made permanent for property acquired after January 19, 2025. Bonus depreciation was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and was set to phase out after 2026 for most property. Taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation entirely or alternatively elect into a 40% bonus (or 60% bonus for property with a longer production period).

The PTC for nuclear facilities under 45U will become subject to the FEOC ownership restrictions.

There's just a fortnight to go until this year's Royal International Air Tattoo, and organisers have announced a 'world first' for the iconic Red Arrows.

It's as they'll be displaying Sustainable Aviation Fuel when they take to the skies above RAF Fairford.

More than 170,000 people are expected at RAF Fairford for the aviation showcase which is due to take place on Friday 18th, Saturday 19th and Sunday 20th July.

The Red Arrows’ performances across the weekend will be history-making for any national aerobatic team – using not only SAF for jet propulsion but also a renewable biofuel, known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), to produce its distinctive trademark vapour trails.

Joining the Red Arrows on SAF will be the RAF’s Typhoon display, which also completed its first routine on SAF at last year’s show in another world-first.

Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said: “We are thrilled to have the Red Arrows performing on sustainable fuel at this year’s Royal International Air Tattoo.

“Their nine-ship team are known across the world, so we are delighted to be hosting this landmark display here at RAF Fairford.

“In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”

The Red Arrows will be performing three times on the fuel, as well as featuring in various special formation flypasts across the weekend event.

The display comes after the team first publicly flew on the fuel last month as part of the celebrations for HM King Charles’ official birthday, in the skies above London.

However, the displays at the Royal International Air Tattoo will be the first ever aerobatic performances by the Red Arrows using both SAF and HVO.

Squadron Leader Andy King, the Red Arrows’ Senior Engineering Officer and who led the pioneering fuels project, said: “At the heart of the Royal International Air Tattoo is a mission to inspire future generations of aviators – a goal shared by the Red Arrows.

“This makes this year’s Air Tattoo an ideal occasion to showcase the Red Arrows’ ground-breaking, world-leading move to more sustainable fuels – powering a display that has the same thrilling, entertaining and exciting aerobatics and teamwork that has captivated millions of enthusiasts at the show across the decades.”

The flights have been made possible by Air Space Intelligence, Intel Foundry and Team Lewis, with HVO and fuel being supplied by Power Electrics and AFS Aviation respectively.",https://cdn.apollo.audio/one/media/686e/407a/3404/6f43/8820/69c7/RED-20240412-240-Zadar%20First%20Display%20Practice-158.jpg?quality=80&format=jpg,N,,2025-07-09 08:06:36.907355

In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.
The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.","The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year.

US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production.

EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth.

The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import.

Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years.

In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.

Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.

EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.

The technology enables many sensing points just a few centimeters apart, each working as an individual temperature sensor.","Sensing technology has come a long way since the invention of the humble thermocouple and strain gauge. Many of these ‘classic’ sensors work by monitoring and measuring changes in wire components to calculate environmental conditions and forces such as temperatures and stress. But while this type of sensor continues to be the workhorse of many industries, including the highly demanding aerospace test environment, engineers are looking for more advanced sensors that provide single-point readings and surface-wide, high-speed data across a range of scenarios.

In a test environment, advanced sensors are required to ensure materials and components are fit for purpose, while in operational environments, they are necessary to monitor the performance of systems, including those using novel fuels and autonomous technologies.

Requirements continue to change. For example, the need to burn hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) changes the heat transfer properties of the combustion gases in aeroengines, necessitating redesigns and the validation of components. In addition, engineers and operators want more data. For instance, in terms of temperature sensing, they are interested in stable operating conditions and temperatures across an entire component rather than at one or two points, a limitation of thermocouples.

In response, innovative companies are developing new sensing solutions using the latest technology and materials to meet these monitoring needs.

PAINTING A PICTURE

A leading example of new sensor technology is Sensor Coating Systems’ (SCS) thermal history coatings (THC) and paint (THP), which remembers the highest temperature. “After operation, we shine a light on it and the luminescence afterglow, after calibration, tells us what the temperature was at every single point across the component. This provides entire temperature maps of components – something thermocouples can’t do,” explains Dr Jörg Feist, managing director of SCS and co-inventor of the technology.

“This is a small project with the potential to make a big impact” DAVID DEBNEY, HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY FOR WHOLE AIRCRAFT, ATI

The solution can be used on anything from combustion chambers to turbine blades and vanes, because it is manufactured similarly to traditional thermal barrier coatings. THC can endure long running intervals of tens or hundreds of hours at very high temperatures, while the paint variant, THP has already been proven to withstand more than 7,000 hours at temperatures below 550°C (1000°F).

The thermal mapping technology can also measure temperatures of up to and beyond 1,600°C (2,900°F) with an accuracy of ± 25°C (77°F). This was one of the main reasons it was awarded the UK Aerospace Technology Institute’s (ATI’s) “Making the Difference Award”.

“The project demonstrated that the thermal mapping technology can be used under multi-cycle test conditions where engine load conditions are changing,” says David Debney, head of technology for whole aircraft at the ATI, and chair of the award’s judging panel.

“Existing thermal paints and coatings today usually contain toxic materials. It’s therefore important to note that the solution developed in this project is also fully REACH compliant. This is a small project with the potential to make a big impact.”

UNDER PRESSURE

When it comes to pressure measurement, current strain gauge, piezoresistive and capacitive sensors can be limited by issues including thermal drift and degradation at high temperatures, vibration sensitivity causing inaccurate readings and limited dynamic range missing fast pressure changes.

Test and measurement technology provider HBK has developed new piezoelectric sensors which aim to overcome these challenges. “Our GaPO₄-based sensors solve these issues by operating beyond 700°C (1,300°F), where quartz and ceramics fail and by offering high-frequency response for precise combustion instability and shock wave measurement,” says Dr Christian Roethel, head of sales and product management at Piezocryst by HBK.

These sensors are suitable for environments such as jet engine and gas turbine combustion testing, where they can detect pressure pulsations and instability, and rocket engine development. They can measure dynamic pressure in extreme environments such as combustion chambers and fuel lines.

They can also support hypersonic and supersonic flow research, capturing transient pressure changes in wind tunnels, and structural health monitoring by identifying pressure-induced stress variations.

“As propulsion systems evolve toward cleaner combustion and higher efficiency, our sensors ensure safer, more precise and sustainable aerospace developments by optimizing engine performance, safety and emissions reduction through precise combustion analysis,” says Roethel.

The company continues to look for ways to advance its sensors. This includes by increasing the operating temperature limits. Hydrogen-based combustion happens at higher temperatures, increasing operating demands. Meanwhile research into miniaturization and advanced packaging is enabling the sensor’s use in compact, high-power-density turbines.

LASER VISION FOR AIR FLOW

Aerospace engineers at the University of Cincinnati (UC) in the USA have developed a laser-based system to visualize and measure airflow in unprecedented detail. Building on particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques, the system tracks microscopic particles seeded in the air using high-speed cameras and laser pulses, enabling researchers to calculate velocity by observing particle movement between frames, explains Daniel Cuppoletti, assistant professor of aerospace engineering at UC.

Unlike traditional methods such as pitot probes or hot-wire anemometry, which only provide single-point data, the laser-based technique offers high spatial and temporal resolution, producing full-field, image-based measurements at tens of thousands of frames per second. This enables researchers to capture complex, fast-changing aerodynamic phenomena like shock waves, vortices and noise-generating structures in supersonic and hypersonic flows.

“The timescales of these flows are incredibly short. This technique, operating at 50 to 100KHz, lets us resolve those very fast, transient phenomena,” Cuppoletti explains.

“Our sensors ensure safer, more precise and sustainable aerospace developments” DR CHRISTIAN ROETHEL, HEAD OF SALES AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT, PIEZOCRYST BY HBK

While the laser solution is being used in R&D environments, it is not yet a plug-and-play solution. Calibration and setup are complex processes, especially for high-fidelity measurement. However, the technique is playing a crucial role in validating computational models and refining aircraft components. Its ability to visualize coherent structures supports research into aeroacoustics, a vital aspect of electric aircraft and advanced air mobility solutions being developed to enter service over the next decade.

FROM GROUND TO AIR

It’s not just sensors for test environments that are being advanced – aerospace is also seeing exciting developments in sensor technology that is used in operational settings.

Late last year BAE Systems was awarded a US$12 million contract by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a microelectronic sensor capable of high-bandwidth, high dynamic-range sensing at extreme temperatures, such as on hypersonic aircraft and missiles.

Current sensors are limited in that they can’t operate over 225°C (4,400°F) due to their materials, circuitry and/or packaging. BAE Systems is therefore designing a new pressure sensor module made of an integrated transducer and signal-conditioning microelectronics, capable of operating at 800°C (1,500°F).

“Applications such as jet engine prognostics and space exploration could benefit from the collection of real-time data using high temperature pressure sensors and circuitry through the High Operational Temperature Sensors program,” says Amrita Masurkar, technology development manager at BAE Systems’ FAST Labs R&D organization.

TAMING TURBULENCE

Elsewhere, researchers at the German Aerospace Centre’s (DLR) Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology are working on the optimal load-adaptive aircraft (oLAF) project. This aims to develop an intelligent load control system able to proactively respond to wind gusts and maneuvers by quickly adjusting control surfaces and flaps. This will enable the aircraft to better absorb turbulence and reduce material stress, making the plane more efficient and extending service life.

“Our accelerometers open the door to scalable deployment in precision applications” DAVID BLUMSTEIN, GENERAL MANAGER MOTION, SILICON MICROGRAVITY

The project uses laser systems and LiDAR to measure wind patterns and detect ongoing gusts earlier, enabling the aircraft to react even more precisely and proactively to external influences, explains the project’s manager Lars Reimer. The research has already shown that this solution can reduce fuel consumption by over seven percent, significantly decreasing CO emissions.

SMARTER AIRCRAFT

Another leading example of sensor innovation comes from Saab, which is using Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor technology in its overheat detection system (OHDS) for commercial aircraft. The technology enables many sensing points just a few centimeters apart, each working as an individual temperature sensor.

The key difference with the OHDS is that it is being installed into new aircraft rather than used during the development and testing of materials and systems. Sensing fibres distributed across the aircraft provide real-time monitoring of bleed air piping to detect hot air leakage, providing precise measurements that can be analyzed for trends and setting smart alarms.

Another innovative company in this space is Silicon Microgravity, which is making progress in the world of inertial sensing. Engineers here have developed a resonant micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer that combines the performance of quartz with the scalability and efficiency of silicon.

While the sensor’s core concept isn’t new, Silicon Microgravity’s proprietary IP enables exceptional bias stability (<0.15 μg at 25g, 0.5 μg at 100g) and low temperature sensitivity, all while benefiting from the batch-fabrication advantages of silicon.

“The result is a silicon MEMS sensor that offers near-quartz performance at a fraction of the cost, size and power demand,” says David Blumstein, general manager, motion at Silicon Microgravity.

This breakthrough addresses a long-standing trade-off in sensor design, the choice between high accuracy or affordability.

“Our accelerometers close that gap, opening the door to scalable deployment in precision applications from GPS-denied aerospace navigation to missile guidance, advanced wearables and eventually mass-market autonomous systems,” Blumstein says.

“Our goal is to replace shoebox-sized Inertial Measurement Units that cost hundreds of thousands with something that costs a couple thousand and fits in a matchbox.”

With MEMS gyroscopes and custom ASICs also on its roadmap, Silicon Microgravity clearly aims to redefine what is possible in navigation, guidance and control.

SENSORS SHAPING THE SKY

As can be judged from these few examples, sensors are evolving from test instruments to design enablers and safety guardians, helping the aerospace industry to advance and push boundaries even further.

Sensor data is no longer just for reports. It is real-time, high-resolution and feeding live systems, which in turn is enabling aircraft to respond more quickly and efficiently, providing a myriad of benefits from passenger safety and comfort through to improving sustainability, efficiency, and even capabilities.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to sensor innovation, but it’s an exciting, fast-moving area that will continue to transform aerospace design, operations and performance in the years ahead.",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sensors-lead-pic.jpg.webp,N,,2025-07-09 07:11:16.368901

Considering the continuous growth of air traffic and the limited potential of other alternative fuels, switching to SAF is unavoidable for decarbonizing aviation.

In 2024, aviation accounted for approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2 emissions (~2.5% of global CO2 emissions). However, due to continuous air traffic growth, this sector could become a much larger contributor if transformative measures are not adopted.

The aviation sector is facing immense challenges to meet its commitment to achieve net-zero by 2050:

• Technology (e.g. new engine technologies) and operational improvements (e.g. green taxiing) will reduce CO2 emissions, but the identified levers have potential to reduce CO2 emissions by only ~15%. This reduction will be completely nullified by air traffic growth, that is expected to double by 2050

• Switching to low-carbon fuels is thus a mandatory step to decarbonize aviation and meet net-zero targets by 2050. IATA targets ~65% of CO2 emissions reduction due to the switch to low-carbon fuels.

• The remaining ~20% of CO2 emissions from the aviation sector will have to be offset (through reforestation projects for instance)

‍

‍

‍

In terms of low-carbon fuel options, electricity is to date limited to small/regional aircraft due to battery weight.

Hydrogen has often been cited as a future alternative for decarbonizing aviation. However, its use as a direct fuel is constrained by technological (storage), infrastructure, and energy density limitations. Thus, current projects focus on small/regional aircraft as well.

- In 2022, Airbus launched a differentiated project (ZEROe) targeting an aircraft with more than 100 passengers and a range up to 3700km by 2035

- But Airbus recently scaled back its hydrogen-powered aircraft ambitions

Thus, among available options, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) stands out as the most viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation.

‍

2. SAF consumption is emerging with airline commitments and regulations

Airlines are already incorporating SAF in their fuel mix and regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation (which came into force since January 2025) will secure a growing demand for SAF.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is jet fuel produced from biomass or synthesized from renewable hydrogen (e-fuels) and captured CO2.

Its primary advantage is compatibility with existing engines and infrastructure, allowing for a drop-in replacement of fossil kerosene.

Also, the technology has been proven in commercial flights: Apart from a few flight tests conducted with 100% of SAF, many Airlines have started to incorporate a growing share of SAF (even if it is still very low) in their fuel mix.

For instance, Air France-KLM and IAG have already signed partnerships with SAF producers to secure SAF supply until 2030 and target 10% of SAF in their fuel mix by 2030 (which is greater than the 6% obligation from ReFuelEU Aviation):

- Air France-KLM reported 1.25% of SAF in their fuel mix in 2024 and signed several long-term offtake contracts with SAF producers (e.g. Engie, EDF, Elyse Energy, TotalEnergies, OMV, Raven, SAF+). Notably, the agreement with TotalEnergies represents 1.5Mt of SAF between 2025 and 2035.

- IAG reported 1.9% of SAF in their fuel mix in 2024. They signed long-term offtake contracts with SAF producers like BP, Neste, Repsol, LanzaJet, Gevo and have already reported more than $3.5 billion investment in future offtake.

‍

Exhibit 3: SAF consumption of AirFrance-KLM and IA

‍

In order to boost the development of SAF, several countries have defined SAF mandates imposing progressive blending mandates on fuel suppliers and airlines:

- Europe: Since January 2025, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation has come into force, imposing 2% of SAF in 2025, 6% in 2030 and 70% in 2050.

- UK: 2% of SAF in 2025, 10% of 2030 and for now 22% in 2040.

- Singapore has set an obligation of 1% of SAF in 2026 and is in the process of setting SAF mandates for 2030 (which are expected to be between 3% and 5%).

- Japan established a national objective of achieving 10% of SAF in 2030.

- USA has been very ambitious regarding SAF, with a national target of achieving 100% by 2050. The USA has also set strong financial mechanisms to support SAF production, especially with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to target a SAF production capacity of 9Mt/y in 2030 and 100Mt/y in 2050. The recent election of Donald Trump has, of course, put this trajectory at risk, with several measures from his administration aimed at freezing climate-related funding, including provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

‍

Exhibit 4: Overview of main SAF mandates and national objectives in the world

‍

SAF mandates are essential to ensure a secured demand trajectory and stimulate investment. For instance, in France, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative will establish a predictable SAF demand, growing from approximately 0.2 Mt in 2025 to around 11 Mt by 2050.

‍

3. First challenge to scale-up SAF production capacities is to reduce production costs, to have a viable economic equation

Future SAF technologies fall into two broad categories:

 Biomass-based pathways:

- HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids): the most mature technology, which consists of refining Used Cooking Oil (UCO). The refining process has the advantage of requiring limited investment to convert current refineries

- Alcohol-to-jet: while technologically viable, regulatory constraints on agricultural feedstocks mean local production is limited in Europe. Europe is thus expected to import SAF from Brazil for instance

- Gasification (e.g. process patented from Haffner Energy): this pathway can use a variety of biomass sources and is feedstock-agnostic. However, it generates CO2 as a by-product, which must be captured or offset.

 E-fuels using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: these rely on low-carbon hydrogen and CO2. It requires vast amounts of renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and infrastructure to capture CO2 and infrastructures to transport both hydrogen and CO2.

Technology maturity and feedstock availability represent strong barriers to SAF production today. The first barrier is the production cost: even HEFA, which is the most mature technology, is twice as expensive (~1.2 $/kg) as the current jet fuel price (~0.7 $/kg in average between 2019 and 2024). The ratio can even be greater than 4 for the Power-to-liquid process (depending on electricity price).

‍

Exhibit 6: SAF production processes and costs

4. 2nd challenge is the availability of domestic feedstock, to avoid reliance on imports. To date, France mainly produces SAF from UCO imported from Asia

HEFA is currently the most used process in France (and in the world), but it uses Used Cooking Oil (UCO), mostly imported (Europe imports ~80% of the UCO used) from China (~50% of total UCO imports).

Due to the lowest cost and higher level of maturity, almost all SAF produced in the world is with HEFA process. HEFA seems to be an attractive solution, but the potential is strongly limited due to the feedstock: Used Cooking Oil (UCO).

Indeed, UCO production and collection are very limited. In France, ~90kt is used per year. Even if it were to be used to produce SAF (it is also used to produce biofuels for road transportation), the volume would be negligible compared to the national demand for SAF: 0.2Mt in 2025 and 11Mt in 2050.

Thus, if the other technologies (Alcohol-to-jet, Gasification, Power-to-liquid) are not developed at an economic cost, France will have to continue to rely strongly on imports of UCO from Asia to produce SAF (which obviously limits the effect on the decarbonization of aviation).

‍

Exhibit 7: maturity of SAF production processes and feedstock availability

5. The groundwork to catalyze SAF production investment is in place, but the coming five years will be crucial to turn early initiatives into operational projects

To date, ~15 projects of SAF production based on these other technologies are reported in France. They represent a total SAF production capacity of ~1Mt per year by 2030 (which is greater than the need of 0.6 Mt per year to comply with ReFuelEU Aviation).

‍

Exhibit 8: list of announced projects of SAF production in France

But these projects will require massive financial investments: typical SAF production projects require more than €1 billion investment.

In total, France will need to invest around €28 billion by 2050 to build the 11 Mt of SAF production capacity required under ReFuelEU Aviation.

The groundwork to catalyse SAF production investment is in place:

 The international aviation industry has recognized the imperative to decarbonize and committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050

 SAF stands out as the most viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation

 Many countries have defined SAF mandates, which secures a predictable and growing SAF demand

Many airlines are starting to contract long-term offtake agreements with SAF suppliers (see examples from Air-France KLM and IAG on Exhibit 10), in order to secure SAF volumes up to 2030-2035, which is a very positive signal.

However, investment from infrastructure funds remains limited to date, with Hy24 and Mirova among the first in France: in 2024, they announced a €120m investment to support Elyse Energy’s SAF production projects in France (and Spain).

The next five years will be critical for the successful implementation of the ~15 SAF projects planned in France. Key priorities include:

 maturing the technology

 reducing production costs and demonstrating a viable business model

 developing a local feedstock supply chain. This will allow the shift towards SAF to become a national strategic advantage, rather than relying on used oil import from Asia

This transition to SAF also creates an opportunity for new entrants to challenge historical players (ex: TotalEnergies, BP, ExxonMobil):

 Companies from the hydrogen sector entering the field, such as Elyse Energy, H2V, Lhyfe, and Hy2gen,

 Technology providers like Haffner Energy,

 Major energy players like Engie seizing this opportunity to enter the emerging green fuels market.

The initiative, led by startup Arbor, aims to produce reliable power while capturing and storing carbon dioxide at competitive costs.

Arbor, founded by a former SpaceX engineer, is developing a facility near Louisiana’s Gulf Coast expected to be operational by 2028.

The project employs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology, which converts forest thinnings into clean energy and sequesters the resultant CO₂ underground.

The Frontier coalition will acquire 116,000 carbon removal credits from the project, signalling growing confidence in BECCS solutions.

Microsoft, another active buyer in this sector, has already contracted nearly 10 million BECCS credits from various international projects this year.

Arbor’s approach introduces several advancements: biomass is gasified into a syngas mixture and combusted in pure oxygen, producing a high-purity CO₂ stream in a supercritical liquid state.

This method improves energy conversion efficiency by over 30% compared to conventional BECCS and reduces carbon capture costs due to cleaner exhaust gases.

While current costs exceed $350 per tonne of CO₂ removed, the coalition projects these could fall below $100 per tonne as the technology scales.

Arbor’s integrated capture and power generation design allows system scaling that greatly increases output without proportional cost rises.

Sustainability remains a core concern, as biomass sourcing has previously drawn criticism for impacting natural forests. Arbor’s project addresses this by using forest thinnings from commercial plantations - material typically left unused or burned - minimising ecological impact. The feedstock supply is rigorously monitored via third-party verification to prevent substitution with unsustainable sources, according to the organisation.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bigstock-Vector-Abstract-Futuristic-Gea-90277205-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 05:07:07.395084

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.","President Trump signed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (the “OBBB”) into law on July 4, 2025. Congress passed the legislation using the budget reconciliation process to avoid the 60-vote Senate filibuster. In addition to making many of the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, the bill makes significant changes to many of the clean energy credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Projects that began construction before 2025 and are planning on claiming production tax credits (“PTCs”) or investment tax credits (“ITCs”) under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. However, the OBBB is a mixed bag when it comes to the other energy tax credits that were introduced or extended by the IRA. The OBBB makes substantial cuts to the tech-neutral tax credits for solar and wind and eliminates certain other energy tax credits (e.g., those for hydrogen, EVs and homeowners), but other technologies and activities (e.g., geothermal, carbon capture, nuclear, clean fuel production) experienced fewer claw backs of the benefits provided by the IRA. The OBBB also adds foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions to the surviving energy tax credits. Finally, the OBBB expands the definition of “qualifying income” (“QI”) for master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) under section 7704(d)(1)(E).

While a prior version of the OBBB released by the Senate contained an excise tax on certain wind and solar facilities deemed to have received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (“PFE”), the tax was removed shortly before its passage by the Senate and is not included in the OBBB.

On July 7, 2025, President Trump also issued an Executive Order (Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources) (the “EO”) directing the Secretary of the Treasury to, within 45 days of enactment of the OBBB, “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” The EO specifically directs Treasury to issue new and revised guidance on “beginning of construction” (BOC), and notes that broad safe harbors should not apply “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” In the same 45-day window, Treasury is also directed to implement the FEOC restrictions in the OBBB.

Below is a summary of the key changes for the clean energy industry as a result of the enactment of the OBBB.

I. TAX CREDIT AND DEDUCTION MODIFICATIONS

1. Sections 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credits when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

PIS DEADLINE: Adds a placed in service (PIS) deadline for solar and wind facilities of December 31, 2027.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (i.e., more than 12 months after the enactment of OBBB).

Akin Note: Allowing construction to begin for up to one year after enactment was a late change to OBBB. However, taxpayers’ ability to take advantage of this window may be limited as a result of guidance to be issued by Treasury implementing the EO.]

Statute makes clear that batteries are not impacted by this change. Other facilities that qualify for credits under §§ 45Y and 48E (besides solar and wind facilities) are also not impacted.

[Akin Note: The language making clear that batteries are not impacted by this change is arguably not necessary in light of the Treasury position in regulations that energy storage technologies cannot be part of qualified facilities.]

LEASING DISALLOWANCE: Disallows credits for solar electric heating and small wind residential property if the taxpayer rents or leases the property.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after enactment of the OBBB).

[Akin Note: In earlier versions of OBBB, this rule also applied to residential photovoltaic solar systems. The final enacted version of OBBB does not disallow ITCs or PTCs for residential photovoltaic solar systems.]

PHASEOUT TIMELINE: Sets both §§ 45Y and 48E to begin phasing out in 2032.

Except for solar and wind facilities that have a special PIS deadline (see above), facilities that qualify for either §§ 45Y or 48E and:

BOC before 2034 can access the full credit;

BOC in 2034 can access 75% of the credit;

BOC 2035 can access 50% of the credit; and

BOC after 2035 cannot access either credit.

TAX OWNERSHIP OF GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS: For purposes of determining tax ownership geothermal heat pumps for depreciation and tax credit purposes, the fact that such property is not readily usable by anyone other than the lessee or offtaker is disregarded.

[Akin Note: This point removes a key obstacle to allowing geothermal heat pumps to be subject to “third party ownership” structures which more readily allows for tax equity financing.]

FUEL CELL FACILITIES (§ 48E (ITC) only): Removes requirement that the anticipated greenhouse gas emission rate not be greater than zero for fuel cell facilities.

Changes apply to facilities the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025.

Sets a 30% ITC rate without the ability to increase with adders and apparently without needing to satisfy Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship requirements.

NUCLEAR ENERGY COMMUNITY (§ 45Y (PTC) only): Creates an energy community adder based on local employment in nuclear facilities, nuclear R&D, and nuclear component manufacturing.

DOMESTIC CONTENT (§ 48E (ITC) only): Facilities that begin construction on and after June 16, 2025, are subject to the same domestic content thresholds for the ITC as the PTC.

Domestic content thresholds are 45% for BOC in 2025, 50% for BOC in 2026 and 55% for BOC in 2027+ (separate rates still apply for off-shore wind).

[Akin Note: This change corrects what has long been viewed as a typo or glitch in the statutory framework.]

Facilities that began construction before June 16, 2024, can utilize a 40% threshold.

2. Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT EXTENSION: Extends the deadline to sell eligible fuel from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2029.

EMISSIONS RATES: Disallows emissions rates from being negative, excludes indirect land use changes from the lifecycle analysis, and requires Treasury to provide emissions rates for each specific animal manure feedstock.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

[Akin Note: Many clean fuels producers were hoping to be able to generate multiples of the statutory credit rate as a result of their fuel having negative emissions rates. This change eliminates this possibility, which had previously been implied by other statutory language that contemplated negative emissions rates.]

FEEDSTOCK SOURCING: Requires feedstock to be produced or grown exclusively in the United Stated, Mexico or Canada.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

Disallows any feedstock sources that already generated a 45Z credit but includes a directive to Treasury to issue regulations or guidance to implement this anti-double counting rule.

RELATED PARTY SALES: Directs Treasury to expand the rule allowing sales between related parties prior to a sale to an unrelated party.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL: Eliminates the increased credit rate of $1.75/gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but the standard $1.00/gallon rate remains available for SAF.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.

Applies to fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB), and to fuel sold or used before such date if claims for the § 6426(k) excise tax credit have not been paid or allowed as of such date.

3. Section 45Q (Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT RATES: Equalizes the credit rate for all potential disposal pathways (g., EOR, secure geologic storage and utilization) to $17/MT (indexed for inflation after 2026).

Rate is $36/MT for direct air capture.

Applies to facilities PIS after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after the date of the enactment of OBBB).

4. Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

SALE OF INTEGRATED COMPONENTS: No credit for the sale of integrated components unless certain requirements are satisfied.

Applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

To the extent an eligible component (called a “primary component”) is incorporated into another eligible component (called a “secondary component”) prior to sale to an unrelated person, a 45X credit is allowed with respect to the primary component only if:

The secondary component is produced in the same manufacturing facility as the primary component; and

At least 65% of the total direct material costs of the secondary component are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States.

PHASEOUT FOR WIND ENERGY COMPONENTS: Wind energy components, sold after December 31, 2027, no longer generate a 45X credit.

PHASEOUT FOR CRITICAL MINERALS: Adds a phaseout for applicable critical minerals produced after 2030 based on timing of production.

ADDITION OF METALLURGICAL COAL: Metallurgical coal added as an applicable critical mineral.

Defined as “metallurgical coal which is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the notice published by the Department of Energy entitled ‘Critical Material list; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking’ (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))), regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.”

Generates credit at a special rate of 2.5% of costs (as opposed to 10% for other critical minerals).

Applies only to metallurgical coal produced before December 31, 2029.

REVISED DEFINITION OF BATTERY MODULE: Definition of “battery module” is updated to include a requirement for the module to include “all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.”

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., taxable years beginning after the enactment of OBBB).

5. Section 45U (Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT TERMINATION: Terminates credit for electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2032.

6. Terminated Credits and Deductions

SECTION 45V (CLEAN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT): The deadline for beginning construction under §45V is moved up to December 31, 2027 (instead of December 31, 2032).

EV RELATED CREDITS: Credits for EVs and EV charging property are eliminated.

The deadlines for acquiring an eligible vehicle under §§ 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit), 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), and 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit) are moved up to September 30, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

The deadline for PIS under § 30C (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property) is moved up to June 30, 2026 (instead of December 31, 2032).

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.

The PIS deadline for residential clean energy property under § 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit) of December 31, 2034, is replaced with a deadline for incurring expenditures of December 31, 2025.

The deadline for PIS for energy efficiency improvements, residential energy property expenditures and home energy audits under § 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) is December 31, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

REPEAL OF 5-YEAR MACRS: Removes the ability to utilize 5-year MACRS schedules under § 168 for “energy property” described in § 48.

Property eligible for a credit under §§ 45Y and 48E would remain eligible for 5-year MACRS.

ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS DEDUCTION: Deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings is eliminated by adding a new BOC deadline of June 30, 2026.

Which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity (or an entity related to such specified foreign entity) to exercise effective control over:

Any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), or

With respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (i) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (ii) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

The term “taxpayer” for purposes of the FIE rules includes any person related to the taxpayer.

ATTRIBUTION RULE: For purposes of the definition of a PFE (and the subsidiary definitions), ownership is determined by taking into account the attribution rules under § 318(a)(2) for purposes of determining ownership of stock in a corporation and with similar principles being applied for non-corporate entities.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL:

“Effective Control” means one or more agreements or arrangements similar to those described in the following bullets (relating to determination prior to the issuance of guidance and licensing arrangements) which provide one or more contractual counterparties of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held which are described in the definition of “foreign-influenced entity”.

During any period prior to the date that guidance has been issued by Treasury, the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to:

Determine the quantity determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;

Determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer or the storage of electrical energy in energy storage technology of the taxpayer;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer that produces eligible components;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to specify or otherwise direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized in a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct the operation of any qualified facility, any energy storage technology, or any production unit that produces an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to limit the taxpayer’s utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar agreement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions thereof);

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions thereof);

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or a specified foreign entity; or

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

BEGINNING OF CONSTRUCTION (BOC):

Generally, determined pursuant to rules similar to rules under IRS Notice 2013-29 and IRS Notice 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.

Treasury is directed to prescribed regulations and guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent circumvention of the subparagraph relating to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, including the prevention of any evasion with respect to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio “where the fact demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.”

2. Credit Disallowance

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITIES AND FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITIES: Prevents “Specified Foreign Entities” and “Foreign-Influenced Entities” from claiming the credit.

SFE restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

Credits Impacted: §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Z, 45Q, 45X, and 45U.

FIE restriction applies to:

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB) for §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Q, and 45X.

“Effective Control” is carved out from the FIE restriction for §§ 45Y, 48E and 45X.

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 for §§ 45Z and 45U.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL: Prevents taxpayers subject to “effective control” by a “specified foreign entity” for a given taxable year from claiming credits if the effective control determination was made with respect to a qualified facility, an energy storage technology, or an eligible component (as applicable).

Applies to §§ 45Y, 48E, and 45X for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Credits under §§ 45X ,45Y and 48E are disallowed if the taxpayer receives material assistance from a PFE.

Applies to facilities that BOC after December 31, 2025, for §§ 45Y and 48E.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, for § 45X.

Determination of whether the taxpay received “material assistance” is discussed below in Section II.3.

APPLICABLE PAYMENTS: For any ITC allowed in a taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 (i.e., after two years following the enactment of OBBB), recapture of 100% of any allowed ITC is required if an “applicable payment” (defined by cross-reference to payments that trigger “effective control”) is made to a “Prohibited Foreign Entity” within 10-years of placement in service of the facility.

3. Material Assistance

CALCULATION OF RATIO: Requires calculation of a percentage, the numerator of which is direct costs not attributable to PFEs and the denominator of which is all direct costs.

For Qualifying Facilities and Energy Storage Technologies under §§ 45Y and 48E, the calculation focuses on Manufactured Products (including components) and can be expressed as:

For eligible components under § 45X, the calculation focuses on direct material costs related to the production of eligible components and can be expressed as:

QUALIFIED FACILITIES AND ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY (§45Y/§48E): Requires an increasing amount of a facility’s manufactured products NOT to be manufactured by PFEs based on the beginning of construction date of the qualified facility or energy storage technology. This calculation is called the “Material Assistance Cost Ratio”.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

Material Assistance Cost Ratio calculations include qualified interconnection property (as defined in §48E(b)(4)).

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Qualified Facilities:

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Energy Storage Technology:

ELIGIBLE COMPONENTS (§45X): Requires an increasing amount of an eligible component’s direct material costs NOT to be mined, produced, or manufactured by PFEs based on the year the eligible component is sold.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.i after the enactment of OBBB).

Solar Energy Components:

Wind Energy Components:

Battery Components:

Critical Minerals*:

*Subject to increase by Treasury no later than December 31, 2027, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs and national security concerns

GUIDANCE ON CALCULATION: Prior to promulgation of new guidance from Treasury (required by December 31, 2026), for purposes of calculating the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, the statute permits reliance on:

IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to certain safe harbors for domestic content adder calculations), but scope of such reliance is not yet clear; and

[Akin Note: This guidance only applies to §§ 45Y and 48E projects, and thus there is no current guidance for calculation of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio in the context of § 45X credits. Further, it is also not clear the extent to which IRS Notice 2025-08 may be relied upon for these purposes. For example, it is not clear whether the universe of manufactured products that must be tested limited to the manufactured products and components thereof identified in IRS Notice 2025-08 or whether “production costs” can be included if all of the MPCs for an APCs are not manufactured by a PFE.]

Supplier certifications are required to be made in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. § 1.45X-4(c)(4)(i) and contain:

the supplier’s EIN or similar identification number issued by a foreign government;

be signed under penalties of perjury;

be retained by the supplier and the taxpayer for a period of not less than six years and provided to the IRS upon request; and

be made from the supplier from which the taxpayer purchased any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents stating:

such property was not produced or manufactured by a PFE and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a PFE;

for purposes of § 45X, the total direct material costs for each component, constituent element, or subcomponent that were not produced or manufactured by a PFE; or

for purposes of §§ 45Y or 48E, the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products that were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

EXCLUSION FOR CERTAIN MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS:

For purposes of §§ 45Y and 48E, calculations exclude the cost of any manufactured product if (i) acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, (ii) PIS in a facility that BOC before August 1, 2025, and (iii) PIS before January 1, 2030 (or before January 1, 2028 in the case of wind and solar facilities).

For purposes of § 45X, calculations exclude the cost of any eligible component or constituent element, material or subcomponent if the constituent element, material, or subcomponent is used in a product sold before January 1, 2027.

Treasury is instructed to issued regulations or guidance as may be necessary to prevent abuse of this exception through “stockpiling”.

4. Audit and Penalty Provisions

EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Extends the statute of limitations from three to six years for assessing deficiencies related to the material assistance rules.

REDUCED PENALTY THRESHOLD: Reduces the threshold from 10% to 1% for the threshold to assess penalties related to a substantial understatement of income tax if the cause is an overstatement of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio with respect to the determination of credits under §§ 45Y, 48E or 45X.

NEW SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION PENALTY: Creates a new penalty based on inaccurate supplier certifications that result in a disallowance of credit.

Penalty applies where:

the certifying person knew or reasonably should have known that (A) the certification was inaccurate and (B) the certification would be used in connection with a credit determination; and

the disallowance exceeds the lesser of (x) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year to be shown on the return and (y) $100,000.

Penalty is the greater of (x) 10% of the underpayment and (y) $5,000.

An exception applies to the extent a person can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the IRS that the inaccuracy was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.

Penalty is applicable to certifications made after December 31, 2025.

5. Transferability

EXCLUSION FOR SFEs: An SFE is not eligible to be a transferee taxpayer under § 6418.

Applicable to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

(Back to Top)

III. QI EXPANSION FOR MLPs

1. Qualifying Income

90% REQUIREMENT: Treatment of an MLP as a partnership for federal income tax purposes requires that at least 90% percent the MLP’s gross income for every taxable year consists of “qualifying income.”

2. Historical Application

LIMITED SCOPE OF QI: Previously, QI under § 7704(d)(1)(E) was limited to income and gains from the exploration, development, mining, production, processing, refining, transportation, or marketing of minerals or natural resources such as oil, gas, and certain fuels.

3. Expansion of QI

NEW CATEGORIES OF QI:

Adds to QI income derived from:

transportation or storage of liquified hydrogen or compressed hydrogen;

carbon capture facilities and electricity production from qualifying facilities with sufficient carbon capture;

electricity production from advanced nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal facilities; and

One Saturday morning in May 2025 in the city of Melaka, volunteers in green T-shirts rushed over as Ms Adibah Rahim and her husband drove into the central square, eager to unpack, weigh and register her consignment of used cooking oil (UCO) – the “liquid gold” in European and Asian plans to ramp up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ms Rahim, a housewife, told The Straits Times it was her first time selling used oil, which she had collected over five to six months. She left the collection point RM90 (S$27) richer: At RM3 per liter of oil, it is a welcome boost to her family’s household budget.

“We usually collect UCO from around 200 members of the public,” said Mr Michael Andrew, sales manager for Evergreen Oil & Feed, the company running the Melaka collection with the local council. Evergreen, which runs similar collection drives elsewhere in Malaysia, supplies leading European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell and Finland’s Neste, the operator of SAF refineries in Europe and Singapore.

READ: Southeast Asia seen to boost green aviation fuel industry

The aviation industry and many governments, including Singapore’s, are pinning their hopes on SAF as a way to cut the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are set to increase as demand for flying grows.

And fuel suppliers around the world are scrambling for raw materials to meet new legal SAF blending quotas in Europe and growing demand elsewhere.

When it is made from waste such as UCO, rather than agricultural commodities such as soya or palm oil, SAF purportedly has up to 80 per cent less planet-heating emissions than kerosene jet fuel. And repurposing waste cooking oil avoids using land that would otherwise be used for food crops, or fuelling forest destruction.

But behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks – raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

READ: PH wants partnership with Norway on sustainable aviation fuel

The concern is that barely used and virgin palm oil – the latter is not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO that traders supply to fuel companies, experts and industry operators said.

The investigation focused on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, the EU’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers – oil and gas giant Repsol.

The investigation was funded by Journalismfund Europe.

Fried in Spain?

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Repsol chief executive Josu Jon Imaz held up his company’s new €250 million (S$369 million) plant for renewable fuels, including SAF, near the historic Spanish port town of Cartagena as an example of how Europe can pursue a fair green transition.

Repsol, which aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, started large-scale production of biodiesel and jet fuel – with its SAF mainly made from UCO – at the plant early in 2024.

Contrasting this with electric vehicles, many of them imported from China, Dr Imaz said the raw material for Repsol’s renewable fuels “comes from the Spanish farms and from the Spanish rural economy”.

In a promotional video for those fuels, Spanish celebrity chef Susi Diaz is seen dispensing advice to young cooks in the kitchen of her La Finca restaurant. Olive oil is then poured out of a pan into steel jugs as a voiceover explains how the waste cooking residue will be sent to the Repsol biofuel refinery.

The company is also promoting the recycling of UCO from Spanish households – of which it says only 5 per cent is currently collected – at its fuel stations across the country.

Spain’s restaurants and homes, however, are not the main source of Repsol’s UCO.

In 2024, more than 126,000 tonnes of UCO from Asia – enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools – arrived in the Spanish region of Murcia, where Repsol’s flagship biofuel plant is located, according to trade data published by Spain’s tax agency.

Nearly two-thirds came from Malaysia, whose UCO exports to the region saw a tenfold rise in the same year that the energy heavyweight fired up its Cartagena SAF refinery.

The figures do not specify who provided or bought the raw material. But trade data shows that Repsol purchased at least 53,000 tonnes of UCO from five Malaysian companies, including Evergreen Oil & Feed, in 2024. That amount represents 18 percent of the UCO the Repsol plant in Cartagena uses annually.

This is based on an analysis of Customs records provided by investigative consultancy Data Desk, which provided Climate Home News with a list of shipments of UCO certified for the European market, sourced from Malaysia by Repsol’s trading unit in Singapore.

No incidents of fraudulent UCO were detected in Repsol’s supply chain, with imports meeting EU rules on green certification.

Repsol told Climate Home News it “complements with imports when necessary” and receives raw material shipments from more than 20 countries. It declined to provide more details about the imports for “competitive reasons”.

Repsol’s heavy reliance on Malaysian supplies exposes it to fraud risks that raise wider questions about global assertions over the sustainability of SAF.

Asked what steps it takes to fight fraud, Repsol said it operates a rigorous supplier monitoring system to ensure the sustainability and integrity of its SAF production. A “very strong” compliance process means dubious raw materials and suppliers suspected of misconduct are quickly weeded out, it added.

“Any type of fraud distorts the market and undermines the confidence in the system, so it must be fought with all possible legal means,” the company said in e-mailed comments.

Shrinking air travel’s carbon footprint

Europe’s green aviation fuel refineries are boosting output because of new requirements by the EU for planes to use more SAF in the coming decades. From the start of 2025, fuel supplied to airports across Europe needs to contain at least 2 percent of SAF, with targets rising to 70 percent by 2050.

A million tonnes of SAF is needed to hit the EU’s 2025 mandate, and this will rise to 2.7 million tonnes a year by 2030 to meet the 6 per cent mandate.

SAF is crucial for shrinking aviation’s carbon footprint, according to industry body the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and is expected to account for 65 per cent of emissions reductions by 2050, when the sector has committed to reaching net zero.

In 2023, emissions from international plane travel accounted for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions. As air travel increases, and other sectors are more easily able to decarbonize, that share is set to grow.

One of the reasons SAF is so attractive is that it is a drop-in fuel for planes, requiring no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Repsol’s Dr Imaz told financial analysts early in 2024 that emissions-cutting alternatives to SAF – such as restricting short-haul flights – would represent “a drop in the ocean”.

Repsol’s plant uses 300,000 tonnes of UCO to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable fuels, including SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil.

But surging demand for UCO, SAF’s feedstock of choice, and a far-from-perfect global certification system based on self-declaration at the start of the supply chain are encouraging fraud that undermines the new fuel’s green credentials.

‘Ridiculous’ export statistics

This investigation found that by the time Asia-based traders ship UCO supplies overseas to refineries for processing into SAF, guaranteeing their environmental integrity is virtually impossible – despite the certification system on which fuel companies and airlines rely.

A source at a leading Malaysian UCO supplier to companies including Repsol told ST that he suspects that both UCO collectors and restaurants are committing fraud by providing oil that does not qualify as used, although it is difficult to prove.

In Malaysia, which is among the world’s leading suppliers of UCO and virgin palm oil, government-subsidized cooking oil is cheaper than UCO – providing a clear incentive for fraud. Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.

In a 2024 report, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) cited figures showing that Malaysia already exports about three times as much UCO as it is estimated to collect domestically and import, raising concern about where that oil is coming from – and what it consists of.

In 2023, 458,000 tonnes of UCO originating in Malaysia were registered with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), the leading certification scheme recognized by the European Commission to demonstrate compliance with its biofuel sustainability criteria.

In absolute terms, that puts Malaysia second only to China, which registered 1.65 million tonnes. Malaysia’s UCO volume, if indeed collected from its population, works out to 15.2 litres per person – the highest worldwide by far.

This figure is “ridiculous”, said Mr Cian Delaney, campaign coordinator at T&E, adding that for it to be feasible, Malaysia would need to be “a world-leading collection and refining system – which it isn’t”.

In comparison, China collected 1.4 liters per capita, while the figure is 0.9 liter in Indonesia and 3.8 litres in Spain.

Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin has previously acknowledged there is fraud in the country’s UCO supply chain. He told Reuters in February 2025 that the government would crack down on this to uphold the country’s “reputation as a responsible exporter”.

In a response to questions from ST, he said: “To maintain supply chain integrity, various measures are in place, including traceability systems, certification requirements, and stringent export documentation. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board, in collaboration with other regulatory bodies, is actively monitoring the industry to prevent fraudulent activities.”

He also said the government was strengthening enforcement mechanisms to uphold industry credibility.

Opaque supply chain

The waste ingredients from which SAF is made change hands multiple times in a largely opaque system. To verify their sustainability, European regulators rely on checks by private auditors and agencies that issue green certificates based on their findings.

But there is a systemic blind spot: The restaurants, street stalls, households and factories from which the UCO is pooled self-declare the origin of their contributions. Aside from ad hoc spot checks and sampling, there is no way of knowing that all of these providers are telling the truth.

“The opportunity… of fraud is very high,” said Mr Vasu R. Vasuthewan, former Malaysia head for the ISCC.

The Malaysian authorities recently uncovered criminal syndicates that had pocketed thousands of dollars a day by getting hold of large amounts of subsidized cooking oil, mixing it in with UCO, and then selling it on to industrial UCO traders.

Sources within the industry told Climate Home News and ST that many households and restaurants are motivated to replace cooking oil after a single use – contrary to the standard practice of three to five times – and then sell it on as UCO. Cooking oil is considered waste when it is no longer fit for frying.

“Restaurant compliance (with sustainability standards) may be very low,” said Mr Vasuthewan, who now runs his own UCO import and export business. “Many will fake their declaration, hoping they won’t get caught.”

Mr Delaney of T&E said it is difficult for auditors to physically check the origin of the oil, since hundreds of restaurants can supply the same collection point, making it a “notable blind spot”.

Singapore, a global SAF hub in the making

Singapore is a key part of the global SAF supply chain and is positioning itself as a leader in the production and usage of such fuel. The Republic is home to the world’s largest SAF refinery by capacity: Neste’s biofuel refinery in Tuas. Its SAF production capacity is one million tonnes a year.

Government trade data shows that Singapore is a major importer of UCO from China and Malaysia; this is most likely for the Neste refinery. The Republic also has a licensing framework for local UCO collectors, who pick up UCO mainly from restaurants, hotels and commercial kitchens, with about 19,000 tonnes collected annually from 2021 to 2024, according to the National Environment Agency.

The Government regards SAF as a critical tool to reduce aviation emissions while allowing the industry to keep expanding and Changi Airport, one of the world’s busiest, to keep growing.

To ramp up SAF usage, from 2026, all flights departing Singapore’s two civilian airports must use 1 percent SAF. The goal is to reach 3 percent to 5 percent SAF use by 2030.

Fraud is a concern for the authorities and the industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) told ST that it recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and integrity in SAF feedstocks.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain. We share the same concerns as these pose risks to market confidence, fair trading and development of a nascent SAF market,” said CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

He said the authority is working with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection to develop “harmonised standards for feedstock verification to prevent further fraudulent practices”.

Neste told ST, in response to questions: “Neste sources traceable UCO and other renewable raw materials globally from carefully selected suppliers. Neste evaluates its suppliers and accepts renewable raw materials only from those suppliers that are able to meet strict criteria for sustainability.”

The Singapore Airlines Group said it works closely with its partners to ensure supplies meet internationally recognized standards such as the ISCC, and comply with regulatory requirements in jurisdictions with SAF mandates.

Spot checks, patchy audits

There is a system in place to keep fraudulent stocks out of the supply chain. Buyers and regulators in Europe rely on audit companies to trace the raw materials used in SAF and prove their green credentials.

Those audits are verified by authorised certification systems like the ISCC – which is led by the biofuel industry and, according to one source, enjoys “a kind of monopoly” in the sector. It then issues sustainability certificates to commodities traders and fuel suppliers.

According to the ISCC, its certification supports “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”.

While in some cases auditors conduct random field checks, that happens less often in countries outside the EU, industry experts say.

According to Mr James Cogan, compliance and markets lead at Irish biofuel firm ClonBio, it is far easier for fraud to occur outside the EU where “it’s much less visible to us”.

A 2024 analysis by T&E in China, for example, showed that sampling of points of origin happened in less than 10 per cent of the ISCC-approved audits, whereas in the EU, it was about 30 per cent.

Mr Adam Kirby, ISCC’s senior sustainability manager, told Climate Home News that auditors monitor volumes going in and out of collection points for any suspicious behaviour, in addition to carrying out spot checks. He added that the ISCC follows the requirements established by regulators like the European Commission.

In 2024, the ISCC also conducted 79 special “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. In a third of the cases, it found violations of its certification requirements, including an inability to demonstrate the traceability of products, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Long paper trail

Under the current system, the entire SAF supply chain relies on a long paper trail rooted in those self-declarations and sporadic inspections at the points where UCO is collected.

In Malaysia, Evergreen’s owner C.K. Lau told ST that the company follows the proper processes in its collection based on the requirements established by the ISCC. He added that the documentation is critical as, otherwise, the company would not be able to export its UCO.

Repsol, for its part, said it requires “suppliers to be certified under European Commission-recognized voluntary regimes”.

In turn, airline companies that buy from Repsol, such as the International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and Level – rely on documentation they get from it and other jet fuel providers, to show that the SAF they are paying for has green certification.

In exceptional cases, IAG has sent its own staff to carry out checks on the ground, as with a Shanghai-based Chinese supplier in 2024. It told Climate Home News the outcome of that audit – which included supply, record-keeping, environmental and health and safety standards – was “positive”.

Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry. “You’ll see a race to the top… on sustainability, and it will, in a way, be self-regulated,” he added.

SAF certification faces EU scrutiny

In the meantime, following a string of fraud allegations about the authenticity of UCO-derived biofuels imported from China, the EU has been trying to ascertain whether the certification system that governments and businesses rely on is fit for purpose.

The EU authorities have been in talks to strengthen that system, leading to speculation that the ISCC could be suspended for failing to catch cases of biodiesel fraud. The ISCC denied in a statement that regulators had considered halting automatic EU-wide acceptance of its certificates, adding that its relationship with the European Commission remained constructive.

“There are always bad actors, there are always bad people, and there’s only a certain amount of policing that can be done in any industry,” said Mr Kirby. “We at ISCC have done, I think, an incredible job.”

The ISCC did not respond to follow-up questions from Climate Home News on whether it has full confidence in the current system, including self-declaration.

A European Commission spokeswoman said the bloc’s executive arm was closely monitoring the SAF market “to detect and prevent fraud, which risks undermining the EU’s ambition to effectively decarbonise air transport”.

Demand for UCO sizzles

Demand for SAF and UCO is only expected to increase as usage in Europe, Asia and elsewhere grows and as new refineries are completed in China, South Korea and Malaysia.

In 2024, Malaysia’s state energy firm Petronas, Italy’s Enilive, and Euglena of Japan announced they would develop a biorefinery at Petronas’ Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor. Due for completion in 2028, it would produce SAF and other biofuels.

Malaysia plans to mandate SAF usage by 2027, with the initial goal of blending it into aviation fuel at a 1 per cent rate.

Leading European refiners like Repsol are pushing for a level global playing field as well as more public funding to bring down costs and help develop the nascent sector on the continent.

Iata warned earlier in June that the European mandates had caused the SAF price paid by airlines to double because of hefty compliance fees being charged by producers.

Repsol’s aviation head Carlos Suarez Cubillo warned that fuel producers in parts of the world with laxer rules could produce SAF “with less regulation and less control of the feedstock… and here in Europe that could de-incentivise the production, the construction of new facilities”.

In Brazil, for example, an emerging SAF industry is gearing up to use crop-based feedstocks that are commonly linked to deforestation – and are therefore banned in Europe – such as soya and palm oil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol, which has been linked to labour abuses and modern slavery.

An investigation by Climate Home News’ partner in Brazil, InfoAmazonia, found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region – billed as Brazil’s first SAF project – is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

Iata hopes its efforts to put in place a global registry for SAF, launched in April as a voluntary initiative, will boost transparency around feedstocks and their greenhouse gas savings – and enable airlines to have some level of visibility and comparability between countries, fuel providers and airports.

SAF producers and airlines are also looking to other waste-based materials to meet rising mandates – especially as more advanced fuels made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, known as e-SAF, are still being developed and tested.

Repsol, for example, recently closed a deal with US vegetable oils giant Bunge to source camelina and safflower – non-food crops that can grow on poor land – to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil for biodiesel and SAF.

In January, it also announced it would invest more than €800 million in Europe’s first plant in the Catalan city of Tarragona to produce renewable methanol from organic urban waste, for use in maritime, road and aviation transport from 2029.

But in the meantime, Europe’s overwhelming reliance on UCO means it will continue to import supplies from Asia – despite the concerns over fraud, said Ms Sophie Byron, global head of biofuels pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“That trade flow is not going away any time soon,” she said. /dl",https://globalnation.inquirer.net/files/2025/07/bf363599bb4b95835d1058df082bbdc39e2450d9730aed9912858986ccc73a65.jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 23:02:18.496132

This new financing model unlocks developer access to DEVCAP with lender repayment guarantee that eliminates perceived investor risk for pre-construction funding.

SEATTLE, July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels (NWABF), the developer of one of the United States' largest woody biomass sustainable synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) facilities, announced today a breakthrough financing structure that removes a long-standing barrier in the renewables industry in the United States: access to Engineering Services Development Capital (DEVCAP). This monumental pathway will allow for widescale use of nationally and internationally mandated Sustainable Synthetic Aviation Fuel (SAF) by airlines who fly across the globe.

Historically, major infrastructure and institutional investment funds have been prohibited by their charters from funding DEVCAP, leaving dozens of renewable infrastructure projects whose purpose is to create SAF for airlines on hold. To address this, NWABF has partnered with a global insurance underwriter to create an insurance-backed repayment guarantee that completely de-risks pre-construction working capital.

Under this structure, the investor or lender is named as the insured party and beneficiary and is insured against all defaults of principal and interest payments from the borrower. thereby removing 100% of the risk for financiers.

""This solution was born from our own roadblocks,"" said Dave Smoot, Managing Partner and Founder of Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels. ""Despite having one of the industry's strongest offtake agreements, from one of the industry's strongest airlines, top-tier engineering and technology partners, commitments for the project's required feedstock and the best site available in the Pacific Northwest, securing DEVCAP funding has been a challenge due to legacy financing policies. Now, with this insurance-backed guarantee, similar in nature to Corporate Surety Bonds currently and readily available in Europe and Asia, we're opening the door for all developers across the SAF and renewable energy industry. Someone had to do it.""

This financial breakthrough will lead to a variety of benefits for not just companies in need of DEVCAP across the nation, but also airline partners who will use NWABF's earth-friendly SAF and the state of Washington where thousands of jobs will be created.

What This Means for Airlines

""With this insurance-backed guarantee, similar in nature to Corporate Surety Bonds currently and readily available in Europe and Asia, we're opening the door for all developers across the SAF and renewable energy industry,"" said Dave Smoot, Founder of Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels.

New environmentally friendly regulations are requiring the airline industry to use 10% of SAF by 2029, and 100% by 2050. Once fully operational in 2029, NWABF will be producing 60+ million gallons of SAF that will allow its airline partner to decrease CO₂ emissions by up to 80% as they fly across the globe. Purchase agreements with companies like NWABF will also allow equity access to fuel supply as opposed to reliance on a volatile oil market.

What This Means for the Environment

""There is currently woody biomass and waste at up to 4-feet tall across much of the forests in Washington,"" said Smoot. ""We will be providing the outlet for clearing this out by the tons to use for creation of our SAF"". With wood leaking methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere this alone will be of great benefit to the environment through NWABF's production and manufacturing of SAF.

What This Means for the State of Washington

""We will create approximately 2,000 Jobs during construction, in addition to 200+ full-time positions as well as ancillary jobs (such as agriculture, waste collection and transport, housing, hotels and restaurants) as a result of this facility on the Columbia River,"" said Smoot. NWABF also plans to create feed stock preparation sites that will employ dozens of other Washington State residents.

NWABF is currently raising funds for its Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) Study, while concurrently developing a state-of-the-art SAF production facility along the Columbia River in Washington State, using woody biomass waste as feedstock. The site is currently being secured under a long-term lease agreement and the feedstock providers have agreed to execute long-term supply contracts. The project boasts a long-term offtake agreement with a prominent U.S. airline and is scheduled to begin production in 2029, once construction is completed, and will produce over 60+ million gallons of SAF per year.

""This structure provides a scalable financing solution for developers in SAF, biofuels and clean infrastructure sectors. It's a powerful tool that can unlock billions of dollars in delayed projects, and benefits many of the airlines who currently can't find this fuel, for use now and in the future,"" said Smoot. ""Our CFO, Bernie Asher, and the Insurance Representative have done a wonderful job road mapping a solution to this outdated industry paradigm, creating a winning solution that will benefit many project developers, technology and engineering companies, feedstock suppliers, barge companies, local communities, etc.""

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step toward carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural & biological engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

“There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.”

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers used HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab.

“Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

“We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

“There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.” Yang said. “I’m optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.”

Hydrogen (H2) offers significant potential as a sustainable fuel, with anticipated zero to low carbon emissions. This study develops a methodological framework that integrates on-site electrolytic H2 production, storage, and transportation for airport applications. For the first time, the techno-economic feasibility of supplying clean liquid hydrogen (LH2) to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to support its transition toward sustainable operations by 2050 is comprehensively analyzed. The results underscore the critical role of integrating long-term H2 storage and short-term battery storage solutions to establish a reliable, self-sustained microgrid system at LAX. The estimated levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) ranges from $6.77 to $7.10 per kilogram of H2 in 2030, decreasing significantly to approximately $3.78 per kilogram of H2 by 2050, showing the viability of deploying clean H2 at LAX. Additionally, this study, for the first time, quantifies the global warming potential (GWP) of clean H2 supply pathways for airport applications, revealing a range of 0.29 to 0.35 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 by 2050, with H2 venting from electrolysis identified as the dominant contributor. The findings emphasize the feasibility of H2 as a sustainable aviation fuel and provide actionable strategies for its implementation at LAX. This work advances the hydrogen aviation field by bridging the gap between the general clean H2 supply chain strategies and the specific needs of the aviation sector, thereby contributing to California's ambitious climate goals. Future research is recommended to address limitations in cost optimization, lifecycle impacts, policy incentives, and safety innovations, enabling the scalable and practical implementation of H2 as a sustainable aviation fuel at airports.",Not Available,https://escholarship.org/images/escholarship-facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 21:59:39.088586

It’s gonna take time

Whole lot of precious time

It’s gonna take patience and time, mmm

To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it

To do it right, child

Two stories, in particular, show why some SAF projects quietly advance while others stall in the valley of good intentions.

Over at Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels

First, the team at Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels (NWABF) has unveiled what may be the most consequential SAF financing innovation in years: an insurance-backed guarantee to de-risk the engineering development capital (DEVCAP) phase that has kept so many renewable fuel ventures from getting off the launch pad. It sounds arcane, but it’s foundational.

For decades, major infrastructure lenders have been prohibited from funding pre-construction engineering and design. Projects would get tantalizingly close to reality—feedstock secured, offtake agreements inked, sites selected—but they’d stall for want of the working capital needed to finalize engineering and secure final investment decisions. NWABF, in classic Pacific Northwest style, didn’t make a lot of noise about it. They just worked the problem.

The company partnered with a global insurance underwriter to create a repayment guarantee instrument that effectively eliminates default risk for DEVCAP financiers. Lenders can now fund early engineering work with confidence that if something goes wrong, their principal and interest are insured. The implications are enormous: billions of dollars of delayed SAF projects—some languishing for years—can now clear the runway.

As NWABF’s Dave Smoot put it, “Someone had to do it.”.

This is the kind of GTESI-inflected persistence that matters. When you look across decades of advanced biofuels, you find that it’s not necessarily the most glamorous technologies that survive. It’s the teams that align incentives for all stakeholders. In this case, NWABF aligned risk tolerance, return expectations, and policy mandates into a coherent financing architecture.

Contrast that to projects that have faltered. Too often, companies expect financiers to bear outsized technical and regulatory risks without meaningful protection, or they fail to anticipate the timing mismatch between capital cycles and policy incentives. That’s when you see the press releases fade, the websites stop updating, and the same projects resurface five years later with a new logo and the same structural weaknesses.

Over at Avalon

Consider the Avalon project in Uruguay. If it feels like déjà vu, it’s because Camelina has been on the radar a long time. Back in March 2010, our team published a comprehensive report titled Camelina Aviation Biofuels: Market Opportunity and Renewable Energy Report. Even then, Camelina was identified as an oilseed crop from the mustard family that thrives in semi-arid temperate regions, possessing numerous traits that made it a high-potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

The promise was real:

Camelina proved in yield trials to be a hardy, low-input crop, requiring far less fertilizer and irrigation than soybeans or canola.

It performed well on marginal land, germinated in near-freezing temperatures, and offered agronomic benefits as a rotation crop.

Lifecycle modeling estimated GHG reductions of 75% or more versus petroleum—a figure that has largely held up.

Yet the report also underscored challenges rarely acknowledged in headlines:

Camelina was “relatively novel” in North America, with limited breeding and no large-scale seed supply chains.

Crushing and refining capacity simply didn’t exist at the necessary scale; capital costs for drop-in jet fuel far exceeded those of biodiesel.

Even as field trials expanded across more than a dozen states, contracts and guaranteed offtake commitments lagged behind.

The report concluded that “millions of acres of Camelina, and 100 million gallons per year of Camelina fuel, is still years away.”

In other words, you can’t skip the developmental rhythm. It takes time to scale seed genetics, prove yields, and build the logistics backbone. Rushing the oven doesn’t help. As any baker knows, turning up the heat just scorches the crust and leaves the middle raw.

All of this context is why Avalon’s work today is so significant. It isn’t just a fresh licensing agreement—it’s the culmination of fifteen years of patient progress: breeding improvements, policy development, and supply-chain experiments that laid the groundwork for this moment.

It also highlights a broader lesson running through both Avalon and NWABF’s projects. Whether it’s a novel financing structure to unlock engineering capital, or a new technology platform to process Camelina oil efficiently, success has required a willingness to do the quiet, unglamorous work for as long as it takes.

Looking at these projects through the GTESI persistence lens

In a GTESI frame, it’s a classic example of evolutionary persistence. While hype cycles around algae and miscanthus came and went, Camelina retained a clear value proposition: a low-carbon oilseed that could be grown without displacing food crops. Now, with Sulzer’s BioFlux technology—a proprietary liquid-full reactor that optimizes hydrogenation without vapor recirculation—the process economics have finally matured into something bankable.

It’s worth underscoring that this isn’t merely an incremental tweak. BioFlux significantly improves yield, extends catalyst life, and cuts costs. That’s how you get from “promising pilot” to real project finance.

And again, it circles back to the song refrain:

It’s gonna take patience and time to do it right.

Consider the through-line between NWABF and Avalon. Both teams recognized that no amount of technology hype can paper over weak fundamentals. You need feedstock security, robust engineering, de-risked financing, and credible offtake. You need alignment across growers, processors, airlines, and investors—and the humility to keep building while the spotlight drifts elsewhere.

If there’s a cautionary note this week, it comes in the proliferation of partial measures and symbolic gestures. We’re seeing airlines adopt tiny SAF blends—1% here, 2% there—and while every molecule matters, the question remains: what’s the pathway to 10%, 50%, or 100%?

The same goes for carbon capture pilots at airports and domestic SAF supply announcements. These are good steps, but the industry must guard against the illusion of progress. When partial measures get over-celebrated, they risk crowding out the full-stack efforts that can actually scale.

So how do you tell the difference? Which SAF efforts will persist and reshape the industry, and which will fade into footnotes?

GTESI suggests four questions worth asking:

Is the feedstock strategy resilient and scalable? Camelina, woody biomass, waste oils—these are credible, proven resources.

Is the process technology mature and differentiated? BioFlux is a great example of how core innovation can unlock cost and yield advantages.

Is the financing architecture robust? NWABF’s insurance-backed DEVCAP model removes a structural bottleneck.

Is there a clear path to offtake at meaningful volumes? Without buyers committing long-term, everything else is theory.

When you find projects answering all four, pay attention. That’s where persistence lives.

If this week proves anything, it’s that the path to sustainable aviation fuel is a slow train coming—but it is coming. Whether in the forests of Washington, the fields of Uruguay, or the labs in Dublin, the pattern holds:

It’s gonna take money.

And patience.

And time.

But when all three line up, the industry moves forward. No amount of hype can substitute for that alignment.",,N,,2025-07-08 18:06:31.669670

The robust growth can be attributed to several factors, including strong aerospace demand, operational efficiency gains, and tariff-driven pricing strategies. The company's stock is currently trading near $244, well above its 50-day moving average of around $235, and approaching its 52-week high of $260.55 [1].

A key development contributing to this performance was the announcement of a multi-year service, repair, and overhaul (MRO) agreement with China Airlines. This agreement covers GE9X engines for China Airlines' 14 Boeing 777X aircraft, reinforcing a partnership that dates back to 1999. The GE9X engine, known for its 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor and full compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), has been a significant driver of the company's growth [3].

In the first quarter of 2025, GE Aerospace reported strong results, with revenue rising 11% year over year to $9.94 billion. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 60% to $1.49, beating the consensus estimate of $1.26. The company reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, forecasting low double-digit revenue growth and EPS between $5.10 and $5.45 [1].

The market is looking ahead to GE Aerospace’s second-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating continued growth in service revenue and further pricing momentum tied to tariff pass-throughs. In June, RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating on GE Aerospace and raised its price forecast to $275 [1].

As part of its broader climate strategy, the California Legislature is advancing AB 839, a bill introduced by Assemblymember Blanca Rubio that allows the Governor to certify up to three SAF projects for expedited judicial review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). While the bill aims to accelerate decarbonization in the aviation sector, critics warn the measure could set off legal disputes over due process and public health safeguards.

The CEQA Tradeoff: Speed vs. Scrutiny

At its core, AB 839 amends Sections 21189.81 through 21189.83 of the Public Resources Code to include SAF infrastructure as a qualifying project for CEQA streamlining. These projects would benefit from:

A 270-day limit for courts to resolve legal challenges,

Concurrent preparation of environmental records with EIR review,

Fast-tracked litigation procedures, including optional use of a special master,

And no judicial review of the Governor’s decision to certify a project.

While designed to reduce uncertainty for investors and developers, legal experts suggest this accelerated timeline may erode the public's ability to meaningfully engage in environmental oversight.

Precedent and Pushback

California has previously faced legal pushback for fast-tracking CEQA review of controversial projects, notably during the development of large-scale sports stadiums and high-speed rail. Although AB 839 applies only to a limited number of SAF projects, stakeholders from environmental justice communities are watching closely.

“Communities already burdened by poor air quality—especially near airports and refinery zones—deserve full transparency and a robust environmental review,” said a representative from a regional clean air coalition who asked to remain anonymous due to ongoing negotiations.

The bill attempts to mitigate concerns by requiring:

No use of fossil fuels in production,

Reduced emissions for conversions of existing Title V sources,

And impact mitigation specifically benefiting disadvantaged communities.

However, opponents argue these provisions may be insufficient without full CEQA litigation timelines.

The Stakes: SAF’s Role in California’s Climate Goals

California has ambitious aviation decarbonization targets. Under CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan, 80% of intrastate commercial aviation fuel must be SAF by 2045, totaling an estimated 3.5 billion gallons. Current SAF production, by contrast, remains limited both in scale and geographic distribution.

Proponents of AB 839 argue that CEQA streamlining is essential to meet these deadlines. The bill’s legislative findings cite urgent climate threats—wildfires, extreme heat, and emissions from hard-to-electrify sectors—as justification for prioritized review.

Without accelerated permitting, SAF proponents say, California risks falling behind other states and losing private investment to less regulatory-heavy jurisdictions.

Legal Uncertainty Ahead?

As of July 8, AB 839 remains in Senate committee, with its first hearing delayed at the author's request. Whether that signals a cooling of momentum or strategic recalibration remains unclear.

What is certain: if the bill passes and projects begin moving forward under expedited review, legal challenges are likely—particularly over CEQA’s long-standing role in environmental protection and public participation.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250707-190746-51c-A%20modern%20airport%20runway%20with%20an%20aircraft%20taking%20off%2C%20surrounded%20by%20wind%20turbines%20and%20solar%20panels%2C%20symbolizing%20sustainable%20aviation%20and%20renewable%20energy..jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:06:07.123164

The seminal work introducing MTL showed that related tasks often reach local minima of validation error at different points in training, underscoring the importance of task-specific early stopping8. Building on this insight, ACS combines both task-agnostic and task-specific trainable components to balance inductive transfer with the need to shield individual tasks from NT. The backbone of our architecture is a single GNN based on message passing20, depicted in Fig. 1a, which learns general-purpose latent representations. These are then processed by task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) heads. While the shared backbone promotes inductive transfer, the dedicated task heads provide specialized learning capacity for each individual task. During training, we monitor the validation loss of every task and checkpoint the best backbone–head pair whenever the validation loss of a given task reaches a new minimum. Thus, each task ultimately obtains a specialized backbone–head pair.

To gauge the adequacy of this architecture, we first compare it with recent supervised-learning models on three MoleculeNet21 benchmarks—ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21—each containing two or more prediction tasks and split with a Murcko-scaffold protocol22 for fair comparison with previous works23,24,25,26. ClinTox distinguishes FDA-approved drugs from compounds that failed clinical trials owing to toxicity; SIDER comprises 27 binary classification tasks indicating the presence or absence of side effects; and Tox21 measures 12 in-vitro nuclear-receptor and stress-response toxicity endpoints. Detailed descriptions of these benchmark datasets are presented in the Methods section. In Table 1, we show that ACS either matches or surpasses the performance of comparable models; indeed, only D-MPNN26 achieves consistently similar results. While both ACS and D-MPNN employ message passing, the latter propagates messages along directed edges to reduce redundant updates. Overall, ACS demonstrates an 11.5% average improvement relative to other methods based on node-centric message passing.

We also compared ACS against recent few-shot learning approaches, including meta-learning methods and fine-tuned pre-trained models (see Supplementary Table 1). While these techniques are tailored for low-data regimes, they generally assume more reliably labeled tasks and more balanced support/query splits than the ultra-low data setting targeted by ACS. Moreover, while most meta-learning methods rely on a large number of training tasks to achieve effective generalization, traditional multi-task supervised learning approaches—including ACS—can perform reliably even with as few as two tasks. Similarly, although pre-trained models offer strong performance, they typically demand computationally expensive pretraining on large-scale unlabeled data and may struggle to generalize to sparse, domain-specific targets without significant fine-tuning. Performance and analysis of these meta-learning and pre-trained models on ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 can be found in the Supplementary Notes 1.

To clarify whether ACS’s gains stem from its overall architecture or its ability to mitigate NT, we benchmark multiple baseline training schemes (see Fig. 1). We compare ACS to MTL without checkpointing (denoted as MTL), MTL with global loss checkpointing (MTL-GLC), and single-task learning with checkpointing (STL), which devotes a separate backbone–head pair to each task; thereby removing all parameter sharing. Notably, STL has greater learning capacity than the MTL-based approaches, as it does not introduce parameter sharing. Nonetheless, ACS outperforms STL by 8.3% on average, indicating the clear benefits of inductive transfer. MTL and MTL-GLC also exceed STL, but by smaller margins (3.9% and 5.0%, respectively). The broader gap between ACS and the other MTL methods highlights the efficacy of ACS in curbing NT. On the ClinTox dataset, ACS shows particularly large gains, improving upon STL, MTL, and MTL-GLC by 15.3%, 10.8%, and 10.4%, respectively. By contrast, ACS’s edge over MTL and MTL-GLC is smaller on SIDER and Tox21—both of which differ substantially in size and sparsity from ClinTox. Tox21, for instance, is roughly 5.4 times larger than ClinTox and SIDER and has a missing-label ratio of 17.1%, whereas ClinTox and SIDER have no missing labels. Since ACS is designed to address NT arising from task imbalance, the minimal or absent label sparsity in these datasets limits the relative advantage of ACS. Accordingly, these results underscore the need to explore in more depth how dataset characteristics shape ACS’s effectiveness.

Building on this observation, we conducted extensive experiments on synthetic variations of task imbalance to further elucidate the full scope of ACS’s applicability; the results are presented in the following section. Taken together, our findings show that ACS can robustly mitigate NT by selectively adapting shared parameters while safeguarding task-specific knowledge—particularly under conditions that mirror real-world data imbalances.

Mechanistic insights and applicability domain

Previous studies have shown that synergies in MTL for molecular property prediction depend on both task-relatedness and molecular similarity6,27. However, the impacts of task imbalance on MTL remain relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we systematically varied task imbalance using the ClinTox dataset28,29, which contains 1,478 molecules and two binary classification tasks: (1) FDA approval status and (2) failure in clinical trials due to toxicity. We then trained models under the four aforementioned schemes—STL, MTL, MTL-GLC, and ACS—to quantify how well each approaches NT.

To enable quantitative assessment of task imbalance \(I\), we define it for a given task using Eq. (1):

$${I}_{i}=1-\frac{{L}_{i}}{{\max {L}_{j}}}\atop {j{\mathcal{\in }}{\mathcal{D}}}$$

(1)

where \({L}_{i}\) is the number of labeled entries for the \({i}^{{th}}\) task in a dataset \({\mathcal{D}}\). This task imbalance metric reflects the scarcity of labels in a task relative to the most well-annotated task. By adjusting this ratio, we directly observe how NT emerges when certain tasks have substantially fewer labels.

Figure 2a, b illustrate ACS’s performance improvements compared to MTL-GLC and STL, respectively, across varying levels of task imbalance. Generally, ACS achieves the most significant gains in highly imbalanced scenarios, aligning with its goal of mitigating NT by checkpointing shared model parameters and retaining specialized task heads. Compared to MTL-GLC, ACS provides consistent performance improvement across different levels of task imbalance, as shown in Fig. 2a. This can be attributed to ACS’s more effective approach to mitigate negative transfer by checkpointing model parameters for each task individually. On the other hand, the checkpointing approach of MTL-GLC is less sensitive as it depends on variations in the global loss value. Relative to STL, the advantage of ACS tends to increase with increasing task imbalance. This is supported by the positive trend between performance improvement and task imbalance, as shown in Fig. 2b. At low task imbalance values (\({I}_{i} < 0.5\)), there is no discernable performance difference between ACS and STL. However, as \({I}_{i}\) increases beyond 0.5, the average performance gain steadily rises, with ACS achieving an average improvement of 8.1% for \({I}_{i} > 0.5\). The improvement of ACS over STL can be attributed to its ability to leverage inductive transfer while mitigating NT, a capability that becomes especially valuable under highly imbalanced conditions. Concurrently, MTL-GLC also outperforms STL under higher task imbalance conditions, albeit by smaller margins, as shown in Fig. 2c. This demonstrates how inductive transfer, which is absent in STL, can alleviate the impact of missing labels. Under low task imbalance conditions, however, STL outperforms MTL-GLC due to its higher learning capacity, which is more effectively leveraged in this regime.

These findings collectively define ACS’s applicability: it excels in high-imbalance regimes, where negative transfer is most severe, while remaining competitive as data balance and availability improve. The primary issue in these scenarios is how high-data tasks dominate shared parameter updates, leading to gradient conflicts that impair performance on lower-data tasks. ACS addresses this by preserving a checkpoint of the model before its parameters are affected by NT or noisy stochastic gradient descent updates. By doing so, ACS leverages the advantages of a more expressive network for well-represented tasks while safeguarding underrepresented tasks from the negative effects of excessive complexity.

In addition to analyzing the effects of task imbalance, we systematically evaluated how model capacity impacts ACS performance by varying the depth of the GNN backbone and the width of the MLP heads. As shown in Supplementary Notes 2, ACS performance on both ClinTox tasks remains relatively stable across a broad range of GNN and MLP configurations. While deeper GNNs (e.g., depth ≥ 7) show a slight performance decline, especially for FDA_APPROVED, the overall trends are consistent across tasks and do not indicate divergent behavior. Similarly, increasing MLP width yields comparable improvements or degradations across both tasks, suggesting that ACS adapts well to changes in per-task capacity. These results imply that the capacity mismatch between the shared backbone and task-specific heads does not appear to be a primary driver of negative transfer in this setting.

Ultra-low-data learning of molecular properties (Real-world deployment of ACS)

To evaluate the practical utility of ACS, we deployed it in a real-world application for predicting key properties of SAFs. ML approaches to SAF property prediction aim to reduce both the time and the cost of experimental testing. The design space of SAFs spans a wide variety of physical and chemical properties, which differ substantially in their cost and labor-intensiveness of collection5. Moreover, because aviation propulsion devices operate under unique conditions (e.g., below −55 °C at cruising altitude), SAF certification requires data gathered under specialized test protocols30,31. These factors lead to an incredibly sparse literature of experimentally measured SAF properties, making it a practical setting to assess the performance of ACS on limited data.

We compiled a dataset of 1,381 hydrocarbon molecules commonly found in SAFs, covering 15 critical properties for SAF design and certification. The Methods section provides details of data collection and preprocessing. A quantitative analysis of the SAF dataset reveals significant sparsity, with an average task imbalance of 0.75. The most underrepresented tasks reach a peak imbalance value of ~0.99 (Supplementary Table 4). This strong task imbalance induces NT as tasks with fewer samples exert limited influence on the shared network parameters.

For model comparison, we define two data regimes based on the number of labeled samples, n: an ultra-low-data regime (n < 150; median = 80) and a low-data regime (150 < n < 800; median = 424). We then benchmark ACS against the aforementioned baseline training schemes (as described in Fig. 1): STL, MTL and MTL-GLC. To ensure performance consistency, we employ a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) strategy during model training. As summarized in Fig. 3, ACS consistently outperforms these baseline methods, showing an average improvement of 12.9%. ACS also yields more stable performance across the 5-fold CV, reducing the coefficient of variation by 32.7% on average compared to the baseline approaches.

The advantage of ACS is especially pronounced in the ultra-low-data regime, where it achieves a 20.3% average performance gain over the other methods (Fig. 4, left). STL, which lacks inductive transfer, often fails on tasks with fewer than 60 samples. MTL and MTL-GLC do benefit from parameter sharing but still suffer from NT when large task imbalances occur. In contrast, ACS effectively mitigates NT, permitting beneficial inductive transfer even for tasks with minimal labeled data. As shown in Supplementary Notes 3, ACS maintains robust performance across all tasks, whereas the other methods show substantial variability in the ultra-low-data regime. Close inspection of MTL-GLC reveals that it can outperform STL for tasks with extremely scarce labels (owing to its inherent inductive transfer) but tends to underperform on tasks for which STL does not fail, leading to comparable overall performance. Conventional MTL shows the weakest performance overall, likely because it shares parameters without sufficient regularization against NT and lacks the higher task-specific capacity inherent to STL.

In the low-data regime (150 < n < 800), STL performance becomes comparable to that of ACS (Fig. 4, right), suggesting that tasks with larger datasets can fully leverage STL’s dedicated learning capacity. MTL and MTL-GLC also improve in this regime, as tasks with more labeled samples gain greater influence over network parameters. Nonetheless, ACS consistently provides robust performance across both data regimes, highlighting its effectiveness in scenarios with significant task imbalance and limited data availability.

Task-relatedness manifests in ACS backbones

In MTL, inductive transfer occurs when the training signals or learned representations from one task enhance the performance of another. Because ACS uses a shared backbone while allowing each task to maintain specialized parameters, tasks that are truly related produce backbones with similar latent representations. Inversely, limited task-relatedness is expected to reduce performance gains from ACS (See Supplementary Notes 5 for a detailed discussion). To investigate this effect, we calculated the cosine similarity between the final graph embeddings of each SAF dataset molecule across the task-specific backbones. For a given pair of task-specific latent vectors (u, v), the cosine similarity is defined as \(\frac{{\boldsymbol{u}}\cdot {\boldsymbol{v}}}{\left|\left|{\boldsymbol{u}}\right|\right|{||}{\boldsymbol{v}}{||}}\). Higher similarity values indicate stronger alignment between task-specific backbone parameters. This alignment reflects convergent learning: although each backbone is optimized for a different property, related tasks discover overlapping representational structures in the molecular latent space. Because these embeddings are learned independently from a shared input, consistent alignment suggests the presence of common underlying molecular patterns or physical mechanisms. To account for any molecule-specific anomalies, we compute this metric separately for each molecule and then average the results across all molecules in the SAF dataset, yielding a single value for each pair of tasks. Figure 5 highlights the task pairs that rank in the top 10% for cosine similarity, corresponding to ≥ 0.96 similarity (see Supplementary Notes 4 for 15%, 20%, and 50% thresholds). Several task pairs display exceptionally high alignment, indicating that they capture shared underlying physical mechanisms or chemical features. These findings confirm that ACS can effectively harness inductive transfer by preserving meaningful commonalities among related tasks, while still allowing for task-specific specialization.

To illustrate these high-similarity relationships in more detail, consider autoignition temperature (AIT) and normal boiling point (\({T}_{b}\)). This pair exhibits a striking correlation of 0.996, consistent with previous quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models32. This strong correlation reflects how both properties hinge on how readily a compound transitions to the vapor phase before ignition. Given that \({T}_{b}\) is the temperature at which vapor pressure (\({P}_{v}\)) equals atmospheric pressure, we find that their ACS backbones are highly correlated (~0.986). The lower and upper flammability limits (LFL and UFL) also exhibit a correlation in terms of backbone parameters, producing a cosine similarity of 0.988. It is unsurprising that the flash point (FP) correlates at 0.974 with \({T}_{b}\), given that both properties depend strongly on volatility as demonstrated by previous QSPR studies33,34. In the same high-similarity tier, pairs such as UFL and melting point (\({T}_{m}\)) (~0.971) or AIT and lower heating value (LHV) (~0.969) illustrate how shared structural factors—such as chain length, functional groups, and intermolecular interactions—underlie ignition and phase-transition behaviors32.

Furthermore, we find LHV aligning with vapor pressure (\({P}_{v}\)) (~0.972), as well as viscosity (\(\mu\)) correlating at 0.991 with \({T}_{b}\). Both reflect how molecular weight and polarity simultaneously elevate boiling point, heat of combustion, and viscosity35,36. Meanwhile, moderate similarities arise among properties such as cetane number (CN) and surface tension (ST) (~0.836), or liquid heat capacity (\({C}_{p}\)) and \({T}_{b}\) (~0.802). Here, chain length and intermolecular forces still play a role, albeit in different physical systems (spray ignition behavior versus thermophysical measurements). Finally, correlations drop further when bridging distinct phases or conditions, for example, liquid thermal conductivity (κ) and \({T}_{b}\) (~0.531), or liquid density (\(\rho\)) and \({T}_{m}\) (~0.389). This reduction in correlation arises because the physics governing liquid-phase transport at moderate temperatures differ substantially from those governing boiling or solid-phase transitions.

One way to visualize correlations between latent space representations is through universal manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), a dimensionality reduction technique that preserves the local and global structure of high-dimensional data. Figure 6 displays UMAP projections for two of the aforementioned highly correlated task pairs, with colors indicating molecular families. While UMAP plots may differ in orientation due to the method’s invariance to rotation and reflection, the underlying structure remains consistent. For instance, the heart-shaped clustering in the AIT projection closely resembles that of \({T}_{b}\), albeit rotated by 180 degrees (Fig. 6a, b). A similar correspondence is observed for the flammability limits (LFL, UFL), where both projections show nearly identical clustering arrangements across chemical families (Fig. 6c, d).

These visual similarities are further supported by analyzing the placement of specific chemical families. In both LFL and UFL projections, n-Alcohols cluster tightly in the same region of the second quadrant, indicating that the two task-specific backbones project these molecules in a consistent manner. Likewise, the AIT and \({T}_{b}\) backbones position n-Alcohols along a prominent vertical pattern, which remains recognizable despite a 180-degree rotation between the two projections. When accounting for this rotational invariance, the embeddings of unsaturated aliphatic esters also align closely between AIT and \({T}_{b}\), occupying similar regions relative to other chemical families. These consistent, family-specific projections across related tasks suggest that task-specialized backbones tend to embed chemically similar molecules into structurally analogous regions of latent space—even in the absence of explicit chemical family supervision.

Moreover, the epoch of the last validation loss reduction supports the notion that similar tasks tend to receive positive parameter updates during consistent training intervals. Specifically, AIT and \({T}_{b}\) converged at epochs 341 and 333, corresponding to 47.0% and 46.0% of the total 725 training epochs, respectively. Likewise, LFL and UFL reached their final improvements at epochs 479 and 529—66.0% and 73.0% of training. These tightly grouped convergence points indicate that, despite differences in task label counts and complexity, related tasks tend to converge within similar portions of training, reflecting shared inductive learning dynamics.

Computational cost of training and inference

MTL can offer substantial computational gains whenever multiple downstream tasks share core representational requirements, thanks to parameter sharing in a unified model. This advantage often grows with both the number of tasks and model complexity. In our practical SAF property-prediction scenario, for example, MTL trained 11.5 times faster than the STL baseline while requiring only 6% of the trainable parameters, as shown in Table 2. These figures reflect our specific choice of model architecture, in which approximately 43% of the total parameters lie in the GNN backbone, and each prediction head only accounts for a small fraction of the parameters. Sharing this complex GNN backbone among tasks drastically reduces the overall training cost in MTL; however, a smaller backbone architecture would likely diminish this difference in speed relative to STL.

Despite more frequent checkpointing in ACS, we observed no significant increase in training time compared to MTL-GLC (as shown in Table 2). This result underscores the computational efficiency of ACS’s approach to mitigating negative transfer, even when running multiple training instances. The computational cost of checkpointing results in ~ 17% longer training time for ACS and MTL-GLC compared to MTL, highlighting the utility of low-overhead checkpointing techniques. Notably, molecular property prediction for material design applications typically requires simultaneous estimation of multiple performance indicators (e.g., stability and toxicity)5,6,37, making approaches like ACS especially well-suited for real-world design problems. By leveraging shared representations, such multi-property prediction methods streamline chemical space exploration and accelerate the discovery of viable molecular candidates.

Model architecture

Our framework comprises a shared GNN backbone and separate MLP heads—one head per prediction task. The GNN backbone consists of edge-conditioned convolutional layers38, each followed by a non-linear activation. Edge-conditioned layers incorporate bond information into the node update step, enabling the model to learn both atomic and bond-level features simultaneously.

Downstream of the backbone, each task is associated with a dedicated six-layer MLP that uses a cascading neuron configuration (i.e., hidden-layer sizes decrease progressively with depth). These MLP heads allow for task-specific learning while leveraging the shared latent representation generated by the GNN backbone. An ablation study utilizing a common MLP (matching the total parameter count of the task-specific MLPs) for all targets shows that task-specific MLPs achieve 38.7% higher performance than the common MLP.

Molecular graph construction

We use the PyTorch Geometric library39 to convert molecular SMILES strings into graph-based encodings. Each molecule is represented as a graph whose nodes correspond to atoms and whose edges represent chemical bonds. Node (atomic) features include atomic number, chirality, formal charge, hybridization, aromaticity, and ring membership, among others. Edge (bond) features capture attributes such as bond type and stereochemistry. Table 3 summarizes the complete set of features used for both nodes and edges.

Node features are stored in a feature matrix of size (\(N\times {d}_{{node}}\)), where \(N\) is the number of atoms and \({d}_{{node}}\) is the dimensionality of node features. Similarly, edge features are stored in an edge feature matrix of size (\(E\times {d}_{{edge}}\)), where \(E\) is the number of bonds. By passing these representations through the edge-conditioned convolutional layers, the model learns to aggregate information across nodes and edges in a task-agnostic latent space. Finally, each molecule’s latent representation is funneled into the task-specific MLP heads for final property prediction.

Adaptive checkpointing

Adaptive checkpointing continuously monitors the validation loss for each task and creates a checkpoint whenever a task’s validation loss decreases relative to its previous checkpoint. At these points, the current parameters of the shared backbone and the task-specific head are saved, ensuring that each task retains its best-known parameter state. By isolating these checkpoints, ACS mitigates negative transfer from other tasks in subsequent training steps. Table 4 presents pseudocode summarizing the training procedure.

At the end of the training, each task has an associated pair of backbone and head parameters corresponding to the best observed validation loss for that task. This strategy promotes effective inductive transfer while guarding against NT, ultimately enhancing performance across diverse and potentially imbalanced tasks.

Loss masking for missing values

We implemented a masking scheme (as shown in Fig. 7) within the loss function to maximize the use of training data. This approach selectively incorporates only valid data points, ignoring missing target values, while computing the error between predictions and targets. The final loss is normalized over the total number of target elements, ensuring robustness across varying dataset sizes. Unlike complete-case analysis, this method retains all available data without discarding samples, leading to more effective dataset utilization. Additionally, it mitigates the risk of poor generalizability associated with imputing missing values.

Uncertainty-informed loss function

For the SAF property prediction application, each training sample includes an associated uncertainty value \({\sigma }_{i}\), either sourced directly from experimental records or estimated based on the measurement procedure. To incorporate these uncertainties into model training, we scale the squared error term for each sample by \(\alpha /\left(\alpha + {\sigma }_{i}\,\right)\), where \(\alpha\) is a small-valued user-defined parameter. An \(\alpha\) of 0.1 was found suitable for our SAF dataset. The resulting uncertainty-aware mean squared error \(({{MSE}}_{{UA}})\) for n samples is given by Eq. 2:

$${{MSE}}_{{UA}}=\frac{1}{n}{\sum }_{i-1}^{n}\,{\frac{\alpha }{\alpha + {\sigma }_{i}}{{\cdot }}\, \left({Y}_{i}-{\hat{{{Y}}}}_{i}\right)}^{2}$$

(2)

This formulation penalizes the model less for errors on samples with high uncertainty, preventing noisy measurements from disproportionately influencing parameter updates. An ablation study revealed that incorporating uncertainty in this manner boosted the model’s 5-fold cross-validation performance by approximately 1.6%.

Datasets curation and pre-processing

Benchmark datasets

To illustrate the advantages of ACS and delineate its domain of applicability, we selected a subset of MoleculeNet benchmarks21 —datasets that feature multiple downstream tasks and are tractable for parametric evaluations. The three benchmark datasets which satisfy these requirements—ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21—are described in the subsequent sections.

Each dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets (8:1:1) using Murcko scaffolds22, following standard practice23,24,25,40,41. This scaffold-based strategy ensures structural diversity across the splits, yielding a more robust test of model generalization.

To assess how effectively ACS mitigates negative transfer under varying conditions, we systematically adjusted task imbalance, as defined by Eq. (1), covering a broad range of imbalance scenarios. Concretely, we artificially introduced missing values into the CT_TOX column to achieve the desired level of imbalance, while retaining only a fraction of the overall samples to emulate a smaller dataset. By controlling this factor—ranging from heavily imbalanced, low-data scenarios to relatively balanced, data-rich conditions—we could pinpoint when ACS delivers the greatest benefit and when it remains competitive with conventional MTL and STL.

ClinTox

The ClinTox dataset consists of small molecules labeled according to their outcomes in clinical trials, specifically distinguishing compounds that were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from those that failed due to toxicity issues. It comprises two binary classification tasks: FDA approval status and clinical trial failure due to toxicity. ClinTox presents a relatively small number of labeled molecules (1478) and is fully labeled without missing entries.

SIDER

The SIDER dataset contains marketed drugs annotated with adverse drug reaction information. In its MoleculeNet version, it is formulated as 27 independent binary classification tasks, each indicating whether a compound is associated with a specific side-effect category. The dataset includes 1427 molecules and is fully populated without missing labels.

Tox21

Tox21 is a benchmark dataset derived from the Tox21 initiative, providing chemical compounds evaluated across 12 biological assays related to nuclear receptor signaling and stress response pathways. Each task is a binary classification problem reflecting whether a compound is active or inactive in a given assay. The dataset includes 7,831 molecules, with an overall missing-label rate of approximately 17%.

SAF properties dataset

To validate the practical utility of ACS, we applied it to a real-world scenario involving the prediction of SAF properties. In particular, we curated a dataset of 1379 molecules commonly found in various SAF blends, compiling only experimentally measured or rigorously derived physical and chemical property values. Any records generated by predictive models were excluded to ensure data reliability. As part of a comprehensive screening, we set an upper uncertainty limit of 5% on experimental uncertainty and discarded any entries exceeding this threshold.

The set of SAF properties spans a wide range of physicochemical characteristics relevant to performance, operability, and drop-in compatibility with aviation systems. For example, the LHV strongly influences aircraft payload capacity and travel range, making it critical for flight efficiency. Similarly, the CN is an important certification requirement for assessing a fuel’s resistance to lean blow-out during engine operation42. A detailed description of the prediction tasks and property definitions within the SAF dataset is provided in the Supplementary Information. Due to the high rate of missing labels in the SAF dataset, the 8:1:1 split (train, validation, test) used for the benchmark datasets was not feasible. Instead, we employed a 5-fold CV approach, which provided more robust estimates of model performance while accommodating the inherent sparsity of the SAF data. The coefficient of determination, \({R}^{2}\), was used as a global performance metric to accommodate the variety in physical units across SAF properties.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42004-025-01592-1/MediaObjects/42004_2025_1592_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-07-08 17:06:11.961711

termination of 7 clean energy tax credits in 2025 or 2026

On July 7, 2025, the President issued a related Executive Order (the “BOC Order”) regarding the rapid termination of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar. This client update will focus on the effect of the BBBA and the BOC Order on clean energy tax incentives. For our coverage of the general business tax provisions of the BBBA, click here.

1. Revision to the ITC and PTC

A. Rapid Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Wind and Solar

The eligibility of wind and solar projects for the ITC and PTC is being phased out rapidly. To be eligible for either credit, the wind or solar facility must either

begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA), or

be placed in service prior to January 1, 2028.

B. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Existing IRS guidance provides liberal rules for determining when construction begins for purposes of ITC and PTC phaseouts. Under the existing IRS guidance, a taxpayer can begin construction (“BOC”) by commencing physical work on the project (including certain off-site work on a component of the project) or incurring 5% of the cost of equipment for the project. Under a safe harbor in the existing IRS guidance, a project that begins construction in 2026 can be placed in service as late as December 31, 2030, or in some circumstances even later. However, unlike the beginning of construction principles applicable under the FEOC rules (discussed below), the applicable IRS guidance is not statutorily frozen as of January 1, 2025.

The BOC Order directs that “[w]ithin 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

It seems likely that the new IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order will be more restrictive than existing IRS guidance. The scope and effective date of the new guidance is unknown.

C. Accelerated Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Other Technologies

For technologies other than wind and solar, the BBBA accelerates the phaseout of the ITC and PTC by eliminating the prong of the phaseout that was based upon the year that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall to 25% of 2022 levels. As a result, such projects that begin construction before 2034 will generally be entitled to the full ITC or PTC rate, but those rates will drop to 75% for construction begun in 2034, 50% for construction begun in 2035, and 0% thereafter. The scope of the BOC Order is limited to the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar, so it is not clear to what extent any IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order might apply to other technologies or for other purposes of the ITC or PTC (including, for example, the domestic content or energy community adders).

D. Increased Domestic Content Requirement to Qualify for ITC Adder

Under prior law, the level of domestic content required to qualify for the domestic content adder for the ITC was permanently set at 40% (or 20% for offshore wind), while the percentage required to qualify for the PTC version of the adder increased over time. Under the BBBA, property that began construction before June 16, 2025 will continue to require 40% domestic content; however, projects beginning construction in 2025 after June 16, in 2026, or in a later year must consist of 45%, 50%, or 55% U.S. components, respectively, to qualify for the domestic content adder. These required percentages are lower (20%, 27.5%, and 35%) for offshore wind facilities beginning construction before 2027, then 55% thereafter.

E. PTC Adder for Nuclear Energy Communities

The BBBA expands the energy community credit adder to apply to certain advanced nuclear facilities that claim the PTC, but not to any such facilities that claim the ITC. An “advanced nuclear facility” is defined as any nuclear facility for which either the reactor design was approved after December 31, 1993, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and such a design or a substantially similar one was not approved before such date, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction and issued a site-specific construction permit or combined license. To qualify for the energy community bonus credit on this basis, the advanced nuclear facility must be located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or at any time after December 31, 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power.

F. Leased Systems Formerly Eligible for Section 25D Credit for Solar Water Heating or Wind

The BBBA disallows the ITC and PTC for solar heating property and wind property that qualifies for the homeowner’s credit under section 25D, as in effect prior to its repeal by the BBBA. This disallowance is limited to property that is leased to the homeowner. An earlier version of the BBBA would have extended this disallowance to leased rooftop solar systems, but that provision was not included in the bill as enacted.

G. ITC for Fuel Cells

The BBBA creates a 30% ITC specifically for qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after 2025. This credit is not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but it also does not benefit from other ITC adders. Fuel cells had previously struggled to qualify for the ITC after revisions in the IRA required property for which the credit is claimed to have an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate of no greater than zero. Under the BBBA, fuel cells qualify for the full 30% ITC regardless of technology, fuel type, or greenhouse gas emission profile.

2. Transferability (Sale) of Credits

Section 6418, allowing transfers (sales) of tax credits, has been revised to disallow the transfer of most clean energy tax credits to any entity that is a specified foreign entity (see the discussion of the FEOC rules below). This is an improvement over earlier versions of the bill that would have more broadly phased out the ability to transfer credits.

3. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

A. Phaseout of Credit for Applicable Critical Minerals

Under prior law, the section 45X manufacturing credit for applicable critical minerals had no expiration date. The BBBA adds a phaseout that starts one year later than the pre-existing phaseout for other section 45X eligible components. The full credit rate is available for applicable critical minerals sold before 2031. Applicable critical minerals sold in 2031, 2032, or 2033 will be eligible for 75%, 50%, or 25% respectively of the currently allowable credit. Applicable critical minerals sold after 2033 will not qualify for a credit.

B. New Applicable Critical Mineral Category: Metallurgical Coal

The BBBA creates a separate category of applicable critical minerals for metallurgical coal, defined as coal suitable for use in the production of steel within the meaning of guidance published by the Department of Energy. Metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030, will qualify for a credit of 2.5% of the relevant production costs.

C. Changes to Rules Regarding Other Eligible Components

The credit for production of wind energy components will not apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The phase-out for other eligible components is unchanged.

An additional requirement was added for a component to qualify for the $10 credit for battery modules. The module must be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and battery harnesses, or other essential energy collection equipment.”

D. Reduced Scope of Integrated Component Rule

The BBBA modifies the rule that deems one or more eligible components to be sold to an unrelated person (as required to qualify for the credit) if such eligible components are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into another eligible component that is produced and sold to an unrelated person. Under the BBBA, the integration, incorporation, or assembly into the second eligible component must occur in the same manufacturing facility, at least 65% of the direct materials costs for the second eligible component must be for components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and the credit is unavailable if the second component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a third component. This rule applies to components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

4. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

The credit for carbon capture and sequestration was largely untouched by the BBBA and, in one respect, was significantly enhanced: the credit amount per ton of captured carbon oxide that is used in enhanced oil or gas recovery or for other commercial purposes, such as food and beverage, was increased from the current rate of $60 per ton to $85 per ton, the rate that was previously available only for carbon oxide disposed of by sequestration. This increase in the credit amount is equally available to carbon oxide captured from industrial emissions or direct air capture. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025; carbon capture projects already placed in service would not be able to claim the higher credit amounts for these uses. The requirement that construction of carbon capture projects begin before January 1, 2033, is unchanged. The FEOC rules also apply to the Section 45Q credit as covered below.

5. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The BBBA extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z to fuel sold through December 31, 2029. However, qualifying fuels produced after December 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Under prior law, there had been a question as to whether certain production processes could be considered to have a negative emissions rate for most fuels by resulting in an enhanced credit amount. The BBBA explicitly rules out application of a negative emissions rate by providing that, for purposes of determining the emissions factor, qualifying fuels may not be treated as having an emissions rate of less than zero. However, the BBBA offers a significant exception to this prohibition in allowing biofuels derived from animal manure (which is the fuel category most commonly assigned a negative emissions rate) to have a negative emissions rate. In a blow to the sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) industry, the BBBA reduces the per gallon credit for SAF from $1.75 to the amount available to other transportation fuels of $1.00, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. As with other credits, these changes are in addition to the limitations under the FEOC rules covered below.

6. Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

The BBBA accelerates the date by which clean hydrogen production projects must begin construction to December 31, 2027. This is considered a win for the sector after earlier versions of the BBBA would have required a 2025 beginning of construction date. The sector also benefits from the continued availability of the investment tax credit for hydrogen storage, compression and liquefaction equipment under section 48E and, as discussed above, the investment tax credit for hydrogen fuel cell property.

7. Termination of Other Clean Energy Credits

The BBBA significantly accelerates the end date for various tax credits relating to the acquisition of clean energy-related property. These credits, and the new applicable end dates, are as follows:

Section 25E Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit—property must be placed in service by December 31, 2025;

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit—expenditures must be incurred by December 31, 2025;

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit—property must be placed in service by June 30, 2026;

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit—home must be purchased by June 30, 2026; and

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction—property must begin construction by June 30, 2026.

8. Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)

With the exception of the Section 45V credit for hydrogen production, all IRA tax credits that survive beyond 2026 are subject to disallowance under new FEOC rules if the taxpayer, facility, or product has impermissible connections to China or other disfavored countries or entities. The FEOC rules may disallow the relevant tax credit to a “specified foreign entity,” a “foreign-influenced entity,” or an entity that receives “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity.” Each of those terms has a complex definition, as described below. The particular rules that apply, and the effective date of those rules, varies from credit to credit, as set forth in the table below.

A. Prohibited Foreign Entities, Specified Foreign Entities, and Foreign-Influenced Entities

1. Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)

A “prohibited foreign entity” (“PFE”) is defined as either a “specified foreign entity” (“SFE”) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (“FIE”).

2. Specified Foreign Entities (SFE)

An SFE is defined as a “foreign-controlled entity” (“FCE”) or an entity designated as a bad actor under certain existing statutes, including designation as a “foreign entity of concern,” a “designated foreign terrorist organization,” or a “Chinese military company operating in the United States.” An FCE is defined as any of (i) the government of a covered nation (including any level of government below the national level and any agency or instrumentality thereof), (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs. A “covered nation” is any of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

3. Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIE)

An entity is an FIE if it satisfies either

a direct control test for the current tax year, or

with respect to the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit, an “effective control” test for the preceding tax year.

Under the direct control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if (i) a single SFE has the direct authority to appoint a board member, executive level officer, or person with similar powers or responsibilities, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs. Special rules apply for determining whether a publicly traded entity is an FIE.

Under the effective control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE pursuant to an agreement that entitles the SFE or a related party to exercise effective control over (i) a facility with respect to which the ITC or PTC may be available or (ii) the production of an “eligible component” under the section 45X manufacturing credit. The statute sets forth thirteen different powers, any one of which alone will constitute “effective control.” These powers generally relate to power over operations or output of a facility, including exclusive control over a critical system within the facility. Six of those specified powers are operative immediately; seven of those specified powers are only relevant to the extent provided in regulations to be issued in the future. The BOC Order directs that “within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

B. Material Assistance Rules for ITC, PTC, and Section 45X Manufacturing Credit

1. General Rules

A taxpayer is not entitled to claim the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit with respect to property with respect to which it receives “material assistance” from a PFE. Whether “material assistance” has been received is determined by comparing the “material assistance cost ratio” for such property to a “threshold percentage.”

The material assistance cost ratio (“Cost Ratio”) of a qualified facility (under the ITC or PTC) or energy storage technology (under the ITC) is the ratio of (i) the total costs attributable to manufactured products (as defined for purposes of the domestic content adder) incorporated upon completion of construction excluding costs of products that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total costs attributable to manufactured products incorporated upon completion of construction. The Cost Ratio for a facility that produces eligible components under the section 45X manufacturing credit is the ratio of (i) the total direct costs that are paid or incurred for the production of an eligible component excluding costs paid or incurred for production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total direct costs paid or incurred for the production of the eligible component.

Threshold percentages are established by statute and vary by the type of property with respect to which a credit is being claimed and the year in which such property begins construction or is sold. Generally, the threshold percentages range from 40% to 95% and increase over time.

The BBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026, which will identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or total direct material costs of any eligible component which are attributable to a PFE and provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s material assistance from a PFE. As noted above, the BOC Order directs Treasury to provide guidance regarding FEOC matters within 45 days of the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA. Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on tables issued in guidance on the domestic content adder (Notice 2025-08) and certifications provided by suppliers under penalty of perjury stating that property or direct material costs were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For purposes of the ITC and PTC, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, for use in a facility that begins construction before August 1, 2025 and is placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities), will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

For purposes of the section 45X manufacturing credit, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and used in a product sold before January 1, 2027 will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

2. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Within the definitions of a PFE and “material assistance,” the BBBA directly incorporates IRS Notice 2013-29 and subsequent related guidance addressing the beginning of construction of a project or facility for tax purposes, as in effect on January 1, 2025. The narrow context (PFE and material assistance) in which the BBBA adopts the BOC principles in effect on January 1, 2025, suggests that this “freeze” of BOC guidance as of January 1, 2025, does not apply in any other context. That appears to be the theory underlying the President’s direction to Treasury in the BOC Order to provide “new and revised” guidance regarding the meaning of “beginning of construction” for purposes of the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar.

3. Penalties and Statute of Limitations

The FEOC rules impose new or harsher penalties relating to the material assistance rule and a longer statute of limitations for IRS examination of material assistance issues.

A taxpayer that claims a credit which is later disallowed due to an IRS adjustment to the Cost Ratio of the underlying property may be liable for a substantial understatement penalty on understatements of tax greater than 1% of the true tax liability, as opposed to the normal 10%.

A supplier who makes a certification under the material assistance rules that it knows or reasonably should have known is false will generally be required to pay a penalty of 10% of the resulting underpayment of tax by its customer.

The period during which the IRS may assess additional tax for an error relating to material assistance from a PFE is extended to six years.

4. ITC Recapture Rule for FEOC Effective Control Payments

A taxpayer will be subject to recapture of 100% of the ITC claimed with respect to a property if within 10 years after the property is placed in service it makes a payment that would be deemed to provide an SFE with “effective control” over the taxpayer as described above. This rule applies to property placed in service in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

5. Summary of Application of FEOC Rules to Surviving Tax Credits

The table below summarizes the applicability of the FEOC rules disallowing tax credits to specified foreign entities, foreign-influenced entities and taxpayers who receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Credit Restrictions on SFEs Restrictions on FIEs Restrictions on Property with Material Assistance from a PFE Section 45Q—Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Section 45Y—Clean Electricity Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities do not include any facility the construction of which includes material assistance from a PFE, and which begins construction after December 31, 2025. Section 45Z—Clean Fuel Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 48E—Clean Electricity Investment Credit

No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology do not include property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025, if such construction includes material assistance from a PFE.

In addition to the time pressure to implement begun construction strategies and understand the implications of the FEOC rules, the BBBA creates a number of significant changes to existing tax credits, as well as adding new uncertainties for credit qualification, which may affect tax equity and transferability strategies. We at Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in these and other clean energy tax incentive matters.

Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 globally. In Porto Alegre, Brazil, traffic-related fatalities have surged, with 84 people losing their lives in 2024, the highest rate in seven years.

In light of this issue, Fundação Thiago de Moraes Gonzaga, Translab and iRAP, with support from FedEx Brazil, launched the “Safe Pathways to Schools” project. This initiative focuses on improving road safety for students by engaging the school community, assessing school road infrastructure with Star Rating for Schools (SR4S), implementing tactical urbanism and advocating for permanent improvements and reduced speeds.

The school zone selected for the project is E.M.E.E.F Prof. Elyseu Paglioli, located in the Cristal neighborhood of Porto Alegre. This school supports children and adolescents with disabilities, many of whom have mobility challenges. The area buzzes with foot traffic, surrounded by two other schools, a daycare, a health center, homes, and shops, all adding to the presence of vulnerable road users.

In addition to enhancing child road safety, the project incorporates green elements into its tactical urbanism approach, potentially providing vital environmental and social benefits such as water purification, recreational spaces, and climate resilience, especially relevant after Porto Alegre’s historic flood in May 2024. FedEx Brazil volunteers will also play a key role in supporting the implementation of these interventions.

The country’s challenge is not a lack of technology, capital, or ambition. It’s a gap in policy architecture. Without bankable demand, Australia’s most promising clean commodity projects – green iron, sustainable aviation fuel, and clean ammonia – remain stuck at the starting line.

To meet that challenge, we propose a new demand-side policy model: the Clean Commodities Trading Initiative (CCTI) – a flagship example of green energy statecraft. At its heart is a new tool for national transformation: Clean Commodity Credits that reward innovation and emissions savings.

A market-friendly mechanism to kickstart large-scale clean production.

Green energy statecraft is a strategic approach to governance that uses the clean energy transition to simultaneously advance a nation’s economic, environmental, social, and geostrategic goals. Unlike conventional industry policy, which focuses on domestic market corrections, statecraft treats clean energy as key to national security and prosperity – used to build alliances, secure supply chains, boost productivity, and shape global rules.

The European Union, China, Japan, and South Korea are all pursuing variations of green energy statecraft. Australia must do the same – on its own terms, with tools suited to its advantages, institutions, and budget.

The CCTI is the tool for our times.

The CCTI is a market-friendly mechanism to kickstart large-scale clean production. Its core function is simple: government acts as an early buyer of clean commodities – not to stockpile goods, but to create the conditions for investment. Clean production projects face long lead times and high capital costs. But their biggest barrier is price uncertainty. Firms can’t justify investment if they don’t know whether the market will pay a green premium to offset higher costs. The CCTI removes that uncertainty. It contracts with producers to buy a baseline volume at agreed floor prices. These offtake agreements give developers and financiers the confidence to proceed.

But the real innovation lies in what happens next.

Upon purchasing clean commodities such as green iron, the CCTI would decouple the physical products from their clean attributes by creating Clean Commodity Credits, or Innovation Credits, since the clean attributes reflect not just lower emissions but innovation in production. This dual-market approach allows the physical commodities to be sold in conventional markets while the credits are banked or traded later.

A clean commodity contains two price components: the base cost of the commodity; and the cost of producing it with low emissions. This second factor – the “green premium” – raises prices above conventional alternatives. Clean Commodity Credits solve that problem. They let clean commodities enter traditional markets without the higher price tag. Meanwhile, the CCTI can offset its support costs by monetising the credits in flexible ways. As we argue in our new paper, it could:

Bank credits for future sale as regulatory markets mature

Sell credits into voluntary markets to recover costs

Create bundled products combining physical commodities with clean attributes

This flexibility allows the CCTI to adapt as markets evolve, maximising taxpayer value while supporting market development.

In effect, these credits create bankable demand for green innovation. They send a clear price signal – not just for carbon, but for the kinds of technologies, processes, and business models that will define the clean economy. They give governments a strategic mechanism to stimulate private investment and build advantage in future-facing sectors.

If Australia continues to rely on patchwork subsidies and fragmented supply-side measures, it will fall behind.

Traditional carbon markets, while important, work by penalising emissions. But in heavy industry, where low-carbon alternatives are still emerging, penalties alone often aren’t enough to drive change. Establishing a market for these credits flips the model. Instead of punishing laggards, it rewards leaders. Governments can set clean production targets – say, 30 per cent green steel by 2030 – and let firms meet them by innovating or buying credits from early movers. It creates a race to the top, not just a drag on the bottom line.

This model rewards firms that act now with firm demand at a price that justifies production – not in 2030 when carbon prices bite or regulation finally arrives. And it allows government to recover its support as credit markets develop. Once established, the same principle can apply to any product the government deems strategic, regardless of its carbon value. Thus Innovation Credits may be the better name.

Japan and South Korea, two of Australia’s key trading partners, seek long-term access to clean industrial inputs they cannot produce domestically. Australia, with its renewable energy resources and export capacity, is a natural partner. By embedding Clean Commodity or Innovation Credits into trade relationships – through joint offtake agreements, shared credit markets, or co-investment in CCTI-backed facilities – Australia can deepen economic ties and build geopolitical resilience. This is green energy statecraft in action: aligning clean industry development with alliance-building and regional stability.

The energy transition is a global race. Other countries are moving decisively. If Australia continues to rely on patchwork subsidies and fragmented supply-side measures, it will fall behind. The CCTI offers a smarter, faster, and more strategic path forward. It reflects the kind of governance Australia now needs: bold, integrated, efficient, and effective.

Carbon capture and clean fuels The bill tightens conditions for Section 45Q tax credits for carbon capture.","The signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB Act) by President Donald Trump on 4 July marks a pivotal shift in the United States’ climate and energy trajectory.

The sweeping legislation dismantles much of the clean energy incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while expanding support for fossil fuel activities.

The act radically alters tax credit timelines and access, setting off a rush among developers to start construction before new deadlines in 2025 and 2026.

As the US exits international climate commitments and rolls back green energy support, local governments, clean tech firms and sustainability advocates face heightened uncertainty.

Stepping back from clean energy commitments

Under the new legislation, technology-neutral tax credits for power and storage projects are set to decline steeply.

Solar and wind projects that begin construction by 31 December 2025 can avoid new restrictions, such as those targeting Chinese equipment under the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules.

Projects that start by 4 July 2026 are exempt from a hard deadline to be in service by the end of 2027, but any that fail to start by then must be operational by 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

The tax credit phase-outs are stark: after 2027, wind and solar projects lose access to both the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) unless they meet stringent conditions.

According to Princeton University, this rollback could reduce new wind and solar capacity by 70 GW by 2030, raising household energy costs by US$165 per year and slashing emissions reductions from a target of 40% to just 3%.

Charging infrastructure at risk

The EV sector is hit particularly hard.

The Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (Section 45W), which provided US$7,500 to US$40,000 per vehicle, is repealed for vehicles acquired after 30 September 2025.

This change affects electrification efforts across municipal fleets, including school buses, public works vehicles and police cars.

Similarly, the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit, supporting EV and hydrogen charging stations, is phased out for installations not in service by 30 June 2026.

This undermines efforts to build out the charging networks necessary to support growing electric mobility.

On the consumer side, incentives like the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Tax Credit and Section 25E Used Clean Vehicle Credit will also expire in September 2025.

Princeton analysis estimates this could result in eight million fewer EVs sold this decade.

Hydrogen and fuel cells

Hydrogen sees its own deadline advance.

Projects must now be under construction by the end of 2027 to qualify for the Section 45V hydrogen production credit of up to US$3/kg – five years earlier than under the IRA.

Fuel cell projects, however, gain an exemption from emissions tests and labour requirements to qualify for a 30% ITC, but only if construction begins after 2025.

Unfortunately, those starting in 2025 fall into a legislative gap, qualifying for neither legacy nor new credits.

Energy storage and geothermal

Battery storage and geothermal projects retain tax credit access at full value through 2033, phasing down in 2034 and 2035.

However, like solar and wind, these technologies face compliance with FEOC rules from January 2026.

Given China’s dominance in battery supply chains, navigating these restrictions will be challenging.

Geothermal may fare better due to a more domestic supply base, making it a more viable option for municipalities looking to deploy low-carbon heating and cooling systems.

Legal complexity

FEOC provisions bar projects and companies from claiming tax credits if they rely heavily on Chinese equipment, financing or technology agreements that amount to “effective control” by foreign entities of concern (including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea).

While the rules officially take effect in 2026, their lack of clarity is already causing anxiety among developers.

Taxpayers and local governments alike must now trace supply chains more rigorously than ever, or risk losing tax credit eligibility.

Carbon capture and clean fuels

The bill tightens conditions for Section 45Q tax credits for carbon capture.

Projects must now meet narrower definitions and avoid ties to foreign entities.

Credit values remain at US$85 per tonne for permanent sequestration and US$60 for reuse, but scope is limited.

Section 45Z clean fuel tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable fuels are extended through 2029, though SAF credits drop to US$1/gal from 2026.

Fuel feedstocks must come exclusively from North America, and complex accounting rules block credits for fuels already benefiting from other tax incentives.

Residential and community impact

The OBBB Act repeals several residential clean energy incentives, including:

Section 25D rooftop solar credits, ending 31 December 2025

Section 25C home energy efficiency credits, ending 31 December 2025

Section 179D commercial efficiency deductions, ending 30 June 2026

Section 45L new energy-efficient home credits, also ending 30 June 2026.

Without these, local homeowners and businesses lose incentives to invest in decarbonisation.

Hungarian based airline Wizz Air has released its sustainability report for the financial year ending 31 March 2025.

The airline announced its decarbonisation roadmap outlining its path to achieve net zero emissions in international aviation by 2050.

“As we reflect on the past year, we are pleased to share the significant strides we have made on our journey towards sustainability and innovation,” says Charlotte Andsager, Chair of the Sustainability and Culture Committee, Wizz Air.

“Once again, Wizz Air has proven itself to be at the forefront of sustainability compared to competitors.

“The Company’s commitment to excellence has been recognised through numerous accolades and groundbreaking initiatives, setting new benchmarks in CO₂ intensity in the aviation industry.”

What is Wizz Air doing to be sustainable?

In the past financial year, Wizz Air avoided 144,882 tonnes of CO₂ emissions through 47 fuel-efficiency initiatives.

According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, Wizz Airs’ CO₂ emissions intensity is the lowest in the industry at 52 grams per passenger/km, with a target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions intensity by 2030.

Sustainability related performance schemes for the CEO and management team are in place to make leadership accountable for ESG progress.

Wizz Air have taken on more than 321 neo aircrafts – with a growth plan for 500 aircrafts by 2030 – which have up to 20% better per seat fuel efficiency than previous models and the capability of using a 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend.

Wizz Air has done trials using sustainable aviation fuel blend on its flights and is working towards using a 10% blend by 2030.

Dorottya Durucsko, Head of Government Affairs and Sustainability at Wizz Air says: “At Wizz Air, we regard ESG objectives not as marketing rhetoric, but as a fundamental business imperative.”

“We are investing where it counts: in new technologies, in SAF production capabilities and in smarter operations, while avoiding strategies that lack proven impact,” Dorottya continues.

“Our goal is not only to remain one of the most efficient carriers in the world, but to set a standard for how low fare aviation can evolve responsibly.”

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

SAF is an alternative to traditional jet fuel that is made from renewable or waste derived sources.

It can significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions, potentially offering a 70-80% reduction on a lifecycle basis

The fuel is a “drop-in” method, as it can be blended with conventional jet fuel and is used in existing aircrafts without modifications.

In just about every sector, there’s a promising new green initiative. From resorts with coveted carbon-neutral statuses to airlines allowing passengers to donate more to carbon-emission-relieving projects to locally sourced menus at restaurants to underwater sculpture parks that regrow coral reefs, travelers today have more options than ever before when it comes to sustainability.

The creative ideas are there—and they’re abundant, scientifically sound, and constantly being refined and optimized.

That being said, travel infrastructure isn’t always up-to-snuff. Sustainability projects, as much as I love them and as much as other travelers are demanding them, must be operationally feasible.

As of 2025, many hospitality groups and travel companies are playing catch-up to make their practices, operations, and products more sustainable.

But some are actually ahead of the curve, providing a clear framework for ongoing sustainability measures that other groups can adopt.

Enter Pittsburgh Airport, one of the US’s most quietly sustainable travel hubs. A few years back, it opted to go green with on-site clean energy generation. Now, it’s taking things even further with plans to launch a sustainable aviation fuel refinery on-site.

Pittsburgh Airport goes green in 2021

Back in 2021, Pittsburgh Airport announced plans to create an on-site microgrid that would provide all the energy necessary to run the airport. Since it went live, the microgrid has used a solar panel facility and natural gas-fired generators that fully power the nearly 9,000-acre Pittsburgh Airport property.

Thanks to a private and publicly funded partnership between IMG Energy Solutions, Peoples Gas, and the Allegheny County Airport Authority, Pittsburgh Airport has run almost entirely on sustainable forms of energy. That means it uses the traditional grid as a backup.

For fans of sustainability, that’s a huge coup. But even if you couldn’t care less about green initiatives in the travel world, it’s still a commendable act.

Remember earlier this year when Heathrow Airport was thrown into chaos due to a power grid problem in London? What about a similar blackout in Portugal and Spain? Airports with sustainable, on-site power grids don’t need to worry about blackouts from the traditional grid.

Plans for an on-site refinery are taking shape

Pittsburgh Airport’s impressive microgrid has since influenced new projects for major hubs like JFK and Houston International Airport. But that project took off in 2021, meaning Pittsburgh Airport staff have had plenty of time to start innovating in other directions.

Their latest idea? Take that microgrid innovation and apply it toward on-site aviation fuel refineries. With a sterling reputation for improving green aviation operations, Pittsburgh Airport has been able to attract investors and partners.

Specifically, with the clean fuel-based company Avina, which will turn alcohol into aviation fuel using a Houston-based firm called KBR.

This type of fuel is known as sustainable aviation fuel (aka SAF). It’s a biofuel that has a much lower carbon footprint and can be mixed with traditional jet fuel. But it’s not totally carbon neutral; most sources say that it could be as much as 80% more efficient.

(If you want to learn more about SAF, you can explore this handy summary from the International Air Transport Association.)

The on-site refinery should produce around 120 million gallons of sustainable fuel each year, around 70 million of which would be used by the airport, according to airport CEO Christina Cassotis. The rest would be sold and shipped off-site.

Currently, Cassotis and company are working to generate more funds from another investment round before finalizing plans for the SAF refinery. Additionally, Pittsburgh Airport will be opening a new central terminal this autumn. Further SAF refinery announcements are expected around that time.",https://www.travelawaits.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/TA.favicon.white_.260.png?fit=32%2C32,N,,2025-07-08 16:10:05.858468

“If finalized, these RVOs would unlock investments, create jobs, and support growth in rural America by expanding our country’s renewable fuel production and use,” said Skor. “By setting conventional biofuel blending volumes at 15 billion gallons for two years, this proposal will create the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. This is the strongest RFS proposal we’ve ever seen, with the highest volumes ever, showing this administration’s commitment to American biofuel producers and the farmers that depend on them.”

Skor also urged EPA to make it clear that small refinery exemptions (SREs) will not be granted recklessly, and that any gallons lost to SREs will be made up in the market.

“Only with these pieces in place can this proposal truly deliver the game-changing impact the president wants it to have, and that the nation’s biofuel producers and rural communities are counting on,” she added.

GHG Reduction Targets: ESMA commits to reducing its gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 15.4% by 2027 and 31.4% by 2030, using 2023 as the base year.

Operational Focus: Key emission sources—business travel, energy consumption, and food—will be addressed through targeted internal policies and decarbonization levers.

Annual Monitoring: Progress will be disclosed annually via ESMA’s Annual Report and Environmental Statement, with future revisions adjusting to external changes and data improvements.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has released its first Climate Transition Plan, marking a strategic shift to align its internal operations with the EU’s long-term climate goals and the Paris Agreement. With this initiative, ESMA targets climate neutrality by 2050 and sets interim GHG reduction goals of 15.4% by 2027 and 31.4% by 2030 compared to its 2023 emissions baseline.

“In 2023, ESMA base year emissions amounted to 457.1 tCO2e, mainly resulting from staff business travel, energy and food consumption,” the agency noted in the report.

The plan outlines a series of internal actions, including the introduction of an annual GHG emissions budget for air travel, optimising energy usage by closing underutilised office floors, and promoting lower-carbon food options in staff canteens and catering services.

RELATED ARTICLE: ESMA Introduces Measures to Enhance Corporate Sustainability Reporting

“Our plan is a demonstration of commitment,” said Natasha Cazenave, ESMA’s Executive Director. “As market participants step up to implement their transition strategies, we must hold ourselves to the same standards.”

Approximately 72% of ESMA’s 2027 reduction target could be achieved through actions under its direct control—such as switching long-haul flights from business to premium economy, implementing energy-saving measures, and changing catering orders to reduce their carbon footprint.

To maintain progress toward its 2030 target, ESMA acknowledges that greater reliance will be needed on external stakeholders. These include landlords for decarbonising the energy supply, catering providers for adjusting meal offerings, and broader changes in aviation industry practices.

Financial analysis within the plan suggests possible annual savings between €85,000 and €120,000 by 2030, stemming from lower travel costs, energy efficiency, and reduced office rental space.

While ESMA may consider carbon credits or Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) certificates in the future, it emphasizes that gross GHG emission reductions are the priority in the short-to-medium term.

“The need for a revision of this TP will be considered on a regular basis,” the plan notes. “Such revisions may lead to adjustments to ambition and actions planned, especially where external factors have caused delay or where mitigation outcomes were overestimated.”

Implementation and oversight will fall under the purview of ESMA’s Executive Director and Management Board, supported by the Eco-management Steering Committee. Data quality management and performance indicators will guide ongoing assessments.

Cazenave added, “Balancing our climate objectives with our ability to deliver on our mission will require careful judgement. But we are confident that, with the engagement of our staff and suppliers, we can make meaningful progress.”

This plan supports ESMA’s broader mission under the European Green Deal and aligns with sustainability directives such as the CSRD and CSDDD, offering a model for other EU bodies in operational climate governance.

The insights from the study provide a robust framework for future SAF development, particularly in the design and optimization of catalysts for higher ketone production from renewable resources.","The catalytic conversion of fermentation-derived short-chained oxygenates into longer-chained hydrocarbons offers a promising solution to obtain sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with a low carbon footprint and maximum utilization of renewable resources. This study explores the alkylation of acetone-butanol (AB) mixtures using Pd supported on high-surface area materials with varying inherent properties, aiming to optimize selectivity toward higher ketones. To elucidate the nature of the active catalyst, all synthesized catalysts were thoroughly characterized and tested under the optimized reaction conditions for the AB alkylation. A 5 wt % Pd/MgO-HS (HS: high surface) catalyst was found to exhibit the highest selectivity (81%) for 6-undecanone, C11(═O), which was attributed to an optimal balance of catalytically active sites and surface properties. Despite the absence of Pd leaching, the catalyst showed reduced activity in consecutive reaction runs. Comprehensive analysis of the spent catalyst identified the primary cause to be a transformation of the MgO support to MgKPO4 in the presence of the K3PO4 base additive under the reaction conditions. The restructuring of the catalyst support led to entrapment of the accessible Pd sites, reducing their availability for catalytic reactions.

The scale of this shift is staggering. According to the latest Global Project Tracker from the Mission Possible Partnership, sunbelt countries now account for 30% of the world’s planned clean industrial projects, with the MENAT region alone representing 20% of the global ammonia pipeline.

From Saudi Arabia to Oman, governments are investing billions in green hydrogen infrastructure, clean fuel export hubs, and ammonia synthesis facilities, aiming to leverage their natural advantage of abundant solar energy into global economic strength in a net-zero world.

The implications for aviation and other hard-to-abate sectors are huge. Green ammonia is rapidly becoming a keystone of the global clean fuel economy. It can be used directly as a maritime fuel, converted back to hydrogen for industrial or power use, or serve as a building block for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In this sense, the Middle East’s rise as a clean ammonia powerhouse could help fuel the decarbonisation of flight far beyond its own borders.

Cost advantage meets market demand

The economics are aligning in the region’s favour. BloombergNEF projects that countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Brazil will see green ammonia production costs drop below those of grey ammonia by 2035, driven by falling renewable energy and electrolyser prices.

The Middle East’s renewable electricity is already among the cheapest in the world, and its large-scale infrastructure capacity gives it a head start on global competition. These advantages are bolstered by increasing international interest in offtake agreements, particularly from Europe and Asia, where domestic hydrogen production is either too expensive or lacks sufficient renewable capacity.

Yet this story of opportunity also comes with real-world constraints. Despite the promising pipeline, over $775 billion worth of announced projects in sunbelt EMDEs (Emerging Markets and Developing Economies), progress remains sluggish. Over the past six months, only one clean industrial project in the entire Sunbelt region has reached a final investment decision. Many others are stalled in pre-investment limbo, awaiting the certainty that only long-term offtake agreements, policy frameworks, and investment guarantees can provide.

Turning policy into progress

This is where government policy will play a decisive role. If the Middle East wants to transition from potential to production, it will need to offer more than natural advantage. It must build the policy certainty and financial instruments that will convert announcements into real plants and long-term partnerships. That means national mandates for clean fuels, clearer export regulations, carbon pricing mechanisms, and public funding for early-stage projects.

Equally important is the question of domestic demand. While much of the region’s clean fuel vision is export-oriented, supplying European, Korean, and Japanese markets, building a local clean fuel economy would offer resilience and scale. Integrating green hydrogen and SAF into national aviation, energy, and heavy industry sectors would not only decarbonise domestic operations but also create the steady baseline demand needed to attract investment at scale.

The global payoff could be transformative. With sufficient investment and infrastructure, clean ammonia produced in the Gulf could be shipped to Rotterdam, reconverted into hydrogen, and used to power European industry or aircraft. This could reduce Europe’s reliance on fossil-based imports and position the Middle East as a clean energy trade partner, rather than just a supplier of fossil fuels. Such trade corridors, or green energy highways, could become the backbone of the future global energy economy.

Ultimately, the clean industrial revolution will not be won by technology alone, but by a combination of geography, policy, and leadership. The Middle East has the first two. Now it must deliver the third. With the world watching and the climate clock ticking, the region has a unique opportunity to define its post-oil future.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/07/08/rajiv-bajaj-i4QIqfcTkN8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 11:07:42.863443

This initiative, combining traditional hydrocarbon refining with advanced biofuels and circular economy projects, positions Petrobras as a bridge between Brazil's oil dominance and the growing demand for low-carbon energy solutions. For investors, the question is clear: Does this strategic pivot also present an undervalued stock opportunity?

The Strategic Play: Refining for a Low-Carbon Future

The Rio de Janeiro expansion targets two critical energy transition pillars: biofuel production and carbon reduction efficiency. Key highlights include:

1. Bio Jet Fuel Plant: A dedicated facility at the Boaventura Complex will produce 19,000 barrels per day (bpd) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), directly addressing the aviation sector's decarbonization needs.

2. Bio-Refining Synergies: The Reduc refinery's tests with renewable diesel blends (e.g., Diesel R7) and its new thermal power plant (replacing outdated equipment) reduce emissions while improving operational efficiency.

3. Circular Economy Projects: A re-refining initiative to convert used oil into lubricants (6.3 thousand bpd capacity) exemplifies Petrobras' move toward waste-to-value models, aligning with global sustainability trends.

These projects are not just incremental upgrades—they're a repositioning of Petrobras as a provider of both traditional and renewable energy solutions, leveraging Brazil's abundant agricultural feedstock for biofuels.

Valuation: A Stock Trading at a Discount to Its Transition Potential

While Petrobras' stock (PBR) has long been overshadowed by geopolitical risks and legacy liabilities, its current valuation metrics suggest a compelling entry point.

Forward P/E: Petrobras trades at 4.98x, significantly below Exxon (XOM, 15.2x) and Chevron (CVX, 14.8x). This reflects undervaluation relative to its earnings growth potential from refining upgrades and biofuel synergies.

EV/EBITDA: At 4.05x, Petrobras is cheaper than the global oil majors' average of ~8x, underscoring its operational leverage in Brazil's energy ecosystem.

Free Cash Flow (FCF): With an FCF yield of 27%, Petrobras generates capital far exceeding its valuation, a rare trait in an industry facing capital discipline pressures.

Analysts are bullish: A consensus ""Strong Buy"" rating with a 40% upside to $17.97 highlights the gap between current pricing and future earnings potential.

The Risks: Navigating Debt and Dividend Sustainability

No investment is without risks. Petrobras' 274% payout ratio (dividends exceeding earnings) raises concerns about dividend sustainability if oil prices fall or projects underperform. Additionally, its debt-to-equity ratio (0.93)—though manageable—requires scrutiny.

However, Petrobras' $85 billion debt cap and focus on free cash flow reinvestment mitigate these risks. The company's ability to secure low-cost financing in Brazil and its dominant market position further insulate it from immediate liquidity threats.

Why Investors Should Look Past Near-Term Concerns

The energy transition isn't a binary choice between oil and renewables—it's a gradual shift where refiners like Petrobras play a critical role. By investing in biofuels and efficiency, Petrobras is future-proofing its refining assets against obsolescence.

Key catalysts for upside include:

1. Regulatory Tailwinds: Brazil's push for renewable energy mandates and carbon pricing will boost demand for Petrobras' biofuel projects.

2. Cost Discipline: The company's focus on CAPEX alignment with cash flow and debt reduction targets ($65 billion by 2029) reduces execution risks.

3. Geopolitical Leverage: As global oil markets tighten, Petrobras' control of Brazil's pre-salt reserves and refining capacity provides a moat against competitors.

Investment Thesis and Recommendation

Petrobras' $6 billion Rio de Janeiro expansion is more than a refinery upgrade—it's a strategic reallocation of capital toward low-carbon growth. With valuation multiples at historic lows and a dividend yield of 13.9%, the stock offers a rare blend of income and capital appreciation potential.

Buy the dip: Investors should consider initiating a position in PBR at current levels, with a target price of $18 (40% upside) and a stop-loss below $10 to account for oil price volatility.

While risks like high payout ratios and geopolitical uncertainty linger, Petrobras' alignment with energy transition trends and its undervalued metrics make it a compelling long-term bet.

The legislation—referred to by industry leaders as the “Big Beautiful Bill”—extends key incentives and restores critical tax credits aimed at reviving the domestic biodiesel industry. It has brought much-needed optimism to producers across the state, many of whom had idled plants or reduced operations due to market instability in 2025.

Monte Shaw, Executive Director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA), said the bill comes at a crucial time. “Countries around the world and many of our states are demanding ultra-low carbon fuels,” he said. “This bill helps open the door for the investments needed to produce those fuels here at home, using North American feedstocks.”

The legislation extends the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit through 2029, allows for the transfer of the credit, and reinstates the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit through 2026—raising its value to 20 cents per gallon.

Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board (IBB), said the renewed support is especially critical for small, independent producers. “This is a vital lifeline to biodiesel plants across Iowa. We’re grateful to Senator Chuck Grassley for championing this provision,” he said.

He also praised the bill for prioritizing North American feedstocks and eliminating penalties tied to indirect land use change—two changes that could significantly benefit soybean farmers and biodiesel plants alike. “For producers who’ve been idled or operating below capacity since the start of the year, this sends a strong, hopeful signal about the road ahead,” Kimberley added.

However, industry leaders expressed concern over the bill’s changes to incentives for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The credit for SAF production was reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 per gallon, and technical adjustments now make it harder for producers using ethanol as a feedstock to qualify for the credit. SAF is seen as a key future market, potentially reaching 100 billion gallons annually by 2050.

Given that many of the 45Z tax credit changes don’t take effect until 2026, IBB is urging the U.S. Treasury to quickly issue clear rules and guidance for how the credit will be implemented in both 2025 and beyond.

The bill is expected to restore momentum in Iowa’s biofuel sector, offering new hope to producers and farmers alike after a year of deep uncertainty.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Biodiesel-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 11:08:04.094829

This new platform directly connects airlines seeking SAF with producers offering supply, streamlining negotiations and accelerating the adoption of SAF across the aviation industry.

The SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical challenges in the SAF market: Efficiency: By providing a centralised, no-fee platform, the Matchmaker simplifies and speeds up the procurement process, reducing costs and administrative burdens for airlines. This efficiency is expected to stimulate growth in the voluntary SAF market.

Secondly, the platform allows SAF producers to post available or planned fuel volumes, while airlines can register their demand. This direct matching mechanism facilitates better alignment of supply and demand, with final trade negotiations conducted offline.

Also, the comprehensive data on SAF offerings—including volume, feedstock, production technology, emissions reductions, and compliance with international standards such as CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive—ensures transparency and informed decision-making.

IATA’s senior vice president, Sustainability and Chief Economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, emphasised the platform’s strategic role in achieving aviation’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. She stated, “To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

Hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub—a centralised digital space for aviation energy management—the SAF Matchmaker supports both spot purchases and long-term offtake agreements. Initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers, the platform is expected to expand access to other buyers, such as non-aviation corporations, further broadening the market.

This innovation marks a significant step toward decarbonising air travel by facilitating easier access to sustainable fuels, which can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. By enhancing market transparency and connectivity, the SAF Matchmaker is poised to accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources and support global climate goals.

With a Middle East crisis once again roiling global oil markets, a new report shows that American-made ethanol keeps gasoline prices down—saving drivers well over $50 billion each year, or 39 cents per gallon.

“As our nation again prepares to celebrate its freedom on July Fourth, this report demonstrates the enormous value of American-made ethanol in promoting energy independence,” said Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “The United States is producing record volumes of crude oil and reducing its dependence on foreign sources. Still, as recent events have shown, the global nature of petroleum markets means that disruptions occurring halfway around the world can impact fuel prices here at home. Blending low-cost ethanol into gasoline is a proven strategy for reducing fuel prices and strengthening the U.S. market’s resilience against global supply chain disruptions.”

In the report, George Hoekstra of Hoekstra Trading LLC, an expert in petroleum refinery process research and technology management, analyzed the economics of substituting ethanol for refinery-derived gasoline, considering the effects on both octane value and energy content. Ethanol is a high-octane, low-cost component of the fuel supply. The report estimates the cost of refinery-derived octane to be 4.5 times higher than that of ethanol-derived octane.

Hoekstra concludes, “The energy equivalent substitution to a level of 10 percent ethanol implies that ethanol is adding a net of 39 cents/gal worth of octane to the U.S. E10 gasoline pool. To say this another way, if ethanol was removed from the U.S. gasoline pool, replacing its current octane contribution with refinery octane would increase refining cost and the wholesale cost of gasoline by 39 cents per gallon or $54 billion/year.”

E10, a blend containing 10 percent ethanol, is the predominant form of finished gasoline sold in the United States. Hoekstra also estimated that the cost savings per gallon of finished gasoline increase as ethanol content increases. The study found that using blends like E15, which are becoming more widely available in the U.S. market, results in even larger savings.

The study, which was commissioned by RFA, did not consider the other ways in which ethanol can contribute to lower gasoline prices, notably the aggregate effect of boosting U.S. fuel supplies by approximately 1 million barrels a day.

Contracts with airlines and corporate clients underpin demand, shielding profits from crude price swings.

Cash Flow Fortitude and Capital Discipline

OMV's financial strategy ensures that its transformation is both ambitious and sustainable. A key pillar is its focus on maintaining strong cash flow:

Operating Cash Flow Targets: OMV aims to achieve EUR 7.5 billion in annual operating cash flow by 2030, up from EUR 7 billion previously. This is underpinned by Brent oil prices of EUR 80/bbl and gas prices of EUR 25–30/MWh, which the company forecasts will hold through 2030.

CAPEX Allocation: 40–50% of its EUR 3.8 billion annual organic CAPEX is directed toward low-carbon projects, ensuring that sustainability goals do not divert funds from core operations.

Dividend Policy: A 5–10% annual increase in base dividends through 2030, alongside special dividends when leverage stays below 30%, rewards shareholders while preserving financial flexibility.

Operational Agility in a Volatile Landscape

OMV's adaptability shines in its response to market headwinds:

- Diversified Supply Chains: Gas sourcing from Norway, Italy, and the U.S. mitigates geopolitical risks, while polyolefins sales in high-margin specialty chemicals offset broader market overcapacity.

- Efficiency Programs: A EUR 500 million efficiency drive by 2027 aims to counter inflation and operational costs, reinforcing margins.

- Regulatory Readiness: Methane emissions have been slashed by over 70% since 2019, outpacing EU targets, and Scope 1/2 emissions are set to fall 30% by 2030.

Risks and Mitigation

While OMV's strategy is robust, challenges remain:

- Permitting Delays: Geothermal projects in Germany face regulatory hurdles, but OMV is engaging proactively with policymakers.

- Commodity Volatility: A prolonged gas price slump could strain margins, though Neptun Deep's long-term contracts provide a buffer.

Investment Outlook: A Steady Hand in Turbulent Waters

OMV's blend of cash flow discipline, low-carbon diversification, and operational focus makes it a compelling investment for long-term energy investors. With a leverage ratio of just 12% (Q1 2025) and a track record of shareholder returns averaging 10% annually, the stock offers stability amid market chaos.

Recommendation: Buy or hold OMV for investors seeking exposure to Europe's energy transition. The stock's valuation—currently trading at 5.2x 2025E EV/EBITDA—appears reasonable given its growth trajectory. Monitor execution of Neptun Deep and the Q2 2025 results (due July 31) for confirmation of its financial resilience.

In a sector rife with uncertainty, OMV's transformation is no gamble—it's a calculated bet on the future of energy, backed by the strength of its balance sheet and innovation pipeline.",,N,,2025-07-08 07:07:14.035942

Jet card “owners” (NetJets’ name for its card customers) have 24 months to use their flight hours.","Flexjet, a long-established force in the fractional jet ownership market (since 1995), and also one of the leading providers of jet cards, defines its jet card customers as “UHNW [ultra-high net worth] individuals, families, and companies”. According to Andrew Collins, the CEO of Flexjet, “a significant proportion have self-made wealth, distinguishing them as high-achieving entrepreneurs, investors and business leaders in sectors such as finance, real estate and technology”.

Collins explains that “one key demographic shift we are seeing is clients getting younger, with a growing proportion now falling in the 45-54 age bracket. Our average age for a new client was 58 in 2024, four years younger than it was in 2019”.

It’s easy to see why jet card programmes are gaining traction when you consider the alternatives, some of which require a CFO, a legal team and a meditation app. For example, outright ownership of a jet is the ultimate status symbol — until you’re managing hangar leases, crew contracts, juggling maintenance schedules plus the emotional burden of insuring a flying palazzo. It can cost tens of millions upfront and millions more per year in upkeep, and your jet will sit idle most of the time. It’s a bit like buying a château in Bordeaux just because you like the house wine.

Fractional ownership companies offer a “lite” version of this. About £375,000 typically buys 50 hours a year — but with some companies you’ll still pay monthly fees, compete for availability, and occasionally (with some programmes) share the ride, sometimes with someone else’s labradoodle.

Then there’s jet charter, which gives you on-demand convenience, but the price can yo-yo, especially in and around the glitzier fashion shows and swanky sports fixtures (hourly charter jet rates can oscillate between £3,700 and £11,000 for even the smallest jets during the Monaco Grand Prix).

These options all have their place for the right individual or corporate entity, but jet cards fill an important niche, with their blend of luxury, stable pricing (one of the main pulls) and availability at short notice. One call, or a few taps on an app (which most jet card outfits now provide) and your jet will soon be spooling up its engines on the tarmac while the galley is being topped up with Pierre Hermé macarons.

But before you reach for your Meisterstück to sign up there are a few endearing quirks to watch out for. Some jet cards charge by estimated flight time, others from “wheels up to wheels down”, meaning any scenic detour or weather delay becomes your financial responsibility. Then there are “repositioning fees” (aka ferry fees) — charges for when a private jet must fly empty to or from another airport to pick you up or after dropping you off. Some jet card providers absorb these, others trim them off your tab.

And what about that upfront retainer? With some cards your deposit sits safely in an escrow account, but with others it’s helping to fund the provider’s day-to-day operations. Meanwhile, lower-tier cards can be rigid, with fewer route possibilities, less perks, and aircraft that may lack the wow factor promised in the brochure.

Another aspect to look out for is that some card operators have their own dedicated fleet of aircraft (the best option for a consistent service experience), whereas others don’t own a single plane and rely on a pool of spare capacity sourced from an array of jet charter operators. Verifying what the set-up is should be high on your checklist before you take the plunge.

Finally (and this is something that many people forget to ask) check how much baggage allowance is included — bear in mind that smaller jets have very limited stowage space.

That said, jet card memberships are just the ticket for high-flyers who crave the perks of private aviation without too much palaver. They’re also useful for helping jet-set rookies dip their toes into the world of private aviation without getting out of their depth. According to Flexjet’s Collins, “we see our jet card as the perfect introductory programme for those looking to experience Flexjet, before considering the longer-term commitment of fractional ownership, which is generally for five years or more”. Many of Flexjet’s jet card holders do go on to become fractional owners, having experienced the Flexjet experience via its jet card programme, and as their flying needs and service expectations increase.

Which provider might be right for you? It comes down to the intricacies of quality, service, convenience and of course budget. There are about 45 jet card companies worldwide. Here are four of those with the upper hand.

Flexjet’s jet card — elevated simplicity powered by the Praetor 600

Flexjet’s European jet card is positioned as a stepping stone into private aviation. It’s a highly refined product tailored for individuals who want seamless access to a top-tier fleet, consistent service and a taste of what Flexjet’s fractional ownership model has to offer.

At the heart of Flexjet’s European jet card offering is the Embraer Praetor 600, an aircraft Flexjet knows intimately. “Flexjet was the launch operator,” Collins says. “It hits a sweet spot in terms of its performance, spacious cabin and category-leading range, which allows nonstop flights to New York or Dubai from northern Europe.”

With space for up to nine passengers and a dedicated cabin server, the Praetor 600 is designed for transcontinental travel, with a range of 4,018 nautical miles and endurance of up to eight hours. Cruising at 466 knots (roughly 536mph) it can soar at altitudes up to 13,716m (about 45,000ft) where the air is usually less turbulent than the layer of airspace wherein mainstream airline traffic operates. It also comes with a generous 4.39 cubic metres of baggage capacity — oodles of space for your Louis Vuitton Pyramide Bistens.

Flexjet’s card provides 25 hours of prepaid flying time, with guaranteed availability within 48 hours — or 120 hours during 25 peak travel days, plus 10 blackout days, with fixed hourly pricing set at €14,900 (£12,550 approx).

A huge plus is that cardholders benefit from access to Flexjet’s own fleet, ensuring service standards remain consistently high, and the company’s operation is underpinned by significant long-term investment. This year, it announced a $7 billion deal with Embraer, placing orders for 182 business jets with options for 30 more — an industry-shaping commitment that will help to keep its fleet among the most modern and efficient flying today.

Sustainability is another priority. Flexjet partners with the aviation consultancy 4AIR to deliver meaningful environmental action, including 300 per cent carbon offsetting on every flight. This goes beyond CO₂ to account for contrails and other emissions. Clients can also choose to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and contribute to next-gen flight research.

“This jet card,” Collins says, “is aimed at those who are looking for an exceptional service experience at the very top of private aviation with the simplicity of a jet card format.”

Jettly’s no-fuss formula for private jet travel

Jettly’s jet card programme offers clients flexible, transparent and cost-effective access to a global network of over 23,000 private aircraft, all with fixed hourly rates and no hidden fees.

“Our focus,” explains Justin Crabbe, the CEO of Jettly, ”is on delivering seamless, personalised private jet experiences without the complexities of ownership”.

The company’s “pay-as-you-fly” card starts at $50,000 (about £37,000) for 25 hours, with no minimum usage requirement and no long-term commitment. The service draws high-net-worth individuals, business executives and corporations. But Crabbe observes that “we’re seeing emerging interest from younger, tech-savvy entrepreneurs and a growing number of leisure travellers looking for safe, flexible alternatives to commercial flights”.

Jettly says it’s investing heavily in technology to enhance the customer experience, including AI-powered flight booking, digital membership management, and the integration of blockchain and NFT technology. “Our goal,” Crabbe says, “is to simplify private aviation while providing more transparency and flexibility for our clients.”

Still, sourcing aircraft from a global pool can raise concerns about consistency — something Crabbe is quick to address. “We rigorously vet and partner with top-tier operators globally. Every aircraft meets our safety, maintenance and service standards,” he says. “Our dedicated concierge team works closely with clients and operators to tailor each flight to their preferences.”

Unlike some rivals, Jettly promises “no blackout dates”, Crabbe confirms. “We offer guaranteed availability with as little as ten hours’ notice.”

Sustainability is also on the radar. Jettly provides optional carbon offsetting and is “exploring partnerships with sustainable aviation fuel providers”.

Asked how he thought the private aviation market would evolve over the next 5-10 years, Crabbe says he anticipates continued growth, driven by evolving traveller expectations, technological advancements, and increased focus on sustainability. “Blockchain and digital platforms will likely reshape ownership and access models, while sustainable aviation fuel and hybrid-electric aircraft will become more prevalent.”

NetJets — the discreet card behind 500,000 flights a year

Backed by Berkshire Hathaway, NetJets runs one of the busiest private aviation operations in the world, with over half a million flights annually and a fleet that includes aircraft from Bombardier, Cessna and Embraer. Customers include over 40 of the Fortune 100 companies (over 50 professional golfers choose NetJets year after year).

The company itself has a vast footprint, with a global team of over 9,000 employees with on-site support at its most popular global destinations. Cardholders get access to a 24/7 service team, and at many major hubs its “NetJets Service Representatives” assist with arrivals and departures.

The price of a NetJets Card begins at $200,000 to $300,000 (£148,000 to £221,000) (depending on which aircraft type you sign up for), with “no hidden expenses and ferry fees”. Every NetJets Card (beginning with its offering that unlocks 290 days of annual access) is prepaid in 25-hour increments. Jet card “owners” (NetJets’ name for its card customers) have 24 months to use their flight hours.

Inside the cabin, there’s consistency across the fleet. The interiors lean towards a minimalist, functional style — pale leather seats, dark woods and neutral textiles. Materials are chosen for durability and sustainability, and the company was one of the first to pioneer a sustainability initiative in the private jet sector — “Blue Skies”, which has been running since 2008. All cardholders are automatically enrolled and contribute to carbon offset projects tied to the number of hours they fly.

For those who value privacy, tail numbers (registration numbers visible just underneath the tail of every aircraft) are never publicly linked to clients, and boarding is typically via private lounges — so customers can rest assured they won’t be tracked (and their whereabouts shared on social media) by celeb stalkers.

Additionally, NetJets invests in numerous art, food and wine, music, yachting and premier sports events (including golf, equestrian sports, tennis and motorsports). And from complimentary upgrades to once-in-a-lifetime experiences, customers gain access to exclusive benefits through more than 50 premier partnerships with other luxury brands (the company’s present and past collaborations include such brands as Mercedes-AMG, luxury yacht brokers Northrop & Johnson, and Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts).

VistaJet — the wild card

Then there’s VistaJet. VistaJet defies categorisation, but it is a heavyweight contender. It’s a jet membership programme, yet it sidesteps the “card” badge — and it’s not a charter operator either.

“VistaJet is not a jet card offering. We have a solution for every private aviation client through our VistaJet and XO brands,” insists Thomas Flohr, the founder and chairman of Vista Global Holding. The Swiss billionaire set up the Vista brand in 2004 (a year after he bought his first Learjet) to offer “more than transportation … a way of life, exquisitely tailored to those who fly not just often, but well”.

The Vista group includes aircraft management, leasing and flight operations solutions, making it a one-stop shop for every kind of private aviation client. It owns its entire fleet of 270 aircraft, so every seat, surface and smile in the sky is under their Vista brand — no charter roulette here.

The core proposition, VistaJet, focuses on guaranteed availability and a polished experience, with fine bed linen, cashmere blankets, and Christofle silverware and porcelain on board. Its “cabin hosts” are trained by the British Butler Institute and MedAire (aviation specialists providing life-saving training, medical kits, and expert advice from aviation medical doctors and security experts).

VistaJet’s “50-hour-per-year Program Membership” offers a fixed hourly rate locked in for three years. So whether you’re flying at Christmas, Easter, or during peak summer, the price stays blissfully the same. Hourly rates for different aircraft types vary. For example, the Challenger 350 (an eight-seater aircraft with 7 hours’ flight endurance) starts at about $15,000 (£11,000) per hour, while Global 7500 options (with 14 seats and a 17-hour non-stop flight capability) are about $25,000 (£18,445) per hour.

Every booking is supported by Vista’s global team of 4,000, offering service 24/7 across all time zones. You can also switch between aircraft types, because some days you need an Embraer Phenom 300 (with 6 seats), while at other times you might be travelling with a larger entourage, so one of VistaJet’s Embraer Lineage 1000E jets with 18 seats might be a better play.

VistaJet’s service is augmented by brand sibling XO, which is your on-demand option for private aviation via smartphone, a kind of skyborne “Uber”. In short, VistaJet is white-glove precision, while XO is sleek spontaneity.

At the heart of Vista is a fleet that isn’t bound to any single location — what Flohr calls a “floating fleet concept”. This ensures that, wherever you are in the world, a beautifully appointed aircraft is just 24 hours away. “We guarantee an aircraft available to fly our Members anytime and anywhere,” Flohr adds, “with the highest level of service, and a consistent experience on every flight.”

Even pets and children receive VIP treatment. From the VistaPet service (which includes VistaPet Pochette — a travel bag on board every flight containing “bio-organic animal treats, water-free shampoos, soothing wipes and toys to keep companions entertained throughout the flight”) to “Adventures in the Sky” experiences for younger flyers, every detail is considered. “We want you to feel a sense of familiarity. It should feel easy, almost like home,” Flohr says.

Sustainability, too, isn’t an afterthought. Vista has contracted 4.2 million US gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and offset over 2.2 million tonnes of CO₂ on behalf of clients. Still, Flohr insists, it’s the blend of innovation and human touch that defines Vista. “It’s all designed to create a smooth, personal, and efficient experience.”

From curated menus by the triple Michelin-starred chef Mauro Colagreco to exclusive itineraries via Private World (Vista’s collection of premium experiences, events and destinations delivered in partnership with an ecosystem of partners — an essential element of the Member experience), Vista offers far more than a seat in the sky. “If our members are at Le Mans, we want to be there too,” Flohr says.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F7bfa04c6-84ba-4f9c-a6d0-bf6f01ab8800.jpg?crop=5584%2C3141%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:41.412353

CORSIA, launched in 2016, is a market-based mechanism aimed at capping and gradually reducing carbon emissions from international flights. Vietnam’s participation begins during the scheme’s final voluntary phase and reflects a significant step toward its broader decarbonization goals. The country aims to cap emissions at 85% of 2019 levels between 2024 and 2035, with a long-term target of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2035.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, the government has taken several preparatory steps to meet CORSIA requirements. These include drafting regulations on aviation fuel standards and emissions tracking, implementing Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) mechanisms for international flights, and submitting historical emission data from 2019 to 2024 to ICAO.

While ICAO has commended Vietnam for demonstrating strong readiness among developing countries, industry experts warn of substantial financial implications for domestic carriers. Estimates suggest Vietnamese airlines could spend between USD 5.6 million and USD 37.5 million annually on carbon credits, depending on market fluctuations. Over the voluntary phase, total offset costs could reach between USD 13 million and USD 92 million, based on carbon credit prices ranging from USD 6 to USD 40 per metric ton of CO₂-equivalent.

Airlines Respond with Sustainability Investments

Vietnam’s major carriers have already begun preparing for the transition. Vietnam Airlines, buoyed by a strong post-pandemic recovery and successful debt restructuring, reported a record net profit of VND 7.95 trillion (approx. USD 304 million) in 2024. The airline has reaffirmed its commitment to reducing emissions through fleet modernization and greater adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

In 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated its first SAF-blended international flight on the Singapore–Hanoi route, followed by six SAF-powered domestic flights to commemorate World Environment Day.

Low-cost carrier Vietjet Air is also aligning its operations with CORSIA’s goals. In June 2025, the airline finalized a purchase agreement with Airbus for 100 A321neo aircraft. The new jets promise at least 20% improved fuel efficiency and can operate on up to 50% SAF, positioning Vietjet for a more sustainable future.

As Vietnam prepares for full integration into CORSIA, the government continues to explore ways to balance environmental responsibility with economic sustainability, particularly for its aviation industry, which plays a critical role in national connectivity and tourism.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/18-3.png,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:48.982431

In an effort to help airports prepare for the impacts of climate change, ACI APAC & MID presented a paper on “Climate Adaptation Guidance and Tools for Airports.” The paper unveiled a major 18-month initiative that will deliver tools and guidance materials to help airports put adaptation measures in place.

The initiative has already garnered strong momentum, with 60 airport operators representing 224 airports committed to the study. A dedicated Task Force, including members such as Bahrain International Airport, Darwin International Airport, Dubai International Airport, Hong Kong International Airport, Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport, has been formed to steer the project.

According to a statement issued by CARB on June 27, OAL has now approved the LCFS regulations, allowing the amendments to take effect on July 1.
“Implementing the July 1 effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.","The California Air Resources Board on June 27 announced amendments to the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulations will take effect beginning on July 1. The amended regulations were approved by the agency in November 2024, but implementation was delayed due to regulatory clarity issues.

CARB on Nov. 8 approved updates to its LCFS that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045. The updates also include a variety of technical changes to the LCFS program, including those requiring fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; requiring independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; prohibiting palm-derived fuels from receiving credits; placing a cap on the use of soybean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels; and updates that phase out avoided methane crediting associated with the use of biomethane as a combustion fuel but extend the use of biomethane for renewable hydrogen.

Under California law, the State’s Office of Administrative Law must review rulemakings proposed by state agencies to ensure compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, a state law that governs the rulemaking process. One component of that law deals with clarity, requiring regulations to be easily understood the people directly affected by them.

CARB submitted its final regulatory package on the approved LCFS amendments to OAL on Jan. 3. OAL on Feb. 18 notified CARB of its intention to disapprove the LCFS amendments citing “clarity” issues.

CARB on Feb. 25 received a Decision of Disapproval of Regulatory Action from OAL, which details the reasons for the disapproval. That document indicates that OAL has identified 26 proposed regulatory provisions where additional modifications may be necessary to ensure the regulatory provisions can be “easily understood by those persons directly affected by them.”

Under state law, CARB had 120 days to rewrite and resubmit the amendments to OAL.

Fuel security risk: 80 per cent of Australia’s liquid fuel is imported, costing $50.7 billion in 2023, which the report said exposes the nation to supply chain shocks.
Policy potential: By introducing targeted policies, such as mandates, national procurement programs and low carbon fuel certification, Australia can provide the demand certainty and price signals needed to scale a local clean fuel industry.
To close the gap between potential and reality, the report outlines an actionable framework to help scale Australia’s LCLF industry.
“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels,” he said.","A domestic low carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry could contribute up to $36 billion to the economy and reduce emissions by 230Mt by 2050 – but only if it acts promptly, according to a new report published by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

The report, Refined Ambitions: Exploring Australia’s Low Carbon Liquid Fuel Potential, found that LCLFs are crucial to Australia’s net-zero future, particularly for sectors such as aviation, mining, heavy freight and defence, where electrification is challenging.

It was commissioned by the CEFC and developed by Deloitte, in consultation with industry participants, investors, researchers and government stakeholders.

CEFC CEO, Ian Learmonth, said LCLFs are a present-day necessity for sectors that can’t electrify.

“If we get the settings right, Australia can lead in clean fuels innovation and production – not just supply the feedstocks.”

Learmonth said Australia has all the ingredients to be a clean fuel superpower – abundant feedstocks, world-class research, and growing demand.

“Policy accelerators, including mandates, certification schemes and offsets, are key components to assist the industry reach scale. The first movers will reap the rewards of this global market.”

The report’s key findings include:

$36 billion market opportunity by 2050: A domestic LCLF sector could contribute significantly to Australia’s economic growth and clean energy exports.

230Mt CO₂-e savings: Cumulative abatement over the next 25 years, equivalent to nearly half of Australia’s annual emissions.

Fuel security risk: 80 per cent of Australia’s liquid fuel is imported, costing $50.7 billion in 2023, which the report said exposes the nation to supply chain shocks.

Untapped potential: Australia exports $3.9 billion in LCLF feedstocks such as canola and tallow, but lacks local refining capacity to realise full value, according to the report.

Persistent demand: Even with rapid electrification, large quantities of liquid fuel could still be needed by 2050.

The report said that without domestic LCLF production, Australia remains vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions and misses a significant economic opportunity, particularly for regional areas.

It points to earlier CSIRO modelling that indicates that Australian feedstock could produce billions of litres of LCLFs annually by 2050, utilising existing land and practices without impacting food production.

The CEFC said its report aligns with the Federal Government’s Future Made in Australia agenda, showing how clean fuel production can bolster sovereign capability, create regional jobs and meet climate targets.

CEFC Executive Director, Rupert Maloney, said, “We export the raw materials but miss the opportunity to build the industry here at home. This is about regional development, national resilience, and emissions reduction, all at once.”

Despite the growing momentum and a pipeline of more than two billion litres in proposed projects, the report found that Australia’s LCLF industry faces significant structural, financial, and regulatory challenges.

It found that the cost of production remains higher than that of conventional fuels, while the lack of national mandates has limited investor confidence and demand certainty.

Additionally, the report found that emerging fuel technologies require further R&D and de-risking before they can be commercially deployed at scale. The report identified key hurdles:

Cost gap: LCLFs remain more expensive than fossil fuels without policy support.

Policy potential: By introducing targeted policies, such as mandates, national procurement programs and low carbon fuel certification, Australia can provide the demand certainty and price signals needed to scale a local clean fuel industry.

Investment risk: Next generation fuel technologies need R&D support and commercial de-risking.

To close the gap between potential and reality, the report outlines an actionable framework to help scale Australia’s LCLF industry.

The roadmap focuses on enabling market demand, lowering investment risk, supporting innovation, and coordinating the value chain, drawing on proven models from clean energy and international biofuel markets.

With the correct settings in place, the CEFC said that Australia can unlock a globally competitive and sovereign clean fuels sector. To take advantage of this opportunity, the report details seven key steps:

Improve market access – e.g., trade relationships

De-risk investments – e.g., concessional finance to de-risk private capital

Reduce transaction challenges – e.g., standardised contract terms

Consider credible demand signals – e.g., sustainable aviation fuel and freight fuel blending mandates

More transparent data on demand, supply and feedstocks

Leverage innovation to reduce costs and support for advanced fuel technologies – e.g., hydrogen-based e-fuels

Better coordination and alignment across the value chain – e.g., from feedstock supplier to fuel producer to end user

Maloney said with the right market signals and collaboration, Australia can build a globally competitive clean fuels industry and lead the region in climate-era innovation.

“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels,” he said. “But we need investment commitments this decade to avoid missing the window.”",https://www.energymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AdobeStock_1551469663-Large.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 21:02:42.928038

Among the advocacy groups quick to praise the bill were Airports Council International -- North America, Airlines for America and the Modern Skies Coalition -- a group of 50-plus stakeholders that formed for the purpose of supporting an ATC overhaul.
The largest ATC components in the budget bill are $4.75 billion for ATC telecommunications infrastructure and $3 billion for radar systems replacement.
Aviation stakeholders have been calling for faster and more effective action in upgrading the ATC system for decades as the multibillion-dollar NextGen program that began in 2007 under-delivered and was implemented haltingly.
Farmers got an additional boost, receiving higher tax credits for the production of sustainable aviation fuel from corn ethanol and soybean oil.","Aviation industry stakeholders are praising the budget and policy bill signed by President Trump on July 4, primarily due to the $12.5 billion it provides for an overhaul of air traffic control (ATC) systems.

However, those same stakeholders are already noting that substantially more funding will be needed in the coming years to complete the ambitious ATC transformation, especially within the four-year timeline that Transportation Department Secretary Sean Duffy has laid out.

Among the advocacy groups quick to praise the bill were Airports Council International -- North America, Airlines for America and the Modern Skies Coalition -- a group of 50-plus stakeholders that formed for the purpose of supporting an ATC overhaul.

""This is a meaningful first step toward replacing outdated technology and aging facilities with the tools needed to keep our skies safe and efficient for decades to come,"" the Modern Skies Coalition said.

The group, which has estimated that completing the ATC overhaul will cost at least $31 billion, also said that it ""remains committed to working with lawmakers, regulators and industry partners to ensure that the system is fully staffed and that this investment translates into real progress, guaranteeing the United States will continue to have the safest aviation system in the world.""

The largest ATC components in the budget bill are $4.75 billion for ATC telecommunications infrastructure and $3 billion for radar systems replacement. Another $1.9 billion would go toward constructing a new air route traffic control center to handle midflight air traffic, above 20,000 feet.

Airlines for America CEO Nick Calio was effusive in his praise of the White House.

""Few people have had the gumption to take on the vast undertaking of modernizing our nation's complex ATC system, but President Trump and Secretary Duffy addressed the dire need quickly and are acting with urgency,"" Calio said.

But he, too, stressed that more money will be needed.

""We look forward to working with the administration as we continue to advocate for additional funding for staffing and technology to make President Trump's vision of a new golden age of air travel a reality.""

Aviation stakeholders have been calling for faster and more effective action in upgrading the ATC system for decades as the multibillion-dollar NextGen program that began in 2007 under-delivered and was implemented haltingly. But their calls gained more traction and vocal support from Trump and Duffy following the January collision of an Army helicopter with an American Airlines regional jet near Washington D.C. ATC failures this spring that led to ATC outages and flight delays at Newark Airport were also a rallying cry.

The budget bill also won praise from airports for the more than $6.1 billion it includes for hiring and for bonuses for Customs and Border Protection personnel.

""Funding 5,000 additional CBP officers will improve the processing experience for passengers and cargo moving through our airports, seaports, and land ports,"" Airports Council International -- North America said.

The bill also has other impacts on aviation. Notably, it extends by two years, until 2029, a tax credit for of up to $1.75 for producers of sustainable aviation fuel.

The credit survived despite the Trump administration's hostility to climate-change initiatives, due in large part to support from farmers.

Once complete, the infrastructure will help meet future e-fuel demand from Australia – a market which Chief Executive Officer Gunnar Holen expects to be large.
“At the same time, they are a clean and carbon-neutral fuel, with proven efficacy in both rail and aviation.” How are e-fuels developed?
“In rail, particulates, like soot, can be more damaging for the environment than carbon dioxide, so this is a key benefit,” Holen said.
“In Europe, e-fuels are primarily used for fuel in aviation, given EU mandates around SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] and ESAF.","E-fuels have long been helping Europe decarbonise its rail network – and with Nordic Electrofuel recently signing an MoU for an e-fuel production plant in Saudi Arabia, Australia could soon follow in its tracks.

The plant, due to be built in 2030, is one of several Nordic Electrofuel is developing in the region, with a similar facility in Oman also in the works.

Once complete, the infrastructure will help meet future e-fuel demand from Australia – a market which Chief Executive Officer Gunnar Holen expects to be large.

“E-fuels are great for any country looking to decarbonise their transport networks,” he said.

“Unlike electric and hydrogen-powered trains, which cost millions, e-fuels can be used with existing diesel locomotives and don’t require new infrastructure.

“At the same time, they are a clean and carbon-neutral fuel, with proven efficacy in both rail and aviation.”

How are e-fuels developed?

E-fuels are synthetic fuels based on renewable energy.

“You start with traditional hydrogen production, then mix with captured carbon dioxide to create a gas,” Holen said.

“You then undertake Fischer-Tropsch and come out with fuels, which can be optimised for their various end uses. For example, e-kerosene for aviation.

“We also derive valuable byproduct from the oxygen, which we can sell for industrial purposes.”

While the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process can be carbon-intensive, it has the potential to be carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative, depending on the source of its feedstock and energy inputs.

The carbon intensity is influenced by the source of the carbon and hydrogen used in the process.

The finished product, the e-fuel, is also carbon neutral and void of particulates.

“In rail, particulates, like soot, can be more damaging for the environment than carbon dioxide, so this is a key benefit,” Holen said.

Advantages

As well as being cheaper, e-fuels offer various advantages over clean transport alternatives.

While hydrogen trains are an attractive prospect to operators with larger budgets, Holen warns they are challenging to distribute and carry unique safety risks.

“There is a risk of explosion and, because of that, public caution around them,” he said.

“They also lack the necessary infrastructure. Back in the day, pure hydrogen-powered vehicles were promising in Norway. But the infrastructure hasn’t developed at all, and we only have a handful of filling stations.”

Electrification of the rail network is an equally popular clean transport option, but one which requires a supportive grid.

“If you have the time and the budget, great. Because there will be no emissions from an electrified train network. But for many, quicker, cheaper and more viable solutions are needed.”

Global developments

For these reasons, e-fuels have already become popular in Europe, with Germany representing its largest market, and Finland and Sweden set to become close contenders.

Holen said that as more plants open, e-fuels will become more cost-efficient and widespread around the world.

“We are currently developing several new plants here in Norway, including one we are looking to build equity for, in Herøya , 160 km South of Oslo. We also have plans to make a large fuel plant there.

“We are also extensively engaged in the middle East, working with the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu in Saudi, as well as Canada and Sweden.”

While Nordic Electrofuels primarily deals with the European market, Holen believes APAC demand could soon catch up.

“In Europe, e-fuels are primarily used for fuel in aviation, given EU mandates around SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] and ESAF. It’s a strong market for us.

“But with our upcoming developments in Saudi and Oman, we will be able to cater more readily to the likes of Australia.”

Further insight

Sharing more on his expansion plans and weighing up the pros and cons of e-fuels in rail, Gunnar Holen will present at the upcoming Rail Decarbonisation and Resilience Conference, hosted by Informa Connect.

This year’s event will be held on July 22-23, 2025 at the Swissotel Sydney.

Key topics will include climate-adaptive design, asset resilience, emergency response, and cyber resilience, alongside solutions in clean traction power, alternate fuels, and energy-efficient operations.",https://www.railexpress.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gunnar-Holen-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:12:16.742426

Introduction

The One Big Beautiful Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025, includes extensive energy provisions to overhaul the clean energy credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which are estimated to raise approximately $499 billion in net revenue from 2025–2034.

The legislation will eliminate numerous energy credits including all the clean vehicle credits, residential clean energy and energy efficiency credits, and clean hydrogen production credit by the end of 2027, and other credits several years later, with various phaseout schedules. Together, these provisions are estimated to raise about $543 billion from 2025–2034.

The legislation also expands some energy provisions such as clean fuel production credit and advanced manufacturing credit, which are estimated to cost about $44 billion over the same period.

Overall, the OBBBA’s energy provisions do not make much progress in conforming the IRA’s energy credits to the good-tax-policy principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability. See a previous American Action Forum (AAF) paper for a detailed analysis of the energy credits and an evaluation of them against the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability.

The OBBBA’s energy provisions include simplicity and efficiency enhancing provisions such as those that eliminate the poorly designed clean vehicle credits, standardize credit rates for different qualified energy technologies or components, and retain the refundability and transferability features. The legislation also contains complex and inefficient provisions that restrict taxpayers’ full access to the credits, such as expanding the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules and using an arbitrary approach to pick winners and losers across various energy technologies.

This paper provides an overview of the legislation’s changes to the IRA energy provisions and evaluates the energy provisions against three good-tax-policy principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability.

Summary of the OBBBA’s Changes to the IRA Energy Provisions

The OBBBA overhauls the IRA energy provisions in the following areas. (See detailed information on expiration dates, exceptions, and special rules in the table in appendix.)

Eliminates some credits: The legislation repeals all the new, used, and commercial clean vehicle credits, alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, residential clean energy and energy efficiency credits as soon as after September 30, 2025, with some of them expiring after June 30, 2026. It also repeals the clean hydrogen production credit after 2027.

Brings expiration dates forward: The legislation brings forward most of the expiration dates for wind and solar in the clean electricity production credit, clean electricity investment credit, and advanced manufacturing production credit to December 31, 2027. It also makes the permanent advanced manufacturing production credit for critical minerals temporary, starting its phaseout in 2031 and fully eliminated four years later.

Strengthens foreign entity of concern restrictions: The legislation significantly expands the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) provisions by prohibiting taxpayers from getting “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity,” which includes a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-controlled entity.” The FEOC provisions also include specific restrictions regarding a “foreign-influenced entity.”

Removes emissions-related targets: The legislation eliminates the emissions-related conditions that determine the expiration dates for clean electricity production and clean electricity investment credits. Instead, both credits start to phase out in 2034 and are repealed fully by 2036.

Expands the scope of certain credits: The legislation expands some energy credits, including by extending the clean fuel production credit from 2027 to 2029, adding a new production credit for metallurgical coal equal to 2.5 percent of production costs, and adding a new energy community bonus credit of 10 percent to the clean electricity production credit for advanced nuclear facilities.

Makes limited changes to some credits: The legislation retains the energy credits for carbon oxide sequestration and nuclear power production mostly as detailed in the IRA and adds only FEOC restrictions to them.

Retains transferability, refundability, and most bonus credits: The legislation retains transferability and refundability for the credits and other special bonus credit requirements including domestic content rules, prevailing wage bonus, and apprenticeship bonus.

Evaluating the OBBBA’s Energy Provisions

Simplicity, Efficiency, and Fiscal Sustainability

The IRA uses tax subsidies to encourage the production of clean energy. Although the income tax is not the best approach to addressing climate change, energy tax credits should follow the principles of good tax policy. Ideally, tax policies should be simple, efficient, and fiscally sustainable. This allows the federal government to incentivize clean energy development without imposing unnecessary burdens on taxpayers and the economy. A previous American Action Forum (AAF) paper on the IRA energy provisions provides a detailed analysis of the credits and uses a framework of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability to evaluate them. The three principles are defined as follows:

A simple tax credit is one that makes it easy for the government to implement clean energy tax incentives and the taxpayers to utilize them, keeping both administrative and compliance costs low.

An efficient tax credit would ensure that eligible taxpayers can utilize clean energy tax credits as much as possible to help drive the economy’s transition to clean energy technologies. It should also limit the extent to which the tax incentives distort producers and consumer behaviors in ways that impose additional costs. It is worth noting that there is a tension between efficiency of clean energy tax credits and the conventional meaning of tax efficiency, as clean energy tax credits are designed to change taxpayers’ behaviors and encourage them to switch to the consumption of clean energy technologies.

A fiscally sustainable tax credit is one that limits budgetary costs and can ultimately be financed through a low level of taxation.

Simplicity

The IRA’s tax credits were designed with excessive complexity. Many of the energy tax credits have multiple requirements that significantly limit eligible taxpayers to a specific group of businesses or individuals, which requires regulators to allocate more resources to screen and verify eligibility and taxpayers to incur a larger burden to comply with the requirements.

Tax credits can be simple to administer and utilize if they have universal provisions. If they are designed to subsidize certain taxpayers or economic activities, however, the complex eligibility requirements could substantially increase administrative and compliance costs.

The OBBBA significantly simplifies the design of the energy provisions by eliminating the poorly designed clean vehicle tax credits. AAF’s analysis finds that the clean vehicle credits’ onerous eligibility requirements, income thresholds, and bonus credit rules make them complicated for regulators to implement and difficult for taxpayers to claim the full credits. Indeed, AAF concluded in its previous analysis that the clean vehicle credits fail against all three principles, as they are complex, inefficient, and costly.

Additionally, the OBBBA surgically improves the simplicity of some energy provisions by standardizing credit rates for different qualified energy technologies or components. For example, for the clean fuel production credit, the legislation reduces the credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel to conform to the rate applicable to other eligible transportation fuels. For the advanced manufacturing production credit, the legislation eliminates the permanent feature of the critical minerals credit and changes it to the same expiration and phaseout schedule as most other eligible components.

The OBBBA adds restrictions and requirements to the energy credits, however, making them more complex to claim than necessary. A striking example is that the legislation expands the IRA’s FEOC restrictions significantly to prohibit eligible taxpayers from being directly or indirectly associated with any specified or defined foreign entity of concern. The new FEOC provisions apply restrictions in several ways. A prohibited foreign entity cannot claim the credit. Eligible taxpayers cannot source their input materials from a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity. Additionally, eligible taxpayers cannot enter into a licensing agreement with a prohibited foreign entity. The legislation also adds a new 10-year recapture special rule to the FEOC restrictions. For example, for the clean electricity investment credit, eligible taxpayers are prohibited from transferring payments to a specified foreign entity over a 10-year retroactive period. This rule goes into effect in the tax years beginning two years after the enactment of the OBBBA. The new FEOC restrictions substantially increase the complexity of implementing, interpreting, and utilizing the credits.

The OBBBA retains some of the complex special rules in the IRA, including the domestic content rule and prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. For example, for the clean electricity investment credit, the OBBBA modified the domestic content rule to make it harder for taxpayers to claim the credit by increasing the percentage of eligible products that must be produced in the United States. This requirement may be challenging to comply with as the United States has been relying on certain imported goods as components for energy products and it is more costly to produce them domestically.

Efficiency

The IRA clean energy credits have a combination of features that make them efficient in some ways and less inefficient in others.

The OBBBA retains the efficiency-enhancing features of refundability and transferability. These provisions allow taxpayers to fully utilize the credits for which they are eligible. For example, a startup carbon capture technology company is not typically profitable in its first few years of business, which means that it does not have any taxable income or tax liability, so it cannot use any standard tax credits to reduce its tax liability. With refundability and transferability, the company can either get a refund (a direct payment) from the government as if it had a tax liability or sell the tax credit to another business for cash. Retaining the transferability feature applies to one of the good-tax-policy principles of efficiency, but the OBBBA adds significant FEOC restrictions to prohibit businesses from transferring credits to a specified foreign entity, which reduces the efficiency of the credits and limits taxpayers’ access to claim the credits.

As discussed above, the legislation greatly improves the efficiency of the energy provisions by repealing the inefficient clean vehicle credits. These credits subsidize consumers who would have bought a clean vehicle anyway, and do not incentivize consumers to use electricity generated with clean energy for their vehicles.

In contrast, OBBBA’s arbitrary approach to different types of energy technologies reduces their efficiency considerably. Overall, the legislation favors baseload energy (capable of running continuously), such as nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower, over other intermittent energy sources, including wind and solar. For example, the clean electricity production and investment credits will expire for wind and solar much sooner than for other types of clean energy. The advanced manufacturing production credit is also repealed for wind energy components several years earlier than for other eligible components.

Additionally, the legislation’s energy provisions do not seem to follow any principles of good tax policy. While the carbon oxide sequestration credit and the nuclear power production credit from the IRA are mostly retained in OBBBA, the clean hydrogen production credit will be eliminated after 2027. The clean fuel production credit is extended by two years, whereas the advanced manufacturing production credit for critical minerals is changed from permanent to temporary.

A perplexing modification in the OBBBA’s energy provisions is that it adds a new production credit for metallurgical coal, equal to 2.5 percent of production costs, under the advanced manufacturing production credit. Metallurgical coal is primarily used as a raw material for manufacturing steel, which is sold at a much higher price than thermal coal used for electricity generation. The United States is a major producer of metallurgical coal globally and most of the U.S. metallurgical coal products are for exports.

To price the externalities of greenhouse gas emissions and encourage transition to clean energy technologies, tax subsidies should ideally be as technology neutral as possible, meaning that they subsidize all clean energy technologies equally if they lead to the same amount of emissions reduction. Overall, there is significant room to improve the efficiency of OBBBA’s energy provisions as they arbitrarily pick winners and losers across different energy technologies.

Fiscal Sustainability

The IRA’s clean energy provisions were initially estimated to cost $400 billion from 2026–2035. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) later estimated that the cost of the provisions is more than double, at $870 billion.

Table 1 shows JCT’s estimate of how much revenue the OBBBA’s energy provisions would raise. The termination and restriction of the energy provisions will raise about $543 billion from 2025–2034. The expansion of some of the energy provisions will cost about $44 billion over the same period. On net, all the OBBBA’s energy provisions will raise a total of $499 billion from 2025–2034.

AAF previously estimated that repealing all the energy provisions in the IRA would raise $852 billion from 2026–2035. The OBBBA’s energy provisions will raise approximately 60 percent of the total revenue if the legislation were to fully repeal all the energy provisions.

This sweeping budget reconciliation legislation, which passed the House in May 2025 and the Senate in July 2025, presents a mixed bag for the SAF industry—extending key tax credits while eliminating federal grant programs.

The SAF Provisions: A Tale of Two Policies

The bill repeals grants for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programs but extends SAF tax credits for four years, creating a shift from direct federal funding to tax-based incentives. This approach reflects the Trump administration's preference for market-driven solutions over government grants, fundamentally changing how the federal government supports SAF development.

The massive budget reconciliation bill narrowly passed by the U.S. House of Representatives continues tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel production, providing crucial certainty for producers who have been waiting for policy clarity. This extension comes at a critical time, as CVR Energy Inc. announced that it has halted SAF production as it waits on government clarification on whether tax credits will continue.

The Broader Energy Context

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" represents a significant departure from the Biden administration's approach to clean energy. President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to rely on oil, gas, coal and nuclear to meet its energy needs, and the legislation reflects this priority. The budget bill would dampen development of wind and solar power, kill climate funding and boost oil, gas and coal output.

However, sustainable aviation fuel occupies a unique position in this energy landscape. Unlike other renewable energy technologies that face cuts or elimination, SAF maintains federal support through tax credits, likely due to the aviation industry's strategic importance and the lack of viable alternatives for long-haul flights.

Environmental Concerns and Agricultural Interests

The legislation has drawn criticism from environmental groups, particularly regarding its approach to crop-based aviation fuels. The U.S. agriculture lobby has long promoted ethanol for cars. If President Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" becomes law, the industry would be given tax credits for producing crop-based fuel for planes, too, despite evidence it would spur deforestation and increase emissions.

This tension highlights a fundamental challenge in SAF policy: balancing agricultural economic interests with environmental integrity. The bill's approach appears to prioritize domestic production and agricultural support over strict environmental criteria.

Industry Response and Market Impact

The policy shift has created uncertainty in the SAF market. While the extension of tax credits provides essential support for producers, the elimination of grant programs removes a key funding mechanism for research and development activities. This could slow innovation in next-generation SAF technologies that don't rely on crop-based feedstocks.

The Budget also eliminates ""green aviation"" and other climate scam programs as well as failing space propulsion projects, according to the White House, signaling a broader skepticism toward government-funded climate initiatives.

The Montana Success Story

Despite the broader policy changes, the Trump administration has demonstrated support for large-scale SAF projects that align with its economic priorities. The loan will allow it to expand production to 315 million gallons per year, and produce about half of North American SAF, a fuel made from fats from seed oils and tallow that is lower in greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel.

This approval of a major SAF refinery loan in Montana demonstrates that the administration supports SAF projects that can demonstrate economic viability and use waste-based feedstocks rather than purpose-grown crops.

Looking Ahead: A Market-Driven Approach

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" represents a fundamental shift in how the federal government approaches SAF development. By maintaining tax credits while eliminating grants, the administration is betting that market forces, supported by tax incentives, can drive SAF adoption more effectively than direct government spending.

SAF is the cornerstone of airline industry efforts to achieve carbon net neutrality. The future of SAF is unclear in Trump's next Administration, but the inclusion of extended tax credits in the budget bill suggests that SAF will continue to receive federal support, albeit in a different form.

Strategic Implications for Industry

For aviation industry stakeholders, the message is clear: the federal government remains committed to supporting SAF development, but through market mechanisms rather than direct funding. Airlines and producers must now navigate a landscape where tax policy, rather than grant programs, drives federal support for sustainable aviation fuel.

This shift may actually benefit established producers who can take advantage of tax credits more effectively than newer entrants who might have relied on grant funding for initial development. The result could be a more concentrated industry with fewer but larger players.

The Path Forward

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" has created a new paradigm for SAF development in the United States. While environmental groups may be concerned about the emphasis on crop-based fuels and the elimination of grant programs, the extension of tax credits provides essential market support for the industry.

The ultimate success of this approach will depend on whether tax incentives alone can drive the scale of SAF production needed to meet aviation's decarbonization goals. As the industry adapts to this new policy environment, the next few years will be crucial in determining whether market-driven approaches can deliver the environmental benefits that direct government funding aimed to achieve.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGIjl2C4VGBuA/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/B56ZfnBectGQAQ-/0/1751927615318?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9C66sGn4Hk1ctXVXYfH1If3f2Vk8BeOQGNtpvEm3wow,N,,2025-07-08 05:58:58.025201

The direct reliance of infrastructure upon fossil hydrocarbons has reduced as renewable electricity gradually enters national grids, but the high energy density of hydrocarbon molecules identified by the Wrights when they chose gasoline power more than a century ago, means hydrocarbon fuel is likely to remain the primary commercial aircraft power source for decades to come.

Particularly for smaller aircraft, there is perhaps a role for battery and hydrogen fuel cell propulsion, the latter consuming hydrogen as a fuel and exhausting water as waste product.

Hydrogen fuel cells already power ground vehicles to a limited extent, and applications for hydrogen as a fuel for electricity generation and even domestic heating have been suggested, not least under the UK government’s Hydrogen Strategy.

The SAF connection – How hydrogen could support sustainable aviation fuel production

In a perfect world every turbine-engined aircraft will burn 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sooner rather than later. There are multiple routes to SAF, all requiring a carbon feedstock and, in many cases, hydrogen as a key ingredient.

Even if controversial grown biomass feedstocks are removed from the equation, the earth is rich in carbon through sources as diverse as sewage and carbon dioxide (CO2) extracted directly from the air.

Meanwhile, hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is most commonly found on Earth combined with oxygen as water and, ironically, in fossil hydrocarbon molecules.

Extracting hydrogen is invariably an energy-intensive process. Storing and moving it also poses significant challenges, which industry understands well.

Which is to say that were hydrogen to be used as a fuel on a macro scale, then existing steel-based infrastructure, pipelines, storage tanks and so on associated with hydrocarbon fuels could not be used, since hydrogen reacts with steel.

Another challenge lies in gaseous hydrogen’s very low volumetric energy density compared to hydrocarbons, likely restricting its fuel use to ground and building applications unless it can successfully be stored and moved in bulk, in liquid form.

UK-based CirculAIRity is clear in its vision to “enable the decarbonisation of the [aviation] sector by producing synthetic SAF derived from the Direct Air Capture of CO2.”

More specifically, Alex Chikhani, the company’s CEO and founder, says: “We put our arms around everything, including the primary power source and real estate. We aren’t scaling up our own technology, in fact, we’re technology, power source and location agnostic. We aim to manage the end-to-end supply chain.”

Chikhani describes SAF production as “extremely power hungry”, noting that the energy return per litre of SAF is 20:1, meaning that 20 “units” of energy are consumed to create every one unit of energy released when SAF is burned.

Hydrogen extraction is the most energy-intensive stage in the SAF production process. “Extracting hydrogen, like the manufacture of power-to-liquid fuels, requires energy, but not necessarily electricity,” Chikhani carefully explains.

“Waste heat from industrial processes can be used instead of electricity. So can heat from the sun – it makes little sense from a physics point of view to use sunlight to generate electricity and then use that to extract hydrogen or drive the chemical process that make fuel when we could use the sun’s heat directly.

“There are several ‘colours’ of hydrogen, of which ‘green’ is the most well known. It uses renewable power to extract hydrogen by electrolysis and very little of it is available.

“Most of the hydrogen on the market is ‘blue’, from natural gas, dependent on a fossil fuel and relatively cheap to produce, but if aviation is to decarbonise, then it must eliminate fossil fuels from the SAF production cycle. ‘Pink’ hydrogen uses electricity from a nuclear power station while ‘red’, which remains in the research stage, uses heat from a reactor to split water molecules.

“We’re looking at nuclear as just one of our potential power sources, including the advantage of ‘red’ hydrogen.”

Regional reaction – Trialling hydrogen application at regional airports

The barriers to widescale hydrogen extraction and employment are therefore great, but not insurmountable.

Proving its application at airports is an important component in aviation’s sustainability imperative and the very best locations for real-world trials are smaller, regional airports, where modified infrastructure may be installed with minimal disruption and stakeholders remain close for easy discussion and expedited progress.

Meanwhile, early steps are already being taken, and they are, inevitably, small.

Education and messaging are important elements in the wider sustainability effort and a single hydrogen-powered truck at a regional hub, for example, is likely far more newsworthy than a similar vehicle at a major primary airport.

A case in point is Exeter Airport in the UK, which recently completed a trial using a hydrogen-powered baggage tug, pushback tug and ground power unit to turn around a TUI Boeing 737 aircraft.

Stephen Wiltshire, Managing Director at Exeter Airport, says: “Regional airports are most likely to be those handling the first generation of smaller hydrogen aircraft, so it makes sense they should be the focus of any testbed activities.”

Similarly, in Canada, Edmonton International Airport is partnering with Diesel Tech Industries (DTI) to explore the integration of the Guardian Hydrogen Diesel System on two of the airport’s heavy-duty runway snow sweepers.

Currently operating on diesel fuel, the runway snow sweepers will be retrofitted using the DTI’s hydrogen diesel system to use hydrogen as a supplementary fuel, thereby significantly reducing carbon emissions without requiring extensive infrastructure modifications.

In the Baltics, under the BSR HyAirport programme, a hydrogen-powered Mulag baggage truck was tested at Riga Airport during March.

The programme includes regional airports in Germany, Poland, Scandinavia and across the Baltic region – and in winter 2025/26 expects to see hydrogen-powered winter machinery on test in Helsinki, Tallinn and Riga.

Julian Klaaßen, the BSR HyAirport Project’s Financial and Communications Manager, is based at Hamburg Airport.

He tells Regional Gateway: “The main goal is to create a decision-making tool and some rough calculations for every user – primarily airport operators – to help integrate hydrogen into different airport locations by answering questions like what costs are estimated for fuel and does local production or delivery make more sense?

“Since everything depends on location and every location is different, a general, variables-based outcome is needed. Generating that is the business case behind the whole project.”

Demonstrating hydrogen applications and safety in real-world operations is integral to the BSR HyAirport effort.

Klaaßen adds: “It is also very important for us to share results and show to a broad public audience that safe operations are possible.”

He is in no doubt that regional airports and airline routes will lead in hydrogen applications, adding: “At Hamburg Airport we are on the case with both infrastructure and hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft, while we have a healthy small aviation sector as well.

“Regional aviation will be the first mover, with larger aircraft following at least a decade later. Regional passenger flights are especially significant in the Baltics and Scandinavia, driving interest in electric – for short range – and hydrogen – gaseous for short range and liquid for medium range – aviation.”

Will hydrogen replace other energy sources?

Today, airports might store Jet A1, SAF and avgas for aircraft, petrol (gasoline), diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) for ground vehicles, and offer electric charging points. In a rose-tinted future, could hydrogen replace some of these energy sources and associated infrastructure?

Klaaßen says: “It could represent a huge opportunity for synergy across services and hydrogen could simplify some elements of airport operations, but other fuels will still be used in parallel.

“Petrol and CNG might vanish, for example, but jet fuel will remain for at least 30 years and most probably longer, hopefully as SAF. Hydrogen will therefore be just another fuel to be delivered and stored.

“In an integrated concept, it might provide opportunities for business synergies and simplification, but the integration and transition will pose challenges, with competition for airport space and additional infrastructure required in the early stages too.”

In common with Klaaßen, Chikhani cautions that hydrogen alone is not the solution to humanity’s future energy requirements – and therefore neither will it entirely power tomorrow’s airports and aircraft.

“Firstly, hydrogen is difficult to handle,” he says. “It can’t be moved or stored like natural gas, for example. Hydrogen needs stainless steel or glass vessels, or maybe some very specific plastics. It just leaks from steel and with its activation energy being so low it is very combustible – static from clothing is a sufficient ignition source.

“Aluminium aircraft and steel infrastructure have been built around and matured on almost a century’s worth of kerosene – Jet A1 – being the primary energy source for aviation.

“The idea that everything can be switched to hydrogen is highly unlikely. We need to look at a macro system, applying appropriate expertise throughout the system.”

By its nature, aviation is among the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. In 2024 it was a relatively small contributor to the world’s total carbon emissions at around three per cent, although its effect on global warming was surely greater through other high-altitude emissions, including water vapour.

The latter is volumetrically more significant than CO2 as a greenhouse gas and has significant climate effects, albeit shorter-lived for each emission, than CO2. More worryingly, however, it enhances the warming effects of the latter.

As other industries successfully decarbonise, aviation’s contribution to global warming will become proportionally greater and it is important to realise that the goal here is to reduce global warming for the benefit of the planet and continued survival of society.

This is not about making aviation greener for accounting purposes, this is about stopping emissions and ultimately reversing the damage already done.

Hydrogen as a fuel and SAF component is critical to that goal.

Chikhani says: “It will take time and depends on the commitment of countries, legislators and populations, nationally, regionally and globally, to enact this level of change.”

Regional airports are the obvious crucibles in which the aviation industry might trial hydrogen and other energy technologies, proving them in limited commercial service before any extension into major hubs.

Chikhani and Klaaßen are optimistic about the likelihood of success, while acknowledging that fundamental questions remain, such as: Where does the hydrogen come from? Who makes it? Who sells it? How is it regulated? What infrastructure is required and who pays for and maintains it?

“We are seeking answers,” Klaaßen says. “In the process, we are speaking to stakeholders whom, as airports or aviation operators, we have never spoken to before, because we can only answer these questions in co-operation with other industries. Without co-operation, we will never achieve our goals.”",https://www.regionalgateway.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Untitled-design-31.png,N,,2025-07-07 16:13:39.613116

Reducing emissions in aviation and shipping is crucial, and this action plan marks an important step towards energy transition.","Sweden - and the Nordic countries in general - have always been at the forefront of sustainability discussions. Prior to the pandemic Sweden was making international headlines, as the cradle and symbol of the “flygskam” (flight shame) movement.

But in the light of Sweden’s slow aviation recovery since the end of the pandemic restrictions, the new government have taken some important positive decisions. The first was to announce the abolition of the passenger tax, which became a reality last week. The policy has shifted from punishing people for flying, to enabling air connectivity to thrive while focusing on decarbonization measures. The most important element of that is to encourage Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). SAF is the solution that can deliver most CO2 emissions reduction in the short and medium term.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents around 65% of the solution to reaching Fly Net Zero by 2050, and to reach the levels of production needed by then, the ramp-up of SAF needs to begin now.

Policy recommendations have been split into three stages:

·short-term “quick fixes” to enable more SAF production;

·mid-term policy suggestions to ensure proper regulatory framework is in place;

·long-term actions to assess alternative energy sources as well.

In the case of Sweden, a gap analysis was conducted to understand the country’s current SAF position, what remains to be done to meet the FNZ2050 targets, and to identify business opportunities.

In this context, in May, IATA co-hosted a breakfast seminar together with the Swedish Confederation of Transport Enterprises, to present and discuss the gap analysis report. Also in attendance was the Swedish Minister for Infrastructure and Housing, the State Secretary to the Minister for Climate and Environment, as well as leaders from Preem, SAS, and Transportföretagen.

From left to right: Anna Wilson, Head of External Affairs, SAS; Helena Dyrssen, State Secretary at the Ministry of Climate and Enterprise; Andreas Carlson, Minister of Infrastructure and Housing; Magnus Heimburg, President and CEO, Preem; Rafael Schvartzman, Regional Vice President for Europe, IATA; Fredrik Kämpfe, Industry Manager Aviation; Transportföretagen

Bringing together all these stakeholders around the table resulted in a positive outcome. Shortly after the event, Sweden’s Minister of Infrastructure & Housing, Andreas Carlson. announced the Government would take significant steps to promote sustainable, fossil-free, and low-carbon fuels for aviation and shipping. Investigator Mattias Viklund has been tasked with developing an action plan, due by April 30 next year, to increase the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and shipping fuel. The plan will outline concrete measures, coordinate with relevant actors, and focus on domestic production, leveraging Sweden's resources such as forestry residuals. This initiative complements the Swedish Energy Agency's ongoing efforts to support the transition to fossil-free energy in the transport sector.

Reducing emissions in aviation and shipping is crucial, and this action plan marks an important step towards energy transition. We look forward to a continued active collaboration with the Swedish Government and call on other Governments to follow this example joining forces with the industry to work hand in hand. It is only together that we can deliver the net zero aviation of the future.

The 45Z credit is now in place through the end of 2029.
1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF.","President Donald Trump on July 4 signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The budget reconciliation package extends and updates the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and revives a tax credit benefiting small biodiesel producers but repeals several other bioenergy-related tax incentives.

The bill, H.R. 1, has undergone numerous changes since it was first introduced in May, including those related to the extension and administration of 45Z.

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The version of H.R. 1 originally passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 aimed to extend the 45Z credit for four additional years, through the end of 2031. The initial draft bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on June 16 also included a four-year extension. The Senate bill, however, was later amended to include only a two-year extension, through the end of 2029. The legislation signed by Trump enacts that two-year extension. The 45Z credit is now in place through the end of 2029.

The enacted version of H.R. 1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF. The change essentially caps the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF.

H.R. 1 also limits 45Z eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. The Senate had previously proposed to place no geographical limits on feedstock eligibility but would have reduced the value of the credit by 20% for non-U.S. feedstocks. The language on feedstock eligibility was updated prior to Senate passage of the bill.

Other changes to the 45Z credit implemented by H.R. 1 include provisions that specify that the emissions rate for eligible transportation fuel under 45Z may not be less than zero; eliminate indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel; direct the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks, including dairy manure, swine manure and poultry manure; and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities. H.R. 1 retains full transferability of the 45Z credit.

H.R. 1 also includes provisions to support small-scale biodiesel producers by updating and extending the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. That credit, which expired at the end of 2024, provided a 10-cent-per-gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of agri-biodiesel produced annually by small producers, defined to include facilities with a capacity of less than 60 MMgy. H.R. 1 extends the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit through the end of 2026 and boosts the value to 20 cents per gallon. Language included in the bill specifies that the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit can be stacked with the 45Z credit, allowing eligible producers to simultaneously claim both credits for each gallon of eligible fuel.

The legislation provides additional support for biofuel producers by extending mandatory funding under the USDA’s Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels through fiscal year 2031. That program provides payments to eligible producers to expand the production of advanced biofuels.

H.R. 1 leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact, but repeal various other bioenergy-related tax credits, including the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, which supports retail availability of E85, B20, and renewable natural gas (RNG); the clean hydrogen production tax credit; and the energy efficient home improvement credit, which, in part, supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances.

Also related to biofuels, H.R. 1 rescinds unobligated funding allocated to the U.S. EPA by the IRA to support certain functions related to the Renewable Fuel Standard. The impacted funding includes $5 million allocated to the EPA to support the development and establishment of tests and protocols regarding the environment and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive; perform internal and extramural data collection and analyses to regularly update applicable regulations, guidance, and procedures for determining lifecycle GHG emission of a fuel; and review, analyze and evaluate the impacts of all transportation fuels, including fuel lifecycle implications, on the general public and on low-income and disadvantaged communities and $10 million to the EPA to fund “new grants to industry and other related activities…to support investments in advanced biofuels.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America welcomed the extension of the 45Z and Amall Agri-Biodiesel Producer tax credits. “Clean Fuels thanks Congress for working overtime to provide certainty for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers – especially small companies – so they can resume production and industry growth. Clean Fuels especially thanks Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for securing an enhancement to the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit to help small producers as they make the transition to the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,"" said Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs. ""While the extension of the §45Z credit with transferability through 2029 provides some immediate stability, our industry continues to urge Treasury to promptly propose and finalize clear, reliable rules for the credit.”

The Iowa Biodiesel Board applauded revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit. “We commend President Trump for recognizing the critical role biodiesel can play in building next-generation energy infrastructure and driving a new industrial revolution rooted in American innovation,” said Grant Kimberley, executive director of the IBB. “ This extension sends a clear signal of stability to the marketplace and reinforces our nation’s commitment to strengthening domestic energy capacity.

“The revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit through 2026—and increasing it to 20 cents-per-gallon—is a vital lifeline to small independent producers like those in Iowa. We thank Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for championing the inclusion of that provision,” he added.

“The ability for producers to transfer the credit, the appropriate prioritization of North American feedstocks, and the removal of arbitrary indirect land use change penalties all bode well for Iowa’s biodiesel industry and soybean farmers,” Kimberley continued. For producers who have been idled or running at reduced capacity since the start of the year, this is a breath of relief and welcome signal for a bright future.”

Ethanol producer POET thanked Trump for securing the 45Z extension. “President Trump continues to reassert his support for American farmers and energy independence,” said Joshua Shields, POET’s senior vice president of corporate affairs. “With this extension signed into law, 45Z is now best positioned to transform U.S. agriculture, providing new markets for farmers and furthering biofuel energy dominance. POET thanks both President Trump and our biofuel champions in Congress for their hard-fought efforts to get this provision across the finish line.”

The American Biogas Council applauded the biogas provisions of H.R. 1. “The Act contains several helpful provisions for the biogas sector, acknowledging the enormous potential of recycling decomposable waste – from farms, food systems, and wastewater treatment plants – to produce reliable American-made energy that both generates electricity and fuels the transportation sector,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC.

“With the preservation of key incentives, including continued support for clean fuel production and power generation credits, this bill helps provide certainty for developers to plan, invest, and grow,” Serfass continued. “We are particularly encouraged by provisions that ensure American producers using U.S. and North American feedstocks can compete on a level playing field, while also maintaining appropriate values for manure-based biogas.

The Renewable Fuels Association said H.R. 1 will enhance the role of the U.S. ethanol industry in contributing to American energy security and innovation. “From the very beginning of the budget reconciliation process, our goal was to advocate for the inclusion of tax policies that provide certainty, growth opportunities, and market stability for U.S. ethanol producers. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed today accomplishes that objective. We thank the many renewable fuel supporters in Congress and President Trump for ensuring American ethanol producers and farmers had a voice and seat at the table in this process,” said Geoff Cooper, RFA president and CEO. “The extension and modifications to the 45Z clean fuel production credit, reinstatement of the Research and Development immediate expensing provisions, and improvement of the 45Q carbon sequestration and utilization credit will provide a growth-oriented tax policy climate that ethanol producers can count on, improving the role that renewable fuels can play in helping reach our nation’s energy independence goals.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol praised H.R. 1’s 45Z provisions. “We’re grateful to our Congressional champions for their steadfast leadership to support and strengthen the 45Z credit, which is remarkable considering the fact most other IRA-era tax credits were limited or phased-out in the final package.,” said Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. “While there were other improvements we had hoped to achieve in the final 45Z language, restoring transferability of the credit, removing indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, and restricting feedstock eligibility to USMCA countries will strengthen the credit from its original version.”

“In terms of the credit term, we preferred the House language which would have extended 45Z through 2031, and we also urged Congress to specifically allow low-carbon farming practices to be monetized through 45Z with the feedstock calculator and guidelines USDA has released, but nevertheless ACE remains committed to working with federal agencies to implement the credit in ways that reward on-farm conservation practices and accelerate the use of homegrown, low-carbon biofuels,” Jennings continued.

The RNG Coalition indicated the 45Z extension is vital to the sustained growth of renewable natural gas (RNG) in the U.S. “The credit will play a critical role in directing investment toward low-carbon fuels, based on lifecycle emissions performance,” said Geoff Dietz, senior director of federal government affairs at the RNG Coalition. “We look forward to working with the Department of Treasury on the implementation of several key Section 45Z provisions and would strongly encourage the agency to initiate that process soon. Clear, pragmatic, and expedient regulation will be critical to ensure that Section 45Z reflects the Congressional intent to accelerate sustainable development, deployment, and utilization of renewable gas. RNG is a vital tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, bolster energy security, reliability and affordability, and provide key benefits to diverse American communities — from farm communities in South Dakota to Staten Island in New York City where the first RNG project was sited over forty years ago.""

Growth Energy also applauded the 45Z extension. “The president wants to go big on American energy dominance, and this legislation delivers,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “An extension of 45Z will unlock billions of dollars in new investments across rural America supporting strong, stable markets for America’s farmers and positioning American biofuel producers to compete in global fuel markets. We applaud our champions in the House and Senate, who fought hard to ensure that U.S. biofuel producers are positioned to deliver more clean energy, hold down fuel costs, and restore industrial might across the heartland.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Trump_One_Big_Bill_634e504957.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:13:47.664266

With this agreement, the airline takes a major step towards becoming the world’s first low-cost narrow-body network carrier, anchored by its multi-hub strategy. The aircraft are scheduled for delivery commencing 2028 through 2032.

Witnessed by Prime Minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim who was on an official visit to France, the agreement was signed in Paris on 5 July between Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A (parent company of AirAsia), and Christian Scherer, CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

Half price to Europe and the U.S.?

With an additional three hours of flight time and higher fuel efficiency versus the A321neo, Fernandes, who is founded AirAsia 23 years ago, said the new planes enable a low-cost long-range offering to expand AirAsia’s reach as part of a renewed strategy to expand into long-haul markets, including Europe and North America.

The new narrow-body planes can fly up to nine hours, connecting Southeast Asian airports in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur with the Middle East, then hopping on to Europe in the westerly direction, while for the east, from Southeast Asia to Taiwan or Japan, then a network hop to the US.

Fernandes noted that the goal is to provide flights to Europe and the US at half the price, of what is currently available in the market. “The goal here is not to take anyone’s market share, it is to allow people to fly to places they never dreamt of flying to. I think the opportunity is huge, So really, the world is our oyster now,” he said.

“Obviously with a narrowbody fleet, with efficiency, we believe our fares to the rest of the world will be very, very, very competitive, and we will open up whole new markets,” Fernandes said. AirAsia, which operated long haul flights under AirAsia X previously, has not operated flights to Europe since 2012 and to the US since 2020.

It also means, said Fernandes, when asked by Khaosod English how the new planes will alter low-cost air traffic from Thailand, that Phuket and Chiang Mai Airports will see many direct flights between these Thai airports and cities in India and China.

Expansion in the Middle East

The airline’s parent company, Capital A, had earlier announced in May, its plans to significantly expand into Saudi Arabia, marking a pivotal step in the Group’s Middle East growth strategy. The multi-faceted initiative will begin with AirAsia introducing new routes to Riyadh and Dammam, while increasing flight frequencies to Jeddah from Kuala Lumpur.

It said that the new Riyadh route is projected to serve close to one million two-way passengers by 2026 and more than seven million by 2030.

The Group is also studying new connections from Bangkok and Jakarta to Riyadh, as part of its wider ambition to enhance Middle East connectivity across the Asean region.

Long term strategy of improving connectivity and sustainability

The next-generation A321XLRs will operate alongside AirAsia’s all-Airbus fleet of A320 Family and A330 aircraft, supporting its long-term strategy to deliver unmatched connectivity across Asia and beyond, while maintaining a low-cost model through improved route economics, enhanced aircraft utilisation and fleet efficiency.

The new fleet plays a pivotal role in this transformation. AirAsia’s multi-aircraft strategy enables the airline to match capacity with demand, reduce fuel consumption, and support a sustainable, cost-effective growth model in a highly competitive global landscape. The A321XLR also offers up to 20 per cent lower fuel burn per seat than the Airbus A321neo aircraft, significantly improving emissions performance and operating efficiency.

The first A321XLR is expected to enter service between 2027 and 2028, with long-haul operations initially handled by the A330 fleet. The group is also scheduled to take delivery of four A321LRs in 2026 as reported by Aviation Week.

150 new aircraft in the pipeline

Tony Fernandes also has been reported by NST.com that AirAsia Group is looking to order up to 150 new aircraft as part of its 15-year fleet strategy. and will be announcing its decision as early as August.

He confirmed that the airline group is in discussions with at least two aircraft manufacturers about the order, which are Embraer, for E2-family aircraft, and Airbus for its A220 programme. Fernandes also says that AirAsia is in talks with Chinese airframer Comac.

On a 10-year horizon, Fernandes noted that AirAsia plans to expand its fleet to comprise more than 500 purely narrowbody planes from its current 255 narrowbody and widebody aircraft.

Meanwhile, within the next five years, the aviation group plans to raise annual passengers carried to 130 million from 70 million currently, and boost destinations served to 175 from 143.

Malaysia Airlines orders 20 additional A330-900

Malaysia Aviation Group confirmed an order for 20 additional A330-900 aircraft, which was also announced during Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s visit to France. This latest agreement effectively doubles the airline’s future A330neo fleet to 40 aircraft.

“Countries around the world and many of our states are demanding ultra-low carbon fuels,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw. “The Big Beautiful Bill helps pave the way for the investments to produce those fuels – and to produce them from North America feedstocks.”

The biodiesel industry has struggled in 2025 from low Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending levels and uncertainty around implementation of the original 45Z tax credit, leading several Iowa biodiesel plants to idle. The bill extends the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit through 2029 and provides for transferability of the credit, in addition to restorating the small biodiesel producer tax credit for 2025 and 2026.

“The revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit through 2026—and increasing it to 20 cents-per-gallon—is a vital lifeline to small independent producers like those in Iowa. We thank Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for championing the inclusion of that provision,” said Grant Kimberley, executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board (IBB).

“The ability for producers to transfer the credit, the appropriate prioritization of North American feedstocks, and the removal of arbitrary indirect land use change penalties all bode well for Iowa’s biodiesel industry and soybean farmers. For producers who have been idled or running at reduced capacity since the start of the year, this is a breath of relief and welcome signal for a bright future.”

Because many changes to the 45Z tax credit become effective in 2026, IBB urged prompt, clear rules and guidance from the U.S. Treasury implementing the tax credit both for 2025 and beyond.

In an unexpected move, the bill lowered the incentive for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from $1.75 to $1.00 and made technical changes which make it difficult for a SAF producer using ethanol as their feedstock to claim the credit.

CORSIA is the world’s first global market-based measure to manage carbon emissions from a specific sector—international aviation.
The GSLTF proposal, according to IATA, contradicts the original international agreement to treat CORSIA as the sole mechanism, and risks creating a fragmented and inefficient climate policy landscape.
Rather than duplicating efforts, IATA urges states to support CORSIA, particularly by ensuring access to carbon credits essential for airline compliance.
IATA warned that this could ultimately reduce affordability and hinder economic growth—particularly in regions dependent on aviation.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed strong disappointment over the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force’s (GSLTF) proposal to impose levies on air travel as a means of boosting domestic revenues for developing countries and supporting global initiatives such as climate change mitigation, pandemic preparedness, and other development goals.

According to IATA, an initial review of the GSLTF proposal reveals several serious flaws:

Air Travel Industry Margins Are Slim, Not Excessive

While the GSLTF lacks detailed justification, it references a CE Delft estimate suggesting a premium flyer levy could generate €78 billion (over $90 billion) annually—nearly three times the global airline industry’s projected 2024 profit of $32.4 billion. IATA points out that the industry operates on a structurally thin average profit margin of just 3.4%, about half the global average across all sectors. Any new financial burdens could therefore jeopardize industry viability.

Airlines Are Already Investing Heavily in Sustainability

The airline sector has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050—a transition expected to cost $4.7 trillion between 2024 and 2050. IATA warns that additional taxes could undermine the sector’s ability to fund these sustainability efforts, ultimately weakening its contribution to global GDP (3.9%) and employment (86.5 million jobs), while addressing its 2.5% share of global carbon emissions.

A Global Climate Framework for Aviation Already Exists

IATA criticized the GSLTF for overlooking the existing Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). CORSIA is the world’s first global market-based measure to manage carbon emissions from a specific sector—international aviation. The GSLTF proposal, according to IATA, contradicts the original international agreement to treat CORSIA as the sole mechanism, and risks creating a fragmented and inefficient climate policy landscape. Rather than duplicating efforts, IATA urges states to support CORSIA, particularly by ensuring access to carbon credits essential for airline compliance.

No Impact Assessment on Economies or Travelers

IATA also pointed out that the GSLTF has not provided any assessment of how the proposed levies would impact the economies of the target countries or the global air travel market. While the proposal claims to target premium travel, it fails to acknowledge the critical role premium passengers play in supporting route viability. Penalizing this segment could disrupt connectivity and increase costs for all travelers and businesses relying on air cargo. IATA warned that this could ultimately reduce affordability and hinder economic growth—particularly in regions dependent on aviation.

“The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “Governments are proposing a tax that’s three times the industry’s profit, without considering the real-world consequences. These include impacts on remote communities, tourism, and trade—all of which depend on aviation. Moreover, history shows that such taxes often vanish into general budgets with little, if any, benefit for climate initiatives.”

Walsh also challenged the GSLTF’s claim that these levies would not affect the cost of living. “That’s simply not true. If implemented, these recommendations would raise travel costs across the board, weaken connectivity, and severely limit aviation’s ability to invest in reaching net zero by 2050,” he said.

He emphasized that the aviation industry is not avoiding its climate responsibilities. Airlines are actively investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), operational efficiencies, and cleaner technologies. “What we don’t need,” Walsh added, “is a $90 billion tax that drains resources from these critical efforts. Supporting SAF production is a far more effective way to achieve the GSLTF’s goals without undermining air connectivity and economic growth.”

Public Opinion Backs Aviation, Not More Taxes

IATA also cited global public opinion research conducted by Savanta in 15 countries, which found broad skepticism toward aviation taxation:

73% believe green taxes amount to government greenwashing

79% say there are already too many taxes on flying

78% think taxes are not the way to make aviation more sustainable

74% don’t trust governments to spend tax revenue wisely

88% say any taxes collected should go directly to improving air travel

Only 9% of respondents supported taxation as a way to address aviation’s carbon emissions. Alternatives like SAF investment (25%), clean technology (23%), emissions research (18%), and offsetting (13%) were significantly more popular.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-6.png,N,,2025-07-07 14:16:57.171166

Market Lock-In: The Boeing 777X exclusively uses GE9X engines, creating a moat against competitors as airlines like China Airlines expand their fleets.
For China Airlines: - Fuel savings from the GE9X's efficiency could reduce annual fuel costs by millions, directly improving profitability.
The China Airlines deal exemplifies a recurring-revenue model that insulates the company from cyclical downturns.","The aviation sector is undergoing a seismic shift toward sustainability and efficiency, and GE Aerospace has positioned itself at the forefront. Its recently announced multi-year service agreement with China Airlines for the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) of GE9X engines underscores a strategic play to dominate Asia-Pacific markets while aligning with global decarbonization trends. This partnership is not merely a transaction—it's a blueprint for long-term value creation through recurring revenue, technological leadership, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance.

Why This Deal Matters

The agreement covers MRO services for GE9X engines powering China Airlines' 14 new Boeing 777X aircraft, a fleet expansion critical to the airline's growth in the Asia-Pacific region. The GE9X, the world's most powerful commercial engine, offers 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor, the GE90-115B, and is fully compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This combination of performance and sustainability makes it a game-changer for airlines like China Airlines, which operate in a region where rising fuel costs and regulatory pressure to reduce emissions are top priorities.

Strategic Dominance in Asia-Pacific MRO Markets

GE's partnership with China Airlines builds on decades of trust. Since 1999, China Airlines has relied on GE engines for its Boeing 747-400, 777-300ER, and 787 fleets. The GE9X deal extends this relationship into the 2030s, securing predictable revenue streams for GE's Commercial Engines and Services division.

Key advantages for GE:

1. Regional Infrastructure: GE's existing MRO hubs in Malaysia and Xiamen, China, ensure rapid, cost-effective servicing for Asia-Pacific airlines.

This ESG alignment positions GE as a leader in green aviation—a critical factor for investors prioritizing sustainability.

For China Airlines, the deal reduces fuel costs (a major operational expense) and strengthens its brand reputation as an eco-conscious carrier. Both parties benefit from regulatory tailwinds: the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and Asia-Pacific SAF mandates will only amplify demand for GE's engines.

Financial Implications: Recurring Revenue and Operational Resilience

While the agreement's exact financial terms remain undisclosed, its structure is typical of MRO contracts—fixed fees per engine, plus variable costs for unexpected repairs. For GE:

- The deal secures recurring revenue with minimal capital expenditure, boosting margins.

- Long-term service agreements (LTSAs) often include penalties for underperformance, incentivizing operational excellence.

For China Airlines:

- Fuel savings from the GE9X's efficiency could reduce annual fuel costs by millions, directly improving profitability.

- Predictable maintenance costs lower financial volatility, crucial amid rising oil prices.

GE's Commercial Engines division has grown at a 6% CAGR since 2020, outpacing aerospace peers.

Risks and Considerations

Geopolitical Tensions: China Airlines' operations in Taiwan could introduce political risks, though GE's deep-rooted partnerships in the region mitigate this.

Regulatory Delays: SAF adoption hinges on government incentives, which may vary by country.

Technological Competition: Rival engines like Rolls-Royce's Trent XWB-Widebody aim to challenge GE's dominance.

Investment Thesis: Add GE to Your Portfolio

Investors seeking exposure to aviation decarbonization and Asia-Pacific growth should consider GE. The China Airlines deal exemplifies a recurring-revenue model that insulates the company from cyclical downturns. Additionally:

- Valuation: GE trades at 12x forward EV/EBITDA, below its five-year average of 14x, offering a margin of safety.

- Dividend Yield: A 2.1% yield complements growth, appealing to income-focused investors.

- Sustainability Momentum: GE's ESG profile is improving, with 85% of 2023 R&D spending directed toward low-emission tech.

Ltd has officially announced the implementation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on its commercial flights. This initiative, which commenced on July 1, 2025, is a cornerstone of the airline’s ongoing ‘Low Carbon Skies by Bangkok Airways’ campaign.

This widespread adoption follows a successful pilot program initiated in 2024, where Bangkok Airways began utilizing SAF on a test flight operating between Samui and Bangkok. Building on the insights and success of this pilot, the airline is now expanding its SAF usage to commercial routes. The initial phase of this commercial integration will see SAF-blended fuel used on flights departing from Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) to key international destinations. These include Phnom Penh and Siem Reap in Cambodia, Luang Prabang in Laos, and the Maldives, showcasing Bangkok Airways’ commitment to extending its environmental efforts across its international network.

Initially, Bangkok Airways will incorporate SAF at a blend ratio of 1% with 99% Jet A-1 fuel. Even at this initial blending percentage, the environmental benefits are substantial. This blend is projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an average of approximately 128 kg of CO2 per flight. While seemingly a modest percentage, this incremental reduction across numerous flights will contribute significantly to the airline's overall emission reduction targets and sets a precedent for higher blend rates in the future as SAF production increases and becomes more widely available.

Captain Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth, President of Bangkok Airways, emphasized the significance of this transition. ""The official use of SAF on commercial flights marks a significant milestone in the airline’s transition toward a more environmentally friendly aviation future,"" stated Captain Prasarttong-Osoth. He further elaborated that this initiative is directly aligned with the overarching goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions, a core principle of sustainability policies within the global aviation sector.

The airline's 'Low Carbon Skies by Bangkok Airways' campaign is a testament to its proactive approach to environmental stewardship. By investing in and adopting sustainable aviation technologies like SAF, Bangkok Airways is not only meeting growing regulatory pressures but also demonstrating leadership in an industry grappling with its environmental impact. This move is expected to inspire other airlines in the region to follow suit, fostering a collective push towards more sustainable aviation practices across Southeast Asia.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-07 13:17:34.688069

The Vietnamese government has committed to join the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global climate initiative aimed at reducing carbon emissions from international flights.

By regulating emissions and using carbon credits, it is expected to attract at least USD 5.6 million in annual investment into its carbon market. However, the move may also impose significant financial burdens on the country’s aviation sector.

Aligning with global standards may raise costs for airlines

Launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016, CORSIA uses market-based measures to help the global aviation industry meet its climate goals. Vietnam plans to join in 2026, final voluntary phase of the scheme, and gradually reduce its aviation emissions. The goal is to cap emissions at 85% of 2019 levels during 2024–2035 and to reach net zero by 2035.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, the government has already taken essential steps to join CORSIA, including issuing regulations on aviation fuel usage and emission tracking, implementing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for international flights, and submitting historical emission data (2019–2024) to ICAO.

ICAO praised Vietnam’s participation, noting that it demonstrates higher-than-expected readiness among developing countries. Initial estimates suggest Vietnamese airlines may spend an additional USD 5.6 million to USD 37.5 million annually on carbon credits.

Vietnamese authorities have also raised concerns that domestic airlines could face steep costs. During the voluntary phase, the total carbon offset expense is projected at USD 13 million to USD 92 million, depending on the carbon credit market price—which currently ranges between USD 6 and USD 40 per metric ton of CO₂-equivalent.

Thanks to the rebound in international air travel and a successful debt restructuring, Vietnam Airlines posted a record net profit of VND 7.95 trillion (approx. USD 304 million) in 2024. At its shareholder meeting, the airline’s executives reaffirmed plans to modernize the fleet to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. The company is also actively exploring greater use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Vietnam Airlines conducted its first SAF-blended flight in 2024 on a route from Singapore to Hanoi. Later that year, it operated six domestic flights with SAF to mark World Environment Day.

Meanwhile, budget carrier Vietjet Air is preparing to participate in CORSIA and is investing heavily in fuel-efficient aircraft. In late June, the airline placed an order with Airbus for 100 A321neo narrow-body jets, which offer at least a 20% improvement in fuel efficiency. These aircraft can operate with up to 50% SAF content.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1751868497478828173.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:17:41.440265

Researchers from around the globe will this week attend the inaugural International Conference on Sustainable Aviation Research (ICSAR).

The three-day conference will shine a light on the collaborative work taking place that aims to develop and commercialise novel sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technologies, which will be pivotal in reducing carbon emissions in the years to come.

Developments in this area have accelerated in recent years, with researchers from Trinity establishing themselves as key players in this space. Last year, for example, the Trinity College Dublin Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Research Facility gained a new home at SMBC Aviation Capital’s new global headquarters at Fitzwilliam 28, in Dublin’s city centre.

Stephen Dooley, Professor in Trinity’s School of Physics, said: “As society moves towards net-zero carbon emissions, the associated transitions bring forth unique challenges that span industry, academia, and government entities at all levels. Making aviation more sustainable in this regard is just a piece of the puzzle but a significant one nonetheless, and we at Trinity are proud to provide international leadership.”

“For example, Trinity is the delivery partner for the ‘pre-screening' service of the EU SAF Clearing House managed by the EU Aviation Safety Authority, meaning our team essentially helps new SAF producers understand and stick to the strict rules of fuel evaluation processes, ensuring next-gen fuels are safe and of high quality. In addition, the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre hosted by Trinity covers several research areas, looking at how to cut down greenhouse gases from planes and exploring new technologies for cleaner flying.”

“ICSAR 2025 will foster multidisciplinary dialogue on SAF research, development, policy, and implementation. This forum will not only promote vital collaboration across sectors but also ensure that today’s students receive the comprehensive, systems-level education and exposure necessary to continue driving innovation in this critically important field.”",https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/top-stories/featured/icsar-2025-conference/media/tcd/news-images/artturi-jalli-Su1gc1A63xE-unsplash-RS.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:17:12.889541

Now, the airport is looking to cement its status as an innovator when it opens its new central terminal in October. The industry's first on-airport, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) refinery is also in the plans.

CEO Christina Cassotis said during an interview at the IATA Annual General Meeting in New Delhi last month that she hopes construction on the refinery will begin next year.

The microgrid enables Pittsburgh Airport to be energy self-sufficient, a status that looked especially significant this spring, when power grid failures shut down London Heathrow and, in a separate incident, caused widespread flight disruptions at airports in Portugal and Spain.

Cassotis said the credibility Pittsburgh has achieved from having the microgrid should help it line up partners and purchase agreements for the SAF facility. She first announced her goal of refining SAF within the airport's 3,000 remaining acres in 2023. But after a deal that was in the works didn't come to fruition last year, the airport has secured an agreement with New Jersey-based clean fuels developer Avina, whose production facility would refine alcohol into SAF using Swedish technology licensed to the Houston-based firm KBR.

The refinery would produce 120 million gallons of SAF annually, Cassotis said, 70 million of which could be used at Pittsburgh Airport, with the remainder to be piped off-site and then shipped via rivers to airports in the Northeast, Midwest and Canada.

""We're going to get to final investment in the next six months,"" Cassotis said. ""Then it's just a question of when do you stick the shovel in the ground.""

Inside the new terminal

In the meantime, the airport hopes to grab attention with the opening of its tech-forward $1.7 billion central terminal this fall.

For example, said airport chief information officer Deepak Nayyar, the airport built its own data platform that will be able to assimilate information from various airport systems to help with cross-departmental decision-making.

Using data and AI, Pittsburgh Airport hopes to deploy predictive technology to facilitate tasks as varied as managing parking capacity, advising flyers on when they should leave their home and proactively replacing airport machinery before it breaks.

For enhanced security, the new terminal will also have segmented operating networks, which Cassotis said is a rarity in the airport industry. So, for example, if the baggage claim network falls victim to a cyberattack, the airport will be able to localize and fix the problem while other airport functions continue operating.

As far as features that everyday airport users will notice, Cassotis pointed to the design's comprehensive focus on accessibility, which accounts not only for those with mobility impairments but for caregivers and the hearing- and vision-impaired.

""Everything from signage height and placement to making sure people who are colorblind can distinguish contrast,"" the CEO said.

Flyers will also notice the terminal's overall aesthetic, which architect Luis Vidal described in a 2022 Travel Weekly interview as being like ""a pavilion surrounded by natural light, and by wood and by terraces.""

Large, accessible outdoor spaces will be one of the terminal's most notable characteristics.

""It really is beautiful,"" Cassotis said. ""It reflects Pittsburgh very nicely. It almost tells you about a community you don't know about, just through the design itself. And candidly, it makes sense. It's been very thoughtful, and I think it's going to change the way people feel when they travel.""",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/Art/2025/0623/T0623PITRendering_c_HR.jpg?n=2740&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-07-07 13:17:45.359873

The mechanism is part of a broader strategy to ensure a more secure energy supply, diversification, and decarbonisation.

The Hydrogen Mechanism is designed to facilitate the market development of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives, including ammonia, methanol, and electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF).

The newly launched mechanism aims to empower market participants by matching and aggregating demand and supply.

It will assist in identifying infrastructure development needs and provide easier access to information on financial solutions, thus supporting the EU’s decarbonisation and energy independence objectives.

European Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen said: “With the Hydrogen Mechanism launched …, we empower the European industry to seize competitive opportunities while advancing towards greater security of supply and decarbonisation. This is only the beginning of our work under the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform, which shows that Europe is not just adapting to the future, it is actively shaping it.”

The stakeholders can register on the platform and subscribe to the EU Hydrogen Mechanism, with the first demand and supply matching session scheduled for September 2025.

The Raw Materials Mechanism and the Gas Mechanism are set to be introduced in the forthcoming months.

Hydrogen is increasingly recognised for its role in decarbonising industries where reducing carbon emissions is both urgent and challenging.

The EU’s commitment to climate neutrality by 2050 and its goal to become independent from Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027 underscore the importance of hydrogen and its derivatives.

The bill, which initially stalled when House leadership encountered resistance from deficit hawks over approving procedural rules, was signed into law by the President on 4 July 2025. The bill includes major changes to clean energy tax credits and vehicle efficiency and emissions standards, which are outlined as follows.

Clean Fuels

Notably, the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Credit, which was set to expire in 2031 per earlier versions of the bill, is now set to end after 31 December 2029. The final bill also applies a restriction on foreign feedstocks. This could limit the growth of clean fuels such as renewable diesel, specifically for coastal facilities that rely on imported feedstocks to produce cleaner fuels. The bill also reduces the amount of crediting eligible for Sustainable Aviation Fuel but confirms that manure-based biogas remains eligible for the credit.

Carbon Sequestration and Enhanced Oil Recovery

The 45Q Tax Credit for Carbon Sequestration was left intact, with the tax credit for enhanced oil recovery being expanded to be on par with the credits received for geologic storage. This could encourage carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) activities being carried out at oil and refining facilities.

Zero-Emission Vehicle and Efficiency Standards

Additional Updates

The bill also modifies the 45V Clean Hydrogen Credit by making facilities that begin construction after 31 December 2028 no longer eligible. While this is seen as an extension given previous iterations suggested making this date 31 December 2025, this is still a lower window compared to the original 2033 date in the Inflation Reduction Act. While this may still benefit clean hydrogen projects, the limited time frame may hinder the commercial adoption of certain projects. The bill also keeps battery and solar tax credit eligibility through 2032 but ends crediting for wind projects in 2027 and phases out mineral credits by 2033. Finally, the bill doubles the biodiesel producer credit and extends it through 2026, strengthening margins for smaller Midwest and Northwest producers serving clean fuel markets.

Impact on Carbon Markets

The dismantling of foundational policy tools that pushed automakers toward fleet-wide electrification and rollbacks of incentives for clean fuel production risk stalling climate progress across the country, moving further away from the 1.5-degree warming target. While some revisions may in fact support near-term growth in clean fuels, the broader structural shifts that this bill introduces jeopardize overall decarbonization. Reduced federal incentives that supported achieving targets and emission reduction goals under Low-Carbon-Fuel Standards and Cap-and-Invest programs may slow the rate of emissions decline, adding bullish pressure to the programs.

This regulatory rollback may force states like California to reassess targets with respect to fuels’ carbon intensity, ZEV adoption, and overall emission forecasts in carbon markets.

Among these, Shougang LanzaTech's postponed Hong Kong IPO has drawn attention—not just for its potential as a carbon capture and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pioneer, but for the uncertainties clouding its path. Investors now face a classic dilemma: Can the company's strategic advantages in the green energy transition offset near-term risks tied to regulatory and legal ambiguities?

The Hong Kong IPO Boom: A Tailwind for ESG Plays

Hong Kong's IPO activity has soared in early 2025, with listings up 40% year-over-year as companies seek to avoid U.S. regulatory scrutiny and tap into Asia's growing pool of ESG-focused capital. . This trend is particularly favorable for firms like Shougang LanzaTech, which straddles the intersection of industrial decarbonization and aviation's urgent need for SAF.

The company's core technology—converting industrial carbon emissions into ethanol and SAF—aligns with Hong Kong's push to position itself as a leader in Asia's green finance ecosystem. Regulatory tailwinds include the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's revised ESG listing rules, which now mandate clearer sustainability disclosures, favoring transparent firms like LanzaTech.

Shougang LanzaTech's Strategic Advantages

Shougang LanzaTech combines the industrial clout of Shougang Group, China's steel giant, with LanzaTech's proprietary gas fermentation technology. Its 30-million-gallon SAF facilities in the UK and EU, leveraging CirculAir™, could position it as a key supplier to airlines aiming to meet 2030 emissions targets. Cost-cutting measures—including a 10-15% workforce reduction and spinning off non-core subsidiaries—signal a strategic pivot from R&D to commercial scale, a move critical for profitability.

The company's partnership with Rothschild & Co. to explore strategic transactions adds further upside potential, though execution risks remain. Its postponement of the Hong Kong IPO, while concerning, could reflect a deliberate strategy to address lingering regulatory questions before accessing Hong Kong's deep capital pools.

Risks and the Legal Gray Zone

Despite its strengths, Shougang LanzaTech faces two critical risks. First, the reasons for its IPO postponement remain opaque. While no specific legal disputes are publicly documented, delays in its U.S. SEC filings—pushed to May 24, 2025—hint at operational and regulatory challenges. Delays in financial reporting often correlate with investor skepticism, as seen in LanzaTech Global Inc.'s stock, which has underperformed the S&P 500 by ~25% over the past year.

Second, the company's reliance on industrial carbon capture raises execution hurdles. Scaling SAF production requires stable feedstock (e.g., carbon from steel plants), regulatory permits, and partnerships with airlines—a complex ecosystem where missteps could derail growth. Competitors like Velocys and Neste are also expanding rapidly, intensifying market pressures.

Valuation: A Balancing Act

The IPO's valuation hinges on two factors: the clarity of its regulatory path and the market's appetite for high-risk, high-reward ESG plays. If the postponement resolves lingering concerns—such as disclosure gaps or partnership terms—the Hong Kong market's current enthusiasm for green tech could support a premium valuation. However, if delays persist, fears of legal entanglements or execution failures may cap investor interest.

Investors should also weigh broader macro trends. Hong Kong's ESG-linked bond issuance hit record highs in Q1 2025, signaling strong demand for aligned equities. Yet, the market's recent volatility, driven by geopolitical jitters and interest rate uncertainty, could amplify risks for unproven IPOs.

Investment Takeaways

Wait for Clarity: The IPO postponement is a red flag, but not an automatic deal-breaker. Investors should demand transparency on the delay's cause and progress toward regulatory compliance before committing.

Focus on Execution: Monitor the launch of SAF facilities in the UK/EU and partnerships with airlines. Successful commercialization could validate LanzaTech's business model.

Consider the Market Cycle: Hong Kong's IPO boom may provide a window to access ESG capital, but bargain hunters might prefer waiting for a post-IPO price correction if the listing proceeds.

Conclusion

Shougang LanzaTech embodies both the promise and perils of the green energy transition. Its technology is undeniably cutting-edge, and Hong Kong's IPO boom offers a strategic platform to scale. Yet, the company's ability to navigate regulatory and operational hurdles will determine whether it becomes a leader or a cautionary tale. For investors, patience—and a close watch on the SEC filing deadline—will be rewarded.

In a market hungry for ESG solutions, the stakes are high. But without resolution to its delays, Shougang LanzaTech's IPO remains a gamble best reserved for those willing to bet on long-term carbon capture upside—and able to stomach near-term uncertainty.",,N,,2025-07-07 12:15:52.514924

Papeles de Energía, N.º 28 (julio 2025)

1. Intervención inicial

El desarrollo de los biocombustibles comienza con la primera crisis del petróleo, con el etanol. Posteriormente se introduce el biodiesel, que tiene el inconveniente de que únicamente se puede mezclar en cantidades limitadas. Pero, en cualquiera de los dos casos, solamente se han podido utilizar gracias a las desgravaciones fiscales, ya que nunca fueron competitivos con los combustibles convencionales.

Con la subida de los precios del petróleo previa a la crisis financiera de 2007-2008, se dispara la demanda de biocombustibles, y aparecen los problemas asociados a su competencia con los productos destinados a la alimentación. Esto lleva a la aparición de los biocombustibles de 2ª generación, esto es, aquellos basados en materias primas no utilizables para alimentación.

El paso siguiente es el desarrollo del HVO (aceite hidrogenado), que se puede mezclar en cualquier cantidad con el diesel. Al principio se elaboró con aceite de palma, pero los problemas de deforestación hacen que se sustituya por residuos o aceite usado (UCO). Los residuos (del aceite de palma) explican que los mayores exportadores actuales de HVO sean China, Malasia e Indonesia, y lo que hace surgir dudas sobre la sostenibilidad de este suministro a medio plazo.

A futuro, hay distintas vías de producción que pueden tener interés:

Una alternativa es la gasificación de la biomasa, un proceso tecnológicamente probado cuyo mayor inconveniente es el coste.

La vía del biometanol también es muy interesante, porque se puede producir gasolinas y olefinas a partir de esta materia prima. El metanol también se podría producir a partir de hidrógeno y CO2.

El biometano también presenta un potencial de interés, aunque limitado. Su coste está cercano a la competitividad, sobre todo si la recogida de los residuos es obligatoria.

El SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) tiene como problema fundamental el coste. Para 2040 se espera que su coste sea 3-4 veces superior al del queroseno.

Para concluir: la perspectiva de unos biocombustibles baratos capaces de alimentar la transición energética es dudosa, salvo que se asuma su mayor coste. Para el sector de la aviación y marítimo, o quizá para algún proceso industrial, pueden tener sentido. Pero, en general, son una solución necesaria, pero parcial. En este sentido, los objetivos europeos ya son ambiciosos, pero los del PNIEC superan esta categoría.

2. DEBATE

A continuación, se abre el debate en el que se ponen de manifiesto las siguientes opiniones:

Acerca de la sostenibilidad de los biocombustibles

Incluso aunque sean biocombustibles de 2ª generación hay una competencia indirecta por el uso de la tierra, que debe ser tenida en cuenta a la hora de valorar su sostenibilidad o las emisiones evitadas. Esto hace difícil pensar que exista un potencial muy elevado.

• A este respecto, es preciso afinar la regulación de las materias primas permitidas para producir HVO renovable.

La regulación actual española es más estricta que la europea en términos de usos de suelo.

Los biocombustibles utilizados en España reducen un 82 % de emisiones.

Acerca de la disponibilidad de materias primas

La restricción fundamental para que los biocombustibles crezcan está en el acceso a las materias primas. Se defiende que la Comisión Europea debería ampliar la lista de materias disponibles.

La correlación temporal para producir los RFNBO y la adicionalidad es muy restrictiva.

Si España es líder en porcino, no se explica la falta de exigencia de los purines. Lo primero es exigir el tratamiento de residuos.

Por otra parte, no se espera que la disponibilidad de residuos crezca mucho si avanzamos en economía circular, eficiencia, etcétera.

No se entiende que la biomasa no se pueda usar para producir los RFNBO.

Se apunta a un informe realizado por Imperial College, UK, en el que se defiende que existe en la UE materia prima más que suficiente para cumplir los objetivos.

Acerca de su competitividad económica

El aumento de costes respecto a los convencionales no es relevante: ese modelo tradicional ya no es la alternativa. Eso habría que explicarlo bien.

Las economías de escala pueden permitir reducir significativamente el precio.

La forma más barata actualmente para producir biocombustibles es coprocesarlos en refinería.

Cada vez hay más acoplamiento entre sectores. Y en un contexto en que hay limitación en la materia prima, cada vez hay más competencia entre sectores por los combustibles. Y esto se puede traducir en escalada de costes. ¿Quién pagará más?

La regulación va a influir mucho en esto: por ejemplo, en cómo se computan las emisiones. Por ejemplo, los residuos ganaderos “valen” mucho más que los agrícolas.

No trasponemos las directivas de residuos, porque eso es competencia de los ayuntamientos. Esto explica que no haya coste de tratamiento de los residuos.

España debería tener una normativa mucho más estricta sobre los residuos para aumentar la disponibilidad y bajar el coste. Hay que darles también una vuelta a los certificados de origen. Y el tema de entorno internacional.

Para que el ahorro privado invierta hace falta que tenga un retorno claro y transparente. Ese es el principal problema de la industria de los bios.

En España el coste de transporte de los bios es mucho mayor que en otros países.

El riesgo tecnológico sigue siendo muy alto, y eso exige alta rentabilidad. Los offtakers dicen que no es un problema de CAPEX, sino de OPEX.

El modelo de negocio del biometano es muy difícil de estandarizar.

Acerca del papel de los biocombustibles en la transición

En España el lobby agrícola no es tan poderoso como en Francia o en EE. UU., lo que explica en parte el poco desarrollo que ha tenido lugar.

Los biocombustibles son imprescindibles para cumplir los muy ambiciosos objetivos de descarbonización del transporte.

En el sector aéreo hace falta al menos un 70 % de SAF para cumplir los objetivos.

El sector marítimo y aéreo son difíciles de electrificar, con la complicación de que son negocios globales.

Los objetivos del PNIEC son poco creíbles. Pero es una ruta viable/imprescindible siempre que la regulación se adapte.

El PNIEC se ha elaborado en un contexto ideológico distinto del que impera ahora en Europa. La captura de CO2, la economía circular, van a hacer que se revisen todas estas cuestiones, hacia un plan más posibilista.

Los planes hay que hacerlos desde la demanda, no para mantener la estructura de la oferta. Hay que pensar en cómo va a evolucionar la demanda.

Esta transición, para poder hacerse muy rápido, necesita mucho dinero. Para bios, H2, los RFNBO. Y ese dinero no lo tienen los países europeos. Y los ciudadanos no están dispuestos a pagar más. Hay que buscar cómo involucrar a los ciudadanos. O somos capaces de lograr que el ciudadano vea un retorno, o esto se queda en papel. Una opción es ofrecer bonos del Estado para los ciudadanos, y que gane dinero con ello.

Sería más interesante enfocarse en los productos finales: cemento verde, acero verde, amoníaco verde. Y no tanto en la producción de bios o H2.

Es muy importante también contar con reglas de comercio global en estos productos verdes, certificación homogénea.

El sector del automóvil está en una crisis seria, en parte por la incertidumbre. Hay necesidad de hacer compatibles los objetivos de descarbonización con los de mantenimiento de la competitividad de la industria europea. Los biocombustibles pueden jugar un papel ahí.",https://www.funcas.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/funcas-32x32-1.png,N,,2025-07-07 09:11:38.873682

A key short-term challenge that stands out in the recent Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook 2025 is the availability and cost of sustainable aviation fuel.

Geopolitical headwinds and a shaky economic outlook make this a critical moment for concerted action to keep net-zero aviation within the collective grasp by 2050.

Aviation is a tough industry to decarbonize, not least because efficiency gains need to keep pace with increasing air traffic demand.

With air traffic projected to double by 2042 from around 12 billion passengers a year, net-zero aviation, currently targeted for 2050, feels a long way off. Recent data from the environmental group Transport & Environment reveals that emissions from European airline flights will be 4% above 2019 levels by the end of December 2025 – further evidence of the challenge to decarbonize.

“Nobody in the industry can wave a magic wand or work very hard and accomplish carbon neutrality or sustainability by themselves. They really need to have everybody in the industry working collaboratively,” Justin Erbacci, director general of Airports Council International World, told Radio Davos.

There are many ways to reduce the climate impact of flying; some can be adopted almost immediately, such as using more and better-quality sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% on a lifecycle basis.

Others will take more time, such as aircraft powered by batteries, which could materialize within the next decades or hydrogen, which has the potential to power larger, longer-distance flights in the longer term.

Of all the challenges highlighted in the recent Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook 2025 – which collates insights from top aviation executives, there is one in particular that stands out in the short term: the availability and cost of SAF.

“

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is well within our collective grasp.

”

The SAF bottleneck

It is a chicken-and-egg problem. While there may be demand for SAF from airlines, supply is limited and prices are projected to remain two to three times higher than jet fuel until 2030. However, it will be hard to boost production and reduce production costs without reaching greater scale.

SAF producers need to be confident that demand will continue to grow and need long-term offtake agreements to obtain the necessary funding to build production facilities from financiers.

According to Paul Griffiths, chief executive officer of Dubai Airports, “The global jet fuel market is worth around $254 billion per year, with SAF representing just 0.7% of total fuel production.”

If SAF production doubles every two years, he says, it would still take over seven and a half years for 10% of total jet fuel to come from sustainable sources.

“It’s a very big problem. It needs a big solution, and it needs huge investment,” says Griffiths.

“Industry and governments have got to work together to create a level playing field of investment that doesn’t incentivize poor behaviour.” He notes that one solution would be a levy on aviation fuel or ticket prices, such as the scheme recently applied in Singapore, where just under $2 per passenger is channelled towards SAF production.

Although it would result in “justifiable” costs being passed on to the consumer, he says “We could actually solve the problem if that was applied on a global basis.” Recently, the UK government also proposed a levy on fossil jet fuel to fund local SAF production.

High-stakes need for policy alignment

The introduction of new measures and regulations to support SAF by an increasing number of countries strengthens the importance of international standards and policy consistency.

To encourage investment and consistent SAF adoption worldwide, SAF policies benefit from international alignment and any subsidies to incentivise their production must provide long-term clarity to investors. If countries don’t act in unison in these areas, policy effectiveness will suffer.

Ayesha Choudhury, chief commercial officer at Infinium – a market leader in ultra-low carbon synthetic efuels – says “policy certainty” is key: “predictable revenue… that’s enabled by policy certainty… is really important for off-takers to be able to commit to the long- term agreements that are necessary to get the plants built.”

A great risk is that geopolitical headwinds can slow down aviation decarbonization efforts. Increasing protectionism and tariffs are sparking particular concern among aviation executives.

Geopolitical tensions are destabilizing exports of feedstock, the raw material for SAF, as well as fuelling domestic energy security concerns. With supply chains under stress, feedstock prices are rising, further squeezing the margins of active SAF plants and affecting their production outlooks.

In addition to political risks, magnified by last year’s “super elections” that threaten to shift government priorities and lead to policy reversals, there are also economic ones.

Despite lower inflation and strong growth in the aviation sector, with revenues exceeding $1 trillion for the first time this year, the global economic outlook remains a concern for aviation executives, particularly in emerging markets.

Net zero is within reach

Route closures, rising labour costs, supply chain bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty are impacting profitability and could divert the sector’s focus from the net-zero agenda.

This is a critical moment for the aviation industry. Updated state action plans for decarbonization are due to be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organisation by September, as stakeholders try to walk the fine line between accelerating decarbonization and boosting the sector’s growth in the wake of COVID-19.

Actions taken now will determine the viability of internationally agreed targets, such as reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5% by 2030.

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is well within our collective grasp. SAF will undoubtedly play a key role in this journey, especially in the short to medium term. But it will not, by itself, be enough.

As other technologies become increasingly available, swift and concerted action – from governments and regulators to airports, airlines and businesses along the wider value chain – will be critical.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_p4ajZPSgg-YrLk_SDFrWyLvjcfZX-JMquK0fhOAU3nU.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:12:01.931431

Yet, every progressive policy shift, especially from nations with growing air transport networks, signals momentum toward a greener future. Recently, Turkey unveiled a transformative policy directive focused on Sustainable Aviation Fuel, marking a defining moment for its civil aviation sector. This new regulatory framework serves as more than just an environmental benchmark — it reflects a deeper commitment to aligning domestic capabilities with international sustainability norms.

A Policy Rooted in Strategy and Vision

Turkey’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel directive is not merely a compliance mechanism. It represents a strategic blueprint aligned with the nation’s net zero by 2053 ambition. By embedding sustainability into the regulatory structure of its aviation sector, Turkey is signaling its intention to be a proactive player in climate stewardship — not just a respondent to global pressure.

The directive encompasses wide-reaching requirements, from minimum SAF usage thresholds to domestic fuel sourcing obligations. Such stipulations do not arise in isolation. They are designed to simultaneously boost industrial capability, strengthen energy security, and ensure alignment with standards such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.

Domestic Production as a Pillar of Progress

A key feature of the directive is its focus on cultivating local SAF production. By encouraging investment in domestic refining infrastructure, Turkey is not only reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels but also seeding innovation in its energy and technology sectors. This is an often overlooked yet powerful enabler of long-term emissions reduction: homegrown capacity.

The inclusion of players like Tupras and SOCAR Turkey in early-stage SAF development is promising. Their involvement indicates that the policy is not aspirational alone — it is already attracting serious investment and technical momentum. By 2026, commercial-scale production is expected to begin, positioning Turkey as a credible contributor to the global SAF supply chain.

Regulatory Clarity and Market Confidence

The directive outlines that Turkey’s Civil Aviation Directorate will annually publish SAF usage and minimum emission reduction requirements. This commitment to regulatory transparency is critical for market stability and stakeholder preparedness.

Moreover, the requirement for carriers to load at least ninety percent of their fuel in Turkey ensures that domestic SAF production has a guaranteed off-take mechanism. It also establishes a controlled ecosystem where tracking, compliance, and quality assurance are streamlined under national supervision. These dynamics foster confidence among suppliers, investors, and carriers alike.

Inclusive Policy Design and Sectoral Focus

The scope of the directive is thoughtfully designed. It applies to a broad segment of aviation stakeholders — from national and international carriers to airport operators and licensed fuel providers. Importantly, humanitarian, medical, and state-owned aircraft are exempt, balancing sustainability goals with operational realities.

The tonnage-based threshold for applicability ensures the directive targets flights with the most significant fuel consumption and emissions potential. This prioritisation reinforces impact without compromising the flexibility required for niche operators or emergency missions.

A Model of Proactive Transition

Turkey’s SAF directive provides a compelling example of how regulatory leadership can facilitate meaningful transition. By codifying sustainability as a shared responsibility — across government, industry, and infrastructure — the directive lays a path for other emerging economies with expanding aviation networks.

Sustainability professionals often emphasise systems thinking and cross-sector collaboration. This policy exemplifies both. It leverages domestic energy policy, global climate frameworks, and aviation economics into a single regulatory instrument. In doing so, it reflects a maturing understanding of climate action as a long-term developmental strategy.

Conclusion

Turkey’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel directive is more than an environmental milestone. It is a case study in how sustainability can be embedded into national infrastructure planning with foresight, structure, and collaborative intent.

For those in the transport and sustainability sectors, it offers a timely reminder: transition is not just about technology or targets. It is also about crafting frameworks that enable innovation, demand accountability, and drive local value creation.

As new regional and national directives emerge around SAF and green aviation, professionals in sustainability consulting, policy design, and transport operations should look closely at how such models evolve. These are not isolated steps — they are part of a broader climb toward resilient, future-proofed mobility systems.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-71.svg,N,,2025-07-07 08:00:24.735897

This move, finalized in July 2025 during Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's visit to France, signals a bold bet on long-term operational efficiency, regional market leadership, and alignment with Airbus' competitive edge in the widebody aircraft market. For investors, this decision offers a lens into both Malaysia Airlines' growth ambitions and Airbus' prospects in the booming ASEAN aviation sector.

Fleet Efficiency: The Cost-Saving Catalyst

The A330neo's 25% improvement in fuel efficiency over the Boeing 767-300ER and 14% better per-seat efficiency than its predecessor, the A330ceo, are central to Malaysia Airlines' calculus. With fuel costs typically accounting for 20-30% of an airline's operating expenses, these savings could translate into significant margin improvements. The airline's plan to replace its aging A330ceo fleet (average age 15 years) with newer, more efficient aircraft directly addresses a critical pain point in the post-pandemic aviation recovery.

The A330neo's 7,200-nautical-mile range also unlocks flexibility, enabling Malaysia Airlines to serve high-potential Asian and South Pacific routes—from Bali to Melbourne—without sacrificing fuel efficiency. This dual capability positions the airline to capitalize on pent-up demand in tourism-dependent economies like Malaysia's, which saw international arrivals surge by 140% in 2024 compared to 2022.

Regional Dominance: ASEAN's Aviation Rebound

Malaysia Airlines' order is not merely about cost-cutting but also about reclaiming market share in the ASEAN region. The airline's new A330neo fleet, configured with 297 seats (28 in business class and 269 in economy), aligns with the growing premiumization of travel in Southeast Asia. Analysts project the region's aviation market to grow at a 5.8% CAGR through 2030, driven by rising middle-class incomes and infrastructure investments like Malaysia's RM50 billion (US$11.5 billion) airport modernization plan.

By 2031, when all 40 A330neos are in service, Malaysia Airlines will have a fleet capable of efficiently connecting its hub in Kuala Lumpur to emerging hubs in Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and beyond. The aircraft's sustainability features—including compatibility with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today and a target of 100% by 2030—also position it to meet stringent environmental regulations in the EU and Asia, where carbon taxes are increasingly a factor.

Airbus' Competitive Edge: Capturing Modernization Demand

Malaysia Airlines' commitment underscores Airbus' dominance in the widebody aircraft segment. The A330neo's global order book now stands at 384 firm orders, with Malaysia Airlines becoming Asia-Pacific's largest regional operator of the type. This success contrasts with Boeing's struggles in the mid-capacity widebody market, where the 767 and 787 face stiff competition.

Airbus' Flight Hour Services (FHS) partnership with Malaysia Airlines further solidifies its ecosystem play. By offering maintenance and technical support, Airbus reduces operational risks for its customers while locking in long-term service revenue—a model that has proven lucrative for Boeing's Global Services division.

The A330neo's planned upgrade to a 253-tonne Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) by 2028 adds another layer of strategic value, enabling carriers to optimize payloads for both passengers and cargo—a critical factor as airlines diversify revenue streams.

Investment Thesis: Airbus and ASEAN Aviation

For investors, Malaysia Airlines' A330neo expansion presents two compelling opportunities:

1. Airbus (AIR.PA): The order reinforces Airbus' position as the go-to partner for Asian carriers modernizing their fleets. With a backlog of over 1,800 A330 and A350 orders, the company is well-positioned to benefit from ASEAN's aviation boom. Investors should watch for further order momentum from regional carriers like Singapore Airlines or Thai Airways.

2. ASEAN Aviation Sector: Exposure to airports (KLIA, Changi Airport), ground-handling firms, and even SAF producers could pay dividends as traffic rebounds. Malaysia's focus on green aviation aligns with the EU's FuelEU Aviation initiative, creating regulatory tailwinds.

Risks to Consider

Delivery Delays: Airbus' production capacity constraints, particularly for the A350, could strain its ability to meet Malaysia Airlines' 2029–2031 delivery timeline.

Fuel Price Volatility: While the A330neo's efficiency mitigates this risk, a sustained spike in oil prices could still pressure margins.

Geopolitical Risks: Regional instability or trade disputes could dampen travel demand, though ASEAN's economic integration buffers against this to some extent.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Strategy and Investment

Malaysia Airlines' A330neo expansion is a masterstroke that blends cost discipline, regional growth, and strategic alignment with Airbus' technological strengths. For investors, this is more than a fleet upgrade—it's a catalyst for long-term value creation in both the airline and its key supplier. With ASEAN aviation set to outpace global growth, Airbus' leadership in this space and Malaysia Airlines' renewed competitiveness make them prime picks for portfolios focused on the region's recovery.

Final Note: Investors should monitor Malaysia Airlines' load factor trends and Airbus' order pipeline in Asia-Pacific as key metrics of this strategy's success.",,N,,2025-07-07 09:12:11.481966

The solidarity levy would introduce a parallel carbon pricing system, which IATA says risks undermining CORSIA and could fracture international cooperation on aviation climate policy.
IATA urged governments, including GSLTF member states, to strengthen CORSIA implementation rather than introduce overlapping and inconsistent measures.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued a sharp rebuttal to a recent proposal by the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF), which recommends imposing new taxes on air travel to support climate change mitigation, pandemic preparedness, and broader developmental challenges in lower-income nations. Describing the plan as ill-conceived, economically damaging, and counterproductive, IATA underscored that such levies would undermine global connectivity, financial sustainability of airlines, and ongoing environmental commitments.

A Disproportionate Financial Burden on Aviation

At the heart of IATA’s criticism is the financial scale of the proposed levy. A study cited by the GSLTF suggests that a premium flyer tax could generate €78 billion (approximately USD 90 billion) annually—a figure IATA notes is nearly three times the airline industry’s projected global profit of USD 32.4 billion for 2024. Given the industry's razor-thin net profit margin of just 3.4%, IATA contends that siphoning such vast sums would be unsustainable and jeopardize the sector’s viability.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh cautioned that governments are mistakenly viewing aviation as a financial “cash cow,” warning that the burden of new taxes would ripple through economies and reduce connectivity, especially to remote and developing regions. “The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow,” Walsh emphasized.

Aviation’s Trillion-Dollar Commitment to Sustainability

The aviation sector is already confronting a mammoth investment challenge to meet its environmental goals. Airlines worldwide have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a transition estimated to cost USD 4.7 trillion over the next 25 years. Key strategies include the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), fleet modernization, operational efficiency, and emerging technologies.

Imposing a solidarity levy would not only divert capital away from these investments but also penalize premium passengers, who are critical to maintaining viable route structures. The reduction in premium demand could shrink connectivity options, especially for regions where such revenue cross-subsidizes lower fare classes.

CORSIA: A Global Framework Already in Place

Another major objection from IATA is the GSLTF’s disregard for CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), a globally agreed-upon market-based mechanism developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). CORSIA aims to cap international aviation emissions and manage them through offsetting mechanisms.

The solidarity levy would introduce a parallel carbon pricing system, which IATA says risks undermining CORSIA and could fracture international cooperation on aviation climate policy. IATA urged governments, including GSLTF member states, to strengthen CORSIA implementation rather than introduce overlapping and inconsistent measures.

Economic and Consumer Impact Largely Ignored

IATA further criticized the GSLTF for failing to assess the broader economic and social impacts of the proposed levy. There has been no analysis of how such taxes would affect travel affordability, route networks, or the economies of developing nations—the very beneficiaries of the funds.

The association warned that higher airfares caused by excessive taxation would disproportionately affect low-income travelers and hinder the flow of goods and services, especially in island nations and isolated communities that rely heavily on air transport.

Public Skepticism of Air Travel Taxes

IATA backed its position with new international survey data from Savanta, which polled citizens in 15 countries:

79% believe there are already too many taxes on flying

78% reject taxation as a viable path to aviation sustainability

74% distrust governments to manage such tax revenues responsibly

88% believe air travel tax revenues should be used to improve the travel experience

Only 9% support taxation as the preferred solution to carbon emissions

Alternatives with higher public support included Sustainable Aviation Fuel investments (25%), technology enhancements (23%), and emissions reduction research (18%).

A Call for Practical, Sector-Specific Solutions

Willie Walsh concluded by affirming the industry’s commitment to climate action, while emphasizing that punitive taxes are not the answer. “The last thing these efforts need is a USD 90 billion gut punch of a tax,” he stated. Instead, the GSLTF’s objectives would be better served by enabling SAF production and access to carbon credits, allowing airlines to sustainably connect people and businesses across the globe.

As governments deliberate on the GSLTF recommendations, IATA is urging stakeholders to prioritize collaboration, consistency, and investment—not fiscal extractions—to ensure aviation remains a driver of economic prosperity and environmental responsibility.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/25_03_2025_14_13_39_7215916.webp?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:39.792621

In 2025 and 2024, low-cost carrier Flynas in Saudi Arabia has seen unprecedented growth and has become the fastest-growing airline in the Middle East region. From its strategic expansion in its fleet to diversifying its routes and improving operations, Flynas looks set to sustain its upward momentum

Explosive Growth in Passenger Numbers

Flynas has seen its passenger numbers soar in 2024, reaching over 7 million travelers, marking a 47% increase from the previous year. The airline’s success is tied to its expansion strategy, which has focused on increasing domestic and international routes, improving customer service, and maintaining affordability without compromising quality. This surge in passengers has cemented Flynas as one of the leading carriers in the region, with a strong reputation for offering competitive fares and efficient service.

The increased demand for Flynas’ services is not only a reflection of the airline’s competitive pricing but also the result of the growing demand for air travel within Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East. As more people seek cost-effective travel options, Flynas has successfully tapped into this demand by offering flexible, accessible flights to a wide variety of destinations. The airline’s route network has expanded considerably, and its services now span several major international destinations, offering travelers more options than ever before.

Expansion of Flynas’ Fleet and New Aircraft Orders

As part of its strategy to meet the growing demand, Flynas has made significant investments in expanding its fleet. In 2024, the airline added several new aircraft to its operations, bringing its fleet size to 61, which includes Airbus A320 and A330 series aircraft. The airline has also signed agreements for additional planes, including 75 Airbus A320neo aircraft and 15 Airbus A330-900s, as part of a $5.7 billion deal. These new aircraft will allow Flynas to expand its routes and increase its capacity, especially on high-demand international routes.

The expansion of the fleet is expected to continue through 2025, with Flynas’ focus on modernizing its aircraft to include more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly options. The Airbus A320neo and A330-900 aircraft are part of Flynas’ commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing the overall passenger experience. The airline’s strategic investment in new aircraft will provide a more comfortable, efficient, and sustainable option for travelers in the region.

New Destinations and Increased Frequencies

Flynas’ growth is not limited to fleet expansion. The airline has also significantly increased its number of routes, offering new international destinations and increasing frequencies on existing ones. Among the new routes added in 2024 were flights to major cities in Europe and Asia, including Istanbul, Cairo, and Dubai, allowing the airline to tap into new markets and strengthen its regional connectivity.

In addition to expanding its network, Flynas has also introduced more frequent flights on its most popular routes. For example, the airline now operates over 20 daily flights between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a vital market for both business and leisure travel. Flynas has become one of the primary carriers for flights between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, further solidifying its position as the dominant low-cost carrier in the region.

The addition of more routes and frequencies has helped Flynas capitalize on the growing demand for travel within the Middle East and beyond, with the airline now offering more direct flights to cities in Europe, Asia, and Africa. This expansion strategy has allowed Flynas to increase its market share in the competitive Middle Eastern aviation market, outpacing other regional LCCs.

Sustainability and Environmental Initiatives

Flynas has also made sustainability a key priority in its business strategy. The airline has committed to reducing its carbon emissions and has partnered with international organizations to offset the environmental impact of its flights. In 2024, Flynas offset over 625,000 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to planting 25 million trees. This initiative aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy and reduce the country’s carbon emissions.

The airline’s new fleet of Airbus A320neo and A330-900 aircraft plays a crucial role in its sustainability efforts, as these planes are more fuel-efficient and produce fewer emissions compared to older models. Flynas is also working on implementing other green technologies and practices, including carbon offset programs and investments in sustainable aviation fuel.

Flynas’ IPO and Financial Growth

In 2025, Flynas is preparing for a major financial move: the airline is set to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on the Riyadh Stock Exchange. The IPO, which could raise up to $1.1 billion, marks a significant milestone for the airline and its shareholders. This IPO is expected to help Flynas secure additional capital to fund its continued growth, including further fleet expansion, new routes, and enhanced passenger services.

Flynas’ financial performance in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 has been robust. In the first quarter of 2025, the airline reported a net profit of SAR 148 million, a 5% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. The airline’s revenue growth is a direct result of its expanding passenger base, new aircraft, and growing market share in the region.

Looking Ahead: Flynas’ Path to Global Recognition

Flynas is on a clear path to becoming one of the leading low-cost carriers not just in the Middle East but globally. The airline’s success in 2024 and 2025 is just the beginning. As Flynas prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2027, it is focused on continuing its expansion into international markets, modernizing its fleet, and offering new and innovative services to its customers.

“These tools are vital not only for safety but also enhance fuel efficiency.” She mentioned ongoing enhancements focusing on artificial intelligence which will lead to deeper analytical capabilities moving forward.
A Complete Approach Towards Environmental Accountability Sustainability efforts at Lufthansa Cargo are supported by an evolving global environmental management system established back in ’07.","Lufthansa Cargo is taking steps to align with Europe’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) initiative, but it has some reservations.As stated by the airline, the existing regulations could potentially harm the competitiveness of European carriers.With a 2025 target for a 2 percent SAF blend looming, Lufthansa is advocating for a more balanced regulatory framework or a carbon border adjustment to ensure fair competition.

Bettina Petzold, who leads Corporate Obligation at Lufthansa cargo, expressed concerns: “Simply mandating blending won’t create a viable SAF market on its own. The EU’s current policies overlook critical supply and pricing challenges: biogenic SAF is scarce and can cost up to five times more then customary kerosene. In fact, in 2023, SAF accounted for only about 0.2 percent of global fuel needs.”

The airline also highlighted competitive imbalances in the aviation sector: “The current rules put EU airlines at a disadvantage compared to those from regions like the Gulf or China,” she pointed out. “We’re calling for regulations that treat all players equally regarding SAF mandates or introduce an equitable Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for non-compliant airlines.”

Innovative Carbon Tracking and Flexible SAF Options

Lufthansa Cargo isn’t just voicing concerns; they are actively implementing SAF solutions tailored for various customer needs.

Petzold shared insights on their offerings: “We provide three services that help customers transparently reduce their carbon footprint through purchasing SAF,” she explained. “Our ‘Sustainable choice’ service is available globally across all routes and capacities—allowing CO2 emissions reductions of up to 80%. This process can be completed easily online and appeals not only to large clients but also small-to-medium-sized forwarders.”

The company also offers bulk purchases of over 100 tons of SAF with specific allocations tied to identified transport routes—ensuring no double counting occurs globally—and special charter deals are available as well.

Petzold emphasized traceability in their operations: “We focus on high-quality biogenic residues like used cooking oils—not palm oil—for our SAF production. Each purchase comes with certification from an external auditor ensuring compliance.”

This commitment has already yielded results; Petzold noted that through these initiatives, approximately 8,500 tonnes of CO2 were saved in just one year.

The exact breakdown of how much SAF was used per route will be clearer by early 2026 as calculations continue.

Data-Driven Strategies and Fleet Modernization

Lufthansa Cargo is increasingly relying on digital tools within its strategy aimed at reducing carbon emissions—especially concerning fuel efficiency.

“Our Fuel efficiency Team employs specialized software that thoroughly analyzes fuel consumption throughout all flight phases,” said Petzold. “These tools are vital not only for safety but also enhance fuel efficiency.” She mentioned ongoing enhancements focusing on artificial intelligence which will lead to deeper analytical capabilities moving forward.

“We’re also working on advanced analytic tools resembling ‘digital twins’ capable of predicting changes in kerosene usage based on various factors such as aircraft modifications,” she added; though this technology remains under growth.

Lufthansa has revamped its fleet significantly since late 2021 by transitioning entirely to Boeing’s modern freighter model—the Boeing 777F—which boasts superior environmental performance among freighters today.Currently operating twelve units with plans for seven additional B777-8 freighters expected by 2030 promises even greater efficiency improvements according to Boeing’s projections.

“Alongside fleet upgrades and increased use of sustainable fuels we’re targeting an additional four percent reduction in emissions by the year 2030,” Petzold noted.

A Complete Approach Towards Environmental Accountability

Sustainability efforts at Lufthansa Cargo are supported by an evolving global environmental management system established back in ’07.

“CO2, along with noise metrics have been tracked as the ’90s laying groundwork towards structured environmental management,” explained Petzold.

The first ISO14001 certification was achieved back in ’08 at Frankfurt airport followed shortly thereafter extending certifications across germany before achieving global recognition by ’15—a feat made possible thanks largely due collaboration among dedicated environmental ambassadors within our workforce.”

This system continues adapting over time; revisions occurred during ’12,’ ’16,’ & most recently ’23’ reflecting new developments while maintaining compliance standards.”",https://fullavantenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/89620-lufthansa-cargo-pushes-for-saf-policy-overhaul.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:48.173843
