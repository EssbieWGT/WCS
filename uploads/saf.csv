The two companies have signed an agreement to jointly explore the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) within India, leveraging Honeywell's advanced eFining technology.

This landmark partnership aims to revolutionize SAF production by utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from NTPC's power plants as a feedstock, combined with green hydrogen.

DMR Panda, Executive Director (Green Hydrogen) at NTPC Ltd., emphasized the importance of this collaboration, stating that SAF production forms a ""sizeable part"" of NTPC Green's ambitious Green Hydrogen Hub in Pudimadaka, Andhra Pradesh. ""We believe that the mandate in the aviation sector for blending SAF in jet fuel will drive many early mover projects in green hydrogen,"" Panda added, highlighting the anticipated policy push that will accelerate SAF adoption.

Honeywell's proprietary eFining technology is central to this initiative. This cutting-edge process enables the efficient conversion of eMethanol, produced from captured CO2 and green hydrogen, into high-quality SAF. This technology is designed to produce a low-carbon intensity jet fuel with high SAF yield and selectivity, while also minimizing capital expenditure and plot space. It is a ""drop-in"" replacement fuel, meaning it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to existing aircraft engines or infrastructure.

Ranjit Kulkarni, Vice President and General Manager, Energy and Sustainability Solutions, Honeywell India, underscored the strategic alignment of this partnership with India's environmental objectives. ""Our collaboration with NTPC Green will leverage Honeywell's expertise in SAF solutions to efficiently treat emissions from thermal energy, foster green hydrogen adoption, diversify feedstocks for SAF production and help India's aviation sector meet its long-term environmental goals,"" Kulkarni stated.

India has set ambitious targets for SAF blending, with plans to mandate a 1% SAF blending target by 2027, rising to 2% by 2028, and a more significant 5% by 2030. These targets align with international frameworks like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and India's broader commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 under the Panchamrit strategy.

The Pudimadaka Green Hydrogen Hub, where SAF production will be explored, is being developed as India's first Green Hydrogen Hub under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. This mega-project, with an estimated investment of Rs. 1.85 lakh crore (approximately $22 billion), aims to produce 1,500 tonnes per day (TPD) of green hydrogen and 7,500 TPD of green hydrogen derivatives, including SAF, green methanol, and green urea. Its strategic location near Visakhapatnam, with proximity to seaports, positions it as a potential hub for both domestic consumption and export of green fuels.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-03 13:56:59.560188

Speaking on Skift’s climate podcast GreenShift, Amelia DeLuca, Delta’s Chief Sustainability Officer, acknowledged the tension between business expansion and climate goals.

But she said the airline remains focused on reducing emissions.

“Delta is not a sustainability company that just happens to have an airline - we're an airline that has a sustainability team and policy,” DeLuca said. “But we also know that if we don’t decarbonize, we lose our license to operate over the next hundred years.”

A Balancing Act Between Growth and Green Goals

Airlines are under growing pressure to curb emissions, with the sector pledging to reach net zero by 2050. But Delta’s emissions rose in 2024 to their highest level since before the pandemic, according to its most recent sustainability report.

“The industry, Delta included, is in growth mode as we come back from the pandemic,” DeLuca said. “We’ve just seen continued support for international travel and premium travel. So Delta is obviously trying to serve its customers as best we can. And through that, you’re seeing growth in international destinations and premium seats.”

The airline has hundreds of planes on order and while new aircraft are more efficient, more flights will mean more emissions.

Despite rising emissions, DeLuca pointed to signs of progress. She said Delta increased its capacity by 5% last year compared to 2019, but used less jet fuel, a first for the airline. It saved 45 million gallons of jet fuel and roughly $110 million.

“That means we’re growing, but doing so more efficiently,” she said.

Delta credits that efficiency to flight improvements such as more efficient routes as well as newer aircraft, which the International Air Transport Association says can be up to 20% more fuel efficient than older models.

DeLuca also said part of the emissions increase comes down to better data. As Delta improves tracking of indirect emissions, such as those from suppliers, its total footprint appears larger.

“Our scope three emissions look like they’re going up, but it’s just because we’re now working with our supply chain to give us the most accurate emissions that we can get,” she said.

The Race for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

DeLuca made it clear that operational tweaks and better planes won’t be enough.

“Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the biggest lever,” she said. “It’s the only thing that gets us to net zero. We’re in a race against time.”

Delta is building a SAF blending hub in Minnesota and working with corporate clients to create demand. The airline hopes this can serve as a model for broader state-level action.

There have been concerns that SAF production will never be able to grow to the level required by the entire aviation sector, as it tries to decarbonize, due to issues around feedstocks.

The fuel uses things like used cooking oil, of which there is limited supply, and plants, which are feared might result in crop displacement - taking vital land away for things like food for humans, for SAF.

“There's a limit to how much used cooking oil exists. The next generation of SAF is using biomass type products, such as corn waste, potentially woody biomass from fallen trees,” DeLuca said. “All those have a limit.”

DeLuca called on the sector to continue investing in new technologies such as carbon capture, capturing gasses out of the atmosphere using renewable energy and turning it back into fuel. “These are unlimited feedstocks. And that cost profile of that product, if you have unlimited feedstocks, is actually lower than conventional jet fuel today. But that is a long way off. This is going to take all of us. Airlines alone can’t solve climate change.”

State’s federally funded hydrogen hub releases aviation whitepaper co-led by CLEE.

Few industries face as complex a challenge in decarbonizing as aviation. While great for decarbonizing on-road transportation, batteries are generally too heavy to power long-distance flights. Low-carbon biofuels blended into fossil jet fuel represent only a partial solution, due to lack of feedstocks and blend limits. Zero-emission hydrogen could represent a solution, either as an ingredient for synthetic jet fuel that can drop in as a replacement for fossil jet fuel or to power fuel cells on redesigned zero-emission aircraft.

To explore the potential for hydrogen to help decarbonize the aviation sector, the state’s federally funded hydrogen hub ARCHES (Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, representing a California-based public-private partnership to develop and deploy renewable, clean hydrogen projects) just released a white paper detailing the opportunities, challenges, and policy needs. Berkeley Law’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) co-chaired the ARCHES Aviation Working Group that produced the report, along with San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and RMI.

Key Recommendations

While hydrogen’s promise is substantial, barriers remain. High production costs, limited infrastructure, and fragmented safety and technical standards have slowed adoption. The whitepaper offers a targeted set of recommendations for state leaders, including:

Develop Standards and Policy Frameworks: California state agencies, in collaboration with federal and international partners, could create robust policies and safety standards for hydrogen production, storage, and distribution at airports. This includes infrastructure to support both ground support equipment and hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Expand Incentives Through the California Air Resources Board and Energy Commission: The Board and Energy Commission could incentivize the use of low-carbon hydrogen as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel or for direct consumption in hydrogen aircraft. These incentives could mirror existing programs like the Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

Integrate Aviation into Clean Transportation Programs: Including hydrogen aviation projects in state-level clean transportation initiatives—such as the CEC’s Clean Transportation Program—would accelerate hydrogen propulsion timelines and de-risk private investment.

Enable Airport Leadership: Airport authorities can lead by empowering staff to engage with hydrogen producers based on proximity, price, and emissions profile, and by developing plans for future hydrogen fueling needs in coordination with operators.

Foster Regional Hydrogen Clusters: Developing hydrogen “clusters” at airports like Long Beach would create hubs of hydrogen activity, supporting ground equipment, transit systems, and eventually hydrogen aircraft. These clusters could leverage economies of scale to lower costs and build a more resilient supply chain.

With planning and leadership, hydrogen could become a cornerstone of a clean, resilient aviation system in California. While hydrogen won’t be able to solve aviation’s climate challenges overnight, the runway to decarbonization is now open, if policymakers, industry, and airport leaders work to accelerate the takeoff.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cover-page-of-the-report.png,N,,2025-06-03 12:57:00.827406

Amy Klobuchar wants to help Midwest corn farmers tap into new lucrative tax credits aimed at making airplane fuel more climate friendly. But some environmentalists worry her proposal could make climate change worse.

The tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is available for any fuel manufacturer that can show their product is at least 50% less carbon intensive than today’s petroleum-based jet fuel. The credit has mobilized universities and major companies like Cargill to explore a bevy of alternative fuels, including hydrogen gas, ethanol and even recycled cooking oil.

...

In April, Klobuchar, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kans.) introduced a bill that would extend the SAF credit for another 10 years, while also prohibiting biofuels and other fuel feedstock imported from overseas from qualifying for the subsidy.

...

“Domestically produced biofuel strengthens our energy independence, supports our farmers and boosts rural economies,” Klobuchar said in a press release, announcing the proposal.

...

Klobuchar declined an interview request from the Minnesota Star Tribune, but said in a statement that her “bipartisan bill with Senator Marshall protects the sustainable aviation fuel credit from being exploited by foreign feedstocks from deforested rainforests — while giving farmers the certainty they need to produce lower-carbon fuel.”

...

Brian Werner, the executive director of the Minnesota Bio-Fuels Association, said ethanol producers generally support Klobuchar’s legislation.

“Sustainable aviation fuel in Minnesota will not develop without some sort of economic incentive in the near term,” he said. “So her support for making sure that this tax credit is extended … is critically important in a political environment where House Republicans are looking for savings and cuts for every single green energy tax credit that was included in the inflation Reduction Act.”

At present, sustainable aviation fuel, which is primarily derived from waste oils and biomass, is regarded as the most promising short- to mid-term solution for reducing emissions in air travel.","At the recent IATA Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, India, a significant development was revealed regarding the future of cleaner aviation. It was stated that by 2025, the global production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to reach 2 million tonnes, effectively doubling current output. However, despite this notable increase, the figures suggest that SAF will still make up only 0.7% of all aviation fuel consumed globally—a number that starkly highlights how far the industry still needs to go to meet its 2050 net-zero emissions target.

Industry Leaders Urge Immediate Policy Action

During the discussions, aviation leaders made it clear that while the production boost was a step in the right direction, it remains far from adequate. They strongly encouraged governments and energy providers to introduce more robust policies, offer subsidies, and make infrastructure investments aimed at rapidly increasing SAF availability.

A central concern raised was the lack of consistent incentives, which has caused a sluggish buildup of SAF capacity. As a result, airlines are now competing for limited fuel supplies while simultaneously coping with higher operational costs. The challenge has been intensified by delivery setbacks from aircraft manufacturers, delaying the rollout of more fuel-efficient airplanes, and hindering immediate efforts to reduce carbon emissions through modernized fleets.

Financial Strain Tied to Green Progress

While the SAF production increase has been welcomed, it was acknowledged that it comes with a hefty financial cost. Projections indicate that this growth could add about $4.4 billion to the global aviation fuel bill by 2025. Many in the industry view this as a necessary cost of progress, but warn that unless SAF becomes more affordable and easier to access, the pace of aviation decarbonization could falter.

At present, sustainable aviation fuel, which is primarily derived from waste oils and biomass, is regarded as the most promising short- to mid-term solution for reducing emissions in air travel. Its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing aircraft engines makes it particularly valuable. But its limited availability and high production costs have kept it from playing a larger role.

SAF at the Heart of Aviation’s Green Strategy

Since the 2021 pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, airlines have placed substantial emphasis on SAF as a cornerstone of their climate strategy. Its existing infrastructure compatibility means it doesn’t require major changes in aircraft technology or airport refueling systems. However, this reliance on SAF is becoming increasingly risky in the absence of accelerated production and widespread policy support.

Several key points were highlighted during the event to frame the current situation:

SAF output is expected to hit 2 million tonnes by 2025

This will represent just 0.7% of the airline industry’s total fuel use

The global aviation fuel bill is likely to increase by $4.4 billion as SAF scales

Urgent calls continue for policy reform and investment support

The Broader Impact on Air Travel and Global Travelers

The implications of this slow progress extend far beyond industry boardrooms. For global travelers, this limited SAF adoption could bring higher ticket prices, especially on long-haul flights, where SAF usage is more likely to be prioritized due to international regulations or green branding.

As fuel prices rise and airlines work to offset their environmental impact, passengers may start to feel the financial burden. This could lead to changes in travel patterns, such as opting for shorter routes, choosing lower-emission carriers, or reducing flight frequency altogether.

More importantly, the current state of SAF availability reveals a deeper challenge: how the aviation sector must walk a tightrope between environmental responsibility and economic sustainability. Without swift and scalable solutions, experts caution that the climate goals set for 2050 may become unattainable, potentially eroding public trust and forcing airlines to pursue alternative decarbonization methods that may be even more complex or costly.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aviation-.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 09:56:13.764819

There’s much that we can do with AI to build these cyber layers.” Soaring ambition Innovation in the aviation industry is not necessarily easy.","No one can accuse International Airlines Group (IAG) of being complacent. The company, which owns flag carriers British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, is one of Europe’s most profitable airline groups, earning €2.7bn after tax in 2024, ahead of rivals Ryanair and Lufthansa. To ensure it can stay ahead, however, earlier this year it ramped up its corporate venturing activities, setting up a new CVC unit with a €200m ($227m) fund to be invested over the next five years.

“It is easier to launch this kind of vehicle when your [parent] company is one of the most profitable airlines,” Nacho Tovar, head of the recently formed IAGi Ventures, told GCV.

IAG has been taking minority stakes in startups for years, but without a fixed fund size or cadence to the investment. Now it is committed to €40m a year for the next five years, and Tovar, who worked for a tech VC firm before joining Iberia in 2017, is bolstering the team with members who have venture capital experience so that the unit adds a Silicon Valley mindset to its expertise on the aviation industry.

“If you compete with not just corporate VC, but [also] the big players around VC, you need to understand valuations, deals, convertible loans, this kind of language,” he says.

AI and automation

Since the pandemic, costs for the airline industry have been creeping up, according to data analysed by the International Air Transport Association, a trade association. This puts a premium on improved efficiency, which two of the fund’s focus areas, AI and automation, might be able to deliver.

Tovar says that the fund will target AI startups at the application layer with “a vertical proposition around aviation”. These could, for example, be used to improve processes on the ramp – the area where an aircraft is loaded, boarded and refueled. A successful example of this from the company’s former accelerator programme, Hangar 51, is Assaia, a startup that uses AI to analyse a live video feed of the procedures preparing a docked plane for its next flight against the schedule. It has been run for British Airways planes at Heathrow since 2019 in an effort to improve turnaround times.

Automation is closely related to AI. Currently, Tovar says, the airline industry lags behind other sectors in implementing it.

“It is still far away from other industries like retail [and] logistics,” he says. “If you go to a fulfilment centre, there’s a lot more automation over there.”

It could also improve procedures on the ramp, for example with robotic automation of the fueling process. But Tovar also says it could make a difference across airports, with their “orchestra” of moving parts. Loading cargo, connecting bags to the correct flights, speeding up the boarding process and helping passengers make their connecting flights could all be made easier with AI or automation.

Making sustainable aviation fuel

While automation might help to shave down costs and improve reliability, the fund also has its sights on a more existential threat to the sector.

The aviation industry is currently thought to contribute to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, and 4% of global warming to date when non-CO2 sources are accounted for. The industry plans to rely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to help it reduce carbon emissions enough to make reaching net zero by 2050 manageable.

Tovar says the ultimate goal is to reach third-generation SAF, generated from captured CO2 mixed with green hydrogen. The venture fund will invest in technologies that improve the synthesising techniques.

“We need to speed up the technology,” he says. “The technology to have third-generation SAF available at the right price is [what] we are working towards.”

While the CVC unit focuses on investing in SAF initiatives, IAG is lobbying the UK government to make the transition to SAF less painful for airlines, and to encourage investment in new SAF plants.

The government recently mandated airlines to use SAF for 10% of all their fuel by 2030. IAG says it used just under 2% in 2024. With SAF, as with AI and automation, the group has used a startup partnership to experiment with what works. In 2021, British Airways invested in LanzaJet, which has built the world’s first commercial-scale plant converting bioethanol to fuel, an example of second-generation SAF.

Looking further afield

IAG will continue to run the accelerator programmes it has for startups that are not yet ready for it to invest in. The Hangar 51 accelerator has been rebranded as IAGi Accelerator, and will contain two tracks. A 12-week programme will focus on technology that it can start to deploy among the business units to meet specific business needs, while a 24-week programme will support earlier-stage startups developing promising new technologies.

Beyond AI, automation and SAF, Tovar says the IAGi Ventures fund will also invest in connectivity and IoT, as well as quantum, cloud and cybersecurity.

“We need to be on top of everything that is happening in cybersecurity,” he says. “Even more [so] with new systems like quantum and AI. There’s much that we can do with AI to build these cyber layers.”

Soaring ambition

Innovation in the aviation industry is not necessarily easy. The priority of airlines and airports is always safety, which can make implementation of new technologies slow.

Increasing pressure on airlines’ bottom lines can also make them less willing to fund corporate venturing initiatives, as seen recently when struggling US airline JetBlue spun out its CVC unit, JetBlue Ventures, so that it could focus on returning the core business to profitability.

But Tovar is optimistic that IAG’s new fund can rise to the challenges. He sees aviation as an area that has so far not sufficiently exploited tech innovation.

“There are not so many airlines with the right approach or the right ambition around investing in technology,” he says.

“I strongly believe we could be the best VC of our kind in the world.”",https://globalventuring.com//content/uploads/2025/06/Interview-template.png,N,,2025-06-03 10:56:10.713260

The announcement was made during IATA’s annual meeting in New Delhi, India, amid rising concerns that SAF production remains far below the levels needed to meet the sector’s 2050 net-zero emissions target.

SAF, made from waste oils and biomass, is seen as the most viable pathway to decarbonising aviation in the medium term.

While the growth in output is welcome, IATA Director General Willie Walsh noted that it comes at a high cost.

“The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” he said. The additional SAF volumes are expected to increase the global aviation fuel bill by $4.4 billion in 2025.

Since 2021, the aviation sector has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century, largely relying on SAF as a core solution.

However, energy companies have been slow to scale up supply and airlines are facing competition for limited volumes.

At the same time, carriers are also contending with delays from aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing in delivering newer, more fuel-efficient planes.

Japan’s SAF Roadmap and Industry Position

Japan has set ambitious carbon neutrality goals, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The aviation sector, although a relatively small contributor to total emissions, plays a symbolic and strategic role in this pursuit. Japanese aviation stakeholders — including airlines, fuel producers, and government agencies — are actively investing in sustainable aviation fuel as part of their broader climate strategy.

Major Japanese carriers are increasingly incorporating SAF into their operations, with plans to scale usage over the next decade. Government-backed initiatives and partnerships with global fuel technology firms are helping accelerate the development of domestic production capabilities. Japan is also exploring the potential of alternative feedstocks, including municipal waste, algae, and biomass, which align with its resource efficiency and circular economy principles.

By 2032, Japan aims to establish a reliable SAF supply chain to support both domestic flights and international routes originating in Japan, positioning itself not only as a consumer but also as a regional SAF hub in Asia.

Just to highlight a few examples of how far we have come over the last five years:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production reached about one million tonnes in 2024, while this is roughly 0.3% of total jet fuel use, it is double the output of just a year prior. In 2025, output is expected to more than double again to 2.1 million tonnes, signalling an accelerating trajectory for SAF supply. As of this year, there are 11 approved pathways for SAF production, and a further 11 currently being assessed, which help diversify supply and create a menu of SAF options around the world, particularly in developing nations.

Over 50 airlines worldwide, covering roughly 40% of global passenger traffic, have pledged to SAF goals. We see similar developments on the airport side, almost 100 airports globally have had ongoing SAF deliveries since 2024. Business aviation is playing their part as well, having pledged to the net-zero 2050 target in tandem with commercial airlines, actively adopting efficiency measures.

Manufacturers produce the world’s most fuel-efficient aircraft and engines, and work on electric and hydrogen propulsion technologies.

Airports are taking measures to increase efficiency of ground handling, infrastructure and transportation, while air navigation service providers work towards creating more efficient flight paths.

These industry actions are supported by governments across the globe: Around 45 countries, are now developing or implementing policies to speed up the uptake of the approximately 23 million tonnes of SAF needed by 2030. None of this progress has happened in isolation. ICAO has in many ways facilitated not just a joint commitment but is supporting its realisation.

The path to net zero carbon is driven by multilateralism. The agreement by ICAO Member States on a long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 was a shining example of what we can accomplish if we all agree on a common denominator. ICAO’s role in coordinating this progress cannot be overstated: By bringing together more than 190 nations, ICAO provides the forum for States to coordinate action, align policies, and implement frameworks that serve as solutions for climate action on a global scale.

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) – the first-ever global market-based measure for any sector – is one example of how ICAO has helped to turn ambition into action. Airlines will need to purchase $20-30 billion in approved offsets for 1.2-2 billion tonnes of CO2. This represents around 70% of the growth in international air transport emissions during the lifetime of the scheme. This is the result of extensive negotiations by developed and developing countries, the ICAO system, industry and civil society, and represents a measure that will be effective without having a disproportionately negative impact on developing nations and their capacity for growth. A total of 130 states have now volunteered for the first stage (a new addition from Dominca which joined today), making it likely to be one of the most successful UN-level carbon management projects.

The progress of recent years has been truly encouraging. We have moved from aspiration to action and built a strong foundation for the next phase of aviation’s net zero journey, but we must acknowledge and actively address the challenges on the way. The hardest work of scaling up from those first millions of tonnes of SAF to the hundreds of millions needed, and deploying new technologies at global scale, still lies ahead. Achieving our objective will require nothing less than a concerted push from all of us in the coming decades.

This is a call to action for every stakeholder in aviation’s ecosystem. Governments have shown leadership through ICAO; now we urge them to continue translating that leadership into concrete national policies and international collaboration. Meanwhile, industry partners such as airlines, airports, manufacturers, fuel producers, and air navigation service providers continue to invest, innovate, and share their knowledge. Institutions and energy companies, too, are critical players; the latter of which have recently scaled back their initial commitments on SAF production. It is up to governments to introduce measures that will hold oil companies truly accountable and ensure their crucial support in the scale-up of SAF. It will take unified ambition from all corners to overcome the hurdles of this energy transition, whether it’s improving the economic viability of SAF, commercialising hydrogen and electric propulsion systems, or upgrading infrastructure across the world.

The next three to five years will be a vital time for the decarbonisation of our sector. We need to demonstrate a continued commitment, to ensure that the early gains we’ve seen can be solidified into long-term transformation. Air traffic will continue to increase every year to serve a global population that sees great benefits in connectivity, and with it the need to decouple carbon emissions from growth becomes even more important. As impacts are felt by citizens with more frequent flooding and wildfires, climate change will increasingly be a part of public consciousness, with greater demands for political, consumer and corporate action. Most importantly, multilateralism on a global scale will continue to be crucial to future success, removing barriers and allowing the industry to innovate at scale. I look forward to discussing the next chapter of this journey at the ICAO Aviation Climate Week in the coming days.",https://atag.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-03 10:56:22.659437

Why in News?

The Uttar Pradesh government has unveiled plans for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Manufacturing Policy-2025, aimed at converting agricultural waste into jet fuel.

A high-level roundtable conference was organized by Invest UP in Lucknow to discuss the policy framework.

Key Points

About the SAF: It is produced from renewable sources such as agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and forestry residues.

It has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Indigenous feedstock like sugarcane molasses and Make in India technology are being used to produce SAF.

About the Policy: The policy targets the production of sustainable aviation fuel from agricultural residues like sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, and wheat straw.

It aims to establish industrial units within Uttar Pradesh for bio-jet fuel manufacturing.

This initiative will directly benefit around 2.5 crore farmers by creating new markets for their crop waste.

Significance of the Policy:

First of Its Kind in India: Marks a pioneering step towards integrating agricultural waste-based biofuels into India’s aviation fuel mix.

Climate Change Mitigation: Supports India’s commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon intensity and promote renewable energy.

Agricultural Waste Management: It can reduce stubble burning, a major cause of air pollution and smog in northern India, improving public health and ecological balance.

Rural Economy Upliftment: Creates new markets and value chains for agricultural residues, generating additional income sources for farmers.

Industrial Growth: Promotes establishment of SAF manufacturing units, leveraging UP’s strategic logistics and agro-industrial base.

Related Challenges:

Technological Viability: Developing reliable and scalable processes to convert varied agricultural wastes into aviation fuel efficiently remains a major hurdle.

Price Competitiveness: Producing SAF at a cost close to conventional jet fuel is necessary to encourage adoption without heavy subsidies.

Infrastructure Development: Effective collection, transport, and storage of dispersed crop residues need robust logistics to maintain a steady supply.

Policy Integration: Aligning state and central policies on biofuels and aviation is essential to streamline approvals and incentives.

Way Forward:

Incorporate Stakeholder Feedback: Engaging farmers, industry, and experts will help tailor the policy to real-world challenges.

Facilitate Research & Development: Investment in R&D can improve technology efficiency and reduce production costs.

Create Incentives: Financial benefits for SAF producers and users will promote market growth.

Strengthen Farmer Outreach: Educating farmers and ensuring fair prices will secure reliable feedstock supply.

Promote Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government and private sector can drive large-scale, sustainable SAF production.",https://www.drishtiias.com/drishti/img/drishti-dual-logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 08:57:10.518478

This question was the focus of the tests carried out in spring 2023. They took place on the ground at the Payerne airbase using a Cessna 560 XL Citation Excel, a twin-engine business jet that can carry nine passengers.

Significantly lower soot emissions

A working group of environmental experts from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, the Paul Scherrer Institute, the Swiss Air Force and the FOCA analysed and evaluated the data. A clear picture emerged: Fossil CO2 emissions are reduced in line with the proportion of SAF in the tanks.

The decline in soot emissions is significant: Depending on the engine configuration, these are up to 35% lower. The reduction is particularly marked when the aircraft is idling - for example, when it is on the ground with the engine running. The reason for this is that SAF generally does not contain any soot-forming aromatic hydrocarbons and therefore burns more cleanly than pure fossil kerosene. It is also sulphur-free. Even with a low admixture, not only are fewer soot particles produced, but also fewer gaseous aromatic and sulphurous substances, which brings an overall reduction in particulate matter pollution and an improvement in air quality.

SAF: Better for the climate and air quality on the ground

Sustainable aviation fuels are a promising approach to reducing fossil CO2 emissions in aviation. Compared with fossil fuels, SAF makes it possible to avoid up to 80% of CO2 emissions without modifying today's engines, including all emissions relating to production and transport. Using SAF is a win-win situation, as it also has a positive effect on the air quality at and around an airport. While similar results were already available for large engines, the tests in Payerne on a business jet engine show that SAF can also be used to reduce pollutant emissions from small engines.

The results of the tests have been published in a scientific journal.

SAF test conditions

The fuel mixture used in the tests contained 35% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This met the technical requirements of conventional kerosene. It did not require any technical modifications to the aircraft or the refuelling system. This is important because theseSAF mixtures can be used directly in existing aircraft. The SAF was produced from organic waste such as used cooking oil and animal fats from slaughterhouse waste. In order to be able to compare the SAF mixture directly with conventional kerosene, the right and left wing tanks were filled with different fuels. It was possible to switch between the fuels while the engine was running.",https://news.admin.ch/favicon-16x16.png,N,,2025-06-03 08:57:18.743029

In addition, the cost of alternative fuels to airlines ""has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging,"" according to IATA, which estimated that compliance fees will add $1.7 billion on top of market prices – ""an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.""

IATA also estimated that the average cost of alternative aviation fuel in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel. In 2025, the global average cost for alternatives is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.

Walsh added that ""this highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation.""

IATA urged redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel to ""eliminate the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil”. The association also advocated for an approach to energy policy that includes alternative aviation fuels.

In a separate update on Tuesday (3 June), IATA announced a partnership with Amadeus to integrate its CO2 Connect emissions calculator into the latter's travel management platform.

IATA’s CO2 Connect is one of many methodologies designed to measure emissions from flights. It provides operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, rather than the modelled averages used by some other calculation methodologies.

Challenges with Mandates and European Cost Increases

IATA identified that most SAF production is currently directed towards Europe, largely due to EU and UK mandates that became effective on January 1, 2025.

The association reports that the cost of SAF to airlines in Europe has doubled due to compliance fees levied by producers or suppliers.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF anticipated to meet European mandates in 2025, the market cost is estimated at $1.2 billion, with an additional $1.7 billion in compliance fees.

IATA notes that this additional amount could have abated an extra 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. The organisation asserts that Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF “five times more costly than conventional jet fuel“.

Walsh criticised this approach, stating, “This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation“.

He added, “Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way“.

IATA’s Initiatives and Urgent Government Action Call

To foster the development of a global SAF market, IATA has launched two initiatives:

A SAF registry, managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organization (CADO), designed to provide a transparent and standardised system for tracking SAF purchases, usage, and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations like CORSIA and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The SAF Matchmaker, intended to facilitate SAF procurement by connecting airline SAF requests with supply offers.

Through a pioneering project called GRIM-SAF (GRound-Based and Inflight Measurements), experts are investigating how sustainable aviation fuel could reduce aircraft emissions of soot and volatile particles, and a range of gases including nitrogen oxides, often referred to as the non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Led by scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, academics from Manchester Met are working with a group of universities, research centres and aerospace companies to understand how different aviation fuels change the emissions and therefore the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

In a UK-first experiment held at RAF Brize Norton, two aircraft flew in formation – with one trailing the other to sample its emissions – to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel.

Previous in-flight emissions work in the UK has involved following several miles behind other aircraft whereas the aircraft involved in GRIM-SAF were able to get within 60 metres of each other.

Both aircraft also landed at RAF Brize Norton to make detailed ground-based measurements with the goal of linking this to the in-flight work.

Dr Simon Christie, Research Fellow at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: “The chase experiment marks a significant milestone in our research as we now have a real-life scenario through which to analyse the environmental impacts of sustainable aviation fuel against traditional jet fuel.

“We look forward to continuing to work with our partners to shape global measures to mitigate aviation’s climate change effects.”

These non-CO2 effects include the emission of soot and other substances, such as lubrication oil vented from aircraft engines, that can cause contrails to form.

Contrails are long, thin clouds made of ice crystals, which form when water vapour condenses on the tiny particles emitted by aircraft engines. Contrails sometimes spread out over large areas and can affect the Earth’s climate in the same way as naturally-formed cirrus clouds.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic.

Dr Paul Williams, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester, said: “Although this type of experiment, with one aircraft following another in formation, is very useful for scientists to get an understanding of the emissions produced by burning different types of fuels, it is environmentally costly.

“GRIM-SAF aims to understand the emissions on the ground, and correlate these to emissions at altitude so future experiments don’t rely on chasing aircraft with other aircraft.”",https://aboutmanchester.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/32444EC0-82C6-4F64-914C-4C00744364BE.webp,N,,2025-06-03 08:57:22.382845

“India’s integrated approach to biofuels shows how smart policy can align economic growth with environmental progress,” Walsh noted.","Global production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is set to double in 2025, reaching 2 million tonnes, but still meeting just 0.7 percent of airlines’ fuel needs, according to new data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The slow ramp-up in supply, combined with policy missteps – particularly in Europe – is raising concerns that flawed regulation may be undermining aviation’s decarbonization efforts.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

According to IATA, Europe’s SAF mandates, introduced in January 2025, were intended to boost the market. Instead, they have significantly inflated costs. Airlines purchasing the expected one million tonnes of SAF to meet compliance will face a $1.2 billion fuel bill at current market rates – plus an estimated $1.7 billion in compliance fees imposed by producers and suppliers. IATA argues this cost premium could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

“This highlights the problem with implementing mandates before sufficient market conditions exist,” Walsh said. “Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

In response, IATA is advancing two market-enabling initiatives:

– A SAF registry developed under the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) to transparently track SAF transactions and emissions reductions under global schemes like CORSIA and the EU ETS.

– A new SAF Matchmaker platform to link airline demand with producer supply.

To scale SAF globally, IATA is urging governments to adopt more effective policy frameworks. These include redirecting a portion of fossil fuel subsidies toward renewables, integrating SAF into broader energy strategies, and ensuring the effectiveness of CORSIA by making eligible carbon credits available.

IATA noted that India, the world’s third-largest aviation market, is positioning itself as a leader in this transition. Through the Global Biofuels Alliance, it has targeted a 2 percent SAF blend for international flights by 2028, supported by favorable pricing mechanisms and capital incentives. IATA is working with local stakeholders to support best practices for feedstock sustainability and life-cycle assessments.

“India’s integrated approach to biofuels shows how smart policy can align economic growth with environmental progress,” Walsh noted.

This initiative marks a significant milestone in aviation’s journey toward greater operational efficiency and long-term carbon reduction goals, aligning with the global aviation sector’s 2050 net-zero carbon emissions roadmap.

The adoption of FuelIS by two prominent airlines highlights the increasing industry focus on managing fuel consumption not only as a key cost component but also as a central pillar of environmental responsibility.

The Importance of Fuel Efficiency in Aviation

Fuel costs remain a dominant expenditure in airline operations, accounting for approximately 25-30% of total operating expenses, depending on market fluctuations. With increasing carbon pricing mechanisms and the decarbonization commitments under the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), managing fuel efficiency is now a strategic imperative for global carriers.

According to IATA’s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, technological innovation and operational efficiency improvements—including better fuel management—are projected to deliver 10% of total emissions reductions by mid-century.

Nick Careen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security, emphasized this in the announcement:

“Fuel management is key for airlines. On top of its cost impact, it is intrinsically linked to carbon emissions. Understanding how an airline performs compared to peers using FuelIS can reveal efficiencies that both reduce costs and improve sustainability.”

What Is IATA FuelIS?

IATA FuelIS (Fuel Intelligence Solution) is an advanced analytics platform that helps airlines benchmark and analyze fuel consumption across aircraft types, regions, markets, and operational conditions. The system is powered by real-world data from the IATA Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) platform and integrates seamlessly with IATA’s existing Fuel Efficiency Gap Analysis (FEGA) framework.

FuelIS draws upon the Flight Data eXchange (FDX) program, which aggregates operational fuel data from more than 220 global airlines, covering over 8 million flights annually. This collective, anonymized dataset enables airlines to compare their performance against industry averages and generate actionable insights.

The platform provides granular analysis that includes metrics like fuel burn per block hour, sector length comparisons, and engine performance tracking—critical data for both immediate operational improvements and long-term strategic planning.

How GOL and TAP Are Leveraging FuelIS

For TAP Air Portugal, FuelIS is now a critical tool in measuring the impacts of fleet modernization and the gradual integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into operations.

TAP CEO Luís Rodrigues stated:

“Fuel is a major cost driver for TAP Air Portugal. Managing consumption is a priority both financially and environmentally. Every kilogram saved matters. FuelIS gives us the insight needed to measure and refine our decarbonization strategy.”

Similarly, GOL Linhas Aéreas views its adoption of FuelIS as an operational and competitive advantage. The airline’s COO, Albert Pérez, said:

“Fuel is a significant cost factor, and managing it effectively gives us a strong edge. FuelIS equips us with industry-level benchmarking and decision-making tools to fine-tune our performance and reduce costs. It’s another step in our long-term commitment to operational excellence and sustainability.”

Economic and Environmental Impact

Since launching its fuel efficiency programs in 2005, IATA has helped its member airlines identify annual fuel savings of 4.76 million tonnes, equating to $3.8 billion in avoided costs. This demonstrates the dual benefit of efficiency: economic resilience and climate impact mitigation.

FuelIS contributes directly to national and international efforts for carbon accountability in aviation. As governments increasingly enforce emissions tracking and reporting, tools like FuelIS help airlines comply with evolving regulations such as:

EU ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme)

CORSIA under ICAO

National sustainability mandates like Brazil’s ProBioCombustível and Portugal’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP)

These regulatory frameworks, accessible via official sources like icao.int, easa.europa.eu, and europa.eu/climate-action, reinforce the need for robust data management and emissions transparency.

Data Accuracy and Benchmarking

One of the most powerful features of FuelIS is its data credibility, built on IATA’s trusted data governance. The FDX platform ensures anonymized, validated operational data, enabling apples-to-apples comparison among different airlines and aircraft types. FuelIS also helps airlines set measurable KPIs and track improvements over time.

This is especially vital for airlines investing in new aircraft, SAF testing programs, or hybrid-electric propulsion. Comparing outcomes across similar fleet profiles can validate or recalibrate investment strategies in real time.

Industry-Wide Adoption and Future Outlook

As airlines like GOL and TAP set the precedent, broader industry adoption of FuelIS is anticipated. With more airlines striving to meet Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) goals and aligning with national decarbonization strategies—such as Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Portugal’s Green Deal commitments—data tools will be indispensable.

Moreover, as the global SAF market scales, having detailed fuel performance insights can help airlines integrate SAF cost-effectively while maximizing emissions reductions.

IATA’s focus on digital transformation and real-time analytics aligns with aviation’s move toward smart operations, endorsed in government-backed aviation modernization strategies like FAA’s NextGen and EU’s Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR).

Conclusion

The decision by GOL and TAP Air Portugal to implement IATA FuelIS represents a strategic shift toward data-driven efficiency and long-term climate accountability in aviation. With rising fuel costs, stricter emissions regulations, and ambitious decarbonization timelines, the ability to precisely measure and optimize fuel use is no longer optional—it is essential.

As the industry faces the twin pressures of economic viability and environmental responsibility, tools like FuelIS offer a scalable, evidence-based path forward.

That benchmark equates to about 2 million tonnes of fuel, or about 0.7% of the airlines’ fuel consumption. This increase will add about $4.4 billion globally to aviation’s total fuel bill.

Our Analysis: Despite the Increase, Airlines May Struggle to Meet Sustainability Goals

Back in 2021, the global aviation sector agreed on a shared goal to meet net-zero emissions by 2050, the result of a gradual switch over to SAF. And although it’s encouraging to see the increase in production of SAF this year, IATA reiterated that several challenges stand in the way of airlines reaching the net-zero goal.

Since SAF (made from waste oil and biomass) is still in limited supply – and extremely expensive to produce – the trade group is cautioning that progress is still too slow, and that challenge is further compounded by the industry’s delay in delivering more fuel-efficient jets. Much more urgent work must be done of the goal is to be met.

What They Are Saying: Progress Is Too Slow

""The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,"" said Willie Walsh, director for IATA, in a statement. “The behavior of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage. The cost of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is estimated to be an enormous $4.7 trillion. Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers.”

Fast Facts: The State of the Aviation Industry in 2025

- The first half of 2025 has been marked by global market uncertainties, yet airlines are projected to perform better than in 2024 in terms of net profits.

- Overall performance will be slightly below earlier forecasts.

- A key positive factor is a 13% drop in jet fuel prices compared to 2024, and 1% below prior estimates.

- Airlines are expected to carry more passengers and cargo this year than in 2024.

- Demand projections have been affected by trade tensions and reduced consumer confidence.

Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers.

- Net profit margins are expected to rise from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025.

- This margin is still about half the average across all industries.

- IATA director general Willie Walsh says the results highlight the resilience airlines have built despite challenging conditions.

- According to IATA, “the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel, for a total additional cost of $1.6 billion. In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel. This extra cost is largely the result of SAF 'compliance fees’ being levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge their potential costs as a result of European SAF mandates to include 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TAW/uploadedImages/Professional_Development/Opinion/IATASAF_HERO.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-06-03 06:56:33.053603

Expenses are to reach $913 billion, lower than the $940 billion prediction.","NEW DELHI—The International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a clear warning about the negative consequences of trade barriers and tariffs.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said at the association’s annual general assembly in New Delhi June 2 that “like all forms of connectivity, flying makes the world more prosperous. That stands in contrast to isolationism, trade barriers and the fragmentation of the multi-lateral rules-based system. These destroy wealth and lower living standards. For the times we live in, this is an important message.”

IATA expects the global airline industry to make a $36 billion net profit in 2025. That is $3.6 billion more than it achieved in 2024, but slightly lower than the $36.6 billion IATA had predicted for this year last December. Nonetheless, the industry will record a 3.7% net margin, up from 3.4% last year, mainly because of the lower fuel costs that airlines continue to benefit from.

Revenues are to come in at $979 billion, lower than the $1 trillion that IATA had predicted at the end of 2024. Expenses are to reach $913 billion, lower than the $940 billion prediction.

In absolute numbers, North America is leading the industry with $12 billion in profits, followed by Europe ($11.3 billion), the Middle East ($6.2 billion) and Asia-Pacific ($4.9 billion). The best margin was achieved in the Middle East (8.7%) followed by Europe (4.3%) and North America (4%).

Airlines are going to be impacted by a slowing global economy as many players are taking a wait-and-see attitude as trade conflicts are playing out, experts warned.

“There is a lot of holding your breath—so the global economy starts to slow down,” Andrew Staples, principal at advisory service GeoPol Asia, told the IATA meeting. “Student tourism, tourism, business travel—there is a lot of risk around this.”

The uncertainty and quick changes of U.S. trade policy “create a paralysis,"" said Henry Wilkinson, chief intelligence officer at Dragonfly.

Separately, IATA urged the industry to accelerate sustainability efforts as the rollout of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as air traffic control and fleet modernization, have been falling behind.

“By the time we meet next year, we must be able to show more progress,” Walsh said. “And by 'we,' I mean all the aviation industry and governments who are joined in a common commitment to net zero by 2050.”

IATA has been studying the feasibility of SAF targets, with fuels delivering 65% of planned carbon mitigation in 2050, and has come to the conclusion that there is “more than enough” feedstock for the amounts needed, yet production capacity expansion is lagging.

SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tons in 2025, but that represents only 0.7% of fuel demand. Walsh said that governments are not creating ""supportive policy frameworks,"" that U.S. tax credits that were supposed to support production ramp-up “are now uncertain” and that major energy companies such as Shell and BP have cut back on investment plans.

Also, Walsh pointed out that in his view, government support for CORSIA, the global offset scheme, has weakened and that the European Union (EU) mandate of 2% SAF that is in place now has raised costs, but not production. “It’s an outrage that suppliers are charging airlines compliance fees that value SAF at double its market premium over conventional jet fuel. That’s a billion-dollar windfall for fuel suppliers. This is the EU great green scam.”

Walsh also blasted manufacturers and the supply chain for constant delays. “The manufacturing sector is failing badly,"" he said. Deliveries are down 26% this year versus prior promises, 1,100 aircraft under 10 years of age are in storage and lead times between order and delivery not be 14 years. “It is just not acceptable that it should take until the end of the decade” for supply chain issues to be sorted out, he said.

The average fleet age has risen from 13 to 15 years, according to IATA, as airlines hold on to aging aircraft longer to ensure they have sufficient capacity.

“This is not where we should be in 2025,” Walsh said. “We have a quarter century to get to net zero. There is no time for delay and no tolerance for government greenwashing and unnecessary cost increases. We need urgent actions.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-06-03 06:56:36.005658

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.
Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular.
Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived.
Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach 2 million tonnes (Mt) (2.5 billion liters) or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Problem with the Use of Mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

IATA’s Role in Supporting the Development of a Global SAF Market

To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives:

• A SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

• The SAF Matchmaker that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

Urgent Action by Governments Is Needed

IATA urges gove​​​​rnments to focus on three areas:

1. Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel.

2. Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A wholistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors.

3. Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

Focus on India

India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries Limited, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.

As the third-largest global civil aviation market, India can strengthen its leadership in biofuels with the accelerated adoption of SAF through progressive policies.","https://dev-aspire.imgix.net/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/website/logos/1746635074307-aviationpros_logo_tm.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=solid&fill-color=&w=1200&h=627",N,,2025-06-03 06:57:12.964058

As the first airline to implement this technology, TAP is setting a new industry standard for fuel management, driving significant cost savings while contributing to environmental sustainability. By leveraging data-driven insights, TAP aims to significantly reduce fuel consumption across its fleet, marking a crucial step toward greener aviation practices and a more sustainable future for the industry. The adoption of IATA FuelIS positions TAP as a leader in the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency in aviation.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently announced a significant milestone in the aviation industry: GOL and TAP Air Portugal have become the first airlines to implement IATA FuelIS, an advanced analytics solution aimed at optimizing fuel consumption. This marks a pivotal moment in the aviation sector’s push toward greater fuel efficiency and sustainability.

IATA’s roadmap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions, laid out in their comprehensive 2050 strategy, emphasizes that technological advancements and operational efficiencies will play a crucial role in reducing emissions. These improvements, which directly lower fuel consumption, are expected to contribute roughly 10% of the emissions reductions required to meet the 2050 target. With aviation being a major contributor to global emissions, the implementation of such technologies is essential to the industry’s long-term sustainability.

IATA FuelIS: Revolutionizing Fuel Management

IATA FuelIS is a cutting-edge analytics tool designed to assist airlines in improving fuel efficiency by offering data-driven insights into fuel consumption patterns across various aircraft types, engines, and fleet operations. This solution enables airlines to benchmark their fuel performance against industry standards, identifying opportunities for optimization and ultimately driving down costs. The system uses real-world operational data to evaluate how efficiently an airline is using fuel compared to its peers, providing actionable insights that help airlines make informed decisions about their fleets and operations.

The FuelIS platform leverages data from the IATA Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) platform, which aggregates a vast amount of information gathered from the Flight Data eXchange (FDX) program. The FDX program currently compiles fuel consumption data from over 220 airlines worldwide, representing more than 8 million flights annually. This extensive database enables FuelIS to offer a highly accurate and reliable picture of fuel consumption trends across different regions, markets, countries, and fleet types. By tapping into this wealth of operational data, airlines gain access to a comprehensive and up-to-date view of their fuel usage, which is essential for developing effective fuel management strategies.

FuelIS also integrates seamlessly with IATA’s Fuel Efficiency Gap Analysis (FEGA), a tool that helps airlines track their fuel efficiency over time. FEGA analyzes the data collected by FuelIS to identify the “fuel efficiency gap”—the difference between current performance and industry best practices. This analysis supports the development of targeted fuel strategies and allows airlines to track their progress in improving fuel efficiency. The combination of FuelIS and FEGA provides a powerful suite of tools that airlines can use to minimize fuel consumption, reduce operational costs, and contribute to the broader goal of sustainability.

The Economic and Environmental Impact

The implementation of IATA FuelIS is expected to have both economic and environmental benefits. On the economic side, airlines that use FuelIS can achieve significant cost savings by identifying inefficiencies in fuel usage and addressing them through data-driven solutions. Over the years, IATA’s collaboration with airlines has led to impressive results. Since 2005, IATA has worked with airlines around the world to uncover opportunities for reducing fuel consumption by an estimated 4.76 million tonnes annually. This reduction translates into savings of approximately \$3.8 billion each year. These figures highlight the substantial impact that improved fuel management can have on an airline’s bottom line.

From an environmental perspective, optimizing fuel usage is one of the most effective ways for the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. As global air traffic continues to grow, the pressure on airlines to adopt more sustainable practices becomes even more critical. By implementing technologies like FuelIS, airlines can make significant strides toward lowering their carbon emissions, which is in line with the broader goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition to fuel efficiency, the data insights provided by FuelIS also support other sustainability efforts, such as the identification of operational improvements that reduce aircraft emissions and minimize the environmental impact of air travel.

The Future of Fuel Management in Aviation

The adoption of IATA FuelIS by GOL and TAP Air Portugal represents just the beginning of what is expected to be a broader trend across the aviation industry.

For the estimated one million tonnes of SAF to meet European mandates in 2025, the cost at market prices is projected at US$1.2 billion, with additional compliance fees adding US$1.7 billion. Walsh pointed out that this extra cost could have been used to reduce a further 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

He questioned the implementation of mandates ahead of adequate market conditions and safeguards, noting that increasing the cost of decarbonisation – already estimated at US$4.7 trillion – could hinder progress. Walsh suggested that Europe may need to reassess its current approach.

To support a global SAF market, IATA has developed two initiatives. The first is a SAF registry, managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), which provides a transparent, standardised system for tracking SAF purchases, usage, and emissions reductions in line with international regulations such as the Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The second initiative, the SAF Matchmaker, aims to facilitate SAF procurement by connecting airline requests with supply offers.

IATA has called on governments to take urgent action in three key areas. First, governments should create more effective policies by removing the disadvantages renewable energy producers face compared to fossil fuel industries, including reallocating some of the US$1 trillion global subsidies currently directed at fossil fuels. Second, a comprehensive energy policy is required, one that increases renewable energy production and ensures an appropriate allocation for SAF. This should include support for shared infrastructure and co-production to benefit aviation and other sectors. Third, governments should ensure the success of CORSIA by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines; to date, only Guyana has made its carbon credits accessible for this purpose.

India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer after the US and China, has launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to promote biofuels as a key component of its energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target of two per cent SAF blending in international flights by 2028, supported by policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA is collaborating with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association and Praj Industries to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of feedstocks in India.

As the third-largest civil aviation market globally, India is positioned to strengthen its leadership in biofuels by accelerating SAF adoption through progressive policies.",https://ttgasia.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/SAF-concept-640.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 06:58:00.041266

LATAM Airlines Group to host 82nd IATA AGM in Rio de Janeiro​: IATA announced that the 82nd IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2026, hosted by LATAM Airlines Group.
The last time the IATA AGM was in South America was in 1999, also in Rio.
“LATAM is proud to host the IATA AGM in Brazil in 2026, the main market for our airline group connecting South America to the world.","Policy shortcomings put SAF production at risk: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach 2 million tonnes (Mt) (2.5 billion liters) or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025. “While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel. “This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh. IATA urges governments to focus on three areas: Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel. Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A wholistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors. Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards announced: IATA announced the winners of the annual IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards: Inspirational Role Model: Claudia Zapata-Cardone, President of the Latin Professionals in Aerospace (LPA); High Flyer: Katherine Moloney, Founder of Elevate (her) Aviation; Diversity & Inclusion Team: Air Canada. “Diversity and inclusion is strategic for aviation as the industry’s growth is contingent upon attracting a strong talent pool with a wide variety of skills. Congratulations go to this year’s awardees who have all excelled at creating the potential for any individual to have a great career in aviation—an industry that is a powerful force for social and economic prosperity.

Through their support, each winner receives a prize of $25,000, payable either to themselves or their nominated charities.

$1.3 billion in airline funds blocked by governments: The International Air Transport Association reported that $1.3 billion in airline funds are blocked from repatriation by governments as of end April 2025. This is a significant amount, although it is an improvement of 25% compared with the $1.7 billion reported for October 2024. IATA urged governments to remove all barriers preventing airlines from the timely repatriation of their revenues from ticket sales and other activities in accordance with international agreements and treaty obligations. “Ensuring the timely repatriation of revenues is vital for airlines to cover dollar-denominated expenses and maintain their operations. Delays and denials violate bilateral agreements and increase exchange rate risks. Reliable access to revenues is critical for any business—particularly airlines which operate on very thin margins. Economies and jobs rely on international connectivity. Governments must realise that it is a challenge for airlines to maintain connectivity when revenue repatriation is denied or delayed,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. Pakistan and Bangladesh, previously in the top five blocked funds countries, have made notable progress in clearing their backlog to $83 million and $92 million, respectively (from $311 million and $196 million in October 2024, respectively). Mozambique has climbed up to the top of blocked funds countries, withholding $205 million from airlines, compared with $127 million in October 2024. The Africa and Middle East (AME) region accounts for 85% of total blocked funds, at $1.1 billion as of end April 2025. The most significant improvement was noted in Bolivia, fully clearing its backlog that stood at $42 million at end October 2024.

At the same time, the industry has incredible strengths to call on— most of all the quality of the people that strive to make aviation a safe, secure and rewarding experience for millions of travelers every day. IATA has a vital role in harnessing these human and technical resources to deliver leadership and innovation. I look forward to playing my part in steering IATA in its long mission for a strong and successful airline industry,” said Gallego. Gallego has nearly 30 years of broad experience in the aviation industry. He became IAG’s chief executive in September 2020, joining from Iberia, where he was chairman and chief executive from January 2014. During his tenure at Iberia, he turned the airline around and improved its efficiency, customer service and brand. Before that, Gallego launched Iberia Express, as chief executive from January 2012, making the new Iberia subsidiary one of the most efficient and punctual airlines in Europe.

LATAM Airlines Group to host 82nd IATA AGM in Rio de Janeiro​: IATA announced that the 82nd IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2026, hosted by LATAM Airlines Group. “We are excited to accept LATAM’s offer to host IATA’s 82nd AGM in Rio de Janeiro.

The collaborative efforts of SunGas Renewables, C2X, ENEOS, and Maersk exemplify the kind of strategic partnerships necessary to drive meaningful progress in the global supply of low-carbon fuels.

Understanding Green Methanol: A Key to Sustainable Energy

Green methanol is a renewable fuel produced by combining carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from renewable sources with green hydrogen generated from biogenic sources or through electrolysis powered by renewable electricity. This process results in a liquid fuel that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fossil fuels.

The production of green methanol involves several pathways:

Biomass Gasification: Converting organic materials such as woody biomass and agricultural waste into syngas, which is then synthesized into methanol.

Electrofuel Pathways: Utilizing renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, which is then combined with captured CO2 to create methanol.

These methods not only provide a use for waste materials but also offer a means to store renewable energy in a liquid form, facilitating easier transportation and storage.

The Benefits and Applications of Green Methanol

Green methanol offers numerous advantages that make it a compelling alternative to traditional fossil fuels:

Significant Emission Reductions: It can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 95%, nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 80%, and virtually eliminate sulfur oxide and particulate matter emissions.

Versatility: Applicable across various sectors, including maritime shipping, aviation, and chemical manufacturing.

Compatibility: Can be used in existing internal combustion engines, facilitating simple adoption and integration into today's infrastructure.

Energy Storage: Acts as an efficient energy carrier, storing renewable energy in a stable, liquid form.

These attributes position green methanol as a pivotal component in the global strategy to achieve net-zero emissions and combat climate change.

Looking Ahead

The developments surrounding the Beaver Lake project and the substantial investment by industry leaders underscore the growing commitment to green methanol as a cornerstone of sustainable energy solutions. As technology advances and production scales up, green methanol is poised to play a critical role as a cleaner solution for various sectors by supplying an additional low-carbon fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel production to double in 2025, says IATA

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts SAF production to reach 2 million tonnes in 2025. Although a positive direction for the aviation industry, the rising production in SAF will not add to the 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption the fuel contributes. The production will further add $4.4 billion to the global aviation fuel bill due to rising costs. IATA warns that the slow increase in SAF investment is not enough to meet 2050 net-zero emissions. Issues of supply and demand plague the aviation industry as Airbus and Boeing struggle to bring to market fuel-efficient aircraft at a rate that is fast enough to meet demands. To accelerate sustainable solution adoption, companies will require the use of sustainability tools as industries like aviation move towards net-zero adoption.

Their groundbreaking work in developing a liquid hydrogen storage and delivery system promises to elevate zero-emission aviation from visionary concept to near-term commercial reality—even as early as 2035.

Bridging the Hydrogen Divide

Hydrogen’s potential as an aviation fuel is undisputed: its energy density far surpasses conventional jet fuel, and it burns without producing carbon dioxide. However, its practical adoption is hampered by formidable engineering challenges. Storing hydrogen safely requires cooling it to a staggering –487.4°F (–253°C), and traditional techniques rely on heavy, separate systems to manage fuel storage and thermal regulation. This dichotomy has long been the Achilles’ heel for hydrogen’s role in aviation.

The FAMU-FSU team has taken a holistic approach by designing an integrated system that uses hydrogen not only as fuel but as a built-in cooling agent. This synergy is a paradigm shift—eliminating the need for bulky additional equipment while solving multiple technical hurdles simultaneously.

The Heart of the Innovation: Technical Advances Unpacked

A Leap in Gravimetric Efficiency

One of the most impressive breakthroughs achieved is the development of a system with a gravimetric index of 0.62. In simple terms, 62% of the total weight of the storage system is usable hydrogen—not the heavy, cumbersome structure typical of conventional designs. This dramatic improvement means that every kilogram saved on structure is another kilogram available to power the future of flight.

Pump-Free, Pressure-Regulated Delivery

Mechanical pumps, indispensable in many fuel systems, become liabilities under cryogenic conditions. They add both weight and potential failure points. Addressing this, the FAMU-FSU engineers have devised a pump-free delivery mechanism. By regulating tank pressure through dynamically controlled feedback loops, the system adjusts fuel flow in real time. High-pressure injections boost flow when needed, while venting excess vapor fine-tunes the balance. This elegant solution minimizes moving parts, enhances reliability, and optimizes the delivery of hydrogen under the severe conditions of flight.

Integrated Thermal Management: Dual-Purpose Design

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the system lies in its use of hydrogen for thermal management. By channeling the ultra-cold liquid hydrogen through a series of strategically placed heat exchangers, the system performs a dual function. First, it cools critical high-performance components—such as superconducting generators, motors, and power electronics. In doing so, it extracts waste heat and, simultaneously, preheats the hydrogen to optimal operating temperatures for fuel cells and turbines. This staged thermal integration not only streamlines system architecture but also directly contributes to overall energy efficiency, setting the stage for truly sustainable aviation.

Meeting the Demands of Modern Flight

Simulation studies underscore the system’s robust performance. With hydrogen delivery rates reaching 0.25 kilograms per second, it can supply up to 16.2 megawatts of electrical power—precisely what is required during the high-demand phases of takeoff or emergency maneuvers. The focus on system-level optimization, including the precise management of vent pressures and heat exchanger dimensions, ensures that the design is primed for commercial aviation use.

Toward Commercialization and Beyond

While detailed simulations mark a significant step forward, the journey from concept to widespread adoption continues. The next phase involves building a prototype system for experimental validation—a critical milestone under NASA’s Integrated Zero Emission Aviation program. This initiative, which brings together leading institutions nationwide, is instrumental in driving research that translates into operational, zero-emission aircraft.

Beyond aviation, the principles underlying this hydrogen storage system have far-reaching implications. The integrated approach to fuel storage and thermal management could transform storage solutions in other high-demand sectors, laying the groundwork for a broader hydrogen economy.

Redefining the Future of Flight

The work at FAMU-FSU sets a new industry benchmark.

In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.","Sustainable aviation fuel in 2025 is projected to reach 2 million metric tonnes (2.5 billion liters), the International Air Transport Association announced Sunday at its annual general meeting in New Delhi.

""While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million [metric] tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation's total fuel needs,"" IATA general director Willie Walsh said in a statement. ""And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.""

Most SAF now is ""heading toward Europe,"" where the EU and U.K. mandates began on Jan. 1, 2025. In addition, the cost of SAF to airlines ""has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging,"" according to IATA, which estimated that compliance fees will add $1.7 billion on top of market prices—""an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.""

IATA also estimated that the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel. In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.

Walsh added that ""this highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization.""

“Pittsburgh International Airport has long been committed to resiliency and driving innovation in the aviation and energy industries,” Cassotis said.","Pittsburgh International Airport and Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel are partnering to develop the first on-airport sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility utilizing one of the very first alcohol-to-jet pathways in the U.S.

Avina said it will build a state-of-the-art facility to provide ASTM certified fuel on airport property just south of PIT’s terminal by deploying KBR’s innovative PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology, developed and owned by Swedish Biofuels AB and exclusively licensed globally by KBR.

This facility will be a gamechanger in the infrastructure and economic development for the Pittsburgh region and will present a unique opportunity for airline partners to secure SAF readily and cost-effectively to meet their ambitious decarbonization targets. This development supports PIT’s unrelenting commitment to resiliency and energy innovation initiatives for the aviation industry.

The facility, through multiple phases of development, is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually to meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and beyond. Avina’s SAF facility will provide the opportunity for hundreds of full-time jobs, when constructed. The plant will have a carbon intensity that is at least 65 percent lower than that of conventional jet fuel, according to Avina’s May 29 press release.

Support from Global Aviation Leaders

The project has earned support from international aviation leaders.

“In pursuit of responsible and resilient growth in aerospace, Boeing supports the development of advanced, synthetic fuels here in the U.S. to power air travel into the future,” said Mike Caston, Director, Americas Partnerships and Policy, Boeing.

Project leaders from KBR, Pittsburgh International Airport and Avina acknowledged the global support and potential impact the project would have.

“KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it onsite at the airport,” said Hari Ravindran, KBR’s Global SVP for Technology said. “PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) Technology, is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100 percent drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.”

“This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,” said Christina Cassotis, CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport. “With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure, and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.”

Vishal Shah, Founder and CEO of Avina said, “Avina is excited to support the vision of Pittsburgh International Airport and bring a SAF production facility to their doorstep.

With Pittsburgh’s commercial and cargo demand along with the network to connect to the other regional hubs, we aim to set the platform for such developments nationally and globally.”

Latest Addition to PIT’s Energy Resiliency and Innovation

The announcement adds to the airport’s energy portfolio, which includes a first-in-the-world microgrid launched in 2021.

Power outages that shut down London Heathrow Airport and airports in Spain and Portugal earlier this year highlighted the significance of PIT’s award-winning microgrid, a blueprint for airport resiliency around the world.

Thanks to the microgrid, PIT is the first to completely generate its own power using natural gas and solar energy – and, in addition to boosting resiliency, has saved the airport more than $1 million per year in electricity costs.

In addition, the airport announced a project in April to more than double the 10,000 solar panels that already exist on airport property.

Unlike rival Heart Aerospace, which is developing the ES-30 hybrid-electric 30-seat airliner, Deutsche Aircraft has opted for conventional propulsion provided by off-the-shelf PW127XT-S powerplants, similar to those on the ATR 42-600.
Although Deutsche Aircraft has not announced firm orders for the D328eco, Neumann says the company is talking to around 60 potential customers and has “lots of” letters of intent or LOIs.
Founded in Friedrichshafen in 1914 by Claude Dornier, the original Dornier company set up its Oberpfaffenhofen factory in the 1930s and became one of the biggest names in German aviation.
Neither will Deutsche Aircraft be rushing to join the electric or disruptive propulsion bandwagon.","Excitement and pride were in plentiful supply on 28 May as politicians, dignitaries, and suppliers joined Deutsche Aircraft management and staff in an Oberpfaffenhofen hangar to hail the roll-out of the D328eco as the first all-German commercial aircraft in a generation to enter production. “German aviation is back home,” enthused the company’s co-chief executive Nico Neumann as employees embraced amid the applause.

Airbus – which assembles airliners in Hamburg, fighters in Manching, and helicopters in Donauworth – and the likes of military trainer specialist Grob might take issue with Deutsche Aircraft’s suggestion that it is single-handedly revitalizing the domestic aircraft manufacturing sector. However, the business’s pledge to bring back to life a type introduced almost 35 years ago and become only the second player after ATR in the 40-seat turboprop market is certainly significant.

Sierra Nevada-owned Deutsche Aircraft admits the D328eco – which it hopes to fly later this year with an entry into service target of quarter four 2027 – is not a clean-sheet design. Rather, it is an “advanced evolution” of the original Dornier 328 with the latest version of Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PW100-series engine, new Garmin avionics, redesigned landing gear, and a fuselage stretched by 2.1m (6.9ft) to accommodate 40 seats instead of its predecessor’s 32.

Some might even say the “eco” designation is also a bit of a misnomer. Unlike rival Heart Aerospace, which is developing the ES-30 hybrid-electric 30-seat airliner, Deutsche Aircraft has opted for conventional propulsion provided by off-the-shelf PW127XT-S powerplants, similar to those on the ATR 42-600. The company also makes great play of the D328eco being “100% SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] compatible”, but that hardly makes it unique. Most modern engines are, in theory.

However, the biggest challenge facing Deutsche Aircraft – which succeeded 328 Support Services, the company that took over the type certificate and design rights to the original Dornier 328 turboprop and its 328JET sibling and was subsequently acquired by Sierra Nevada in 2015 – will be breathing new life into a moribund market for sub-50-seat passenger aircraft.

Sales of the ATR 42 are massively outpaced by those of the larger ATR 72. In fact, last year, of 56 ATRs ordered, only five were for the smaller variant. The only other Western company in the segment, De Havilland Canada, which owns the out-of-production DHC-8 series of regional turboprops, has shown little appetite to return to manufacturing.

So, what makes Neumann confident that Deutsche Aircraft can deliver in the sort of numbers that will justify its investment in a new production plant at Leipzig airport capable of building 48 aircraft a year, which will be ready to begin production in early 2026, and a supply chain that includes a rear fuselage assembly line at Dynamatic Technologies in Bengaluru, India? “Quite simply, the market loves this product,” he says.

Although Deutsche Aircraft has not announced firm orders for the D328eco, Neumann says the company is talking to around 60 potential customers and has “lots of” letters of intent or LOIs. On top of a “replacement market” for ageing small regional aircraft – including 150 legacy 328 turboprops and jets still in service – there are “classic growth markets” in India and the rest of Asia, where demand for regional air services is growing exponentially, he asserts.

He refutes the suggestion that most new airlines in emerging markets want to start large – eschewing 40-seat regional turboprops for bigger regional jets or even Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies. Many existing carriers offering essential connectivity services around the world have “had the chance to go big and haven’t”, he suggests. He cites Norway, Australia, and the north of Canada as being among the territories where there is the largest need to replace ageing fleets.

While Neumann makes much of the “Dornier DNA” behind the D328eco, Deutsche Aircraft decided not to build the aircraft in the erstwhile brand’s spiritual home of Bavaria, where Dornier made its name and the original 328 was assembled. Instead, it chose Saxony in eastern Germany where wages and living costs are lower. Leipzig, says Neumann, is also “well connected” by transport links and, as a DHL hub, is one of the centres of the European air freight industry.

Construction of the new facility began a few weeks ago, and Deutsche Aircraft aims to have it ready before the end of the year, when it will begin installing jigs and assembly lines. Neumann expects output in the first full year to be around 12 aircraft, rising into the 20s in the second or third and eventually into the forties, although he is reluctant to set out a precise ramp-up timetable.

The aircraft unveiled at Oberpfaffenhofen – test aircraft or TAC 1 - was lacking engines. Its PW127XTs are poised at P&WC’s facility at Longueuil near Montreal but shipping them over for a roll-out ceremony months before they are required would be “sending the wrong signal” to staff at a time when the business needs to preserve cash, says Neumann.

TAC 1’s fuselage is constructed from two separate legacy 328 structures – the nose and empennage from one and centre section from the other – to achieve a stretch without plugs. TAC 2 will join it in flight testing next year, chiefly to evaluate aircraft systems, while a third test platform, with final cabin configuration, will be the first example assembled in Leipzig.

Following its appearance at last year’s Farnborough event, Deutsche Aircraft will be at the Paris air show with a mock-up of the D328eco on display in its chalet. The company is one of at least three spin-offs from the original Dornier – others are Dornier Seawings, developer of the Seastar CD2 amphibian, which has offices next to Deutsche Aircraft in Oberpfaffenhofen, and General Atomics AeroTec Systems, an offshoot of the US defence giant, which is behind the NXT variant of the original Dornier 228 turboprop.

Founded in Friedrichshafen in 1914 by Claude Dornier, the original Dornier company set up its Oberpfaffenhofen factory in the 1930s and became one of the biggest names in German aviation. In the mid-1990s, the business was taken over by US firm Fairchild, becoming Fairchild Dornier and continuing production of the 328, which entered service in 1993, as well as developing a 70-seat regional jet called the 728JET. However, the costs of the latter programme proved too much and Fairchild Dornier collapsed in 2002, days after rolling out the prototype.

A short-lived venture, AvCraft, acquired the rights to the 328 and planned to restart production of the jet, but itself went bankrupt three years later. 328 Support Services took over the entire 328 programme in 2006 – with the aim of providing maintenance, repair, and overhaul services to operators of the existing fleet. Nine years later, 328 Support Services was itself taken over by Sierra Nevada, which in turn renamed it Deutsche Aircraft with plans to resume production of the turboprop.

However, the 328JET will not be resurrected. “There is no market in a sustainable aviation world for a [regional] jet,” says Neumann. Neither will Deutsche Aircraft be rushing to join the electric or disruptive propulsion bandwagon. “Maybe down the line we could look at a hybrid or even hydrogen in 15 years, but our priority is establishing the D328eco,” he says.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/4/9/110249_tac1_706811.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 15:57:08.913708

The announcement came during an event organized by Invest UP, where Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh briefed industry representatives and investors about the upcoming policy framework.

Singh highlighted the state’s strategic advantages as a potential hub for SAF production, citing proposed incentives, streamlined facilitation processes, and robust logistics infrastructure. He emphasized that the policy aims not only to attract investment but also to create significant benefits for the agricultural community in the state.

The SAF sector’s reliance on biomass and grain-based feedstock—such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, wheat straw, and surplus grains—could open new revenue streams for farmers, Singh said. By sourcing raw materials locally, the initiative is expected to boost rural incomes and offer better price realisation for agricultural produce.

“This initiative not only strengthens our commitment to green energy but also ensures that farmers become direct beneficiaries, enhancing their earnings while contributing to a more sustainable future,” Singh stated.

A detailed presentation by Invest UP outlined the state’s vision for SAF and was followed by a discussion session with key industry stakeholders. Topics such as land availability, policy framework, and ease of doing business were addressed during the interaction.

The event drew strong interest from investors, with over 18 companies expressing a willingness to set up SAF manufacturing units in the state. These firms collectively proposed investment intents exceeding ₹3,000 crore.

Singh also underscored Uttar Pradesh’s unparalleled connectivity, pointing to its extensive air, rail, and road network, including five international airports, which offers seamless logistics and market access for potential investors.

Previously, Invest UP had issued an Expression of Interest (EOI) to attract global SAF technology providers and clean energy innovators to participate in the state’s growing green energy ecosystem.

However, this increased output will still only account for a mere 0.7 percent of the fuel used by airlines.

IATA, a key industry organization, has consistently cautioned that airlines face significant hurdles in achieving their environmental sustainability targets. It has previously described the rate of SAF production as disappointingly slow, noting that this greener fuel is also more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, acknowledged the positive news of increased production but highlighted the financial implications. He stated that even this relatively small amount of SAF will add an estimated $4.4 billion to the global aviation industry’s fuel expenses.

“The pace of progress in boosting production and finding ways to make it cheaper must get faster,” Walsh urged in a statement.

In 2021, the broader aviation industry committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This ambitious goal largely depends on a gradual shift towards SAF, which is manufactured from waste oils and biomass.

First, a transition plan contextualizes measures like energy efficiency upgrades relative to other decarbonization levers like SAF.","Banks can highlight to clients why granular, entity-level transition planning enables corporations to credibly finance low-hanging fruit like energy efficiency. For high-emitting corporations, near-term, decarbonization actions like energy efficiency are important to their net-zero journey despite being activities they might do regardless of climate goals (e.g., airlines buying fuel-efficient aircraft). These activities are usually necessary but insufficient to reach net -zero and shouldn’t inhibit/replace more difficult, transformative changes to capital stock in the medium -term. Transition plans can address this nuance by contextualizing near-term versus medium-term actions to protect against greenwashing.

Disclaimer: This hypothetical case study is based on several real-world transactions and conversations with aviation and sustainability bankers. This archetypal deal illustrates what credible transition finance could look like.

The nascent transition finance market often lacks consensus on assessing additionality. For example, whether and how to reward companies for conducting practices that could contribute to climate targets but also be business as usual (BAU), such as investing in energy efficiency.

Airlines routinely replace old aircraft with new ones and, generally, each new generation of aircraft is more energy efficient than the last. Airlines prioritized energy efficiency long before they set climate targets because efficiency improvements pay for themselves via lower fuel expenses (fuel costs can be 30%-40% of operating expenditure). Today, therefore, it could be unclear whether acquisition financing for new aircraft can be labeled as transition finance or whether this activity should be seen as BAU.

Simply replacing old aircraft with more efficient new models is necessary but insufficient to achieving net -zero; quickly modernizing fleets is one part of a comprehensive aviation transition plan that also includes switching to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), mitigating contrails, and electrifying airport infrastructure in the medium- to long-term.

Additionally, rather than buying new, highly efficient aircraft, an airline may use bank financing to replace old/inefficient aircraft with used, slightly less inefficient aircraft because they are cheap and available. On the surface, it may look like the airline has improved its fleet’s overall efficiency, but deeper analysis would show the marginal improvement isn’t enough to align with sector decarbonization pathways. Transition-labeled UOP acquisition financing for a purchase like this could result in greenwashing accusations for lenders.

In this archetypal case, the banks determined that replacing an old aircraft with the new Boeing 787-8 supported the client’s broader transition plan by helping keep the airline’s emissions trajectory inside a 1.5°C pathway. The banking syndicate could finance the purchase via a transition-linked loan tied to the airline’s overall Scope 1 GHG emissions decreasing ~20% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline, in line with aviation sector transition pathways.

Without a transition plan to contextualize it, this type of UOP, asset-level financing would risk being just a “transition-compatible” BAU activity rather than an example of transition finance. Good corporate transition planning can give private and public lenders high quality data on which to base financial offerings — especially for high capex, higher risk parts of the client’s transition. A good transition plan helps banks credibly disburse asset-level loans — and potentially also much larger general corporate purpose debt packages — in two main ways.

First, a transition plan contextualizes measures like energy efficiency upgrades relative to other decarbonization levers like SAF. Fuel efficiency comprises up to 45% of aviation sector emissions reductions (see infographic below), according to Mission Possible Partnership. In this archetypal case, a robust transition plan would quantify the (important but limited) role that this type of $100 million energy efficiency deal played in the airline’s net-zero transition relative to investments in SAF. Banks could do this energy-efficiency deal knowing that the client also plans to invest the appropriate amount in SAF.

Second, a transition plan would provide granularity on the airline’s energy efficiency strategy, including the annual aircraft replacement rate needed to modernize the airline’s fleet in line with transition pathways. A robust plan would define what efficiency thresholds new aircraft need to meet to be considered “additional” beyond BAU. The Boeing 787, for example, is widely accepted as a leading example of an energy- efficient aircraft. Energy efficiency in aviation can entail near-term, low-hanging fruit (e.g., carbon fiber instead of metal alloys in planes’ wings) as well as more radical, medium-term changes (e.g., replacing traditional propulsion systems with novel propulsion systems like hydrogen fuel cells and batteries). For those breakthrough technologies, export credit agencies (i.e., public lenders that regularly participate in airline deals) could provide loan guarantees to support deals that private banks alone wouldn’t underwrite.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/american-airlines-boeing-787-aircraft-at-dfw-airport-2183087051.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 16:56:44.735816

Restarting ethanol production is projected to bring economic benefits to Luverne and surrounding communities by supporting local agriculture and boosting the regional economy.","Gevo Inc. has signed a definitive agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary, Agri-Energy LLC, to Minnesota-based A.E. Innovation LLC for $7 million. The transaction includes the 18-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility located in Luverne, Minnesota. The sale marks a significant step in Gevo’s ongoing strategic repositioning, as it focuses on renewable fuels and sustainable chemicals.

As part of the agreement, Gevo will retain select isobutanol-related assets and a portion of the undeveloped land at the Luverne site. These retained assets could support future production of up to 1 million gallons annually of isobutanol, which may be sold as a specialty chemical or converted into renewable fuels such as isooctane and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ethanol production at the Luverne facility has been idled since 2022. A.E. Innovation, an agriculture-driven investment group, intends to restart operations and repurpose the site into a hub for scaling new technologies in the biofuel and renewable chemicals sectors.

“We’re seeing rapid innovation in bio-based fuels and chemicals, and Agri-Energy has a strong track record of being on the leading edge,” said Dave Kolsrud, principal of A.E. Innovation. “Luverne, with its low-carbon corn, wind power, and community spirit, is the right place to advance the next generation of biofuel technologies.”

The Luverne facility has played a key role in demonstrating regenerative agriculture practices in collaboration with local farmers. It has also served as an educational platform showcasing the versatility of corn and the potential of biofuels, including ethanol, SAF, and isobutanol.

Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber expressed optimism about the partnership with A.E. Innovation. “We see tremendous opportunities for growth and collaboration,” Gruber said. “Luverne and its farming community are ideal for building forward-thinking, sustainable solutions based on carbohydrate-derived energy and chemicals.”

Under the terms of the deal, Gevo will receive $2 million at closing, with an additional $5 million to follow under the purchase agreement. The transaction is also expected to generate about $3 million in annual savings by eliminating current facility idling costs. Gevo anticipates potential synergies from operating isobutanol production alongside renewed ethanol output.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2025, pending A.E. Innovation’s financing and standard closing conditions. Restarting ethanol production is projected to bring economic benefits to Luverne and surrounding communities by supporting local agriculture and boosting the regional economy.

In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.
This extra cost is largely the result of SAF ‘compliance fees’ being levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge their potential costs as a result of European SAF mandates to include 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply.
“The behaviour of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage.
Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers,” said Walsh.","Willie Walsh, Director of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has hit out at fuel suppliers for “profiteering” by levying “compliance fees” as the European and UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates came into force.

SAF production is projected to double to two million tonnes (approximately two and a half billion litres) in 2025, which would meet around 0.7% of global airline fuel demand, IATA has calculated.

However, Walsh warned that this progress, while encouraging, is insufficient and comes at a significant cost. “Even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill,” he said. “The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

IATA expressed significant concerns regarding the implementation of SAF mandates, particularly in Europe, where EU and UK regulations came into force on January 1, 2025.

IATA estimates that the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel, for a total additional cost of $1.6 billion. In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel. This extra cost is largely the result of SAF ‘compliance fees’ being levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge their potential costs as a result of European SAF mandates to include 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply.

“The behaviour of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage. The cost of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is estimated to be an enormous $4.7 trillion. Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers,” said Walsh.

The global aviation industry earned a total profit of 36 billion dollars in 2024, translating to a modest margin of just 3.7%, according to senior economist and Vice President Thomsen, who addressed presspersons on Monday. She described aviation as a “capital-intensive and complex endeavour,” heavily reliant on passenger revenue, which accounts for over 70% of the sector’s earnings.

Speaking about rising operational costs, Thomsen noted that fuel alone makes up 26% of the industry’s total expenditure. “In 2025, every passenger flying contributed an average of 7.2 billion dollars in earnings to the aviation sector. In contrast, a passenger in the Middle East brought in 27.2 billion dollars, while in Africa it was just 1.3 billion dollars,” she said, attributing the Middle East’s high figure to significant investments in infrastructure.

Thomsen suggested that airlines could explore alternatives like manufacturing their own fuel internally, particularly Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), to ease dependency and reduce long-term fuel costs.

Supply chain disruptions remain a major challenge, she pointed out. “The industry is severely impacted by delays, especially when it comes to the delivery of regional jets and turbojets,” she said, adding that long waiting periods for aircraft are impeding fleet expansions and operations.

On the question of airfares, Thomsen remarked that fares have been on a consistent downward trend since the industry's early years. “This decline is likely to continue, thanks in part to the reduction in fuel costs,” she said.",https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2025-06-02%2Fih6efk09%2F1000449348.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-06-02 12:56:54.152103

The funding will bolster SkyNRG’s first SAF production facility, which will be built in Delfzijl, Netherlands and is expected to become operational in 2028 with a planned annual capacity of approximately 120,000t.

In 2019, Shell Aviation announced its support to SkyNRG for the development of its SAF production facility in Delfzijl.

The Delfzijl plant will process low-quality oils and fats that would otherwise be burned, while avoiding mainstream waste cooking oils and virgin vegetable oils.

Other projects in SkyNRG’s pipeline will utilise different technologies such as eSAF, a synthetic aviation fuel made from renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide.

The deal’s completion is contingent upon receiving regulatory approvals and is anticipated to occur in the latter half of 2025.

The aviation sector is claimed to account for roughly 2.5% of global annual CO2 emissions.

SAF offers a minimum emissions reduction of 80% compared to fossil jet fuel over its lifecycle, according to the company.

APG infrastructure associate director Jan Jacob van Wulfften Palthe said: “As the transition to net zero accelerates, SAF offers a viable pathway towards decarbonising the sector.

“It utilises renewable feedstocks and can be blended with or replace fossil jet fuel. SAF’s key advantage is its “drop-in” compatibility, integrating seamlessly into existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure without modifications, unlike hydrogen or battery-electric alternatives that require extensive redesigns.”

Founded in 2009 and based in Amsterdam, SkyNRG has supplied SAF to more than 30 airlines across six continents and is claimed to have facilitated the world’s first commercial SAF-powered flight in 2011.

Still, that will amount to just 0.7% of aviation fuel needs in 2025, the airline trade group says.

Overall, IATA expects approximately 660 million gallons of SAF to be produced globally this year. Approximately 60% of that supply will be required for airlines in the U.K. and EU to meet SAF mandates that went into effect this year.

Under both mandates, SAF must account for 2% of fuel supply this year.

'A great green scam'

At its annual meeting here on Sunday, IATA restated its opposition to those mandates, saying that they have doubled the cost of SAF in Europe due to compliance fees charged by SAF producers and suppliers. Those extra costs are expected to amount to $1.7 billion this year, the trade group said.

IATA director general Willie Walsh called the mandate ""a great green scam"" during his opening address at the IATA AGM.

IATA has longed advocated for government incentive programs to spur SAF investment, rather than mandates. The airline group said governments subsidize fossil fuel production to the tune of $1 trillion per year and is advocating for a portion of such funds to be re-allocated to SAF.

Airlines have set goal of net-zero emissions

Airlines globally have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with 65% of the reductions to come from a ramp-up of SAF usage. IATA estimates the SAF transition will cost $4.7 trillion. Despite the enormous price tag, the trade group's chief economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, said it is achievable during a June 1 press briefing.

IATA says there is adequate SAF feedstock to meet the 2050 commitment. But it says governments aren't making the required commitments.

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates for a 2% SAF blend kicked in on 1 January 2025, noted IATA.
The cost of SAF for airlines has now doubled in Europe, said the association, because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging.
For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion.
Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.","Ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties have brought significant unpredictability to global markets, including commercial aviation. But according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2025 will nonetheless be a slightly better year for airlines than in 2024, albeit a touch below IATA’s previous predictions.

“The biggest positive driver is the price of jet fuel which has fallen 13% compared with 2024 and 1% below previous estimates,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said at the IATA annual general meeting (AGM) in New Delhi, India.

“Moreover, we anticipate airlines flying more people and more cargo in 2025 than they did in 2024, even if previous demand projections have been dented by trade tensions and falls in consumer confidence.”

The result for airlines, he said, is an improvement of net margins from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025. “That’s still about half the average profitability across all industries. But considering the headwinds, it’s a strong result that demonstrates the resilience that airlines have worked hard to fortify.”

In 2025, total traveler numbers are expected to reach a record high 4.99 billion, representing a 4% increase on 2024, but below the previously projected 5.22 billion.

Other highlights from the air transport industry’s expected 2025 financial performance see net profits rising to $36 billion from the $32.4 billion earned in 2024, but slightly down on the previously projected $36.6 billion; and total revenues reaching a record high of $979 billion, a 1.3% increase on 2024, but below the $1 trillion previously predicted by IATA.

Air cargo volumes are expected to inch up by 0.6% year-over-year to 69 million tonnes, which is below the prior forecast of 72.5 million tonnes.

“Perspective is critical to put into context such large industry-wide aggregate figures,” said Walsh. “Earning a $36 billion profit is significant. But that equates to just $7.20 per passenger per segment. It’s still a thin buffer and any new tax, increase in airport or navigation charge, demand shock or costly regulation will quickly put the industry’s resilience to the test.

“Policymakers who rely on airlines as the core of a value chain that employs 86.5 million people and supports 3.9% of global economic activity, must keep this clearly in focus.”

Even as the price of jet fuel has fallen, the high cost of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains a continued pain point for airlines. Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates for a 2% SAF blend kicked in on 1 January 2025, noted IATA. And those blend requirements will rise in the coming years.

The cost of SAF for airlines has now doubled in Europe, said the association, because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion.

Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices — an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization,” said Walsh.

“Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives: a SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as global offsetting scheme CORSIA and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme; and the so-called SAF Matchmaker program that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

But IATA is calling for “urgent action” by governments to create more effective policies, develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF; and ensure the success of CORSIA “as the sole market-based mechanism” to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions.

“Good intentions will not get us to net zero,” warned Walsh in New Delhi. “Action is what we need. Fortunately, it’s not too late to pick up pace and re-align us on the path to success.”

Catalytic Capital: Barclays’ £203M investment unlocked an additional £305M from third parties—£2.18 for every £1 invested.

Systemic Gap Addressed: The initiative targets the “missing middle” of climate tech funding, bridging early- and late-stage investment barriers.

Economic Impact: Portfolio companies created 1,309 jobs, including 664 in the UK, advancing energy innovation and job growth.

Barclays Climate Ventures has catalyzed more than £508 million in climate tech investment since 2020, according to its newly released 2024 impact report. By leading or co-leading 61% of its deals, the group has leveraged £203 million of Barclays capital to secure £305 million from third-party investors.

“Through a willingness to adjust our risk appetite and take a new approach, we have been successful in catalysing investment into climate tech,” said Steven Poulter, Head of Barclays Climate Ventures. “We now call for more investors to join us on this journey.”

The report, with data validated by the Carbon Trust, highlights Barclays’ role in filling a critical financing gap—where many climate tech firms struggle to secure capital due to high upfront costs, long scaling timelines, and risk-return profiles that deter traditional VCs and infrastructure funds.

But Mr Counsell said: “If we can get to 20 million tonnes, the price will halve.” The Independent has contacted British Airways for comment.
In September, British Airways became the largest carbon removal purchaser in the UK after agreeing to a more than £9 million partnership with UK-based company CUR8.","British Airways may soon offer cheaper, more eco-friendly flights than competitor airlines thanks to its early investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Under parent company IAG, the airline has committed $3.5 billion (£2.6bn) in SAF investments to meet sustainability targets and lower operational costs.

SAF refers to aviation fuels that are synthetic, biofuels or recycled carbon, some produced from used cooking oil, tyres and forestry waste.

Unlike conventional fuels, the carbon dioxide generated by SAF is already part of the carbon cycle, reducing carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent over the fuel lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuel.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG sustainability head, said at a summit last week that investing in sustainable fuel early would give the group a “competitive advantage” over other airlines, reported The Times.

According to the outlet, executives from the airline conglomerate said it is currently paying less than 60 per cent of the market rate for SAF after locking in long-term contracts with suppliers early and at favourable rates.

IAG spent €7.6 billion on fuel in total in the last financial year, making it the group's largest single expense.

According to British Airways, SAF accounts for 2.7 per cent of its total fuel use today.

The airline was the first in the world to use SAF produced on a commercial scale in the UK after signing a multi-year agreement with Phillips 66.

The SAF Mandate says 2 per cent of total UK jet fuel demand should be SAF in 2025, increasing to 10 per cent in 2030 and then to 22 per cent by 2040.

However, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel.

The mandate is set to drive up flight fares as airlines face environmental surcharges and spend more on SAF over the coming years.

British Airways has so far opted to pay the initial costs of SAF itself. Seat prices to fly BA from the UK, Switzerland, and Norway could become more competitive if savings from discounted SAF contracts are passed on to passenger pricing.

Airlines that delay securing SAF are likely to face higher procurement costs that could hike costs for customers.

Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic have already added a SAF supplement to tickets to fund their sustainable fuel expenses – up to €72 (£61) per ticket and up to £24 per ticket, respectively.

The IAG group plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Mr Counsell told the Latin American Travel Association Expo 2025: “We’re going to be using liquid fuel for the next 30 or 40 years.”

He added at the conference in Windsor today: “There is more than enough SAF.”

Many airlines complain about the high price of sustainable aviation fuel, and the mandate to use an increasing proportion of it. But Mr Counsell said: “If we can get to 20 million tonnes, the price will halve.”

The Independent has contacted British Airways for comment.

In September, British Airways became the largest carbon removal purchaser in the UK after agreeing to a more than £9 million partnership with UK-based company CUR8.

The airline said that roughly one-third of its emissions reductions will come from carbon removals – the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it – by 2050.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/02/7/08/iStock-531320870.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,91&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-06-02 10:56:43.144576

Through a pioneering project called GRIM-SAF (GRound-Based and Inflight Measurements), experts are investigating how sustainable aviation fuel could reduce aircraft emissions of soot and volatile particles, and a range of gases including nitrogen oxides, often referred to as the non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Led by scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, academics from Manchester Met are working with a group of universities, research centres and aerospace companies to understand how different aviation fuels change the emissions and therefore the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

In a UK-first experiment held at RAF Brize Norton, two aircraft flew in formation – with one trailing the other to sample its emissions – to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel.

Previous in-flight emissions work in the UK has involved following several miles behind other aircraft whereas the aircraft involved in GRIM-SAF were able to get within 60 metres of each other.

Both aircraft also landed at RAF Brize Norton to make detailed ground-based measurements with the goal of linking this to the in-flight work.

Dr Simon Christie, Research Fellow at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: “The chase experiment marks a significant milestone in our research as we now have a real-life scenario through which to analyse the environmental impacts of sustainable aviation fuel against traditional jet fuel.

“We look forward to continuing to work with our partners to shape global measures to mitigate aviation’s climate change effects.”

These non-CO2 effects include the emission of soot and other substances, such as lubrication oil vented from aircraft engines, that can cause contrails to form.

Contrails are long, thin clouds made of ice crystals, which form when water vapour condenses on the tiny particles emitted by aircraft engines. Contrails sometimes spread out over large areas and can affect the Earth’s climate in the same way as naturally-formed cirrus clouds.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic.

Dr Paul Williams, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester, said: “Although this type of experiment, with one aircraft following another in formation, is very useful for scientists to get an understanding of the emissions produced by burning different types of fuels, it is environmentally costly.

“GRIM-SAF aims to understand the emissions on the ground, and correlate these to emissions at altitude so future experiments don’t rely on chasing aircraft with other aircraft.”

GRIM-SAF aims to give scientists a better understanding of gaseous and particulate emissions from aircraft.

In addition to the chase experiments, the team used a specialist sampling probe - a facility unique to Manchester Met - to monitor the non-CO2 emissions from the aircraft on the ground to correlate future ground-based measurements with in-flight predictions.

The progress of the GRIM-SAF project follows Manchester Met’s announcement earlier this year of the £4.2 million PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) project, which brings together partners from four European countries to look at ways to minimise the climate impact of non-carbon dioxide emissions.",https://www.mmu.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph_image/public/2025-06/IMAGE.jpg?h=8869a3dd&itok=xc-wOj2w,N,,2025-06-02 11:56:41.652072

APG, the investment manager for Dutch public-sector pension giant ABP, has committed €250m to SkyNRG, in a bid to facilitate a wider uptake of sustainable aviation fuels.

The investment forms part of a €300m funding round intended to support the firm’s plans to develop and construct SAF production facilities in Delfzijl, the Netherlands, as well as in Sweden (Project SkyKraft) and the United States (Project Wigeon).

The firm had previously received backing from infrastructure manager Macquarie Asset Management (MAM), which invested €175m in 2023 and is now increasing its overall investment to €225m.

Martin van der Pot, head of private investments at ABP, said: “SkyNRG represents ABP’s first investment in the SAF sector, which is closely aligned with our ambition to create impact by investing at the forefront in energy transition assets that meet our investment criteria. This strategic investment underscores our commitment to supporting innovative solutions that drive the decarbonisation of the infrastructure industry.”

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions and has traditionally been viewed as a sector that is relatively hard to abate. But over the past two years, large institutional investors including Macquarie and IFM have made their first commitments to scaling up the development of greener alternatives to conventional aviation fuels.

In her interview, Thomsen said: “The Middle East has huge opportunities for co-processing.
Clearly, the Middle East is uniquely positioned for this.” Thomsen further said that governments in the Middle East region should create investment policies in such a way that oil producers will be more attracted to co-processing.
“Again, I repeat, the Middle East is uniquely positioned to help the world take a big step forward if we could immediately co-process.
There are also lower-carbon fuels which occur naturally in the Middle East, which the world should explore,” she added.","NEW DELHI: The Middle East has all the potential to emerge as a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel production thanks to co-processing opportunities available in the region, according to a top official.

Speaking to Arab News on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association’s Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, Marie Owens Thomsen, senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist at IATA, said that the world should act now to increase the production of SAF to meet decarbonization targets.

This comes as the region accelerates efforts to produce the fuel, with Saudi Arabia’s Nordic Electrofuel-backed project announcing in January a Jubail plant targeting 350 million liters annually by 2029, using renewable hydrogen and solar PV.

The UAE, meanwhile, aims for 700 million liters by 2031, supported by Emirates, Etihad, and Air Arabia. Emirates has secured over 3 million gallons from Neste for 2024–25 flights, while Shell began supplying SAF at Dubai Airport in 2023.

In her interview, Thomsen said: “The Middle East has huge opportunities for co-processing. What we are seeing across the world is insufficient production of SAF.”

Co-processing is the use of renewable feedstock in conventional fossil fuel units. This method allows existing traditional fuel refineries to seamlessly integrate renewable feedstocks into their production processes without the need for extensive infrastructural changes.

She added: “If this co-processing happens, then boom — we have a SAF plant. Clearly, the Middle East is uniquely positioned for this.”

Thomsen further said that governments in the Middle East region should create investment policies in such a way that oil producers will be more attracted to co-processing.

The use of SAF is widely considered a crucial development for the global aviation industry, as most countries have stipulated targets to achieve net zero as part of their energy transition efforts.

According to Thomsen, the world, on its current trajectory, is expected to produce 400 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, up from an estimated 2 million tonnes in 2025 and 1 million tonnes in 2024.

Amid this projected growth, Thomsen revealed that the world would require at least 500 million tonnes of SAF by 2050 to meet energy transition and sustainability goals.

“On the current trajectory, we will be a 100 million tonnes short in 2050. That is a dramatic shortfall. If we do not address it today, this shortfall may be even greater by the time we reach 2050,” said Thomsen.

She said this presents a challenge and dilemma because as long as jet engines power our flights, liquid fuels remain essential.

“Again, I repeat, the Middle East is uniquely positioned to help the world take a big step forward if we could immediately co-process. There are also lower-carbon fuels which occur naturally in the Middle East, which the world should explore,” she added.

Thomsen revealed that the aviation industry’s net profit margin is lower compared to other sectors, and expenses could rise as SAF gains.

However, she made it clear that effective ways should be adopted to increase the production of the fuel, so that the energy transition targets could be achieved by 2050.

On the opening day of the AGM, Willie Walsh, director general of IATA, also shared identical views, and said that sufficient government measures, including the implementation of effective policies, are needed to achieve decarbonization targets.

The study, expected to be completed by mid-2025, will support India’s dual mission of positioning itself as a SAF hub and achieving its emissions reduction goals by building a pathway toward promoting the production and export of SAF to other regions.

The European Commission has selected 15 renewable hydrogen production projects for €992 million in EU public funding across the European Economic Area (EEA). “The projects, located across five countries, are expected to produce nearly 2.2 million tons of renewable hydrogen over ten years,” said the European executive body. Eight projects will be in Spain, three in Norway, two in Germany, one in Finland, and one in the Netherlands. The biggest projects in terms of bid capacity are one in the Netherlands, followed by one in Germany. In terms of bid price, seven out of the eight cheapest hydrogen projects are in Spain. The funds will come from Innovation Fund, sourced from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

The European Union, which recently decided to continue technical regulatory exchanges on hydrogen with the United Kingdom, has published its opinion on the statutory documents of the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH), the association representing future hydrogen transmission network operators at the EU level. The European Commission said the operators must adopt and publish the final statutory documents by early July 2025, incorporating feedback from both the Commission and the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER).

The Japanese government has agreed to subsidize hydrogen for fuel cell trucks and buses in six prefectures, with the subsidy set at JPY 700 ($4.80)/kg, according to Nikkei. Government official Shinichi Kihara said at the World Hydrogen Summit in Rotterdam that Japan’s contracts-for-difference (CfD) program for clean hydrogen has been oversubscribed, with project selection expected to begin in the latter half of the fiscal year. Japanese and German officials also met in Rotterdam to discuss hydrogen demand creation and financing.

IATA reported that sustainable aviation fuel production is expected to double in 2025 to 2 million tonnes — still only 0.7 percent of total industry fuel usage.

Speaking to Arab News on the sidelines of the International Air Transport Association’s Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, Marie Owens Thomsen, senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist at IATA, said that the world should act now to increase the production of SAF to meet decarbonization targets.

This comes as the region accelerates efforts to produce the fuel, with Saudi Arabia’s Nordic Electrofuel-backed project announcing in January a Jubail plant targeting 350 million liters annually by 2029, using renewable hydrogen and solar PV.

The UAE, meanwhile, aims for 700 million liters by 2031, supported by Emirates, Etihad, and Air Arabia. Emirates has secured over 3 million gallons from Neste for 2024–25 flights, while Shell began supplying SAF at Dubai Airport in 2023.

In her interview, Thomsen said: “The Middle East has huge opportunities for co-processing. What we are seeing across the world is insufficient production of SAF.”

Co-processing is the use of renewable feedstock in conventional fossil fuel units. This method allows existing traditional fuel refineries to seamlessly integrate renewable feedstocks into their production processes without the need for extensive infrastructural changes.

She added: “If this co-processing happens, then boom — we have a SAF plant. Clearly, the Middle East is uniquely positioned for this.”

Thomsen further said that governments in the Middle East region should create investment policies in such a way that oil producers will be more attracted to co-processing.

The use of SAF is widely considered a crucial development for the global aviation industry, as most countries have stipulated targets to achieve net zero as part of their energy transition efforts.

According to Thomsen, the world, on its current trajectory, is expected to produce 400 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, up from an estimated 2 million tonnes in 2025 and 1 million tonnes in 2024.

Amid this projected growth, Thomsen revealed that the world would require at least 500 million tonnes of SAF by 2050 to meet energy transition and sustainability goals.

“On the current trajectory, we will be a 100 million tonnes short in 2050. That is a dramatic shortfall. If we do not address it today, this shortfall may be even greater by the time we reach 2050,” said Thomsen.

She said this presents a challenge and dilemma because as long as jet engines power our flights, liquid fuels remain essential.

“Again, I repeat, the Middle East is uniquely positioned to help the world take a big step forward if we could immediately co-process. There are also lower-carbon fuels which occur naturally in the Middle East, which the world should explore,” she added.

Thomsen revealed that the aviation industry’s net profit margin is lower compared to other sectors, and expenses could rise as SAF gains.

However, she made it clear that effective ways should be adopted to increase the production of the fuel, so that the energy transition targets could be achieved by 2050.

On the opening day of the AGM, Willie Walsh, director general of IATA, also shared identical views, and said that sufficient government measures, including the implementation of effective policies, are needed to achieve decarbonization targets.

He added that ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation is crucial to offsetting carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Under CORSIA, an initiative launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airplane operators must purchase and cancel “emissions units” to offset the increase in CO2 emissions.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s annual inflation rate rose to 3.5% in May, higher than the April 2025 reading of 0.3%, data from the statistics bureau showed on Monday.

On a month-on-month basis, inflation decreased by 0.2% in May 2025, as compared to a decrease of 0.8% in the previous month and a decrease of 3.2% in May 2024. The CPI inflation average during 11MFY25 stood at 4.61 percent, compared to 24.52% in 11MFY24.

Inflation has cooled significantly, easing from 37.97% in May 2023.

The CPI reading is higher than the government’s expectations. In its monthly economic report released last week, the finance ministry expected inflation to ease to between 1.5% and 2% year-on-year in May, before picking up to 3%-4% in June.

“Improved weather conditions, better crop yields and a stable exchange rate have helped reduce inflation to a historical low,” the finance ministry report had said, adding that “inflation is projected to remain between 1.5-2.0% in May, with a possible rise to 3.0-4.0 percent by June 2025.”

The latest CPI reading was also higher than projections made by several brokerage houses.

JS Global projected Pakistan’s headline inflation to inch up to 2.7% in May.

“Pakistan’s CPI is expected to clock in at 2.7 percent for May. The base effect is now fading, signaling a return to normalized price trends. This is likely to take 11MFY25 average inflation to 4.7%, down from 11MFY24 average of 24.9%,” JS Global had said in a report.

Last month, the State Bank of Pakistan cut the key interest rate by 100 basis points (bps) to 11%, the lowest policy rate since March 2022 (9.75%). The central bank has cut the rate by 1,100 bps since June from an all-time high of 22%.

RIYADH: Qatar and Kuwait have signed an agreement to eliminate double taxation and prevent tax evasion and avoidance, aiming to enhance economic coordination and commercial ties.

The accord seeks to establish a legal framework to eliminate all forms of double taxation on income and to reinforce bilateral cooperation in tax matters by aligning with international standards, the Qatar News Agency reported.

The deal was signed by Qatari Minister of Finance Ali bin Ahmed Al-Kuwari and Kuwaiti Minister of Finance and Minister of State for Economic Affairs and Investment Noura Sulaiman Al-Fassam.

The countries currently do not impose personal income tax on individuals, but both levy corporate tax on foreign entities. Qatar enforces a flat 10 percent corporate income tax, while Kuwait applies a 15 percent tax on profits earned by foreign companies operating in the country.

“This agreement will contribute to supporting international standards of transparency through the exchange of verified financial information, as part of both countries’ commitment to strengthening coordination and cooperation in tax matters and economic relations,” Al-Kuwari said during the signing, as quoted by QNA.

The agreement also aims to enhance commercial cooperation, broaden investment opportunities for government entities and individuals, combat tax evasion, and support neutrality and fairness in the treatment of taxpayers.

In addition, Kuwaiti Minister Al-Fassam signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Finance, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, who led a Saudi delegation participating in the 123rd meeting of the Financial and Economic Cooperation Committee of the GCC in Kuwait.

“During the meeting, participants discussed several topics related to enhancing financial and economic cooperation among GCC member states in a way that contributes to further joint Gulf cooperation,” Al-Jadaan said in a post on X.

The deal, signed on the sidelines of the meeting between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, aims to enhance cooperation in the financial sector.

“The MoU will deepen bilateral ties and foster enhanced cooperation in the financial sector, advancing the shared strategic interests of both brotherly nations,” Al-Jadaan added.

The deal seeks to develop and strengthen ties between the two ministries and increase collaboration in support of shared interests between the two countries.

RIYADH: Middle East airlines are forecast to post the world’s highest net profit margin in 2025 of 8.7 percent, outpacing global peers, according to the latest industry report.

The forecast, released by the International Air Transport Association during its 81st Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, also projects that airlines operating in the Middle East will generate a net profit of $6.2 billion this year — slightly up from $6.1 billion in 2024. The region is also expected to earn $27.20 per passenger.

Globally, airlines are projected to record a net profit of $36 billion, with total industry revenue reaching $979 billion — below IATA’s earlier $1 trillion estimate, due in part to macroeconomic uncertainties and supply constraints.

The growth of the aviation sector in the Middle East reflects broader regional expansion, as countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE continue to bolster the industry as part of their economic diversification efforts.

In its report, IATA stated: “The Middle East will generate the highest net profit per passenger among the regions. Robust economic performance is supporting strong air travel demand, both for business and leisure travel.”

It added: “However, with delays in aircraft delivery, the region will see limitations in capacity as airlines embark on retrofit projects to modernize their fleet, hence limiting growth.”

According to IATA, revenue per passenger in 2025 is expected to reach $11.10 in North America, followed by $8.90 in Europe, $3.40 in Latin America, $2.60 in Asia Pacific, and $1.30 in Africa.

Global outlook

While airlines globally are expected to earn a collective $36 billion in profit in 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024, the figure is slightly below the $36.6 billion projected in December. The average net profit per passenger remains modest at $7.20, according to IATA.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said the first half of 2025 has brought notable uncertainty to global markets. Still, he noted, airline performance is expected to surpass 2024 levels, though it will fall slightly short of earlier forecasts.

“The biggest positive driver is the price of jet fuel which has fallen 13 percent compared with 2024 and 1 percent below previous estimates,” he said.

Walsh added: “Moreover, we anticipate airlines flying more people and more cargo in 2025 than they did in 2024, even if previous demand projections have been dented by trade tensions and falls in consumer confidence.”

He noted that considering the headwinds, this is a strong result that “demonstrates the resilience that airlines have worked hard to fortify.”

Operating profit for global airlines is expected to reach $66 billion in 2025, up from $61.9 billion the previous year. Total expenses are projected at $913 billion in 2025, marking a 1 percent increase from 2024.

“Our profitability is not commensurate to the enormous value that we create at the heart of a value chain supporting 3.9 percent of global GDP and providing and supporting jobs for 86.5 million people,” said Walsh.

Passenger revenue in 2025 is expected to increase by 1.6 percent year on year to reach an all-time high of $693 billion.

Passenger growth, measured in revenue passenger km, is projected at 5.8 percent — a normalization following the double-digit growth during the pandemic recovery.

Cargo revenues are expected to decline by 4.7 percent to $142 billion in 2025, driven by sluggish global economic growth and trade-dampening protectionist measures, including tariffs.

Air cargo growth is expected to slow to 0.7 percent in 2025 from 11.3 percent in 2024. Cargo yield is also projected to decline by 5.2 percent, reflecting slower demand growth and lower oil prices.

Fleet and backlog issue

The IATA director general criticized aircraft manufacturers for long delivery backlogs, noting that more than 17,000 aircraft are on order, with wait times of up to 14 years, stalling growth opportunities across regions.

“The number of deliveries scheduled for 2025 is 26 percent less than what was promised a year ago,” said Walsh.

He warned that the backlog will negatively impact revenues as demand remains unmet, while scarcity drives up maintenance and leasing costs.

“It’s just not acceptable that manufacturers estimate it could take until the end of the decade to sort this mess out,” said Walsh.

Walsh also highlighted recent infrastructure advancements, including the opening of new secondary airports in New Delhi and Mumbai, and the phased launch of the world’s largest airport in Dubai.

“Governments around the world are building a competitive future for aviation because they want aviation to contribute even more to their societies and economies,” added Walsh.

Sustainability and SAF

Walsh also emphasized the importance of sustainability in aviation, urging the sector to leverage all available decarbonization tools.

He called for global cooperation to advance decarbonization efforts.

IATA reported that sustainable aviation fuel production is expected to double in 2025 to 2 million tonnes — still only 0.7 percent of total industry fuel usage.

The average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times higher than jet fuel, adding $1.6 billion in costs.

In 2025, SAF is expected to cost 4.2 times more than jet fuel, primarily due to “compliance fees” levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge against the cost of meeting a 2 percent SAF mandate in jet fuel supplies.

“The behavior of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage. The cost of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is estimated to be an enormous $4.7 trillion,” said Walsh.

He added: “Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers.”

Walsh added that under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, airlines are expected to face a $1 billion cost in 2025.

Under CORSIA, operators must purchase and cancel emissions units to offset increases in CO2 emissions.

“CORSIA must be successful. It is a credible and verifiable system that requires carbon credits of only the highest standard, making its positive impact on climate unquestionable,” said Walsh.

SINGAPORE: Oil prices rebounded more than $1 a barrel on Monday after producer group OPEC+ decided to increase output in July by the same amount as it did in each of the prior two months, which came as a relief to those who expected a bigger increase.

Brent crude futures climbed $1.46, or 2.33 percent, to $64.24 a barrel by 9:26 a.m. Saudi time after settling 0.9 percent lower on Friday. US West Texas Intermediate crude was at $62.45 a barrel, up $1.66, or 2.73 percent, following a 0.3 percent decline in the previous session.

Both contracts were down more than 1 percent last week.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies decided on Saturday to raise output by 411,000 barrels per day in July, the third month the group known as OPEC+ increased by the same amount, as it looks to wrestle back market share and punish over-producers.

The group had been expected to discuss a bigger production hike.

“Had they gone through with a surprise larger amount, then Monday’s price open would have been pretty ugly indeed,” analyst Harry Tchilinguirian of Onyx Capital Group wrote on LinkedIn.

Oil traders said the 411,000-bpd output hike had already been priced into Brent and WTI futures.

“The headline motive has centered on punishing OPEC+ members like Iraq and Kazakhstan that have persistently produced above their pledged quotas,” said the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in a note on Monday.

Kazakhstan has informed OPEC that it does not intend to reduce its oil production, according to a Thursday report by Russia’s Interfax news agency citing Kazakhstan’s deputy energy minister.

Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs analysts anticipate OPEC+ will implement a final 410,000 bpd production increase in August.

“Relatively tight spot oil fundamentals, beats in hard global activity data, and seasonal summer support to oil demand suggest that the expected demand slowdown is unlikely to be sharp enough to stop raising production when deciding on August production levels on July 6th,” the bank said in a note dated Sunday.

Meanwhile, low levels of US fuel inventories have stoked supply jitters ahead of expectations for an above-average hurricane season, analysts said.

“More encouraging was a huge spike in gasoline implied demand going into what’s considered the start of the US driving season,” ANZ analysts said in a note, adding that the gain of nearly 1 million bpd was the third-highest weekly increase in the last three years.

Traders are also closely watching the impact of lower prices on US crude production which hit an all-time high of 13.49 million bpd in March.

Last week, the number of operating oil rigs in the US fell for a fifth week, down four to 461, the lowest since November 2021, Baker Hughes said in its weekly report on Friday.

RIYADH: The global industrial sector is witnessing a radical transformation toward adopting Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, prompting countries to reconsider traditional manufacturing methods and adopt smart solutions that include automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, and data-driven systems to improve production efficiency and reduce operational costs.

According to the Saudi Press Agency, the Kingdom is not only keeping pace with the global industrial transformation but also aims to lead it through strategic initiatives and specialized programs that promote smart industry practices and accelerate the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies.

This will enhance the competitiveness of Saudi Arabia’s industrial sector both regionally and globally, aligning with the goals of Vision 2030 and the National Industrial Strategy to position the Kingdom as a leading industrial power, one that supports global supply chains and exports high-tech products globally.

The Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources is undertaking this ambitious transformation by establishing an integrated and comprehensive national system to enhance advanced manufacturing, according to SPA.

It has launched the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center, which brings together all programs and initiatives that enable the adoption of modern manufacturing technologies and stimulate smart and innovative industrial solutions.

This initiative is in cooperation with various government entities related to the technology, research, and innovation sectors and in partnership with several global leaders in industrial technology.

The efforts under the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center include the Future Factories Program Initiative, the Industrial Beacons Program, the Accelerated Manufacturing Program, the Capability Centers Network, and the Operational Excellence Program, reported SPA.

These initiatives collectively support the center’s vision of becoming a unified national platform that accelerates the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies. They also serve as a bridge to help local manufacturers access cutting-edge solutions that improve efficiency, enhance quality, and reduce costs across the industrial sector.

The center aims to boost productivity and competitiveness in the manufacturing sector by localizing advanced and sustainable technologies, creating an attractive environment for industrial investment, and supporting skill development through its Capability Centers Network. It also offers experiential learning opportunities and provides advisory services to help industrial establishments adopt advanced manufacturing practices.

The efforts of the ministry are aligned with several government entities that support the center’s vision and objectives.

In 2022, the ministry launched the Future Factories initiative to support the smart transformation journey of industrial establishments, aiming to automate 4,000 Saudi factories and increase their production efficiency, reduce reliance on unskilled labor, and promote the adoption of advanced industrial solutions and practices.

The initiative offers numerous incentives and enablers to support the digital transformation of national factories, including financing solutions, consulting services, and the development and qualification of human resources to leverage the latest manufacturing technologies.

It also helps industrial establishments assess their technological maturity and develop transformation plans to adopt operational excellence practices and advanced manufacturing solutions, including AI, robotics, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics.

To support industrial transformation in the Kingdom and achieve global leadership in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies, the ministry launched the Industrial Beacons program.

This undertaking aims to enable leading Saudi factories to adopt Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, thereby enhancing their production efficiency and qualifying them to receive international recognition within the Global Lighthouse Network, an affiliate of the World Economic Forum, by 2030.

During the launch ceremony of the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center, the Ministry announced 10 national industrial companies that committed to achieving the standards of the Industrial Beacons initiative.

With the launch of the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center and its targeted initiatives to promote advanced technologies and foster research and innovation in the industrial sector, the Kingdom signals that its ambitions extend beyond simply keeping pace with global industrial trends.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/06/02/4607920-691218682.jpg?itok=zK7XNTKg,N,,2025-06-02 10:57:15.700498

Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived.
Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production.","2 June 2025 (New Delhi) – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach 2 million tonnes (Mt) (2.5 billion liters) or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Problem with the Use of Mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

IATA’s Role in Supporting the Development of a Global SAF Market

To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives:

A SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The SAF Matchmaker that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

Urgent Action by Governments Is Needed

1 Policy Shortcomings Puts SAF Production at Risk

IATA urges governments to focus on three areas:

Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel.

Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A wholistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors.

Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

Focus on India

India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth.

IATA warns that the airline industry's 2050 decarbonisation target faces challenges. Policies favouring fossil fuels are slowing progress. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is crucial but expensive. Investment of $4.7 trillion is needed.

NEW DELHI: The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

'Entirely achievable'

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.

Despite the projected increase, IATA warned that the pace of SAF production remains far too slow.

Uncategorized

Fraport subsidiary Lima Airport Partners (LAP) has officially opened the new passenger terminal at Jorge Chávez International Airport (LIM) in Peru's capital, marking a major milestone in the airport's transformation. Between the night of May 31 and June 1, airlines, government bodies and partners completed the transition from the old terminal to the newly constructed facility. This followed a two-week soft launch involving four airlines to ensure operational readiness.

The new terminal is three times larger than its predecessor and, by the end of 2025, will span 270,000 m² with the capacity to handle up to 40 million passengers annually. Built as part of a US$2 billion expansion that began in 2019, the project also included a second runway, a new air traffic control tower, energy facilities, aircraft stands, road and transport links and parking infrastructure.

Designed for future growth, the terminal incorporates advanced technologies such as next-generation CT scanners for aviation security and South America's first digital apron management system, allowing for remote monitoring and control of taxiing aircraft using cameras.

The new terminal also celebrates Peru's cultural heritage. Artistic installations representing the country's coast, mountains and rainforest, created in partnership with local artists, are featured throughout. In addition, more than 8,000 square metres of restaurant space offer passengers a taste of Peru's renowned cuisine.

José Salmon, CEO of Lima Airport Partners, described the terminal as “the heartbeat of Peru,” highlighting its potential to generate around 120,000 jobs, stimulate economic growth, and support the recovery of tourism across the region.

India’s Long-Haul Ambitions Need Matching Access India’s airlines are finally building the long-haul fleet needed for international growth.","This year will be a better for airlines than last year, although slightly below the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) earlier projections. That was the verdict of IATA Director General Willie Walsh on Monday.

“The biggest positive driver is the price of jet fuel which has fallen 13% compared with 2024 and 1% below previous estimates,” Walsh said. “We anticipate airlines flying more people and more cargo in 2025 than they did in 2024, even if previous demand projections have been dented by trade tensions and falls in consumer confidence. The result is an improvement of net margins from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025.”

IATA expects passenger revenues to reach an all-time high of $693 billion in 2025, a 1.6% rise over 2024. This will also be bolstered by an additional $144 billion in ancillary revenues.

Speaking at a press briefing at the IATA annual general meeting in Delhi on Monday, Walsh spoke candidly about the pressures mounting across the industry — from rising tariffs and supply chain choke points to geopolitical risks and policy missteps.

Here are five big takeaways from the session that aviation stakeholders should be watching.

1. Tariffs on Aircraft Parts Could Unravel a Stable Global System

Walsh warned that the re-emergence of tariffs on aerospace components, including aircraft engines, threatens to create new complications in a sector already operating on thin margins.

“Obviously our desired position is that aerospace and aircraft engines be excluded from tariff regimes. Return to the 1979 agreement, where it is exempt. It is a global supply chain. It's functioning very well. Starting to unpick that by applying tariffs is going to become very complex.”

While no sharp price increases have materialised yet, Walsh said that some key suppliers have indicated that it is something that they're looking at.

“We don’t want to see any of the manufacturers or suppliers using tariffs as an excuse or an opportunity to increase their prices to the industry,” he said.

Any shift that makes aircraft more expensive would be “an unwelcome development,” he added — one that airlines would strongly resist.

2. Supply Chain Delays Are Capping Growth

Global aviation demand has bounced back. But aircraft deliveries and parts availability haven’t caught up. That mismatch is now dragging down capacity and limiting airlines’ ability to grow.

“Growth is lagging behind the demand and has done for some time, which means that there are airlines that are missing out on opportunities to expand their networks and provide new options to their customers.”

The result? Record-high load factors.

“We’re looking at seat factors over 84%. I didn’t think I would ever see load factors at that level. When we hit 82.6% in 2019, I thought that would stand as the all-time record,” Walsh said.

And 84% average across a year means that many flights are operating at full capacity — with passengers unable to book seats on their preferred routes.

3. Geopolitics Still Shapes Route Maps

Walsh acknowledged that airspace closures and global tensions remain a constant threat — but also something the industry has learned to navigate quickly.

“Geopolitics has always been a factor in our industry. We’re a very resilient industry. And we’re very quick to be able to adapt. So any change in a geopolitical environment… we quickly adjust to find alternative routing.”

Still, the cost of rerouting and limited access is real, especially when already tight capacity leaves little room for flexibility.

“We prefer that airspace is open to everybody everywhere, but you know, the reality of it is where airspace is closed, we quickly adapt.”

4. India’s Long-Haul Ambitions Need Matching Access

India’s airlines are finally building the long-haul fleet needed for international growth. But Walsh cautioned that regulatory access must keep up with this newfound capability.

“Around two or three years ago, there were less than 50 widebody aircraft based in India. For a country of this size and a population of over a billion people, to have less than 50 widebody aircraft is astounding.”

Now, with IndiGo and Air India expanding their long-haul fleets, that picture is changing. But Walsh warned that this shift must be matched by changes in bilateral air rights.

“As we see the expansion of the carriers in India accessing new markets, you will have to see a corresponding change to the approach with access. Because Indian carriers will want access to markets right across the world.”

Walsh called the European Union’s approach to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), ineffective and even counterproductive.

“The principal criticism recently is because of their mandate to include SAF, what we've seen is the fuel suppliers have used that as an opportunity to add what they’re calling a compliance fee.”

This fee, he said, has added $1 billion to airline fuel costs in the EU — without delivering the environmental benefits intended.

“EU’s mandate has done nothing to stimulate additional production but has done a lot to enable the fuel suppliers to increase their charges and offer increased costs to airlines,” he said.

Walsh was blunt: “We’ve always argued that mandating something that doesn’t exist makes no sense.”

He added that these policies must be tested against actual outcomes — not just intentions.

“There are people who say these mandates are positive because they stimulate production. We don't see any evidence of that. What we see is these mandates are not being met… and the people required to fulfil the mandate are being fined.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has cautioned that policy and market inefficiencies could obstruct the scaling up of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), even as global production is forecast to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025. Despite this growth, SAF will still account for just 0.7 per cent of total airline fuel consumption.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 per cent of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add USD 4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. He noted the need for rapid acceleration in production and cost-efficiency gains.

European mandates that came into force in January 2025 have driven up SAF costs. Airlines purchasing SAF to meet the EU and UK targets are now facing costs five times higher than conventional jet fuel. Of the USD 1.2 billion market price for the 1 million tonnes expected to be used to meet mandates, an additional USD 1.7 billion in compliance fees could have otherwise reduced carbon emissions by 3.5 million tonnes.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation,” Walsh added.

To support global market development, IATA has launched two initiatives: a SAF registry under the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), and a SAF Matchmaker to connect buyers and suppliers.

IATA is also urging governments to redirect fossil fuel subsidies, integrate SAF into broader energy policy, and uphold the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Only Guyana has made eligible emissions units available for airlines so far.

India, the third-largest oil consumer globally, has set a SAF blending target of 2 per cent for international flights by 2028. Through partnerships with ISMA and Praj Industries, IATA aims to support India’s biofuel ambitions using global standards and lifecycle assessments.

Responsible for around 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, projected to double by 2050 if left unchecked, the sector faces mounting pressure to decarbonise. One Dutch company is leading the charge toward cleaner flight: SkyNRG, an Amsterdam-based pioneer in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), has secured €300 million to accelerate its global expansion.

The funding round signals strong confidence in SAF’s future role in aviation. Dutch pension asset manager APG led the investment with €250 million on behalf of pension fund ABP, while returning investor Macquarie Asset Management contributed €50 million. This capital will fund the construction of three large-scale SAF production facilities across Europe and North America, bringing clean jet fuel closer to mainstream adoption.

Arjan Reinders, Head of Infrastructure Europe at APG, emphasised that “SkyNRG is a frontrunner in the SAF market, demonstrating an entrepreneurial spirit and a strong commercial focus,” positioning this investment as part of APG’s ambition to invest at the forefront of energy transition assets.

The story of SkyNRG: from Dutch roots to global reach

SkyNRG’s expansion centres on a flagship SAF facility in Delfzijl, the Netherlands — a cornerstone for European SAF production. Connected to Schiphol Airport through existing pipelines, the plant is ideally positioned to meet new EU regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation, which mandate increasing SAF usage across the bloc.

The facility, developed with Swedish energy firm Skellefteå Kraft, will produce 100,000 tonnes of SAF annually. Using green hydrogen (from water and renewable electricity) and captured CO₂, its e-fuel production method reduces lifecycle emissions by over 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

SkyNRG’s ambitions extend further. The company is developing Project SkyKraft, another e-fuel plant with Skellefteå Kraft in Sweden. Across the Atlantic, Project Wigeon in Washington State will convert biogenic methane from landfill waste and manure into SAF and renewable diesel. Backed by U.S. incentives, this project promises environmental and economic benefits, creating hundreds of jobs while demonstrating effective public-private collaboration in clean energy.

Building a net-zero aviation future

Founded in 2009 by Maarten van Dijk and Theye Veen, SkyNRG grew from a vision to integrate aviation into the bio-based economy. Their founding focus, reducing emissions, enhancing energy security, and driving green innovation, remains central to their mission today.

The company strives to establish sustainable aviation fuel as the new global standard, supporting aviation’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. SkyNRG builds SAF production capacity, manages supply and distribution, ensures sustainability through certified feedstocks, develops regional supply chains, and helps partners meet decarbonisation goals.

SkyNRG distinguishes itself through complete control of the SAF value chain. Unlike oil giants like Shell or TotalEnergies, which focus on specific segments, SkyNRG manages everything, from sourcing and certification to blending and distribution, ensuring a more sustainable, transparent, and reliable supply.

Corporate climate action, reinvented

An independent Sustainability Board guides SkyNRG, comprising experts from WWF International, the European Climate Foundation, and the University of Groningen. This board enforces strict environmental and ethical standards, permitting only sustainable feedstocks like waste oils and agricultural residues, without compromise.

In 2011, SkyNRG achieved a milestone by powering the first commercial SAF flight with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Today, it supplies over 50 airlines and major corporations worldwide, with long-term SAF purchase agreements worth €4 billion demonstrating industry confidence.

The company is revolutionising corporate climate engagement through its “Board Now” program. This program enables companies like PwC, Microsoft, and Skyscanner to invest directly in SAF and offset travel emissions, creating an effective model for corporate climate action.

Projects like DSL-01, a regional supply chain in the Netherlands, showcase SkyNRG’s dedication to reducing transport emissions and supporting local economies. These local hubs make SAF greener, more affordable, and more accessible.

Behind SkyNRG: Leading the SAF value chain

As the first company to supply SAF for commercial flight (KLM, 2011), SkyNRG has grown to serve over 40 airlines globally, becoming a trusted industry leader. Unlike competitors such as TotalEnergies or Shell, SkyNRG manages the entire SAF value chain, from sourcing to distribution, certification, and price gap co-funding, enabling superior quality control and reliability.

The company reduces the cost difference between SAF and conventional jet fuel through co-funding partnerships with airlines, corporations, and logistics partners. By developing regional supply lines like DSL-01, SkyNRG cuts transport emissions, boosts local economies, and strengthens supply resilience.

SkyNRG leads in SAF market research, technology development, and advisory services, guiding airlines, airports, and governments toward faster SAF adoption and policy implementation. Their “Board Now” initiative allows companies to invest directly in SAF and reduce travel emissions, exemplifying effective corporate climate action.

SkyNRG’s strict sustainability standards and independent oversight set it apart in the competitive landscape. While Neste and World Energy focus on scale, and LanzaTech advances carbon recycling, SkyNRG’s comprehensive value chain integration, regional approach, and corporate engagement programs make it unique.

Brazil's GDP growth slows to 2.9pc in 1Q

Sao Paulo, 30 May (Argus) — Brazil's economy grew at an annualized 2.9pc in the first quarter, as slowing consumption and factory output offset a rebound in farming activity. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) decelerated from 3.6pc in the previous quarter and was off for a second quarter from 4pc in the third quarter of 2024, according to government statistics agency IBGE. Agriculture grew by an annual 10.2pc in the first quarter, more than offsetting a 1.5pc contraction in the last quarter of 2024. The increase in the sector was led by good crop performance and a rise in the outlook for the 2024-25 crop , IBGE said. The industrial sector expanded by 2.4pc, slightly slower than 2.5pc in the prior quarter. Manufacturing decelerated to an annual 2.8pc in the first quarter from 5.3pc in the previous quarter. Electricity and gas, water and sewage management increased by 1.6pc following a 3.5pc contraction in the last quarter of 2024. The sector was led by higher residential demand, IBGE said. The oil, natural gas and mining industries grew by 0.2pc following a 3.6pc contraction. The sector's gain was led by oil and gas exploration, but was slowed by a drop in iron ore mining, IBGE said.

Dutch pension fund invests €250mn in SAF firm SkyNRG

Amsterdam, 30 May (Argus) — Dutch pension services provider APG is investing up to €250mn ($283mn) in Dutch sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) distributor SkyNRG, to accelerate that company's global development of SAF production facilities. The funding, on behalf of pension fund ABP, is a part of a wider €300mn round that also includes an additional €50m from Macquarie Asset Management in 2023 , to take its backing to €225mn from €175mn. The capital will support SkyNRG's SAF infrastructure expansion and its existing production facilities. In the Netherlands, SkyNRG is developing a 100,000 t/yr hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids SAF plant at Delfzijl . In Sweden, through a joint venture with power company Skelleftea Kraft, it is developing 100,000 t/yr e-SAF plant from renewable electricity and biogenic CO2 . In the US, SkyNRG is preparing a 150,000 t/yr facility combining SAF and renewable diesel production from feedstocks such as syngas. Located at the Port of Walla Walla in Washington state, construction is slated to begin in 2026, with production expected by 2029. SkyNRG supplies SAF to airlines and corporate customers. Its push for dedicated SAF facilities is to meet anticipated demand driven by mandates like ReFuelEU . Under that mandate, fuel suppliers will need to include 2pc SAF in their jet fuel deliveries in 2025, rising to 6pc in 2030, 20pc in 2035, 34pc in 2040, 42pc in 2045 and 70pc in 2050. RefuelEU also requires a specific proportion of synthetic aviation fuels, such as e-kerosene and hydrogen, that are defined as renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). Synthetics must reach a total share of aviation fuels of 1.2pc in 2030, 2pc in 2032, 5pc in 2035 and 35pc in 2050. European SAF prices have been at relatively low levels because of oversupply, but started picking up recently. Argus assessed spot hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) fob ARA range at $1,886.5/t on 29 May, up from $1,177.8/t on 22 May, driven by stronger seasonal European demand ahead of the summer flying season.

US tariff ruling could revive biofuel feedstock trade

New York, 29 May (Argus) — A sweeping court ruling Wednesday against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs could make foreign biofuel feedstock imports, which have wavered this year, more attractive. A three-judge panel on the US Court of International Trade struck down tariffs Trump set under a little-used economic emergency law, including bilateral tariffs on China, ""reciprocal"" tariffs on nearly every country, and levies on some Canadian and Mexican products to combat drug trafficking. The tariffs upended global trade flows, including by making recently fast-rising inputs for renewable diesel production like Chinese used cooking oil and Brazilian beef tallow more expensive. The trade court gave the government ten days to comply, though the Trump administration has asked for a pause on the ruling and pledged to appeal. Tariffs enacted under other laws, including sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, would remain intact. Trump could also still eye different authorities to revive his broader tariffs, which he sees as a crucial negotiating tool to counter what he has called unfair trade practices abroad. But the court's decision, if it holds, would still be a significant barrier to Trump's efforts to rewire global trade. The US could even be required to offer refunds of emergency tariffs that have already been paid. US levies on Chinese products imposed under the emergency law at one point reached 145pc, raising fears of a protracted trade war and global economic slowdown. Fewer options for foreign biofuel feedstocks because of tariffs also helped increase the price of domestic alternatives like US soybean oil, where futures were down 2pc in early trading Thursday, and compounded the pain for refiners struggling with major changes to biofuel tax credits. Biomass-based diesel production in the US has been down sharply this year because of all the policy shifts. Formerly fast-rising flow Before this year, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers along the US Gulf and west coasts were expanding capacity and increasingly looking abroad for inputs. Waste feedstocks like used cooking oil and beef tallow are considered lower-carbon feedstocks than crops and thus generally fetch larger government subsidies — even if sourced from abroad. The US imported nearly 5.4bn lbs of used cooking oil in 2024, a record-high and with more than half that total coming from China. But Trump's tariffs sharply reduced the incentive to import foreign feedstocks. Duties on Chinese products have varied significantly but were last at 30pc before the court ruling, adding to existing 15.5pc charges on Chinese used cooking oil. Reciprocal tariffs of 10pc on nearly every country added new costs to Australian and Brazilian tallow too. US import data is only available through March, before Trump imposed his most far-reaching tariffs as part of an April ""Liberation Day"" announcement . But global feedstock traders more recently have said that the tariffs — and the unpredictability of future policy — have made global inputs riskier. While some tariffs are eligible for duty drawbacks, creating options for biofuel producers targeting foreign markets, US imports of Chinese used cooking oil were down 27pc in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Other barriers remain Even if the court ruling holds, other policies could deter US biorefineries from relying too heavily on foreign feedstocks. For one, current government guidance around a new US clean fuel tax credit prevents refiners from claiming any subsidy for road fuels derived from foreign used cooking oil . Those rules also pin the carbon intensity of canola-based fuels as too high to claim any subsidy, choking off interest in Canadian canola oil imports that had been rising significantly before this year. And farm groups, worried that foreign feedstocks are hurting demand for US crops, are lobbying regulators and lawmakers for more severe limits. A party-line budget bill that passed the House this month would restrict clean fuel tax credit eligibility to fuels derived from North American feedstocks, a win for US oilseed crushers but a major blow to refiners reliant on foreign tallow. While that bill still needs Senate approval and changes would only kick in next year, the proposal is a clear signal from Republicans that refiners should start looking closer to home for renewable diesel inputs.

Ti market assesses fallout of UKTMP chlorine gas leak

London, 28 May (Argus) — The titanium market is assessing the fallout of a chlorine gas leak at Kazakh titanium sponge producer Ust-Kamenogorsk Titanium and Magnesium Plant (UKTMP) on 19 May, with the company anticipating no significant impact to production but other sources cautioning the possibility of outages during repairs. ""An industrial incident occurred during a scheduled preventive cleaning of equipment at one of the production sites, as a result of a short-term deviation in the operation of the gas exhaust system,"" UKTMP told Argus . The leak occurred during maintenance to repair blocked pipes on one of the plant's chlorinators. One of the emitted gases was chlorine, which is used in the Kroll process to convert titanium dioxide into titanium tetrachloride. Titanium tetrachloride is subsequently reduced with magnesium to produce titanium sponge. Additional cleaning was promptly carried out and UKTMP switched to a reserve chlorinator per standard procedure, it told Argus . But one market source questioned the condition of UKTMP's reserve equipment, owing to a lack of investment in recent years. ""The incident did not affect the production process as a whole, especially the production of titanium sponge. Today, the plant is operating normally, without any change to the production schedule,"" UKTMP said. Mixed or limited information received by market participants has led to varied reactions. Some sources have claimed that the situation is more critical than UKTMP has said, underpinned in part by videos released online of green chlorine gas over Ust-Kamenogorsk in eastern Kazakhstan, although Argus could not verify these videos. It could take more than six months to repair damaged equipment, during which time sponge production will be affected, some sources claimed, but UKTMP denied such an outage. US titanium producer ATI confirmed to Argus that its supply of titanium sponge is secure, but ATI could not provide insight on UKTMP's operations. France's Aubert & Duval — a consumer of aerospace-grade 6Al 4V ingot, and titanium sponge through its EcoTitanium subsidiary — declined to comment. One Atlantic alloy producer that Argus understands procures 6Al 4V ingot from UKTMP said it does not see any risk to grade 5 ingot supply as a result of the leak. UKTMP produced 19,000t of titanium sponge last year, according to the company, accounting for 21pc of aerospace-approved sponge supply, or 16pc, including Russia.

The bill, which also included updates, would now be considered by the US Senate, where it was likely to be amended, Ethanol Producer wrote.

Welcoming the move to extend the tax credit, Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), was quoted as saying: “In addition to extending the 45Z clean fuel production credit by four years, the bill also reinstates crucial tax benefits that will stimulate research, experimentation and innovation across the ethanol supply chain.

“As the bill now moves to the Senate, we hope additional improvements can be made to ensure these tax policies truly drive demand growth for American-made renewable fuels.”

Established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the existing 45Z tax credit provides a tax incentive for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels.

The credit starts at 20¢/gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35¢/gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that meet current wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to US$1/gallon for non-aviation fuels and US$1.75/gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Section 111112 of the HR1 aims to limit availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the USA, Mexico or Canada. It also aims to exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel.

“It will also reinforce our position as a renewable energy leader, which is at the heart of our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania’s Future.”","Tasmania has taken a major step forward in its ambition to become a global leader in green hydrogen production following a successful expressions of interest (EOI) process to identify a key project partner, reports Manufacturers’ Monthly.

Minister for Energy and Renewables, Nick Duigan, announced that Bell Bay Power Fuels has been selected as the provisional proponent for the Tasmanian Green Hydrogen Hub. The EOI attracted five high-quality submissions, highlighting strong industry interest and confidence in establishing a hydrogen industry in the state.

Duigan said the Hub could produce up to 45,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually — enough to fuel more than 2,200 heavy vehicles for a full year. The project is also expected to create approximately 740 direct and indirect jobs, ranging from energy specialists such as engineers and technicians to skilled local tradespeople including concreters, metalworkers, fitters, and electricians.

As Australia’s leading renewable energy state, Tasmania offers unique advantages for industry and global markets, the Minister added. To support this growth, the 2025-26 state budget has allocated $64.8 million over the next four years to advance strategic renewable energy projects and strengthen Tasmania’s economy.

Key investments include $14.4 million for the Renewable Energy Approvals Pathway, which will help bring new clean energy generation online, and support for the Tasmanian Green Hydrogen Hub and the Renewable Energy Services Hub, aimed at preparing the state for emerging industries.

Duigan also highlighted the government’s strong commitment to Project Marinus, with a $300 million equity contingent reserved should the project receive a positive Final Investment Decision by August 2025.

“The Hydrogen Hub, together with our bold energy agenda, will attract investment, drive regional economic growth, and support Tasmania’s transition to a low-emission future,” Duigan said. “It will also reinforce our position as a renewable energy leader, which is at the heart of our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania’s Future.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/green-hydrogen.jpeg,N,,2025-06-02 08:56:38.948655

But the greenhouse gases are released overseas, so they don’t count in Australia’s emissions data.
Australia’s export emissions are likely to be triple that of our domestic emissions.
When it comes to fugitive and export emissions, Australia is not on track to meet 2030 targets.","According to Australia’s Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, the latest emissions data show “we are on track to reach our 2030 targets” under the Paris Agreement. In 2024, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were “27% below 2005 levels”. That’s great news, right?

Well, yes and no. Australia continues to rely on changes in land use to compensate for emissions released into the atmosphere.

In other words, Australia’s plants are considered to be taking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere now than in 2005. Their efforts are captured in the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, which is the single largest reason for the significant reduction in Australian emissions.

Without accounting for land use, Australia’s emissions have only decreased 3% since 2005, not 27%.

If Australia is serious about reducing emissions and tracking towards net zero by 2050, we need to tackle a series of inconvenient truths about fossil fuels. Fossil fuels feed into almost every aspect of our lives, not just cars and power plants. There are substitutes, but they are not easy to source – and they don’t come cheap.

How fossil fuel exports drive up emissions here and overseas

Australia is one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel exporters. The coal, oil and natural gas we export is either burnt or combined with our sizeable iron ore exports to produce iron. But the greenhouse gases are released overseas, so they don’t count in Australia’s emissions data.

This is in line with our international commitments under the Paris agreement. But there is an argument to be made that even though Australia doesn’t burn those exports, we should acknowledge our central role in contributing to global emissions. We may need to account for these in future reporting.

Australia’s export emissions are likely to be triple that of our domestic emissions. These emissions have been increasing consistently over the last decade.

But the process of extracting fossil fuels and preparing them for export does show up in Australia’s domestic emission figures, through what’s called “fugitive emissions”. These fugitive emissions are the unavoidable leaks that occur when we pull fossil fuels out of the ground, store, transport and process them.

In the year to 2024, fugitive emissions accounted for 10.6% of our emissions, which is far greater than emissions from industrial processes (6.8%).

Disturbingly, recent analysis suggests fugitive emissions could be drastically underreported. Because these emissions are tricky to measure, they are often estimated on an average basis. This means reported values do not accurately reflect true releases.

When it comes to fugitive and export emissions, Australia is not on track to meet 2030 targets. Recent export-focused fossil project approvals such as the North West Shelf gas project suggest we might even be backtracking.

The transition to renewables

Closing dirty old coal-fired power stations and replacing them with renewable energy such as solar and wind power does cut emissions. The reduction in emissions from the electricity sector, down 23.7% on 2005 levels, is good news. But the difference is still small enough that seasonal variations from Tasmania’s hydro power plants can distort the annual figures.

At least there is a plan in place for the energy transition. Big, slow wheels are in motion.

Unfortunately the reality is we will need much, much more renewable energy in the future. Up to three times the current capacity of the National Electricity Market will be needed to cover future domestic energy requirements across electricity and other sectors out to 2050.

Significantly more would be required to generate enough additional green energy to also produce green value-added commodities.

Australia’s clean energy challenge

Discussions around transitioning from fossil fuels typically overlook how deeply they are embedded in our everyday lives.

Not just the fuel we use in our cars, but the roads we drive on. Not just the electricity we use to power our hospitals, but the steel used to build them and the pharmaceuticals we rely on.

Globally, around 13% of fossil fuels are not burned but used to make these key chemicals. What’s the alternative?

Clean electricity is the key.

Electricity can be used to make hydrogen from water through electrolysis. This hydrogen can then replace fossil fuels in manufacturing – making products such as green steel and ammonia for fertiliser.

When combined with non-fossil sources of carbon, hydrogen can also be turned into renewable fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel. It can be used to synthesise green versions of petrochemicals used in industrial processes such as ethanol, propylene and ethylene, which are currently sourced from fossil fuels.

This takes energy. Lots of it. Fortunately Australia has all the ingredients needed for a booming green industry – one that’s much broader than just renewable electricity.

Currently, it costs more to produce these chemicals without using fossil fuels. That’s why some companies and state governments have been pulling back from their investments in green hydrogen.

Most people talk about green hydrogen in the context of energy storage or export. But it can also enable the transition away from fossil fuels in other sectors. The technology exists to make these chemicals and products, without the emissions and it’s slowly but steadily moving closer toward price parity.

If we can nail this switch to fossil-free alternatives to petrochemicals, Australia would be able to add value onshore, rather than exporting raw materials. For example, we could export iron, not iron ore. Methanol or ammonia, not hydrogen. Export the jumper, not the wool.

Heavy industry driven by renewables?

On Sunday, Bowen said he found some areas of the 2024 emissions figures “encouraging, like industrial emissions, way down and lower than 2021”.

Unfortunately, this result was partly due to a decline in manufacturing. Onshore manufacturing capability has been steadily decreasing, despite increased fossil fuel extraction.

Unless we ramp up green manufacturing – replacing fossil fuel exports with much needed renewable products and fuels – we will continue to bear responsibility, if not direct accountability, for large, exported emissions as well as onshore fugitive emissions.

And no amount of changes to land use can account for that.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/671496/original/file-20250602-56-u2x1eo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C1225%2C7336%2C3668&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-02 06:57:45.346264

Okay, so I just got off the phone with a source at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and honestly, I'm pretty blown away. They're predicting a massive jump in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. We're talking a doubling – yes, doubling – by 2025. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Is this for real? Another one of those overly optimistic predictions?"" And, you know, I had the same thought at first. But after going through the data and chatting with this expert, I'm convinced this is a seriously big deal. It's a huge step towards making air travel a bit less… planet-killing. I mean, the aviation industry's carbon footprint is no joke, and SAF is really the best hope we've got right now for a meaningful reduction. This could seriously change things.

What Does This Actually Mean For Us?

So, what does doubling SAF production actually mean for everyday flyers? Well, for starters, it should mean more flights using this cleaner fuel. The more SAF available, the cheaper it becomes, making it a more viable option for airlines. We can expect to see airlines slowly incorporating more and more SAF into their operations. Now, it won't happen overnight, obviously. There are still some supply chain hurdles and definitely some cost issues, but this prediction from IATA points to a significant change in the near future. Think of it this way: It's not a magic bullet solving all of our aviation-related climate problems, but it's a gigantic leap in the right direction. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty optimistic. This is much faster than many experts predicted only a year or two ago.

The Challenges Ahead: It's Not All Smooth Sailing

It's not all sunshine and rainbows, though. Even with this predicted boom, there are still some pretty significant challenges ahead. One of the biggest is scaling up production. Doubling production in just a couple of years is a huge undertaking. It requires massive investment in new infrastructure, research and development, and a whole lot of coordination between governments, airlines, and fuel producers. Think of it like trying to suddenly build twice as many car factories. It's complicated and expensive. Getting the feedstocks – the raw materials used to make SAF – is also a big question. Sustainability is key here; we don't want to solve one problem by creating another. And of course, there's the cost. SAF is currently much more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Getting the price down to a competitive level will be essential for widespread adoption.

IATA's Confidence: Why They're So Optimistic

IATA isn't just pulling numbers out of thin air, though. They've based their projections on a whole bunch of factors, including government policies supporting SAF, increasing investments in production facilities, and growing public and corporate demand for sustainable travel options. They're seeing a real shift in the industry – a genuine commitment to reducing emissions and lessening the environmental impact of flying. This isn't just wishful thinking; it's based on a lot of detailed analysis and conversations with industry players. It’s still early days and there’s a lot of work to be done, but honestly, their confidence is infectious.

The Bottom Line: A Reason for Hope

Look, I'm not saying that all our climate woes will vanish with this increased SAF production. But, it represents a monumental shift in the right direction. It shows that the industry is starting to take seriously its responsibility to reduce emissions and that there is real progress being made. It's a reason to feel a little bit hopeful about the future of air travel. We still need to keep pushing for more innovation and sustainability across the board, but this news is definitely a win for the planet.",https://www.procapitas.com/data/blog/banner/thumb683d3e17391a01.10413254.webp,N,,2025-06-02 04:56:36.885072

The industry needs rapid scale-up and efficiency gains, not empty targets.”

Mandates Gone Wrong: Europe’s SAF Approach Backfires

Instead of spurring adoption, European SAF mandates introduced on 1 January 2025 have backfired—driving up costs and distorting the market. With most SAF now diverted to Europe to meet compliance obligations, airlines face skyrocketing costs.

For the 1 million tonnes of SAF expected to be purchased in Europe this year, airlines will pay $1.2 billion at market price—plus an additional $1.7 billion in compliance fees, levied by SAF producers and suppliers. These fees, IATA notes, could have reduced 3.5 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions had they been invested in actual decarbonization efforts.

“Mandating SAF use before markets are ready—and without guardrails—has made SAF five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel,” said Walsh. “Europe’s strategy is not accelerating the transition—it’s undermining it. If the goal is to decarbonize aviation, this is the wrong road.”

Global Solutions, Not Local Barriers

To break these bottlenecks and enable truly global SAF growth, IATA is spearheading two key initiatives:

CADO SAF Registry – A global, standardized registry to track SAF production, purchases, and emissions reductions in compliance with CORSIA and the EU ETS.

SAF Matchmaker – A platform that connects airline demand with supplier availability, simplifying procurement and expanding access.

A Call to Action: What Governments Must Do Now

IATA is calling on governments to abandon flawed approaches and take meaningful action in three critical areas:

Fix the Policy Imbalance: Level the playing field between renewable energy producers and fossil fuel giants. Reallocate a portion of the $1 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies to support SAF development.

Build a Unified Energy Policy: Ensure aviation is integrated into national and global renewable energy strategies. SAF production depends on greater access to renewable energy and supportive infrastructure across all sectors.

Back CORSIA as the Global Solution: CORSIA must remain the only market-based mechanism for tackling international aviation’s emissions. Governments should release more Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) to help airlines meet their obligations. Currently, only Guyana has done so.

The recent Annual General Meeting of the International Air Transport Association presented a statistic that is both humbling and hopeful: global production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is expected to double in 2025, reaching two million tonnes. Though this figure still only accounts for 0.7 percent of total airline fuel consumption, it signals a shift from intention to tangible progress.

This doubling is more than numerical growth—it represents a directional change. The increase may seem modest against the magnitude of the aviation industry’s carbon footprint, yet it embodies momentum that can multiply if the right ecosystems are in place.

Economics of Transition: A Complex Equation

As SAF scales, it introduces a familiar dilemma in the sustainability dialogue—cost. Europe’s SAF mandates have spurred demand but also doubled prices, with airlines projected to spend USD 2.9 billion in 2025 just to meet regulatory requirements. That same investment could have potentially abated 3.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide under more cost-effective programs.

However, this challenge also presents an opportunity to recalibrate policy frameworks to ensure they drive transformation rather than inflate transition costs. SAF’s cost competitiveness cannot rest solely on mandates; it requires an ecosystem that promotes innovation, scale, and market parity.

Building Bridges, Not Barriers

The call for equitable access and infrastructure by IATA underscores a broader principle: sustainable aviation should not be a luxury of the few but an imperative for all. Efforts like the SAF Matchmaker platform aim to bridge gaps between suppliers and airlines, making SAF procurement more accessible and transparent.

Equally pivotal is the creation of a global SAF registry, managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization. By embedding traceability into the SAF ecosystem, such tools enhance credibility and align the fuel with compliance schemes like CORSIA.

Emerging Voices, Emerging Markets

India’s aviation trajectory adds an important layer to this narrative. As one of the world’s most rapidly growing aviation markets and the third-largest oil consumer, its commitment to a 2 percent SAF blend by 2028 sets the stage for significant regional influence. Yet, with no current commercial SAF production, the journey has just begun.

India’s move is not just a policy announcement—it is a signal of intention from the Global South, which must be acknowledged and supported in the global energy transition. Emerging economies will play a crucial role in determining whether SAF remains a boutique solution or becomes a universal standard.

Towards a Shared Altitude

The story of SAF in 2025 is not one of disappointment in its current scale but recognition of its directional integrity. Sustainable aviation is not defined by how fast we decarbonize but by how well we embed equity, innovation, and feasibility into every stage of the journey.

Governments must now align ambition with practical support—reallocating fossil fuel subsidies, strengthening access to bio-feedstocks, and refining carbon credit markets. The aviation sector, meanwhile, must lean into transparency, traceability, and partnerships.

Conclusion: A Quiet Revolution, Not a Headline

The SAF outlook presented at the AGM reminds us that sustainability is not always a story of sweeping revolutions. Sometimes, it is about small, deliberate shifts—like doubling production—that lay the groundwork for exponential change.

Real progress in aviation decarbonization will depend on how these first steps are amplified. By focusing not just on outputs, but on ecosystem building, inclusive policy, and accessible technology, the future of flight can indeed be sustainable.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-8.svg,N,,2025-06-02 04:56:44.446972

Iata reported global SAF production should hit two million tonnes (2Mt) this year or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption.

But the association noted the cost of SAF in Europe has doubled since the EU and UK SAF mandates were introduced on January 1 owing to “the compliance fees SAF producers or suppliers are charging”.

Both the UK and EU mandates require that SAF comprise an average 2% of aviation fuel on departing flights over the course of this year, with the proportion required to increase in subsequent years.

Iata estimates the one million tonnes of SAF required to meet the mandates in 2025 would cost $1.2 billion at current market prices.

However, it calculates compliance fees could add $1.7 billion on top, suggesting the mandates “have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel”.

Iata director general Willie Walsh said: “This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and safeguards in place against unreasonable market practices.”

He argued: “Europe needs to realise its approach is not working and find another way. Raising the cost of the energy transition should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies.”

Walsh insisted: “The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

But he said: “While it’s encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s fuel needs and even that small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill.”

Iata wants governments to create “more effective” policies, arguing that to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular it’s necessary “to eliminate the disadvantage renewable energy producers face compared with big oil”.

It called on governments to “redirect a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel”.

The association also called for SAF production to form part of a comprehensive approach to energy policy and renewable energy production.

Meanwhile, Iata projected airline industry net profits of $36 billion this year against $32.4 billion in 2024 with passenger carryings up 4% year-on-year to hit a record high of 4.99 billion.

Walsh said: “The first half of 2025 has brought significant uncertainties to global markets. Nonetheless, by many measures including net profits, it will still be a better year for airlines than 2024, although slightly below our previous projections.

“The biggest positive driver is the price of jet fuel which has fallen 13% compared with 2024 and 1% below previous estimates.

“Moreover, we anticipate airlines flying more people and more cargo in 2025 than they did in 2024, even if previous demand projections have been dented by trade tensions and falls in consumer confidence.

“The result is an improvement of net margins from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025. That’s still about half the average profitability across all industries. But considering the headwinds, it’s a strong result that demonstrates the resilience that airlines have worked hard to fortify.”

Iata said polling data from April supported projections for demand growth.

Some 40% of respondents expect to travel more over the next 12 months than they did in the previous year. The majority (53%) said that they expect to travel as much as they did in the previous 12 months. Only 6% reported that they expect to travel less.

Almost half (47%) expect to spend more on travel over the next 12 months. An almost equal proportion (45%) expect to spend the same on travel over the next 12 months while only 8% expect to spend less.

Although 85% expected trade tensions to impact the economy in which they reside and 73% expect to be personally impacted, 68% of business travellers (50% of those polled) expected increased corporate travel amid trade tensions to visit customers - 65% said trade tensions would have no impact on their travel habits.

These include hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen internal combustion engine (H2-ICE) vehicles, supported by nine hydrogen refuelling stations.","Aviation sector’s hydrogen hurdle

Aviation contributes 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions. Despite this relatively small share, aviation’s high-altitude emissions and limited clean energy alternatives make it a priority area and one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise.

Global aviation leaders, including the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and manufacturers like Boeing, have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. However, hydrogen, a fuel often touted as a future solution, is unlikely to play a central role in meeting that goal. Gupte noted that hydrogen-powered aircraft are still decades away from commercial viability and will not contribute meaningfully to the 2050 target.

“Hydrogen is going to be part of the solution, but not any time soon. It's going to be a decade or two before we're able to solve some of those problems on the tech side and the infrastructure side,” Gupte said.

The core challenge lies in the fundamental design shift required to accommodate hydrogen fuel. Owing to its low volumetric energy density which means it stores less energy per unit of volume compared to other fuels like gasoline, hydrogen must be stored as either highly compressed gas or cryogenic liquid. A high volumetric energy density is important for maximising range and efficiency in vehicles. This allows for smaller, lighter fuel tanks, increasing vehicle efficiency and space for passengers or cargo.

These conditions demand completely new aircraft architectures and add significant weight and volume, reducing both passenger and cargo capacity—an unfeasible trade-off for most airlines today.

“Boeing has been working on hydrogen technologies for the last 10 years. Airbus has been working for the last 4-5 years, they have, however, put their efforts on pause for a while. And there's a reason for that the infrastructure for aviation for hydrogen and the sheer physics of a hydrogen plane in terms of number of passengers it can carry versus how big the carrier can be, today just doesn't make sense,” Gupte noted.

Beyond aircraft design, the supporting infrastructure is virtually non-existent. Airports would need to overhaul their refuelling systems, safety protocols and storage facilities to handle hydrogen safely at scale—investments that are not just capital-intensive but also time-consuming.

“But, by then we would [already] be too late to get to net zero by 2050. So, it will be part of the solution in the future. But the current solution has to be primarily sustainable aviation fuel,” he added.

Trending Stories

The trucking sector backs the case for hydrogen

While hydrogen may face long lead times in aviation, it is gaining traction as a viable decarbonisation option in the trucking sector. Volvo’s Bali pushed back on Gupte’s view that hydrogen will not contribute significantly, in the near term.

“At least in the trucking space, for medium to heavy duty vehicles, hydrogen is likely to make sense much earlier than aviation,” Bali said, citing both technological momentum and growing use-case viability.

Volvo Group is currently advancing hydrogen technologies on two fronts. It is developing hydrogen fuel cell trucks through a joint venture called Cellcentric, formed with Daimler Truck AG, and hydrogen combustion engines in partnership with Westport Fuel Systems under the joint venture Cespira.

Bali noted that such innovations significantly cut emissions while leveraging existing engine architecture, making the transition more cost-effective for fleet operators.

Heavy-duty trucks are a high-impact sector in the carbon equation. Although they represent fewer than 8% of the global vehicle fleet (excluding two- and three-wheelers), they account for more than 35% of direct CO₂ emissions from road transport, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) data. The agency expects that 280,000 hydrogen fuel cell trucks and buses will be on the road by 2030.

Hydrogen offers compelling advantages for long-haul transport. It provides higher energy density by weight than batteries, which allows trucks to maintain range without sacrificing payload capacity—crucial for logistics and freight operations. Refuelling a hydrogen truck also takes minutes, not hours, enhancing uptime and operational efficiency. In addition, hydrogen ICE technology can be integrated into existing diesel engine platforms, reducing the cost and complexity of transitioning to cleaner fuels.

“The key is that hydrogen will be stored at 700 bars, very high pressures, that’s where the trick is how it will get very efficient,” Bali noted.

He revealed that as part of the ongoing pilot programs between private players and the Centre, hydrogen-powered vehicles are being tested on Indian roads. These trials are set to run over the next two years to evaluate real-world performance and feasibility.

“We hope by the end of two-three years, this whole concept can be proven, [of hydrogen as a] very efficient fuel. If we can master this—using hydrogen at 700 bars—with the entire ecosystem that needs to be built, it can then run on the same ICE engine, which can be a very big breakthrough for all medium- to heavy-duty trucks, as well as long-haul transport,” Bali added.

Yet, challenges remain. Green hydrogen—produced via electrolysis from renewable power—is still expensive, and scaling up production to meet transport demand will take time. Refuelling infrastructure remains limited, and developing a viable distribution network will require strong public-private collaboration. Additionally, hydrogen-powered trucks continue to be significantly costlier than their diesel counterparts, a barrier that must be overcome through economies of scale and innovation in fuel cell and engine technology.

Global setbacks have added to the caution. According to Bloomberg’s Colin McKerracher, in recent months, several hydrogen truck startups including Nikola, Hyzon Motors, Quantron, and Hyvia either shut operations or scaled back, struggling to cover the costs despite generous subsidies. McKerracher pointed out that trucking was long seen as hydrogen’s best bet, but slow infrastructure rollout, high fuel costs, and lack of standardisation have hampered momentum.

The India picture

India’s decarbonisation strategy is beginning to take shape across key transport sectors, with hydrogen emerging as a potential solution—especially for heavy-duty mobility. Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM), launched in January 2023 with a total outlay of ₹19,744 crore until FY 2029-30, the government is actively pushing hydrogen as a clean energy alternative. Aimed at reducing dependence on fossil fuels and positioning India as a global leader in green hydrogen technology, the Mission includes targeted funding of ₹496 crore for mobility pilot projects by 2025-26.

As part of this effort, five pilot projects have been sanctioned to deploy 37 hydrogen-powered buses and trucks across 10 routes nationwide. These include hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen internal combustion engine (H2-ICE) vehicles, supported by nine hydrogen refuelling stations. Companies such as Tata Motors , Ashok Leyland , Reliance Industries , NTPC , IOCL , and others are leading the trials, which are expected to be operational within 18 to 24 months, the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said in a March press release.

These pilots are intended to validate the feasibility, safety, and cost-effectiveness of hydrogen mobility under real-world conditions, particularly in long-haul and heavy-duty transport, where battery electrification faces limitations.

As for aviation, Gupte underscored that India holds a strategic advantage in the Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) space. SAFs, though expensive, costing about 2.5 times more than conventional Jet A1 fuel, can be blended with existing jet fuels and used in today’s aircraft without redesigning engines or overhauling airport infrastructure.

Thanks to its access to abundant feedstock like agricultural waste and used cooking oil, Gupte noted that India has the potential to supply over 5% of global SAF demand by 2050. With a growing aviation market and supportive policy measures, India could not only reduce its domestic aviation emissions but also become a key exporter of SAF. However, this would require a focused push in refining capacity, logistics infrastructure, and clear policy incentives, especially at a time when SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of aviation fuel use globally, according to the IEA.

As India works to decarbonise transport, its dual approach towards hydrogen and SAFs can help it build both its global and domestic market. India must push hydrogen where it can deliver early results—like in freight and heavy vehicles—and double down on SAFs in aviation, where they offer the most immediate and scalable impact.",https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india%2F2025-06-02%2Fy1k35sr5%2FGettyImages-1306278602.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-06-02 01:56:24.605820

Léger renforcement de la rentabilité des compagnies aériennes prévu pour 2025, malgré les vents contraires (pdf)

New Delhi – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced updates to its 2025 airline industry financial outlook, showing improved profitability over 2024 and resilience in the face of global economic and political shifts.

Highlights from the expected 2025 financial performance include:

Net profits at $36.0 billion, improved from the $32.4 billion earned in 2024, but slightly down on the previously projected $36.6 billion (December 2024).

Net profit margin at 3.7%, improved from the 3.4% earned in 2024 and the previously projected 3.6%.

Return on invested capital at 6.7%, improved from the 6.6% earned in 2024 and largely unchanged from previous projections.

Operating profits at $66.0 billion, improved from an estimated $61.9 billion in 2024, but down from the previously projected $67.5 billion.

Total revenues at a record high of $979 billion (+1.3% on 2024, but below the $1 trillion previously projected).

Total expenses at $913 billion (+1.0% on 2024, but below the previously projected $940 billion).

Total traveler numbers reaching a record high 4.99 billion (+4% on 2024, but below the previously projected 5.22 billion).

Total air cargo volumes reaching 69 million tonnes (+0.6% on 2024, but below the previously projected 72.5 million tonnes).

“The first half of 2025 has brought significant uncertainties to global markets. Nonetheless, by many measures including net profits, it will still be a better year for airlines than 2024, although slightly below our previous projections. The biggest positive driver is the price of jet fuel which has fallen 13% compared with 2024 and 1% below previous estimates. Moreover, we anticipate airlines flying more people and more cargo in 2025 than they did in 2024, even if previous demand projections have been dented by trade tensions and falls in consumer confidence. The result is an improvement of net margins from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025. That’s still about half the average profitability across all industries. But considering the headwinds, it’s a strong result that demonstrates the resilience that airlines have worked hard to fortify,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Perspective

“Perspective is critical to put into context such large industry-wide aggregate figures. Earning a $36 billion profit is significant. But that equates to just $7.20 per passenger per segment. It’s still a thin buffer and any new tax, increase in airport or navigation charge, demand shock or costly regulation will quickly put the industry’s resilience to the test. Policymakers who rely on airlines as the core of a value chain that employs 86.5 million people and supports 3.9% of global economic activity, must keep this clearly in focus,” said Walsh.

Outlook Drivers

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the traditional driver of airline economics. However, although global GDP growth is expected to fall from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.5% in 2025, airline profitability is expected to improve. This is largely on the back of falling oil prices. Meanwhile, continued strong employment and moderating inflation projections are expected to keep demand growing, even if not as fast as previously projected.

Efficiency is another significant driver of the outlook. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high in 2025 with a full-year average of 84.0%, as fleet expansion and modernization remains challenging amid supply chain failures in the aerospace sector.

Overall, total revenues are expected to grow by 1.3%, outpacing a 1.0% increase in total expenses, shoring up industry profitability.

Revenue

Industry revenues are expected to reach a historic high of $979 billion in 2025 (+1.3% on 2024).

Passenger Revenues

Passenger revenues are expected to reach $693 billion in 2025 (+1.6% on 2024), an all-time high. This will be bolstered by an additional $144 billion in ancillary revenues (+6.7% on 2024).

Passenger growth (measured in Revenue Passenger Kilometers/RPK) is expected to be 5.8%—a significant normalization after the exceptional double-digit growth of the pandemic recovery.

It is expected that passenger yields will fall by 4.0% compared with 2024. This is largely reflective of the impact of lower oil prices and strong industry competition. This will continue the trend of travelers benefiting from ever-more affordable air travel. The real average return airfare (in 2024 US dollars) is expected to be $374 in 2025. This is 40% below 2014 levels.

IATA’s April 2025 polling data supports projections for demand growth:

Some 40% of respondents expect to travel more over the next 12 months than they did in the previous 12-month period. The majority (53%) said that they expect to travel as much as they did in the previous 12 months. Only 6% reported that they expect to travel less.

Some 47% of respondents expect to spend more on travel over the next 12 months than they did in the previous 12 months. An almost equal proportion (45%) expect to spend the same on travel over the next 12 months while only 8% expect to spend less.

Although 85% expected trade tensions to impact the economy in which they reside and 73% expect to be personally impacted, 68% of business travelers (50% of those polled) expected increased business travel amid trade tensions to visit customers, and 65% said trade tensions would have no impact on their travel habits.

Cargo Revenues

Cargo revenues are expected to be $142 billion in 2025 (-4.7% on 2024).

This is primarily based on the expected impact of reduced GDP growth largely influenced by trade-dampening protectionist measures, including tariffs. As a result, air cargo growth is expected to slow to 0.7% in 2025 (from 11.3% in 2024). The cargo yield is also expected to reduce by 5.2%, reflecting a combination of slower demand growth and lower oil prices.

Although significant uncertainty remains on how trade tensions will evolve over the year, as of April cargo demand was holding up well with a 5.8% year-on-year increase.

Expenses

Industry expenses are expected to grow to $913 billion in 2025 (+1.0% on 2024).

Jet fuel is expected to average $86/barrel in 2025 (well below the $99 average in 2024), translating into a total fuel bill of $236 billion, accounting for 25.8% of all operating costs. This is $25 billion lower than the $261 billion in 2024. Recent financial data show minimal fuel hedging activity over the past year, indicating that airlines will generally benefit from the reduced fuel cost. It is not expected that fuel will be impacted by trade tensions.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is expected to grow to two million tonnes (Mt) in 2025, accounting for just 0.7% of airline fuel use. SAF production will double from the 1 Mt produced in 2024 (all of which was purchased by airlines), but production needs an exponential expansion to meet the demands of the industry’s commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

IATA estimates that the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel, for a total additional cost of $1.6 billion. In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel. This extra cost is largely the result of SAF 'compliance fees’ being levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge their potential costs as a result of European SAF mandates to include 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply.

“The behavior of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage. The cost of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is estimated to be an enormous $4.7 trillion. Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers,” said Walsh.

The cost of the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Airlines (CORSIA) to airlines is expected to reach $1 billion in 2025. The market for CORSIA credits will grow, but Guyana is the only country to have issued certificates for the high-quality credits that the scheme requires.

Fleet/Supply Chain

The aircraft backlog exceeds 17,000 (sharply up from the 10,000-11,000 pre-pandemic), with an implied wait time of 14 years. Should states exit from a multilateral agreement exempting aircraft from tariffs, supply chain constraints and production limitations could be further aggravated.

Supply chain issues have had significant negative impacts on airlines: driving-up leasing costs, increasing the average fleet age to 15 years (from 13 in 2015), cutting the fleet replacement rate to half the 5-6% of 2020, and reducing the efficiency of fleet utilization (using larger aircraft than needed on some routes, for example).

In 2025, 1,692 aircraft are expected to be delivered. Although this would mark the highest level since 2018, it is almost 26% lower than year-ago estimates. Further downward revisions are likely, given that supply chain issues are expected to persist in 2025 and possibly to the end of the decade.

Engine problems and a shortage of spare parts exacerbate the situation and have caused record-high groundings of certain aircraft types. The number of aircraft younger than 10 years in storage is currently more than 1,100, constituting 3.8% of the total fleet compared with 1.3% between 2015 and 2018. Nearly 70% of these grounded aircraft are equipped with PW1000G engines.

“Manufacturers continue to let their airline customers down. Every airline is frustrated that these problems have persisted so long. And indications that it could take until the end of the decade to fix them are off-the-chart unacceptable!” said Walsh.

Risks

With ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, the most significant risks to the industry outlook include:

Conflict:The resolution of conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war would have a benefit for airlines in reconnecting de-linked economies and reopening airspace. Conversely, any expansion of military activity could have a dampening effect.

Trade tensions: Tariffs and prolonged trade wars dampen demand for air cargo and potentially travel. Additionally, the uncertainty over how the Trump Administration’s trade policies will evolve could hold back critical business decisions that drive economic activity, and with it the demand for air cargo and business travel.

Fragmentation: Global standards have always been critical for aviation. Fragmentation of global standards or weakening of multilateral institutions and agreements could bring additional costs to airlines with a more complex or unstable regulatory environment. This includes the evolution of policies on climate, trade, facilitation and a myriad of other matters impacting airline strategic decision-making and operations.

Oil prices:Oil prices are a major driver of airline profitability. The complex array of factors impacting oil prices (including economic growth projections, the amount of extraction activity undertaken, policies on decarbonization, sanctions, availability of refining capacity, and transport blockages) can produce quick shifts in pricing volatility with significant impact on airline financial prospects.

Regional Roundup

All regions are expected to deliver collective net profits in 2025. Most will see their financial performance improve compared with 2024, with Latin America being the exception. Profitability, however, varies widely by carrier and by region. The collective net profit margin of African airlines is expected to be the weakest at 1.3% while carriers in the Middle East are forecast to be the strongest at 8.7%.

North America will generate the highest absolute profit among the regions even as it is expected to be affected by a slowdown in the US economy, with increased tariffs likely to erode both consumer and business sentiment, dampening consumption and investment. The persistent shortage of pilots and engine reliability problems, particularly in the low-cost sector, will limit growth in the region.

Europe is expected to benefit from strong passenger demand, driven by growth in the low-cost sector. More of their aircraft fleet will return to service following engine-related grounding, and the EU’s open skies agreements with North Africa will provide market opportunities. A stronger Euro will boost profitability for all carriers in the region with costs (such as fuel) mainly denominated in US dollars.

Asia Pacific is the largest market in terms of RPK, with China accounting for over 40% of the region’s traffic. Passenger demand is expected to be strong given the relaxation in visa requirements in several Asian countries, particularly China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. This will support both international tourism and travel within the region. However, the economic landscape poses some challenges, with the GDP forecast for the region, particularly China, having been revised down. Although flights between China and the United States are still limited to 100 weekly frequencies and significantly below pre-COVID levels, overcapacity issues are showing signs of improvement due to better fleet deployment between domestic and international travel.

Latin America is home to some airlines that are thriving and others that are experiencing significant financial difficulties. The region’s airlines continue to be impacted by weak domestic currencies as major cost items, such as fleet expenses and debt servicing, are paid in US dollars. Argentina’s signing of open skies agreements with a number of countries is positive and will enhance connectivity and competition for the benefit of airlines and passengers. However, the proposed 26.5% VAT on tickets in Brazil could have a significant impact on the market. This is the only region to see profitability decrease compared with 2024.

The Middle East will generate the highest net profit per passenger among the regions. Robust economic performance is supporting strong air travel demand, both for business and leisure travel. However, with delays in aircraft delivery, the region will see limitations in capacity as airlines embark on retrofit projects to modernize their fleet, hence limiting growth.

Africa’s carriers face high operational costs and a low propensity for air travel expenditure in many of their home markets. A shortage of aircraft and spare parts is dampening growth in the region. The shortage of foreign currency in some economies, particularly US dollars, is adding to the region’s challenges. Despite these challenges, there is sustained demand for air travel in Africa.

The Traveler’s Viewpoint

Air travel delivers value to consumers. An April 2025 public opinion poll (commissioned by IATA covering 14 countries with 6,500 respondents who have taken at least one trip in the last 12 months) revealed that 97% of travelers expressed satisfaction with their travel (58% indicating they were highly satisfied). Moreover, 89% agreed that air travel makes their lives better, 81% appreciated the availability of choice in travel planning, and 78% agreed that air travel is good value for money.

Passengers are counting on a safe, sustainable, efficient, and profitable airline industry. IATA public opinion polling demonstrated the important role that travelers see the airline industry playing:

90% agreed that air travel is a necessity for modern life

90% agreed that air connectivity is critical to the economy

89% said that air travel has a positive impact on societies

82% said that the global air transport network is a key contributor to the UN Sustainable Development Goals

84% care about the success of the aviation industry

88% care about their ability to fly in the future

The air transport industry is committed to its goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Travelers are expressing high levels of confidence in this endeavor with 81% agreeing that the industry is demonstrating a commitment to work together to achieve this ambitious aim. Some 77% agreed that aviation leaders are taking the climate challenge seriously, significantly above the 64% recorded for government leaders and 60% for the oil sector.

Producing even this small amount of SAF will add approximately $4.4 billion to the global fuel bill.
Airlines now pay double for SAF due to fees from producers and suppliers.
For the expected one million tonnes bought in Europe to meet the rules, the cost will be around $2.9 billion.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has revealed that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025. However, this will still cover only about 0.7 percent of all airline fuel needs worldwide.

IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, said this progress is a step in the right direction, but the cost is huge. Producing even this small amount of SAF will add approximately $4.4 billion to the global fuel bill. Walsh warned that the industry must move faster to increase supply and bring costs down.

“The pace of progress must speed up […] both in ramping up production and in finding ways to bring costs down,” Walsh insisted.

Much of the current SAF supply is going to Europe, where new mandates from the EU and the UK took effect at the beginning of 2025. But these new rules have caused fuel prices to soar. Airlines now pay double for SAF due to fees from producers and suppliers.

For the expected one million tonnes bought in Europe to meet the rules, the cost will be around $2.9 billion. This includes $1.7 billion in extra compliance fees. According to Walsh, this outcome is “unreasonable.”

“This highlights the problem with implementing mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization,” IATA’s Director General said.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/06/Aircraft-fueling-process.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 01:56:45.556444

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to develop bio-jet fuel technology independently.

This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by approximately 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

What is SAF?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly reduce its lifecycle carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, helping to address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

Adoption of SAF from the Chinese Mainland

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Last year, Cathay Pacific also adopted two batches of SAF from the Chinese Mainland, which were uplifted at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow Airport, respectively.

Cathay Pacific introduces ‘Chinese Classics’ for Business Class customers

Cathay Pacific announced it was introducing its new “Chinese Classics” dining offerings inspired by the Eight Great Cuisines of China for its Business class customers. The new “Chinese Classics” menu seeks to provide a diverse culinary experience for customers.

As the cornerstone of Chinese culinary culture, the Eight Great Cuisines of China embody the diversity and storied traditions of Chinese food. The “Chinese Classics” menu encompasses dishes from Sichuan, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan, redefining inflight dining with innovative concepts and exceptional quality. To meet the unique demands of inflight catering, Cathay’s culinary team conducted thorough research on the flavour profiles, ingredients, cooking techniques and cultural heritage of these regional cuisines. The team carefully curated the ingredients and refined cooking methods to ensure that the dishes retain their authentic flavours and visual appeal at high altitudes.

The new menu adheres to rigorous quality control standards and embodies the wisdom of Chinese culinary traditions, providing customers from all over the world with an immersive experience that fosters a deeper understanding of Chinese culture.Cathay Director Customer Travel Erica Peng said: “Our ‘Chinese Classics’ menu complements our already popular ‘Hong Kong Flavours’ and ‘International Favourites’ options, showcasing rich Chinese cultural heritage to all our customers. These dining offerings are meticulously crafted, vibrant in both flavour and presentation. We hope that these iconic dishes can offer our customers a taste of home and warm their hearts whenever, wherever they fly with us.”

From April 2025, Cathay Pacific has progressively introduced its “Chinese Classics” offerings in its Business class cabin, debuting on selected outbound flights from Hong Kong to the Chinese Mainland. The menu features a new dish each month, bringing fresh and authentic Chinese flavours to customers from around the world. The airline plans to introduce dishes from Sichuan, Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year, with a complete rollout of the eight regional cuisines expected in 2026.

Additionally, the offerings will be progressively extended to other routes and cabins. To promote cultural exchange, Cathay Pacific will be releasing a three-part documentary series in July, enabling customers to better understand the heritage and craftsmanship of Chinese culinary culture by exploring the design concepts, cultural roots and creative process behind the dishes.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tons in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” Walsh said.
Call for Policy Reform and Renewable Energy Access According to IATA, the success of SAF hinges on two critical needs: increasing global renewable energy production and securing dedicated access for SAF producers.
“Advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived,” IATA said.
Under CORSIA, international airline operators are required to purchase and cancel emissions units to offset growth in carbon emissions above 2019 levels.","Global production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to double to 2 million tons in 2025, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said, though the industry body warns that the figure still represents less than 1 percent of aviation’s total fuel consumption.

IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, made the disclosure during the association’s 81st Annual General Meeting in New Delhi. He acknowledged the progress but stressed that the scale remains far too small to make a meaningful dent in aviation’s carbon emissions.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tons in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” Walsh said. “And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

The aviation industry has been under mounting pressure to decarbonize, with countries introducing net-zero targets as part of their energy transition goals. SAF—produced from sustainable feedstocks like used cooking oil and agricultural waste—has been identified as a critical lever to cut aviation emissions without needing to overhaul current aircraft technology.

However, its limited supply and high cost remain major bottlenecks.

Call for Policy Reform and Renewable Energy Access

According to IATA, the success of SAF hinges on two critical needs: increasing global renewable energy production and securing dedicated access for SAF producers.

“Advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived,” IATA said. “Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production.”

Walsh further emphasized the need for coordinated government policy, saying, “Sufficient government measures, including the implementation of effective policies, are needed to meet decarbonization efforts.”

He also pointed to the importance of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), an initiative launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Under CORSIA, international airline operators are required to purchase and cancel emissions units to offset growth in carbon emissions above 2019 levels.

Revenue Blockages Add to Industry Pressure

Aside from fuel-related concerns, IATA also raised concerns over the continued blocking of airline funds by several governments. As of the end of April 2025, $1.3 billion in airline revenues remain stuck in various countries, down from $1.7 billion reported in October 2024—a 25 percent improvement, but still a significant strain on airline liquidity.

“These blockages violate international treaties and compromise the financial stability of airlines,” Walsh said. “Ensuring the timely repatriation of revenues is vital for airlines to cover dollar-denominated expenses and maintain their operations.”

He warned that the delays increase exchange rate risks and threaten airlines’ ability to maintain vital air connectivity, particularly in economies that depend heavily on international air transport.

“Economies and jobs rely on international connectivity. Governments must realize that it is a challenge for airlines to maintain connectivity when revenue repatriation is denied or delayed,” he added.

The Regional Divide

While Walsh praised parts of the Middle East for their aviation progress, he cautioned that conflicts, sanctions, and closed airspace in the broader region continue to undermine industry recovery.

“Conflicts, sanctions & closed airspace don’t just ground planes — they stall economies,” he said in a statement shared via IATA’s social media handle.

As the aviation world convenes in New Delhi, the SAF conversation remains a top agenda item. IATA is urging global stakeholders to harmonize regulatory frameworks, enhance safety oversight, and tackle economic policies that continue to choke airline growth and sustainability efforts.

Although the doubling of SAF output offers a glimpse of hope, the road to aviation decarbonization remains steep. However, IATA’s message is that governments must act faster, producers must scale up, and the industry cannot afford to move at its current pace.",https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/01180407/aircraft-airplane.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 18:56:17.492004

A Inpasa, the largest producer of grain ethanol in Latin America, received the international ISCC Corsia certification, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), on May 23, 2025. This certification allows the company to supply ethanol and Technical Corn Oil (TCO) as raw materials for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), consolidating its position in the global biofuels market.

Certification expands Inpasa's operations in the SAF sector

Initially granted to the Dourados (MS) unit, the ISCC Corsia certification now covers all Inpasa plants in Brazil. With this, the company is able to supply ethanol and TCO, a strategic byproduct in the production of SAF through technological routes such as Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). Inpasa's TCO production capacity is approximately 846 thousand kilos per day, totaling around 305 thousand tons per year. According to Christopher Davies Junior, Inpasa's sustainability director, ""the certification marks a new level of international credibility. We are anticipating trends, investing in technologies and contributing to a cleaner energy matrix for Brazil and the world.”

Expansion and investments strengthen market leadership

Inpasa began operations in Brazil in 2019, after operating in Paraguay since 2008. The company currently has five plants in operation in the country and plans to open a new biorefinery in Luís Eduardo Magalhães (BA) in 2026. In 2024, the company achieved gross revenue of R$14,9 billion and invested approximately R$4,9 billion in expanding its production capacity. The Sinop (MT) plant stands out as the largest corn ethanol production unit in the world, processing more than 4,6 million tons of the cereal and producing 2,1 billion liters of ethanol annually. With a daily production of approximately 16 million liters of ethanol, Inpasa accounts for approximately 17% of the national production of this biofuel, according to data from the National Union of Corn Ethanol (UNEM) and the Society of Agribusiness Consulting (SCA Brasil).

Sustainability and innovation drive growth

Inpasa uses second-harvest raw materials, such as corn and sorghum, without affecting food production or land use. In 2024, it processed around 8,3 million tons of corn, producing 3,7 billion liters of ethanol. Since the beginning of operations in Brazil, it has avoided the emission of 15 million tons of CO₂, compared to fossil fuels. The company's units are certified by RenovaBio and, in 2024, generated 1,3 million decarbonization credits (CBIOs).

While this marks a doubling of 2024’s output, it still represents just 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption—a sobering reminder of the long road ahead.

“This small but growing volume of SAF will still add US$4.4 billion to airlines’ fuel bills globally,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “We must urgently accelerate production and drive down costs.”

A key challenge lies in the unintended consequences of well-meaning environmental mandates. In Europe, where SAF blending mandates took effect in January 2025, compliance costs have doubled the price of SAF. For the one million tonnes expected to be purchased to meet these mandates, airlines will pay US$1.2 billion—plus an additional US$1.7 billion in compliance fees. This $2.9 billion total could have instead abated 3.5 million tonnes of CO₂, raising questions about the effectiveness of current policy approaches.

“Europe’s strategy has made SAF five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel,” Walsh warned. “Decarbonization policies must not make the energy transition more costly.”

To help scale the SAF market, IATA is rolling out two major initiatives. The first is a SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), which will ensure transparency and compliance with emissions schemes, such as CORSIA. The second, the SAF Matchmaker platform, aims to connect airlines with SAF suppliers, streamlining procurement.

Governments also play a critical role. IATA is urging them to refocus energy policies, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies that disadvantage renewables, and ensure SAF gets fair access to renewable energy infrastructure. Supporting the CORSIA framework and expanding access to eligible emissions credits is also key. So far, only Guyana has made credits available to airlines.

Meanwhile, India has biofuel ambitions. As the` world’s third-largest oil consumer and a rising aviation power, the country has committed to a 2% SAF blend by 2028. However, while the skies are busy, the fuel powering India’s aircraft is not yet sustainable, as there is currently no commercial production of SAF in the country.

If global aviation is to meet its sustainability goals, bold policy shifts and international cooperation—especially from emerging economies like India—are essential.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/683c8ae78be43a11443c911a_Adrian%20Nowakowski.jpeg,N,,2025-06-01 13:56:58.049068

Salil Gupte, President of Boeing India and South Asia, said the country is uniquely positioned to meet a significant share of global SAF demand, with the capacity to eventually produce 8-10 million mt annually, enough to meet over 5% of global SAF requirements.

“India can help decarbonize the civil aviation industry,” Gupte said. “This creates an opportunity to convert agricultural waste into a valuable export product while addressing climate goals.”

With aviation contributing around 2%–3% of global carbon emissions, according to IATA,SAF is considered a critical solution for reducing the industry’s environmental footprint. However, supply remains a major challenge, with SAF currently costing 2.5 to 3.5 times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel.

India’s rapid aviation expansion further strengthens the case for local SAF production. Gupte noted that 2,500 new civil aircraft are expected to join the Indian fleet over the next two decades. Indian carriers have already placed orders for more than 1,000 aircraft in recent years, cementing India’s status as one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets.

The opportunity, according to Gupte, lies not just in meeting domestic demand but also in exporting SAF to global markets striving to reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050. To meet that goal, global SAF production must scale up to 185 million mt annually.

India’s feedstock advantage includes used cooking oil, farm waste, and other agricultural residues that are not in direct competition with the food supply. Developing this sector could not only support climate commitments but also drive rural economic development and energy security, Gupte suggested.

Boeing, a long-time partner in India’s aerospace ecosystem, is ramping up its efforts to support sustainable aviation globally, including through research partnerships, SAF supply chain investments, and aircraft fleet modernization programs.

India’s potential to become a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel has been gaining momentum, bolstered by both public and private sector initiatives. Earlier in 2025, Boeing and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. announced a partnership aimed at accelerating SAF production and ecosystem development in India.

The collaboration will explore opportunities to scale domestic SAF manufacturing, certify fuel made from local feedstocks, and implement sustainability standards across the supply chain.

HPCL, through its Green R&D Centre, has already pioneered “Trijet” technology, a patented method to convert used cooking oil into jet fuel.

This innovation underscores the country’s readiness to commercialize SAF at scale using widely available agricultural and industrial residues.

Feedstocks such as farm waste, non-edible plants, forestry residue, and municipal waste make India uniquely positioned to meet both its domestic needs and contribute to global SAF supply chains.

Boeing has committed to making all its commercial aircraft capable of flying on 100% SAF by 2030 and has previously demonstrated the technology in test flights.

However, industry leaders — including Boeing India President Salil Gupte — emphasize that aircraft readiness is not the barrier. Rather, building a viable supply chain, a favorable policy environment, and reducing the high cost of SAF are key challenges that must be addressed.

At recent industry events, Gupte projected India could produce up to 24 million mt of SAF annually based on available feedstock, far exceeding the estimated domestic demand of 8-10 million mt by 2030.",,N,,2025-06-01 13:57:04.853194

“While it is encouraging to see SAF production double, such a small volume will add $4.4 billion to the global fuel bill. Production must accelerate and become more efficient,” warned Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Europe: A Mandate That Inflates Sustainability Costs

Starting January 1, 2025, airlines operating in the European Union and the UK face mandatory SAF usage requirements. The result has been a doubling of costs in Europe, driven by compliance fees imposed by fuel producers and suppliers.

An estimated one million tons of SAF will be purchased to meet these regulations, with a market price of $1.2 billion. An additional $1.7 billion in fees brings the total cost to $2.9 billion.

“With that extra money, an additional 3.5 million tons of carbon emissions could have been avoided,” Walsh explained. “Europe’s approach is failing. It urgently needs revision.”

IATA Drives Global Solutions for a More Accessible SAF Market

To prevent a repeat of Europe’s scenario in other markets, IATA has launched two key initiatives:

A SAF Registry Managed by CADO

This system will transparently track SAF purchases, usage, and emission reductions, aligning with international regulations such as CORSIA and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

SAF Matchmaker: A Tool to Connect Supply and Demand

The goal is to streamline SAF procurement by matching airline requests with supplier offers, optimizing distribution and access to the fuel.

What Governments Must Do: Three Urgent Action Lines

IATA calls on governments to focus on effective, realistic policies that genuinely boost SAF production and use without distorting markets:

1. Eliminate Advantages for Fossil Fuels

Renewable energy producers currently compete at a disadvantage against major oil companies. Reallocating part of the $1 trillion in global oil subsidies would be a critical step.

2. Integrate SAF into National Energy Policies

This involves ensuring sufficient renewable energy production to generate SAF and reserving a fair share for aviation. Shared infrastructure and co-production should also be promoted.

3. Support CORSIA as the Sole Market Mechanism

So far, only Guyana has made its carbon credits available for airlines to meet CORSIA obligations. IATA urges other countries to follow suit.

India: A Key Player in SAF’s Future

India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer, is taking decisive steps by launching the Global Biofuels Alliance and setting a 2% SAF blending target for international flights by 2028.

Measures such as guaranteed pricing, financial support for new projects, and technical standards are part of the package. IATA will collaborate with the Indian Sugar and Bioenergy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries Limited to align production with international best practices.

“India has a major opportunity to lead the global push for biofuels with progressive policies that accelerate SAF adoption,” IATA concluded.",https://aviacionaldia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Combustible-de-aviacion.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 15:56:34.488254

According to the association, 81 airlines have inked agreements to buy and use greener jet fuel, up from 70 in 2023, and this number is growing steadily.
Dr Thomsen also called on governments to redirect some of the subsidies given to fossil-fuel companies to those producing renewable energy, including sustainable jet fuel.
Iata on June 1 highlighted the sustainable jet fuel mandates rolled out in Europe and Britain.
This money will go towards the bulk purchase of greener jet fuel that airlines will need to use at Changi and Seletar airports.","– More airlines around the world are committing to using greener jet fuel in a bid to reach their goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

But there are headwinds, with the global trade body representing the industry flagging policy shortcomings that have hindered the production and adoption of such fuels. These are made mainly from waste materials like used cooking oil, and are said to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with regular jet fuel.

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) said on June 1 it expects the production of such greener aviation fuels to reach 2 million tonnes in 2025, a dip of 0.1 million tonnes from its earlier projections in December 2024.

While this is double the 1 million tonnes of greener jet fuel produced in 2024, the 2025 figure forms just 0.7 per cent of airlines’ projected total fuel consumption this year, Iata noted.

According to the association, 81 airlines have inked agreements to buy and use greener jet fuel, up from 70 in 2023, and this number is growing steadily.

Singapore Airlines and its low-cost arm, Scoot, are among those that have pledged to increase sustainable fuel use.

“The problem is not the (airline) industry. The problem is the energy source,” said Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, Iata’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist.

Speaking to reporters on the first day of Iata’s three-day annual general meeting in New Delhi, she called for government policies that maximise the production of renewable energy in all forms.

Dr Thomsen also called on governments to redirect some of the subsidies given to fossil-fuel companies to those producing renewable energy, including sustainable jet fuel. These subsidies amount to US$1 trillion (S$1.3 trillion) a year globally.

Unless policies and behaviours change, she said the aviation sector will not meet its 2050 net-zero emissions target.

“It’s not impossible. It’s just that at the pace, with the investments and with the policies currently, it is a resounding no,” she noted on the sidelines.

She flagged other urgent priorities for governments around the world, including the need for policies to adapt and fix unintended consequences.

Iata on June 1 highlighted the sustainable jet fuel mandates rolled out in Europe and Britain. They require suppliers to add a proportion of sustainable aviation fuel into the jet fuel they deliver to airports – starting with a 2 per cent blend in 2025.

But the cost of greener jet fuel – which is already two to three timesmore expensive than regular fuel – has doubled as suppliers have passed on added compliance costs to airlines, Iata said.

The expected cost of green fuel needed to meet the mandates is US$1.2 billion at today’s market prices, and the compliance fees have added another US$1.7 billion to airlines’ jet fuel bills, it added.

Said Dr Thomsen: “We want to shout about it, loud and clear to everybody, so that other countries that might be thinking of mandates will think again.”

In contrast, she added that she found Singapore’s approach to driving greener jet fuel adoption to be “innovative”.

The Singapore Government will require flights departing from the city-state to use sustainable jet fuel, with an initial national target of 1 per cent use in 2026, and passengers will be charged a levy to help finance the cost.

Early government estimates in 2024 suggest that economy-class passengers may have to pay $3 more for short-haul flights, $6 more for medium-haul flights, and $16 more for long-haul flights.

This money will go towards the bulk purchase of greener jet fuel that airlines will need to use at Changi and Seletar airports. More details are expected to be announced in 2025, closer to the roll-out in 2026.

Dr Thomsen said raising ticket prices and a central fuel procurement system are not policies that Iata would have suggested.

But she added that there is greater faith that Singapore will reassess its policies and take a different course of action if the Government’s plans do not work as intended.

“The interesting and somewhat exciting nature of the market at the moment is nobody knows how to do this. Nobody has the solution,” she said. “Let’s see if this works and what can be done.”

On green jet fuel production, Iata’s head of net-zero research and programmes Preeti Jain said there are about 300 projects identified globally, with about 160 of them set to come online by 2030.

In Asia-Pacific, there are 28 such projects with a projected capacity of 7 million tonnes.

But whether these projects can be realised is a question, with Ms Jain noting delays and slow progress despite the abundance of raw materials in the region.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ede922998ca118b9f67f5779b63e4fc2e241b083bd993fde4ea1e78eea92d641,N,,2025-06-01 12:56:43.756494

NEW DELHI: India’s aviation sector is witnessing strong growth, supported by enhanced connectivity, improved airport infrastructure, and emerging potential in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Sunday. Speaking at a media briefing during the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) in Delhi, Amitabh Khosla, IATA’s Country Director for India, Nepal & Bhutan, said, ""We are also seeing significant increase in the airport infrastructure, so it gives a good foundation, a base on which India will build further."" Khosla also pointed to India’s potential in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, citing the country’s standing as a major ethanol producer. ""We understand from our discussions with some of the oil companies in the country that we are looking at India SAF production coming about in 2026,"" he said. India, he noted, has the capabilities to become a key player in sustainable aviation, aligning with global decarbonisation goals. Despite this progress, IATA also highlighted persistent challenges related to high operational costs and tax-related uncertainties. This year’s WATS event has drawn approximately 1,700 attendees, and marks the first time IATA’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) is being held in India in over four decades. IATA represents around 350 airlines, accounting for over 80 per cent of global air traffic. According to IATA data, the aviation sector in India directly employs nearly 370,000 people and contributes$5.6 billion to the economy. Including indirect, induced, and tourism-related effects, the industry supports 7.7 million jobs and adds $53.6 billion to India’s GDP- equivalent to 1.5 per cent of total economic output.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.
- 'Entirely achievable' - The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.
To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
""This represents only 0.7 percent of total aviation needs,"" IATA Director General Willie Walsh said.","The airline industry's flagship goal of decarbonising by 2050 is now ""in peril"" due to climate-sceptic policies, including those of US President Donald Trump, the leading airline association IATA warned on Sunday.

The emergence of leaders favouring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks are ""obviously a setback... it does imperil success on the 2050 horizon"", Marie Owens Thomsen, the International Air Transport Association's senior vice president for sustainability, told reporters.

""But I don't think it's going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,"" she said at the IATA annual industry conference in India.

Trump's Republican administration is supporting the development of fossil fuels in contrast to his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, who had massively supported the production of renewable aviation fuels through tax credits.

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

- 'Entirely achievable' -

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

However, SAF biofuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

""Another problem, which is related, is the fact that oil is so cheap,"" Owens Thomsen said. ""I think that also diminishes the sense of urgency that people have.""

A barrel of Brent North Sea crude, the international benchmark, stands below $65 as a result of Trump's tariffs, his call to ""drill baby drill"" and especially a decision by OPEC+ to hike crude output quotas.

This represents an immediate boon for airlines, whose fuel costs represent between a quarter and a third of operating expenses.

SAF is seen as a crucial ingredient in hitting emissions targets. The biofuel produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel and is made from plant and animal materials such as cooking oil and fat.

European Union rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

Owens Thomsen estimated on Sunday that $4.7 trillion in investment is needed to establish SAF sectors capable of meeting the needs of air transport by 2050.

""It is entirely achievable,"" she said, adding that the raw materials and technology already exist and simply need to be developed.

""The money involved is very comparable to the money that was involved in creating the previous new energy markets, notably obviously wind and solar,"" she said.

That money could be found just by stopping subsidies to oil producers, she said.

""The world is subsidising large oil companies to the height of $1 trillion per year,"" she said.

""With that money, if it were redirected in its totality, we could solve our energy transition in less than five years.""

IATA also indicated on Sunday that it expects global SAF production to double this year compared with 2024 to 2.5 billion litres -- slightly down from its previous projections of 2.7 billion litres.

“We are placing a firm order for 30 Airbus A350-900s,” said Pieter Elbers, the CEO of IndiGo, a company founded in 2006 and already behind the largest contract by volume in the history of civil aviation -- 500 Airbus single-aisle aircraft by 2023.

The Indian low-cost carrier, the country’s biggest by market share, is positioning itself as a significant player in the long-haul market.

“This strategic move will enable IndiGo to spread its wings further and expand its long-haul international network”, the company said in a statement.

“This is yet another step in defining the airline’s long-term plans of international expansion”.

The A350 planes, with ranges of up to 15,000 kilometres (9,300 miles), will allow it to further expand its network.

Overall, IndiGo has placed orders for around 1,000 aircraft from the A320 family, Airbus’s most successful model and rival of the Boeing 737 MAX, which has endured multiple setbacks after a series of safety scares.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which began its annual industry conference in New Delhi on Sunday, said “the development of India’s air connectivity in recent years has been nothing short of phenomenal”.

Indian domestic air growth is “running at over 10 percent” per year, Walsh said, ahead of the conference.

The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world’s fourth-largest air market -- domestic and international -- with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.

Last year, India’s domestic air passenger traffic reached a “historic milestone, surpassing 500,000 passengers in a single day”, according to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation.

Railways remain hugely popular but travelling by trains crisscrossing a country about three-quarters the area of the European Union is often slow and chaotic.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is slated to address IATA delegates on Monday, has made the development of the air sector a priority since coming to power in 2014.

Separately, the International Air Transport Association said on Sunday it expects the amount of sustainable aviation fuel produced to double in 2025 to reach 2 million tonnes, representing 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption.

Influential industry body IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will struggle to meet their sustainability goals, and has described the production of SAF - which is more expensive than conventional jet fuel - as disappointingly slow.

In a press statement issued during IATA’s Annual General Meeting, Director General Willie Walsh noted that the projected 2 million tonnes of SAF will account for just 0.7 percent of total fuel consumption this year.

The use of SAF has been increasingly prominent in recent years, as most countries have set stipulated targets to achieve net zero as part of their energy transition efforts.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” said Walsh.

He added: “And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

The IATA official further stated that sufficient government measures, including the implementation of effective policies, are needed to meet decarbonization efforts.

He added that ensuring the success of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation is crucial to offsetting carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Under CORSIA, an initiative launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airplane operators must purchase and cancel “emissions units” to offset the increase in CO2 emissions.

“Advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production,” said IATA in the statement.

In a separate statement, IATA said that $1.3 billion in airline funds are blocked from repatriation by governments as of the end of April.

The industry body, however, noted that this figure also represents a 25 percent improvement compared to the $1.7 billion reported for October.

The aviation body also urged governments to remove all barriers preventing airlines from the timely repatriation of their revenues from ticket sales and other activities in accordance with international agreements and treaty obligations.

“Ensuring the timely repatriation of revenues is vital for airlines to cover dollar-denominated expenses and maintain their operations. Delays and denials violate bilateral agreements and increase exchange rate risks,” said Walsh.

He added: “Economies and jobs rely on international connectivity. Governments must realize that it is a challenge for airlines to maintain connectivity when revenue repatriation is denied or delayed.”",,N,,2025-06-01 12:57:00.310808

Air India CEO Campbell Wilson recently valuable insights into the airline's ambitious turnaround plan, operational challenges, and future growth strategy during a candid interview with Managing Editor of CNBC-TV18 Shereen Bhan. As soon as the conversation began, Wilson highlighted the transformative changes underway at Air India since Tata's acquisition. He noted that the airline's ongoing modernisation efforts, and vision is to become a world-class global carrier with a distinct Indian identity.

One of the most striking revelations was the scale and speed of the airline's transformation. Wilson described a five-year plan aimed at moving from stabilisation to sufficiency and now to efficiency. The airline has grown its fleet from under 100 aircraft to nearly 300 in just three years, with plans for further expansion supported by a marquee 470-aircraft order.

Significant investments have been made in upgrading physical infrastructure, IT systems, product quality, and human resources. Wilson emphasised that these efforts are not short-‘term fixes, but part of a sustained transformation designed to strengthen Air India's financial position and operational performance over the long term.

During the interview, he shed light on the extensive refit programme underway. ""The narrow-body fleet's refurbishment is nearly 75% complete, with expectations to finish the remainder by the end of the year. The wide-body refit programme, critical for long-haul routes, is ongoing and expected to conclude around 2027,"" Wilson said and added that these upgrades will enhance the passenger experience and make the new Air India's product visible across the network.

Wilson discussed operational resilience too, recalling how the airline managed flight disruptions during recent airspace closures due to geopolitical tensions. Through advanced contingency planning, quick rerouting, and close coordination, Air India minimised passenger disruption despite the challenging circumstances.

The meager supply—and more critically, the inefficient policy landscape—poses a significant risk to aviation’s long-term decarbonization goals and cost-effectiveness.

IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh delivered the message with urgency:

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double, the current levels are nowhere near enough. Worse, poor policy implementation—particularly in Europe—is inflating SAF costs unnecessarily.”

With global attention on climate change and energy security, IATA’s critique comes at a crucial time. The agency calls for structural reforms in SAF policy and urges governments worldwide to collaborate in scaling sustainable fuel production while protecting airlines from volatile and inflated costs. Notably, India’s rising role as a SAF innovator and biofuel hub stands out as a potential game-changer.

Europe’s SAF Mandates Backfire, Raising Costs

IATA’s concerns stem from the European Union and United Kingdom’s implementation of SAF blending mandates effective from January 1, 2025. These mandates, while meant to incentivize sustainable fuel adoption, are now causing unintended consequences due to premature rollout in the absence of robust supply chains and price controls.

For the one million tonnes of SAF expected to be purchased in Europe this year to meet these mandates:

Market prices are expected to hit $1.2 billion

Compliance fees—charged by suppliers—could add an estimated $1.7 billion

“Instead of promoting SAF, Europe’s mandates have made it five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel,” said Walsh. “That $1.7 billion could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions.”

The critique underlines a vital policy lesson: premature mandates without price control and production scale-up mechanisms undermine the goal of energy transition and strain aviation economies, particularly in the post-pandemic recovery period.

IATA’s Two Key SAF Initiatives

To mitigate these challenges, IATA is proactively building industry tools to support SAF growth:

CADO SAF Registry: Managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), this registry provides a transparent, standardized system for tracking SAF transactions, usage, and emissions reductions. It ensures compliance with global carbon accounting systems like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

SAF Matchmaker Platform: This new tool matches SAF demand from airlines with verified supply offers, improving procurement and planning, especially for carriers outside Europe and North America.

Both initiatives aim to streamline SAF adoption, reduce compliance confusion, and promote international alignment.

What Governments Must Do: IATA’s Three-Point Reform Agenda

IATA is calling on governments to act swiftly and strategically by focusing on three priority areas:

1. Equalize Policy for Renewables vs. Fossil Fuels

Renewable energy producers currently operate at a cost disadvantage due to long-standing fossil fuel subsidies, which according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), amount to over $1 trillion globally per year.

IATA urges governments to:

Redirect a portion of fossil fuel subsidies toward SAF innovation

Provide capital access, price guarantees, and tax credits to SAF producers

2. Integrate SAF in Broader Energy Policy

Governments must develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that ensures SAF is:

Allocated sufficient renewable feedstock

Supported with shared infrastructure and co-production systems

Recognized as a priority in national energy and transport strategies

3. Ensure CORSIA Success and Carbon Credit Access

IATA reiterates support for CORSIA as the sole global, market-based mechanism to offset international aviation CO₂. Airlines currently lack access to adequate Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs)—with Guyana being the only country offering carbon credits to airlines under CORSIA.

IATA calls on other states to:

Make carbon credits available

Create certification and trading channels

Harmonize international reporting standards

India’s Emerging Leadership in SAF and Biofuels

India is uniquely positioned to emerge as a global SAF leader—a fact that IATA acknowledges in its SAF market outlook. As the third-largest oil-consuming nation and one of the fastest-growing aviation markets, India’s proactive steps toward sustainable aviation could reshape not just domestic travel but global emissions outcomes.

India’s recent launch of the Global Biofuels Alliance aligns with its G20 Presidency 2023 priorities and signals a national commitment to renewable energy integration. The alliance aims to:

Establish biofuels as a pillar of global energy transition

Promote cross-border investments and technology transfers

Support regulatory frameworks for SAF and other green fuels

The Indian government, through the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), has set a 2% SAF blending target for international flights by 2028. Supporting policies include:

Guaranteed pricing for SAF producers

Capital support for infrastructure

Technical standards for feedstock and lifecycle assessments

In March 2025, IATA partnered with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries, two major biofuel stakeholders, to implement best practices in SAF production and feedstock validation.

Implications for India’s Travel and Tourism Industry

India’s leadership in SAF policy isn’t just an environmental win—it presents a strategic advantage for tourism and air travel.

According to the Ministry of Tourism, India welcomed 17.4 million foreign tourists in 2023, with forecasts predicting 25 million by 2028. Long-haul travelers increasingly prefer airlines with strong sustainability credentials, particularly in Europe, North America, and East Asia.

Adopting SAF at scale will allow Indian carriers like Air India, IndiGo, and Vistara to:

Enhance brand reputation in eco-conscious markets

Comply with EU SAF mandates for incoming international flights

Attract code-share partnerships and global tourism alliances

Additionally, eco-tourism and green travel packages, supported by SAF-powered routes, can create new revenue streams and sustainable employment in India’s Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

The integration of SAF into India’s aviation economy may also enable green corridors linking key tourism destinations like Kerala, Rajasthan, Ladakh, and the Andaman Islands—creating a competitive edge for India as a sustainable destination.

Conclusion: Time for Coordinated Action

IATA’s stark warning makes it clear that policy missteps risk stalling the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts, and that SAF must be scaled responsibly, affordably, and globally.

India’s progress—through its clear targets, policy backing, and industry partnerships—offers a model for other nations. If supported with the right economic tools and international collaboration, India can be a biofuel powerhouse that transforms not only its own aviation industry but contributes meaningfully to global climate goals.

In the words of IATA’s Willie Walsh:

“The aviation industry is ready. The technology is advancing. But governments must now provide the foundation through smart, effective policies that support—not stifle—the transition to sustainable flight.”

Peter Elbers, CEO, IndiGo, emphasized the carrier’s evolution from a domestic low-cost carrier to a global powerhouse, backed by strategic partnerships, infrastructure investment, and a commitment to sustainability.

Taking the stage, Elbers delivered a compelling vision of IndiGo’s future. “This is more than just about IndiGo — it's about India's aviation story,” Elbers said. “With the IATA AGM back in India after 42 years, it's a fitting time to show the world how India is redefining flight.”

Doubling Down on Growth

A major announcement during the event was the conversion of options into firm orders for 30 Airbus A350-900s, doubling IndiGo’s wide-body commitment to 60. With deliveries starting in 2027, the deliveries will now continue well beyond 2035.

“This is a great moment for IndiGo — and a great moment for India,” said Elbers. “The A350s are not just planes; they are bridges — between India and the world, between dreams and destinations.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Chief Commercial Officer, Airbus, joined Elbers on stage. “IndiGo has ordered over 1,400 aircraft with us. That scale is unprecedented,” said Saint-Exupéry. “It’s not just a business relationship — it’s a shared journey.”

India’s Aviation Moment

According to IATA, India is currently the third-largest domestic aviation market in the world and is projected to become the third-largest overall aviation market (domestic and international combined) by 2030, surpassing the United Kingdom. In 2023, IATA reported that India’s domestic passenger traffic grew by more than 22% year-on-year — a strong indicator of both economic momentum and evolving consumer behavior.

India also boasts one of the youngest flying populations globally, with a median age of just under 29. “An ambitious, mobile, and tech-savvy middle class is reshaping how India travels,” Elbers noted. “We see this reflected in every flight we operate. And we're here to meet that demand — not just with more seats, but with more choices, more comfort, and more destinations.”

Expanding Horizons: Domestically and Internationally

Elbers outlined IndiGo’s plans to expand its domestic network from 91 to 95 destinations this year, alongside a bold push to grow its international network from 41 to over 50 cities. Besides Amsterdam (AMS) and Manchester (MAN), Elbers announced that Athens (ATH), Copenhagen (CPH) and London will be the next European destinations, plus four Central Asian cities, including Siem Reap (SAI).

“This is just the beginning,” Elbers stated. “Today, 90% of India’s population lives within 100 kilometers of an IndiGo-served airport. Soon, we want to ensure that 90% of the world is within reach of our wings.”

Beyond Numbers: The IndiGo Way

While growth metrics were abundant — including 118 million passengers flown last year and over 2,300 daily flights — Elbers emphasized culture and values. “Every three days, one million customers board an IndiGo flight. But behind every seat is a story. A business dream. A long-overdue reunion. A student’s first step abroad. That's the real weight of what we carry.”

The airline has also led inclusivity efforts in aviation, employing the highest number of female pilots globally at 16% and offering work opportunities to people with disabilities across its operations.

New Products, New Partnerships

In a nod to changing customer expectations, IndiGo is enhancing its premium offerings. The airline’s “IndiGo Stretch” product — a business-class experience — is being expanded to international routes such as Singapore (SIN), Bangkok (BKK), Phuket (HKT), and Dubai (DXB). Additionally, IndiGo's frequent flyer program, Blue Chip, has already amassed over three million members.

IndiGo is also forming deeper global alliances. Hours before the press briefing, the airline announced plans to develop a partnership, enhancing the connectivity of India with Europe and North America with Delta Air Lines (DL), Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic (VS).

Recent partnerships with Delta, Virgin Atlantic, Air France-KLM, and Japan Airlines are enhancing IndiGo’s network connectivity and brand visibility abroad. “These aren’t just codeshares,” said Elbers. “They’re strategic bridges to the future.”

Investing in Infrastructure and Sustainability

Elbers announced that IndiGo is developing its own MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) facility in Bengaluru — a step toward operational independence and cost efficiency. ""India is brimming with engineering talent,"" he said. ""Why should we send our aircraft overseas when we can build world-class facilities here?""

On sustainability, Elbers acknowledged the global push toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and decarbonization. While SAF is not yet widely available in India, he admitted, “We’re committed to flying cleaner. With one of the youngest fleets in the world, IndiGo already has a strong emissions profile. And we are ready to do more as the technology and infrastructure evolve.”

Looking to 2030 and Beyond

Summing up the airline’s direction, Elbers shared a clear ambition: “By 2030, IndiGo will not just be India’s airline — it will be a global airline. Powered by Indian ambition, Indian talent, and Indian innovation.”

Elbers emphasized that the airline’s expansion is not just about size, but about strengthening connectivity, improving service, and building long-term alliances. “We are growing with purpose,” Elbers said. “As India continues to develop, IndiGo’s role is to connect people, places, and opportunities — both within the country and across the world.”

With firm plans in place, a growing fleet, and a focus on both access and efficiency, IndiGo is preparing for its next chapter — one that aims to align closely with India’s broader economic and global ambitions.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/683c5affc2040fc029ba96af_Image%20from%20Roberto%20Leiro%20Airways%20Magazine%20(1).webp,N,,2025-06-01 11:57:09.509750

In a press statement issued during IATA’s Annual General Meeting, Director General Willie Walsh noted that the projected 2 million tonnes of SAF will account for just 0.7 percent of total fuel consumption this year.

The use of SAF has been increasingly prominent in recent years, as most countries have set stipulated targets to achieve net zero as part of their energy transition efforts.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” said Walsh.

He added: “And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

The IATA official further stated that sufficient government measures, including the implementation of effective policies, are needed to meet decarbonization efforts.

He added that ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation is crucial to offsetting carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Under CORSIA, an initiative launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization, airplane operators must purchase and cancel “emissions units” to offset the increase in CO2 emissions.

“Advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production,” said IATA in the statement.

In a separate statement, IATA said that $1.3 billion in airline funds are blocked from repatriation by governments as of the end of April.

The industry body, however, noted that this figure also represents a 25 percent improvement compared to the $1.7 billion reported for October.

The aviation body also urged governments to remove all barriers preventing airlines from the timely repatriation of their revenues from ticket sales and other activities in accordance with international agreements and treaty obligations.

“Ensuring the timely repatriation of revenues is vital for airlines to cover dollar-denominated expenses and maintain their operations. Delays and denials violate bilateral agreements and increase exchange rate risks,” said Walsh.

He added: “Economies and jobs rely on international connectivity. Governments must realize that it is a challenge for airlines to maintain connectivity when revenue repatriation is denied or delayed.”

RIYADH: The global industrial sector is witnessing a radical transformation toward adopting Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, prompting countries to reconsider traditional manufacturing methods and adopt smart solutions that include automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, and data-driven systems to improve production efficiency and reduce operational costs.

According to the Saudi Press Agency, the Kingdom is not only keeping pace with the global industrial transformation but also aims to lead it through strategic initiatives and specialized programs that promote smart industry practices and accelerate the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies.

This will enhance the competitiveness of Saudi Arabia’s industrial sector both regionally and globally, aligning with the goals of Vision 2030 and the National Industrial Strategy to position the Kingdom as a leading industrial power, one that supports global supply chains and exports high-tech products globally.

The Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources is undertaking this ambitious transformation by establishing an integrated and comprehensive national system to enhance advanced manufacturing, according to SPA.

It has launched the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center, which brings together all programs and initiatives that enable the adoption of modern manufacturing technologies and stimulate smart and innovative industrial solutions.

This initiative is in cooperation with various government entities related to the technology, research, and innovation sectors and in partnership with several global leaders in industrial technology.

The efforts under the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center include the Future Factories Program Initiative, the Industrial Beacons Program, the Accelerated Manufacturing Program, the Capability Centers Network, and the Operational Excellence Program, reported SPA.

These initiatives collectively support the center’s vision of becoming a unified national platform that accelerates the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies. They also serve as a bridge to help local manufacturers access cutting-edge solutions that improve efficiency, enhance quality, and reduce costs across the industrial sector.

The center aims to boost productivity and competitiveness in the manufacturing sector by localizing advanced and sustainable technologies, creating an attractive environment for industrial investment, and supporting skill development through its Capability Centers Network. It also offers experiential learning opportunities and provides advisory services to help industrial establishments adopt advanced manufacturing practices.

The efforts of the ministry are aligned with several government entities that support the center’s vision and objectives.

In 2022, the ministry launched the Future Factories initiative to support the smart transformation journey of industrial establishments, aiming to automate 4,000 Saudi factories and increase their production efficiency, reduce reliance on unskilled labor, and promote the adoption of advanced industrial solutions and practices.

The initiative offers numerous incentives and enablers to support the digital transformation of national factories, including financing solutions, consulting services, and the development and qualification of human resources to leverage the latest manufacturing technologies.

It also helps industrial establishments assess their technological maturity and develop transformation plans to adopt operational excellence practices and advanced manufacturing solutions, including AI, robotics, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics.

To support industrial transformation in the Kingdom and achieve global leadership in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies, the ministry launched the Industrial Beacons program.

This undertaking aims to enable leading Saudi factories to adopt Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, thereby enhancing their production efficiency and qualifying them to receive international recognition within the Global Lighthouse Network, an affiliate of the World Economic Forum, by 2030.

During the launch ceremony of the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center, the Ministry announced 10 national industrial companies that committed to achieving the standards of the Industrial Beacons initiative.

With the launch of the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Center and its targeted initiatives to promote advanced technologies and foster research and innovation in the industrial sector, the Kingdom signals that its ambitions extend beyond simply keeping pace with global industrial trends.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Madinah region recorded strong first quarter growth in 2025, led by 24 percent workforce participation in construction and 20 percent in trade, signaling diversification momentum.

A recent report by the Madinah Chamber of Commerce outlines the region’s sectoral distribution, with construction continuing to dominate amid a surge in infrastructure projects, the Saudi Press Agency reported.

The wholesale, retail trade, and vehicle maintenance sector, which accounted for 20 percent of the workforce, continued to thrive, demonstrating strong commercial activity and consumer demand. This segment’s high employment rate underscores Madinah’s role as a regional trading hub.

The manufacturing sector, representing 12 percent of the workforce, showed growth that indicates the emergence of a stronger industrial base, contributing to economic diversification and reducing reliance on oil-related industries.

Tourism, with an 11.2 percent workforce share, remained a key sector for Madinah as a destination for religious tourism, benefiting from a steady influx of pilgrims. The sector’s workforce expansion aligns with increased investment in hospitality, transportation, and tourism-related services, the SPA report added.

The chairman of the chamber, Mazen bin Ibrahim Rajab, emphasized the focus on improving the business environment by leveraging Madinah’s economic strengths and investment opportunities.

The report situated Madinah’s growth within broader economic trends. In 2024, the worldwide economic growth reached 3.2 percent, supported by a rebound in foreign direct investment, while inflation declined to 4.5 percent, signaling improving economic stability.

The Kingdom’s gross domestic product grew by 4.4 percent in 2024, with non-oil sectors expanding by 5.9 percent. Madinah contributed significantly to this trend, recording a 2.8 percent increase in its GDP, reaching SR57.6 billion ($15.3 billion) in the third quarter of 2024.

The report showed that Madinah recorded the second-highest domestic demand growth in Saudi Arabia at 11 percent, trailing only Riyadh.

Additionally, foreign direct investment in the Kingdom surged by 36.6 percent in the third quarter 2024, reaching SR16 billion, with Madinah attracting a notable share due to its expanding industrial and commercial opportunities.

The report also highlighted Madinah’s booming real estate and infrastructure sectors with property transactions in 2024 totaling SR10 billion, reflecting strong investor confidence.

The job market improved significantly, with unemployment dropping from 10.3 percent in the third quarter of 2024 to 8.4 percent in the following three-month period, thanks to new employment opportunities across key sectors.

A total of 213 development projects, valued at over SR210 billion, are currently in progress, according to the report. These include 153 commercial projects, 27 mixed-use residential and commercial developments and other projects in healthcare, education, tourism, and religious infrastructure.

These initiatives are expected to generate more than 119,000 jobs, further boosting Madinah’s economic prospects.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has opened the June subscription window for its savings sukuk product “Sah,” offering a return rate of 4.76 percent, as part of its 2025 issuance calendar.

Organized by the National Debt Management Center under the Ministry of Finance, Sah is the Kingdom’s first savings-focused sukuk designed for individual investors.

The Shariah-compliant, riyal-denominated product is part of the local bonds program aimed at fostering financial inclusion and increasing personal savings.

The June issuance opened for subscription from 10 a.m. on Sunday, June 1, until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, June 3.

The bonds are structured for a one-year term with fixed returns, and profits will be paid at maturity.

The minimum subscription is set at one bond with a value of SR1,000 ($266.56), while the maximum subscription per investor is capped at SR200,000.

The product aligns with the Financial Sector Development Program under Saudi Vision 2030, which targets raising the national savings rate from 6 percent to 10 percent by 2030.

The June issuance of Sah offers a slightly higher return compared to May, rising to 4.76 percent from the previous month’s 4.66 percent, reflecting marginal shifts in market conditions.

While both issuances maintain the same structure — Shariah-compliant, riyal-denominated sukuk with a one-year maturity and fixed returns — the June window opened slightly earlier in the month, running from June 1 to June 3, compared to May’s window from May 4 to May 6.

Subscription terms remain unchanged, with a minimum investment of SR1,000 and a cap of SR200,000 per individual.

Both offerings are accessible through the same network of approved financial institutions.

Sah is promoted as a secure, fee-free savings instrument offering stable, government-backed returns.

Eligible investors must be Saudi nationals aged 18 and above and must subscribe through approved platforms provided by SNB Capital, Aljazira Capital, and Alinma Investment, as well as SAB Invest, or Al-Rajhi Capital.

The sukuk is issued monthly, and the return rate for each tranche is determined based on prevailing market conditions.

NDMC CEO Hani Al-Medaini said in March that the sukuk serves as a catalyst for private sector cooperation and participation in developing and launching various savings products tailored to diverse demographics.

These initiatives could involve partnerships with banks, fund managers, financial technology companies, and more.

RIYADH: Total outstanding credit extended by Oman’s banking sector, comprising both conventional and Islamic institutions, rose by 9 percent year-on-year to 33.6 billion Omani rials ($87.3 billion) at the end of April, according to new data.

According to the Central Bank of Oman, private sector credit rose by 7 percent to 27.8 billion rials. Non-financial corporations held the largest share at 46.6 percent, followed closely by the household sector at 44 percent.

Financial corporations held 5.6 percent, while other sectors represented the remaining 3.7 percent.

Deposits across the banking system also showed robust growth. “Total deposits held with ODCs (other depository corporations) registered a YoY significant growth of 9.3 percent to reach 32.8 billion Omani rials at the end of April 2025,” the report stated.

Of this, private sector deposits reached 21.5 billion rials, a 7.1 percent increase from the previous year.

Household deposits contributed the largest share at 50.3 percent, followed by non-financial corporations at 30.4 percent, financial corporations at 17 percent, and other sectors at 2.3 percent.

Credit extended by conventional banks grew by 7.9 percent to 21.3 billion rials, while their aggregate deposits increased by 6.1 percent to 25.7 billion rials.

The banking sectors across the Gulf Cooperation Council countries have demonstrated credit growth, reflecting the region’s economic resilience and strategic investments.

In Saudi Arabia, outstanding credit facilities reached SR2.96 trillion by the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, marking a 14.4 percent year-on-year increase.

However, Qatar’s banking sector saw a slight contraction, with total credit facilities declining by 0.2 percent to 1.4 trillion Qatari riyals, primarily due to reduced lending to the public sector and consumption.

Oman’s private sector deposits with conventional banks rose 4.5 percent to 16.8 billion rials in April.

Investments in government development bonds increased by 6.2 percent to 2 billion rials, whereas holdings in foreign securities declined by 3.7 percent to 2.1 billion rials.

Islamic banks and windows also demonstrated strong performance. Their total assets increased by 18.1 percent to 8.9 billion rials, accounting for 19.6 percent of the total banking assets.

Financing provided by these entities reached 7.2 billion rials, marking a 13.5 percent annual increase. Total deposits held by Islamic banks and windows increased by 22.6 percent to 7.1 billion rials.

Broad money supply grew 7.5 percent to 25.4 billion rials, driven by a 12 percent rise in narrow money and a 6 percent increase in quasi-money components.

Currency held by the public rose by 7.5 percent, while demand deposits expanded by 16.8 percent.

Interest rate trends showed mixed movements. The weighted average interest rate on deposits with conventional banks rose to 2.594 percent in April, up from 2.580 percent a year earlier.

Meanwhile, the weighted average lending rate fell to 5.555 percent from 5.604 percent.

The overnight domestic interbank lending rate dropped to 4.392 percent, down from 5.212 percent the previous year, reflecting a decrease in the central bank’s repo rate to 5 percent in line with US monetary policy trends.

Oman’s nominal gross domestic product increased by 1 percent year on year in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven by a 4.1 percent expansion in the non-hydrocarbon sector.

Real GDP rose by 1.7 percent, supported by 3.9 percent growth in non-hydrocarbon activities.

The average oil price stood at $75.9 per barrel at the end of April, 5.2 percent lower than a year earlier.

Average daily oil production was 986,700 barrels, reflecting a 1 percent decline.

The broader aviation sector agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF, which is made from waste oil and biomass.

Airlines are at odds with energy companies over scarce supplies of SAF, while also pointing the finger at plane makers Airbus and Boeing over delays in delivering more fuel-efficient jets.

The Problem with the Use of Mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

Focus on India

India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries Limited, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.",https://www.timesaerospace.aero/sites/aerospace/times/files/ta-favico.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 11:57:19.550843

UN aviation agency members, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), have set the year 2050 as their goal for achieving net-zero carbon emissions for air travel -- an industry often criticised for its outsized role in climate change.

The air transportation industry has faced growing pressure to deal with its contribution to the climate crisis.

Currently responsible for 2.5 percent to three percent of global CO2 emissions, the sector's switch to renewable fuels is proving difficult, even if the aeronautics industry and energy companies have been seeking progress.

To achieve net-zero emissions, airlines rely on non-fossil sources known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

IATA members preceded ICAO by a year, at their 2021 General Assembly, in setting this ambitious goal, which requires colossal investments.

But SAF fuels are still three to four times more expensive than petroleum-based jet fuel.

New Delhi – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach 2 million tonnes (Mt) (2.5 billion liters) or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Problem with the Use of Mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

IATA’s Role in Supporting the Development of a Global SAF Market

To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives:

A SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The SAF Matchmaker that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

Urgent Action by Governments Is Needed

IATA urges governments to focus on three areas:

Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel.

Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A wholistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors.

Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

Focus on India

India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries Limited, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.

As the third-largest global civil aviation market, India can strengthen its leadership in biofuels with the accelerated adoption of SAF through progressive policies.

The London-based owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia revealed the group is currently paying less than 60% of the market rate for sustainable aviation fuel.

This follows the firm's recent GBP2.6 billion push into green fuel, and its decision to enter long-term contracts with green fuel suppliers.

The Sunday Times said net-zero fuel quotas are expected to drive up fares over the next few years, as the price of SAF is currently between two and seven times higher than traditional kerosene.

SAF is claimed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

German airline group Deutsche Lufthansa AG has already introduced a supplement of up to EUR72 per ticket to offset this anticipated increase in fuel costs.

Virgin Atlantic, meanwhile, has announced a USD24 surcharge to fund minimum green fuel quotas, and warned that a return trip to New York could cost USD40 more per person as SAF usage increases.

IAG Head of Sustainability Jonathon Counsell said that investing in SAF early would give the group a ""competitive advantage"" over its rivals, The Sunday Times reported.

IAG has committed USD3.5 billion to its SAF programme over more than a decade.

""Few industry watchers believe IAG's strategy will reduce fares in the medium to long term; but the hope is that some of the savings of discounted contracts can be passed on to customers,"" added the Sunday Times.

IAG spent EUR7.6 billion on fuel in its last financial year, making it the group's single largest expense.

IAG executives said that increases in the SAF mandate each year would also benefit the FTSE 100 group by making it hard for new airlines to start up, The Sunday Times reported.

The UK mandates 2% of jet fuel must be SAF this year, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

EU rules also require carriers to include 2% of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, which then rises to 6% in 2030 and soars to 70% from 2050.

Shares in IAG closed down 2.1% at 325.90 pence each in London on Friday. The stock is up 86% over the past year.

From June 1 to June 3, 2025, India proudly hosts the 81st Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in New Delhi—a globally significant event that marks India’s elevated status in the world of aviation.

The summit, organised in partnership with IndiGo Airlines, brings together over 1,700 delegates including top airline executives, government officials, aviation industry experts, and media from across the globe.

This is the first time since 1983 that India has hosted the IATA AGM, reaffirming its growing influence in the global aviation landscape.

With record-breaking aircraft orders, cutting-edge infrastructure, and consistent passenger growth, India is being hailed as one of the most dynamic aviation markets in the 21st century.

A Landmark Gathering at a Pivotal Time

The event is expected to be inaugurated with a keynote address from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emphasizing the government’s deep commitment to aviation-driven growth. This aligns with India’s National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) and UDAN Scheme (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik), which have democratized air travel and enhanced regional connectivity.

According to India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), the number of operational airports in the country has more than doubled over the past decade—from 74 in 2014 to over 150 by 2024.

Speaking about the importance of this event, Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, said: “We are excited to bring the IATA AGM to India after a 42-year gap. India’s place in global aviation has changed dramatically, particularly over the last decade. The country has seen record aircraft orders, impressive growth, and world-class infrastructure developments.”

India’s Aviation Landscape: Fast Growth and Economic Impact

The numbers reflect this transformation. According to IATA data supported by the Government of India, India’s aviation sector directly employs around 369,700 people and contributes $5.6 billion to the nation’s GDP. When including indirect, induced, and tourism-related impacts, the aviation industry supports 7.7 million jobs and $53.6 billion, equivalent to 1.5% of India’s GDP.

The MoCA further estimates that the sector will grow at a CAGR of 10% over the next five years, making India the third-largest aviation market globally by 2030. Strategic government initiatives like GAGAN (GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation) and airspace modernization projects are also facilitating faster, safer, and more environmentally friendly air travel.

Host Airline IndiGo Takes Center Stage

India’s largest airline, IndiGo, serves as the host airline for the IATA AGM. Pieter Elbers, IndiGo’s CEO and Chair of the IATA Board of Governors, expressed pride in India’s role as a rising aviation hub:

“As the host airline of the 81st IATA Annual General Meeting, IndiGo warmly welcomes the global airline community to India. India’s aviation market is rapidly thriving while significantly contributing to the country’s socio-economic growth. This is India’s time!”

IndiGo currently controls over 60% of India’s domestic market and has placed historic orders for new aircraft, underscoring its role in making Indian aviation competitive on the world stage.

World Air Transport Summit 2025: Key Issues on the Table

Following the AGM, the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) will explore urgent topics shaping the future of global aviation. The summit’s centerpiece, the CEO Panel, moderated by CNN’s Richard Quest, features major industry leaders:

Pieter Elbers, CEO, IndiGo

Joanna Geraghty, CEO, JetBlue

Adrian Neuhauser, CEO, Abra Group

Richard Smith, COO International and CEO Airline, FedEx

The CEO Panel will address:

Global financial outlook for airlines

India’s strategic aviation expansion

Energy security and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Innovative financing for net-zero aviation

Cost of payments and transaction innovations

The operational perspectives of airline COOs

The event aligns closely with sustainability goals under India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and global aviation’s commitment to Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050, as outlined in IATA’s Net Zero Roadmap.

Sustainability in Focus: SAF and Financing

One of the most anticipated sessions at WATS will cover Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With SAF production expected to reach 17 billion liters by 2030, as per IATA, countries like India have a key role in scaling domestic production using agricultural and municipal waste. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) supports biofuel initiatives through its National Bio-Energy Mission, promoting SAF as a cleaner, scalable alternative to traditional aviation fuels.

Further, global financial institutions and governments are exploring innovative financing models—green bonds, ESG investments, and carbon offsets—to fund the shift toward net-zero aviation.

Gender Diversity Takes the Spotlight

Another major highlight of the event is the sixth edition of the IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards. These awards support the 25by2025 initiative, which aims to increase female representation in aviation leadership roles by at least 25% or to 25% minimum by 2025.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and IATA, women currently account for only 5% of airline CEOs and 3% of pilot roles globally. The awards aim to accelerate progress by recognizing individuals and organizations committed to gender equity in aviation.

India’s Strategic Aviation Vision

India’s hosting of the 2025 IATA AGM comes at a crucial moment. As the world seeks to rebound from global disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical challenges, India is positioning aviation as a key economic pillar.

The Indian government’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India) initiative includes massive investment in airports, air cargo, and indigenous manufacturing—particularly through partnerships with global OEMs such as Airbus and Boeing. Meanwhile, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Drone and Aviation Components, led by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, is strengthening domestic capabilities.

A Milestone Moment for Global Aviation

As airlines worldwide face a complex future—balancing recovery, digital transformation, and decarbonization—the IATA AGM in New Delhi provides a powerful platform for shared strategy and innovation.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh encapsulated this vision:

“The AGM is always a moment for the industry to reflect and regroup in the face of enormous economic, geopolitical and technological forces. I’m confident this gathering will deliver value to our stakeholders and strengthen our commitment to progress and collaboration.”",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/maxresdefault-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 07:56:17.157414

The SAF British Airways uses is produced from a wide range of renewable sources, including used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and even forestry residue.
British Airways is responding to that demand by turning sustainability into a core part of its brand identity.","British Airways is rolling out a sweeping plan to offer cheaper and more sustainable flights across the UK, Switzerland, and Norway, driven by a £2.6 billion investment aimed at cutting emissions, modernising its fleet, and improving fuel efficiency—moves that will allow the airline to reduce operating costs and pass savings on to passengers while meeting tough environmental targets.

British Airways is preparing to transform the global airline industry by combining lower ticket prices with bold environmental leadership. The UK-based carrier is investing £2.6 billion—approximately \$3.5 billion—into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a move that positions it to underprice competitors in the UK, Switzerland, Norway, and beyond while pushing ahead with its goal to decarbonize air travel.

British Airways has positioned itself for long-term success through this bold investment, gaining a crucial edge over competitors. While many carriers are grappling with the financial burden of soaring sustainable fuel prices, British Airways has proactively secured future-focused supply deals that lock in favorable SAF rates. These agreements insulate the airline from looming cost surges, enabling it to keep fares competitive even as others begin adding extra charges to offset their fuel expenses.

Long known for its premium image and higher ticket prices, British Airways is now reshaping its pricing approach while holding firm on the quality of its service. As sustainable aviation fuel becomes increasingly expensive—costing as much as seven times more than traditional jet fuel—airlines across the industry are being forced to choose between absorbing the financial hit or passing it on to passengers. British Airways, having invested early and strategically in SAF, is uniquely positioned to avoid both options.

British Airways’ move to prioritize sustainable aviation fuel comes at a time when the aviation sector is under mounting pressure to cut carbon emissions. Across the globe, governments are introducing mandates that compel airlines to include a set proportion of SAF in their fuel mix. While this push supports the broader goal of reaching net-zero emissions, it also brings a new challenge—rising operational costs that could make air travel noticeably more expensive.

While other airlines brace for regulatory penalties or announce added fees, British Airways is using its early lead to gain pricing power. By locking in SAF supply well ahead of industry-wide mandates, the airline can offer greener flights without burdening travelers with extra costs. This approach also shields the airline from unpredictable SAF market swings that could destabilize ticket pricing elsewhere.

Several European carriers have already implemented environmental fees in response to SAF pricing challenges. One major airline has imposed a cost surcharge on all flights departing from the EU, UK, Switzerland, and Norway, with fees climbing as high as £60 per ticket depending on route distance. Another operator recently tacked on a £24 fuel surcharge, citing its efforts to meet sustainability targets through SAF integration.

Rather than shifting the financial burden onto its passengers, British Airways has opted to shoulder the initial costs of sustainable aviation fuel itself. By doing so, the airline sets itself apart in a market where many competitors are adding surcharges. This approach allows British Airways to appeal to travelers who are not only budget-conscious but also value eco-friendly choices in how they fly.

The SAF British Airways uses is produced from a wide range of renewable sources, including used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and even forestry residue. This eco-friendly fuel can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to standard jet fuel, making it a critical part of the aviation industry’s climate strategy.

British Airways isn’t just purchasing fuel—it’s shaping the supply chain. The airline was the first to use SAF made at commercial scale in the UK, thanks to a landmark partnership with a domestic fuel refinery. It also actively supports research and development to make SAF more scalable and cost-effective for the entire sector.

With global SAF demand on the rise, British Airways understands that early positioning is key. Airlines that delay adoption will likely face tighter supply, higher procurement costs, and an increasingly competitive marketplace. Those airlines may resort to charging more or cutting services, while early adopters like British Airways will retain flexibility and customer loyalty.

Despite these advantages, British Airways is not immune to broader industry pressures. The global SAF market remains small, with supply bottlenecks and logistical challenges still in play. However, the airline is working to expand access by supporting suppliers, investing in infrastructure, and contributing to cross-sector collaborations that aim to scale SAF production in line with rising demand.

The airline’s larger goal is clear: achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 without sacrificing its customer experience or market competitiveness. That requires more than just cleaner fuel. British Airways is also exploring fuel efficiency technologies, hybrid-electric propulsion, and operational changes that reduce environmental impact.

Still, SAF remains the cornerstone of its decarbonization plan. Unlike carbon offset schemes—which have come under scrutiny—SAF directly reduces the emissions from each flight. That direct impact resonates with climate-conscious travelers and regulators alike.

British Airways also recognizes the importance of making green travel accessible. By offering lower fares while maintaining environmental integrity, the airline removes the financial barrier that often comes with sustainable options. It proves that environmentally friendly choices don’t always need to cost more.

This approach also reflects shifting consumer expectations. More travelers now demand accountability from airlines—not just in comfort and service but in how their flights impact the planet. British Airways is responding to that demand by turning sustainability into a core part of its brand identity.

As the airline pushes forward with its SAF rollout, its strategy stands in sharp contrast to competitors who remain reactive or hesitant. The decision to invest early in SAF wasn’t just about climate—it was about long-term viability in a changing aviation landscape.

British Airways is investing £2.6 billion to offer more affordable and eco-friendly flights across the UK, Switzerland, and Norway by upgrading its fleet, cutting emissions, and boosting fuel efficiency. This move aims to lower operational costs and meet sustainability targets while expanding greener travel options.

British Airways is betting that sustainability and affordability can go hand in hand. If it succeeds, it won’t just redefine its own future—it will challenge the entire airline industry to follow suit. In a world where flying cleaner usually means paying more, British Airways is trying to rewrite the rules—and passengers may be the biggest winners.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-06-01T144833230.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 07:56:20.922543

India, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, is at the heart of this collaboration. By linking IndiGo’s extensive domestic network with Delta’s strength in North America and the transatlantic, the extensive reach of Air France-KLM in Europe and North America, and the U.K. and transatlantic presence of Virgin Atlantic, the partnership is poised to offer travelers broader access, smoother journeys, and a more consistent experience across continents. Linking dozens of cities in the United States, Canada, Europe and India, the airlines aim to meet rising demand for international travel while setting new standards for connectivity and cooperation in global aviation.

Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo, said: “IndiGo has embarked on an ambitious journey to become a global airline by 2030. This partnership represents another important milestone to pursue commercial synergies, operational excellence and innovation. This announcement not only expands our relationship with Air France–KLM and Virgin Atlantic but also marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter as we welcome Delta Air Lines as a valued partner. We are particularly excited to start our long-haul expansion from this Summer and connect with our partners’ networks to provide greater access to Europe and North America. This strategic partnership enables a compelling combined customer proposition in the form of comprehensive intercontinental connectivity, seamless experience and great loyalty value. It also lays the groundwork for us to exchange best practices in areas of technology, operational excellence and service delivery.”

Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, said: “This agreement is another example of our commitment to making travel more connected, more inclusive and more accessible. Combining our strengths with those of IndiGo, Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic, will enable us to offer unparalleled connectivity and convenience, ensuring that our customers enjoy the highest standards of service and reliability across the globe. We look forward to restarting Delta’s direct service from the U.S. to India in the near future.”

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, said: “We are very glad to extend our existing partnership with IndiGo and to do so alongside our partners Delta and Virgin Atlantic. India is a strategic market for Air France-KLM, where we have a strong and historic presence soon to increase. We look forward to welcoming IndiGo customers on our flights and to play an active role in the country’s connectivity.”

Shai Weiss, CEO of Virgin Atlantic, said: “In our 25th year of flying to India, we’re delighted to build on our Joint Venture with Delta and Air France-KLM, and our successful codeshare with IndiGo, by going further with this partnership. As IndiGo starts long haul operations, we’ll connect four of the world’s largest economies, enhancing the travel experience for our guests, from greater connectivity and optimized flight times to loyalty benefits.”

Connecting Route Networks, 2022 and Beyond

IndiGo has had partnerships with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic and with Air France-KLM since 2022. Since then, Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic customers have had access to more than 30 IndiGo points in India.

More recently, IndiGo announced the start of service to Europe, which, in addition to expanding the existing partnership with Air France-KLM and Virgin Atlantic transatlantic flights, facilitates a new partnership opportunity between IndiGo and Delta, enabling Indigo’s customers to connect to Delta’s broad transatlantic network. After commercial contracts and regulatory procedures are completed to allow IndiGo to sell partner flights as its own under its own 6E* marketing codes, IndiGo customers will be able to book onward travel on select flights operated by its international partners, making it easier to reach destinations across Europe and North America. These include:

KLM flights from Amsterdam to 30 points within Europe

Delta and KLM flights from Amsterdam to the United States and Canada

Virgin Atlantic flights from Manchester to the United States

For its part, KLM’s recently announced new route connecting Amsterdam with Hyderabad offers further opportunity for cooperation with IndiGo. With the route’s launch in September 2025, Air France-KLM will begin selling IndiGo flights to 24 destinations beyond Hyderabad.

IndiGo has previously announced that it will enhance its fleet of damp leased B787 to six aircraft later this year and has in place a long-term firm order of 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft, with options for 70 more. As these aircraft join IndiGo’s fleet, the airline’s long-haul expansion will enable further and deeper cooperation between IndiGo and Delta, Air France-KLM, and Virgin Atlantic in the future.

Delta, meanwhile, plans to resume services to India with nonstop flights between Atlanta and Delhi, subject to government approval. The service start date will be announced later.

Empreendedoras enfrentam desafios para acesso ao crédito

Apesar de representarem quase metade dos novos empreendedores, as mulheres ainda recebem apenas 29,4% dos recursos de crédito, segundo dados do Serviço Brasileiro de Apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas (Sebrae). A presidente do Conselho da Mulher Empreendedora e da Cultura (CMEC), Ana Claudia Badra Cotait, alerta para a desigualdade no sistema financeiro, que impõe juros mais altos e exige garantias que muitas não possuem. Programas como o Acredita Delas e iniciativas de cooperativas, como Sicredi e Cresol, buscam mudar esse cenário com linhas exclusivas e apoio técnico.

Southwest Airlines (WN) is undergoing a strategic transformation while holding firm to its core strengths.

A highly efficient domestic network, cost control, and exceptional employee-driven service. CEO Bob Jordan highlighted the airline’s financial pressure, especially in comparison to past industry-leading profitability.

To adapt, the airline is exploring additional revenue sources long embraced by competitors, such as baggage fees and seating options.

A major strategic shift is the introduction of assigned seating, marking a significant change for the carrier traditionally known for open seating.

This move, according to Jordan, aligns with modern passenger expectations. The airline aims to offer more personalized services and travel experiences, acknowledging that passengers fly for diverse reasons and increasingly expect flexibility and options.

Southwest’s new phase includes expanded international connectivity.

Through a partnership with Icelandair, customers can book transatlantic journeys with seamless links between Southwest’s US cities, Baltimore (BWI), Denver (DEN), and Nashville (BNA), and Icelandair’s European destinations.

More expansion is anticipated as the airline seeks to build a more globally connected route structure.

Confidence in Boeing

Despite Southwest’s fleet being entirely made up of Boeing 737 aircraft, Jordan dismissed concerns about supplier risk.

Instead, he expressed confidence in Boeing’s recent progress, noting visible factory improvements and stronger leadership floor relations.

While acknowledging past supply chain issues, Jordan believes Boeing is now on a more stable path and will fulfill Southwest’s upcoming aircraft orders.

Commitment to Modernization

Jordan welcomed federal plans to modernize US airspace infrastructure, describing current systems as outdated and restrictive.

He emphasized that no industry can scale efficiently using decades-old technology.

Encouragingly, the current administration’s prioritization of airspace reform, with committed funding and leadership, is seen as a pivotal step forward.

Regulatory collaboration is another area of focus. While consumer protection remains paramount, Jordan advocates for balanced regulations that benefit both travelers and businesses.

Constructive engagement between the Department of Transportation and airlines can, he says, lead to improved outcomes for all stakeholders.

Operational Efficiency

Southwest is doubling down on sustainability, with a clear strategy to integrate more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The airline backs government subsidies to scale SAF production, noting its current cost, three times that of conventional fuel, as the main barrier.

Airlines are eager to adopt SAF, but producers need long-term assurance to commit capital for development.

Beyond SAF, Southwest’s move to a full Boeing 737 MAX fleet is central to its emissions reduction strategy.

These newer aircraft offer major gains in fuel efficiency. Complementing the fleet upgrade are AI-driven innovations to optimize ground routing, gate assignments, and aircraft turnaround time, drastically improving operational efficiency and reducing carbon output.

Industry Opportunities

Southwest is adapting to new retailing models such as Offers and Orders, which focus on what customers actually want to buy rather than outdated sales processes.

This shift allows the airline to meet passenger expectations with greater clarity and flexibility.

On the broader industry front, Jordan sees both challenges and opportunities, from supply chain issues to economic headwinds.

Yet, he remains optimistic, citing the aviation sector’s proven resilience. Southwest, in particular, is targeting $1 billion in cost savings as part of a long-term efficiency drive, positioning itself to thrive regardless of external pressures.

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to independently develop bio-jet fuel technology. This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions by about 80%, compared with conventional jet fuel.

What is SAF?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

Adoption of SAF from the Chinese Mainland

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Last year, Cathay Pacific also adopted two batches of SAF from the Chinese Mainland, which were uplifted at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow Airport respectively.

Looking to the future

In recent years, the production and adoption of SAF has gained momentum across Asia. Cathay Pacific is working closely with different partners with the aim to expand the use of SAF in Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific reached an agreement with fuel supplier SK Energy, which will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific from 2025 to 2027 in South Korea. At the same time, Cathay Pacific will continue to draw on its own experience to support Hong Kong to scale up SAF usage with supportive policy, in order to further strengthen Hong Kong International Airport’s status as a leading international aviation hub.",https://pimwp.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/2025/05/bOb7kVNu-Madhuri-PIM-Template.png,N,,2025-06-01 06:56:38.024627

By being an early adopter of SAF and securing long-term fuel agreements, the airline aims to reduce costs while maintaining its commitment to sustainability. As other airlines struggle with rising SAF prices and environmental surcharges, British Airways’ strategy gives it a unique edge, positioning the carrier to deliver affordable and eco-friendly flights to passengers across its network.

British Airways, the UK’s flag carrier, has long been recognized for its premium services and extensive route network, often making it a more expensive option compared to low-cost airlines. However, this price gap may soon shrink, driven by a significant £2.6 billion (\$3.5 billion) investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With this strategic shift, British Airways is poised to undercut its rivals and deliver more competitive pricing to its passengers while continuing to prioritize sustainability.

As an early adopter and major advocate for SAF, British Airways is working toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The airline has made significant strides in using SAF produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, woody biomass, waste tyres, and agricultural byproducts like orchard and forestry waste. These eco-friendly fuels are expected to play a crucial role in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint, a sector traditionally reliant on fossil fuels.

British Airways is leading the way in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), establishing a pioneering benchmark for the entire airline industry. It became the first airline in the world to utilize SAF produced at a commercial scale in the UK, thanks to a groundbreaking multi-year partnership with Phillips 66. This commitment to SAF is in line with the broader industry trend of decarbonization, where airlines are seeking more sustainable options for jet fuel in the face of growing environmental concerns.

The move to SAF is part of a broader effort within the airline industry to reduce carbon emissions. Governments across the globe have started to impose mandates requiring airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF in their fuel mix. The transition to SAF is expected to have far-reaching implications, particularly in terms of cost. Currently, SAF can be up to seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, and as these mandates become stricter, the price of SAF is expected to increase. This price increase could lead to higher ticket prices across the board as airlines pass on the costs to passengers.

In anticipation of the rising cost of sustainable fuel, several airlines, including Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, have already implemented surcharges to offset the added expenses of SAF. Lufthansa, Germany’s flagship carrier, has introduced an environmental cost surcharge on all tickets for flights originating from the 27 EU countries, as well as from the UK, Norway, and Switzerland. This surcharge varies based on the route, with prices ranging from 84p (€1) to £60.70 (€72). Similarly, Virgin Atlantic has added a £24 surcharge, aiming to cover the rising costs associated with using SAF in its fleet. The airline’s CEO has also warned that a return flight between London and New York could cost £40 more per passenger as SAF usage becomes more widespread.

However, British Airways is working hard to mitigate the impact of these rising costs on its passengers. By being an early adopter of SAF, the airline has secured long-term contracts that allow it to lock in SAF prices at a lower rate than what is projected for the open market. This strategic move not only positions British Airways as a leader in sustainability but also gives the airline an edge when it comes to pricing. While other carriers are forced to introduce surcharges and hike ticket prices, British Airways may be able to shield its customers from the worst of the price increases associated with the transition to green fuel.

British Airways is betting on SAF to be a key driver in making air travel more sustainable while keeping its pricing competitive. The airline’s early adoption and strategic partnerships with fuel suppliers put it in a favorable position, ensuring that it can offer customers a relatively affordable way to fly while remaining committed to decarbonization goals. The airline’s efforts to push the boundaries of sustainability are a part of a broader shift within the aviation industry, where more companies are taking responsibility for reducing their environmental impact.

The rising cost of SAF, however, does come with challenges. While British Airways may have an advantage in securing discounted fuel prices, the overall industry is likely to see rising fares as SAF becomes more integrated into the aviation sector. The introduction of additional environmental surcharges, like those seen with Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, could become more widespread as airlines pass on the increased costs to passengers.

Despite these challenges, British Airways is working to balance the cost implications with its sustainability goals. The airline’s commitment to SAF and its investment in green fuel technology demonstrate its dedication to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 while remaining competitive in a rapidly changing market. British Airways’ move to outpace its competitors in providing sustainable air travel demonstrates that environmental responsibility can go hand in hand with affordable pricing.

British Airways is set to disrupt the airline industry with its £2.6 billion investment in sustainable aviation fuel, enabling it to offer significantly lower fares than its competitors in the UK, Switzerland, and Norway. This strategic move positions the airline to lead in both affordability and sustainability.

As the demand for greener aviation practices continues to grow, British Airways is setting an example for how airlines can reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing quality or affordability. By making bold moves in sustainable fuel adoption, the airline is not only contributing to the fight against climate change but also positioning itself as a leader in the future of air travel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/British-Airways-3-1-850x567-1-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 04:56:11.641061

First Batch at Hong Kong International Airport

The first batch of SAF to leave Hong Kong International Airport was produced by Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) and was uplifted in April of this year. Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company is a key producer of SAF in Asia and is at the forefront of independently manufacturing bio-jet fuel technology.

The initial batch from Hong Kong International Airport was produced from used cooking oil through a process known as HEFA (meaning using hydrotreated esters and fatty acids), and was also recognised by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) as being able to decrease the lifecycle carbon emissions by around 80%, compared to the standard conventional jet fuel.

Last year, two batches were uplifted by Cathay Pacific at Amsterdam Airport Schipol and London Heathrow Airport.

What is SAF?

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) is a sustainable substitute fuel made from waste materials and other renewable carbon sources. Cathay Pacific has shown that SAF can hugely decrease carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, therefore helping to address the environmental impact that the aviation industry currently has. The cooperation between Cathay Pacific and Sinopec shows the capacity for further collaboration between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability, Grace Cheung, said:

“Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Future Prospects

SAF production and adoption has increased across Asia in recent years, Cathay Pacific is working with different partners to expand the use of SAF across the continent. In March of this year, the airline reached an agreement with a fuel supplier SK Energy, who will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific for 2 years, from 2025 to 2027, in South Korea. Simultaneously, the airline will continue to make use of their experience and knowledge to support Hong Kong scale up its usage with a supportive police to help strengthen Hong Kong International Airport’s status as a leading aviation hub.

This is not Cathay Pacific’s first step towards sustainability as they revealed their 2024 sustainability achievements earlier this year, with a 15% increase in fuel efficiently, and a 20% reduction of onboard waste.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duc-Van-Photo-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 22:56:14.722291

Introduction: The Challenge of Air Freight Emissions

As global trade continues to expand, the logistics industry faces a significant challenge: reducing the environmental impact of air freight. Air transportation, while crucial for rapid global delivery, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. On average, fossil-fueled air freight produces 50 to 150 times more CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per ton-kilometer than ocean freight and 5 to 6 times more than land freight. With aircraft fuel demand expected to double by 2050, it’s clear that we need innovative solutions to address this growing environmental concern.

At FreightAmigo, we recognize the urgent need for sustainable logistics practices. As a digital supply chain finance platform, we’re committed to helping organizations, enterprises, and individuals transform their logistics experiences while prioritizing environmental responsibility. In this article, we’ll explore how Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is revolutionizing the air freight industry and how FreightAmigo is supporting this crucial transition.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a game-changing alternative to conventional jet fuel. It’s derived from sustainable sources such as waste fats, oils, greases, agricultural and forestry residues, and even innovative processes that capture carbon directly from the air. The key advantage of SAF is its ability to significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels.

Here are some crucial facts about SAF:

SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by 70-95% compared to conventional jet fuel.

It can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in current aircraft engines without modifications.

SAF creates a closed carbon cycle, as the CO2 absorbed by the plants used to produce it is roughly equivalent to the CO2e emitted when the fuel is burned.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that SAF will be the most widely-used method for decarbonization in the aviation industry by 2050.

The Environmental Impact of SAF

The adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents a significant step towards reducing the carbon footprint of the logistics industry. By choosing to ship goods with SAF, companies can effectively lower their Scope 3 emissions, which refer to indirect greenhouse gas emissions occurring throughout a company’s value chain.

To understand the impact, it’s essential to consider the different scopes of emissions:

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from an organization’s own operations (e.g., fuel combustion in company-owned vehicles)

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions related to purchased electricity, heating, or cooling

Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect emissions in a company’s value chain, both upstream and downstream

For logistics companies, air transportation emissions typically fall under Scope 3. By utilizing SAF, we can help our clients significantly reduce these indirect emissions, contributing to their overall sustainability goals.

Wizz Air made headlines recently by signing a major deal to purchase sustainable aviation fuel derived from treated human poop. The optics are amusing, but the implications are profound. This isn’t a fringe experiment or a corporate PR stunt. It’s a signal that the aviation industry is moving toward a serious decarbonization strategy grounded in real chemistry, real feedstocks, and real-world constraints. The decision to bet on SAF from municipal waste not only speaks volumes about what airlines think is possible, it also helps dismantle five of the most persistent misconceptions still infecting energy and climate discourse.

The first incorrect assumption is the idea that we are going to need vastly more liquid fuels than we do today. This belief underpins a surprising number of energy transition scenarios, especially those that downplay electrification or assume a strongly increasing demand curve for jet fuel, diesel, and bunker fuel decades into the future. But the numbers don’t support it. Global oil demand for transport is peaking or has already peaked, and all signs point to a rapid contraction over the next 25 years.

In my own modeling, published over the past several years, I’ve projected a scenario where 100% of ground transportation is electrified—cars, buses, trucks, rail, two- and three-wheelers. In that world, the demand for liquid fuels drops by over 80%, and what’s left is concentrated in the hard-to-electrify sectors: long-haul aviation and deep-sea shipping. Aviation fuel demand does grow modestly through 2050 under my model, which is more pessimistic and I think realistic about growth, but hybrid electric regional turboprops take over shorter hops of up to 1,000 km as battery energy densities climb. My projection is for only 110 million tons of liquid fuels required for aviation.

Maritime shipping fuel demand, meanwhile, shrinks dramatically as bulk fossil fuel and iron ore shipments decline. Oil, coal, and LNG shipping collectively represent about 40% of tonnage today, raw iron ore is another 15%, and all four are in structural decline. By the end of the century, I project annual liquid fuel demand for marine shipping is likely to be in the 70 million tons of diesel equivalent range globally. That’s less than a third of today’s shipping fuel volume, and with reductions in aviation fuel demand due to electrification, high-speed rail and other factors, we’re looking at a future where the total global need for liquid fuels might be one-tenth of what it is today.

The second misconception that refuses to die is the notion that biofuels can only come from prime agricultural land. This fear traces back to first-generation biofuels—corn ethanol, soy biodiesel, palm oil—where concerns, some legitimate if overstated, about land use, food prices, and deforestation emerged. But that legacy doesn’t reflect the reality of advanced biofuel production today. The Wizz Air deal is a perfect example. Biosolids—essentially the residual organic matter left over from wastewater treatment—are abundant, underutilized, and pose a methane emissions risk if unmanaged. Converting them to SAF doesn’t displace food crops or use new land. Instead, it turns a municipal waste liability into a high-value, low-carbon product.

And biosolids are just one category. In my comprehensive assessment of viable biofuel pathways, I catalogued at least ten scalable options that rely entirely on waste and non-food biomass: municipal solid waste, forestry residues, agricultural byproducts like corn stover and wheat straw, animal manure, and even landfill gas. The global supply of these materials is vast. The world wastes approximately 2.5 billion tons of food annually. Europe alone generates over 1.5 billion tons of livestock manure per year. At a conservative yield of 0.4 tons of fuel per ton of dried biomass, the waste streams we’re currently mismanaging could supply well over 500 million tons of low-carbon fuel annually. That’s more than enough to meet the residual liquid fuel demand in a maximally electrified transport system. No new farmland required. No tradeoff between food and fuel. Just a redirection of waste into the energy system.

The third false belief is that renewable electricity will become effectively free, enabling a cascade of ultra-cheap electrochemical pathways to dominate. This misconception stems from the marginal cost argument: since wind and solar have no fuel cost, they must eventually drive electricity prices to zero part of the time. It’s true that the marginal cost of generation is low. But the system cost of delivering firm, reliable, high-quality electricity is not. In high-renewables grids like California or South Australia, we do see negative pricing events during solar peaks. But these are short-duration, location-specific artifacts of a misaligned supply-demand curve.

To actually power a process like hydrogen electrolysis or synthetic fuel synthesis economically, you need high-capacity-factor electricity, 60% or more. If you’re relying only on intermittent surplus, your electrolyzers or synthesis reactors are sitting idle most of the time, and your capital costs explode. I’ve run the numbers in multiple regions, and the story is consistent: surplus renewable electricity is not free when you need it at scale, and its temporal distribution makes it unsuitable as the backbone of any major fuel production system. California’s duck curve is not a business model.

This brings us to the fourth fantasy: that green hydrogen will be cheap. It won’t. Hydrogen is a valuable industrial input for very specific contexts—ammonia production, petrochemical refining and perhaps steelmaking. But as a general-purpose energy substitute, it fails the physics and the economics. Electrolyzers are expensive, and their cost per kilogram of hydrogen is highly sensitive to utilization. Hydrogen is expensive to compress, store and distribute.

In transportation, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have a total cost of ownership roughly 2 to 3 times that of battery electric equivalents. I’ve documented multiple real-world cases where hydrogen trucks, buses and other vehicles failed on economics alone, let alone the infrastructure challenges. In energy terms, green hydrogen multiplies the upstream electricity demand by a factor of 3 compared to direct electrification. Every kilowatt-hour routed through an electrolyzer, then compressed, stored, and run through a fuel cell ends up delivering a fraction of the useful energy that a battery does.

That’s playing out now, as every organization that created fantastical projections of cheap green hydrogen adjusts their cost projections to fit the realities that were obvious when they first made them five to ten years ago. BNEF, CSIRO, LUT and more are all finally realizing that their numbers are bogus, but only BNEF has so far had the guts to triple its electrolyzer cost projections for 2050, with the rest only nudging costs up every year since 2020’s projections. Contacts tell me that the IEA gave the task of doing the first projections to an intern, and I find that credible. This wasn’t intentional disinformation, by the way, this was technoeconomic incompetence combined with cognitive biases. It remains indefensible in my eyes, however. Billions of dollars and years of time have been wasted, and more money and time that could be spent on actual climate solutions continue to be thrown at the space.

The reality is that hydrogen is an industrial feedstock that will see significant declines in demand from current levels as 40% of current use is for petroleum refining. Another 30% is used for ammonia, which is also going to see declines as its price increases and agrigenetic nitrogen fixing, precision agriculture, drone spraying and other levers displace its current overuse.

The final myth that needs to be retired is the idea that synthetic fuels—those created from green hydrogen and captured CO₂—will be cheaper than biofuels, perhaps even as cheap as fossil fuels. This one gets a lot of airtime in e-fuel hype circles, particularly in Europe where policy compromises have allowed synthetic fuels to keep internal combustion engines on life support past 2035. But the thermodynamics are unforgiving. Making a synthetic hydrocarbon fuel requires enormous amounts of electricity: to make hydrogen, to capture and purify CO₂, and to run the synthesis process itself. The round-trip efficiency is dreadful—somewhere between 10% and 15% from grid electricity to motion when burned in an engine. That means you’re spending five to seven times more electricity per kilometer than you would with a battery electric vehicle. And that electricity isn’t free, as we’ve established.

Today, synthetic jet fuel costs between $5 and $10 per gallon in pilot quantities. Bio-based SAF, by contrast, is already being produced at commercial scale for $2 to $4 per gallon from used cooking oil, tallow, and now, biosolids. Even as e-fuel technology improves, the gap will persist. Airlines aren’t ideologues, they’ll buy the cheapest low-carbon fuel that meets ASTM specs and avoids reputational risk. Right now, and likely forever, that’s biofuel. Wizz Air knows this. That’s why they’re locking in biosolid-derived SAF, not hydrogen-derived e-kerosene.

Biofuels are always going to be two to three times more expensive than fossil fuels if we let the atmosphere be used as a free sewer, but synthetic fuels will be four to six times as expensive. As a result, no synthetic fuels.

The reality is simpler and more elegant than the myths. We will electrify everything we can—cars, trucks, buses, rail, ferries, short-hop planes—and we will use sustainable biofuels made mostly from waste biomass streams for what we can’t electrify yet. That residual demand is modest, and we have the feedstocks to meet it without touching a single hectare of food-producing land. We will grow a bunch of soy beans and similar things for biofuels simply because we have lots of agricultural land. There’s no shortage or competition for food, as evidenced by us throwing away a full third of the calories we manufacture annually.

These movements have unlocked a 40% discount to market prices.

Governments are now setting mandates for airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF to reduce their carbon emissions. Net-zero targets are highly likely to increase fares over the next couple of years as the price of SAF can be two to seven times more expensive than traditional kerosene.

This higher cost is primarily due to the current technology and feedstock costs. The EU SAF blending quota starts at 2% from 2025, 6% from 2030, 20% from 2035 and 70% from 2050.

While SAF's price is expected to decrease as production scales and supply increases, it remains a significant challenge for airlines, many of whom are already rolling out additional costs.

As global trade continues to expand, the air freight industry faces a significant challenge: reducing its environmental impact. Recent data shows that fossil-fueled air freight produces 50 to 150 times more CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per ton-kilometer than ocean freight and 5 to 6 times more than land freight. With aircraft fuel demand expected to double by 2050, it’s clear that we need innovative solutions to address this growing concern.

At FreightAmigo, we recognize the urgency of this issue and are committed to leading the charge towards sustainable logistics. In this article, we’ll explore how Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is emerging as a game-changing solution for reducing air freight emissions and how our Digital Logistics Platform is supporting businesses in their journey towards greener supply chains.

Understanding Scope 3 Emissions in Air Freight

Before diving into the solutions, it’s crucial to understand the concept of Scope 3 emissions in the context of air freight:

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (e.g., fuel combustion in company-owned aircraft)

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy

Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain

For most businesses using air freight services, the emissions associated with their shipments fall under Scope 3. These indirect emissions are often the largest source of a company’s carbon footprint and can be challenging to measure and reduce. However, addressing Scope 3 emissions is becoming increasingly important as stakeholders demand greater environmental responsibility from businesses across all industries.

The Promise of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a leading solution for reducing air freight emissions. Here’s why SAF is generating so much excitement in the logistics industry:

What is SAF?

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel but with a significantly lower carbon footprint. SAF can be produced from a variety of sustainable sources, including:

Waste fats, oils, and greases

Agricultural and forestry residues

Municipal solid waste

Carbon captured directly from the air

The Environmental Impact of SAF

The potential environmental benefits of SAF are substantial:

Lifecycle carbon emissions reduction of 70-95% compared to traditional fossil fuels

Creates a closed carbon cycle, as the CO2 absorbed by plants during growth is roughly equivalent to the CO2e emitted when the fuel is burned

Can be used as a drop-in solution, requiring no modifications to existing aircraft engines

The Role of SAF in Decarbonization

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF is expected to be the most widely-used method for decarbonization in the aviation industry by 2050. This underscores the importance of investing in and developing SAF technologies to achieve long-term sustainability goals in air freight.

FreightAmigo’s Commitment to Sustainable Logistics

As a Digital Logistics Platform committed to transforming the logistics industry, FreightAmigo is at the forefront of integrating sustainable solutions like SAF into our service offerings. Here’s how we’re supporting our clients in their sustainability journey:

1. Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Analysis

Our Digital Logistics Platform provides detailed insights into the carbon footprint of each shipment, allowing businesses to make informed decisions about their freight options. By clearly displaying the CO2e emissions associated with different transport modes, we empower our clients to choose the most environmentally friendly option for their needs.

2. SAF Integration

We’re working with airlines and fuel suppliers to integrate SAF options into our platform, making it easy for clients to opt for more sustainable air freight solutions. This includes:

Providing transparent information on SAF availability and pricing

Offering flexible options for incorporating SAF into shipments, such as carbon offset programs or direct SAF purchases

Facilitating the necessary documentation and certifications for SAF usage

3. Environmental Attribute System

Similar to the concept introduced by other logistics providers, FreightAmigo is developing an Environmental Attribute System to simplify the use of SAF for our clients. This system will allow businesses to purchase SAF credits or attributes, ensuring that an equivalent amount of SAF is used in the aviation fuel supply chain, even if it’s not directly used for their specific shipment.

4. Customizable Sustainability Programs

We understand that every business has unique sustainability goals and requirements. That’s why we’re developing customizable programs that allow clients to choose their preferred level of SAF usage or CO2e reduction for their shipments. These programs will be flexible enough to accommodate various budgets and sustainability targets.

5. Comprehensive Reporting and Analytics

Our Digital Logistics Platform provides detailed reports on SAF usage and emissions reductions, helping businesses track their progress towards sustainability goals and comply with reporting requirements. These analytics can be invaluable for companies looking to improve their environmental performance and communicate their efforts to stakeholders.

The Future of Sustainable Air Freight

While SAF represents a significant step forward in reducing air freight emissions, it’s just one part of a broader sustainability strategy. As we look to the future, several trends and developments are shaping the landscape of sustainable air freight:

1. Increased SAF Production and Availability

As demand for SAF grows, we can expect to see increased investment in production facilities and technologies. This will likely lead to greater availability and potentially lower costs for SAF in the coming years.

2. Advancements in Aircraft Technology

Alongside SAF development, aircraft manufacturers are working on more fuel-efficient designs and exploring alternative propulsion systems, such as electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft for short-haul flights.

3. Optimization of Air Freight Operations

Digital Logistics Platforms like FreightAmigo are enabling more efficient routing, load consolidation, and capacity utilization, further reducing the overall environmental impact of air freight.

4. Regulatory Support and Incentives

Governments and international organizations are likely to introduce more regulations and incentives to promote the use of SAF and other sustainable aviation practices.

5. Collaboration Across the Supply Chain

Achieving significant emissions reductions in air freight will require collaboration between shippers, freight forwarders, airlines, and fuel producers. Platforms that facilitate this collaboration will play a crucial role in driving industry-wide sustainability efforts.",https://www.freightamigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/new-icon-1.png,N,,2025-05-31 19:56:26.458231
