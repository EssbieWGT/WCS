The investment includes conditional purchase agreement to order up to 100 airplanes, based on JetZero achieving development milestones including flight of a full-scale demonstrator in 2027, as well as an option for an additional 100 planes.

Founded in 2021, California-based JetZero is designing a plane that integrates the wings and fuselage into a single smooth shape, reducing aerodynamic drag, and leading to lower fuel needs, emissions and operating costs. The aircraft will be compatible with sustainable aviation fuel and can also provide benefits including an enhanced passenger experience with larger seats and wider aisles, while also being expected to integrate easily into current airport infrastructure.

JetZero announced a $235 million contract with the US Air Force in 2023 to fast-track the development of JetZero’s full scale demonstrator, with the agreement focused on advancing airframe technology and capabilities, showcasing its potential, and providing the Department of Defense and commercial industry more options to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Over the past few months, the company has also announced investments and partnerships with airlines including Delta and Alaska Airlines.

JetZero CEO and co-founder Tom O’Leary said:

“United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe. JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”

United has set a goal to fully reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on carbon offsets. The investment was made through its corporate venture capital fund, United Airlines Ventures (UAV), which targets investments in companies developing technologies with the potential to revolutionize aerospace developments, create value for customers and United’s operation and complement the airline’s net zero emissions goal.

This resulting sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes flying now without modifications, making it one of the highest-impact near-term strategies to cut emissions from the aviation sector.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%.
According to Hunter, camelina can reduce soil erosion by up to 80% and nitrate leaching by up to 90%.
“Minnesota is lucky to have partnerships across governments, businesses, academic institutions, and nonprofits that are driving Minnesota forward as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel.”","Camelina is what’s considered an ancient crop, one that Europeans cultivated thousands of years ago. It’s also considered an orphan crop, displaced by other more successful oilseeds like canola. With a $75,000 grant from the MPCA, however, the University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative intends to make it a crop of the future that will help Minnesota develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry.

“Minnesota has the right reasons to lead on sustainable aviation fuel: a track record of environmental leadership, smart tax incentives, and a strong infrastructure,” said MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler, chair of the Governor’s Climate Change Subcabinet. “The MPCA is proud to invest in research that will help Minnesota grow a sustainable aviation fuel industry on our own soil from the ground up.”

Growing interest in growing camelina

One of over 15 crops the Forever Green Initiative is developing — and one of dozens of potential sources of sustainable aviation fuel — winter camelina has already generated a good deal of interest among Minnesota’s farmers for two big reasons, according to Mitch Hunter, the co-director of the initiative.

One, its tiny seeds produce a relatively high amount of an oil that can be crushed into cooking oil or further refined and blended to create jet fuel. This resulting sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes flying now without modifications, making it one of the highest-impact near-term strategies to cut emissions from the aviation sector. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%.

Two, because it’s planted in the fall and harvested in the spring, hardy winter camelina makes for an excellent cover crop, one that provides farmers another source of revenue to supplement their income while protecting soil health and water quality. According to Hunter, camelina can reduce soil erosion by up to 80% and nitrate leaching by up to 90%.

As if all that weren’t enough, camelina blooms early in the spring, Hunter said, making it a resource for pollinators just waking up from their winter naps.

Camelina is on the first leg of its commercialization journey in Minnesota and the wider region.

“Farmers are already getting bags of seed and selling crops,” Hunter said. On-farm pilots of camelina have grown rapidly since the first was planted in 2021 — up to about 5,000 acres this year — and the first commercial flight fueled in part by camelina grown in Minnesota flew from MSP to La Guardia last September.

There’s still work to do before camelina takes off as a “cash cover crop,” as Hunter put it. He said if farmers across the region grow at least 1 million acres of camelina by 2035, the crop should have a steady flight path. To reach that goal, though, the Forever Green Initiative will need to “pull out all the stops” in terms of continued research, education and outreach, figuring out risk management for the crop, determining supply chain needs and regulatory barriers, and building market demand.

The MPCA grant will help the initiative create what Hunter called a “road map” to get to that million-acre goal.

“We are grateful that the State of Minnesota sees the potential of winter camelina to simultaneously help our farmers, environment, economy, and climate,"" Hunter said. “Minnesota is lucky to have partnerships across governments, businesses, academic institutions, and nonprofits that are driving Minnesota forward as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/MPCASAF_1_7a575225ec.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 10:56:37.324034

JetZero's Z4 aircraft features an ""all wing"" design that reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan. The company claims this could lead to as much as 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger mile compared to similarly sized conventional aircraft.

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, explains the strategic importance of the investment: ""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.""

The Z4 is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel, with propulsion systems compatible with sustainable aviation fuel blends. JetZero recently received substantial backing from the US military, with the US Air Force awarding the company a US$235 million contract to accelerate development of its commercial demonstrator.

""United's investment in our company signals the industry's belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,"" says Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero.

Beyond fuel efficiency, the aircraft's unique design could potentially enhance the passenger experience with flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes, and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat. The company also claims the wider main boarding door could streamline the boarding process by leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution.

In one example highlighted by the companies, a flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain would use up to 45% less fuel compared to twin-aisle aircraft currently operating that route.

The aircraft is expected to integrate with existing airport infrastructure without requiring modifications to jet bridges, runways or taxiways - potentially reducing barriers to adoption by airlines.

United Airlines Ventures, the airline's corporate venture capital fund, has made several investments in alternative aircraft technologies, including hybrid-electric, hydrogen-powered, and electric air taxis, as part of its strategy to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

The U.S. Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aims to expand SAF production to 35 billion gallons by 2050, and switchgrass could contribute significantly.

Researchers tested three modern energy cultivars—Independence, Liberty, and Carthage—against two forage types across Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Independence and Liberty showed the best profits, depending on location and fertilizer rates. Notably, switchgrass required much less nitrogen fertilizer compared to corn.

Postdoctoral researcher Muhammad Umer Arshad highlighted that energy-type switchgrass can bring returns within two years, making marginal lands profitable. Another study led by Nictor Namoi found that switchgrass reduced nitrate leaching by 80% and nitrous oxide emissions compared to continuous corn fields.

Interestingly, carbon dioxide emissions were initially higher in switchgrass because of more root biomass. However, this also indicates greater long-term carbon storage. The perennial nature of switchgrass boosts soil health and offers strong ecosystem services.",,N,,2025-04-25 10:57:02.597981

The proposed location for the project is the Royal Port of Barrow for which Associated British Ports (ABP) announced a development masterplan to create an advanced engineering cluster.

GRAMM's SAF cuts carbon emissions fourfold beyond the UK requirements.

That enables the project to deliver 53.5 per cent of the UK's 2035 SAF target and create 850 jobs, according to GRAMM.

Alexander Peschkoff, GRAMM consortium lead, said: ""Advanced Fuels Fund support will propel UK sustainable aviation forward.

""Meeting a significant part of the UK aviation sector's net zero obligations will establish GRAMM as a leading sustainable aviation fuel producer.

""This project also proves that decarbonisation can tackle climate challenges while driving regional economic growth.""

Regional support for the project has been robus with assistance from the North West Net Zero Hub, a regional programme dedicated to promoting investment in energy projects, Net Zero North West (NZNW), an industry-led collaboration driving industrial decarbonisation across the North West, and Enterprising Cumbria, the newly-established body working to boost economic development throughout Cumbria county.

With electricity demand expected to surge, fueled by artificial intelligence, data centers, and domestic manufacturing, Minnesota is showing how to meet that challenge with a reliable, affordable, and resilient clean energy system.

A foundation built on performance, not promises

For the fifth year in a row, more than half of Minnesota’s electricity came from zero-carbon sources, including renewables and nuclear, well above the national average of 42%. In 2024, zero-carbon sources made up 53% of Minnesota’s energy mix. In 2024, coal generation declined to an all-time low of 20% of Minnesota’s energy mix and is being displaced by increased generation from natural gas and renewables.

These results aren’t the result of ideology. It results from sustained, smart policies and investments delivering real-world benefits. Carbon emissions from the state’s power sector fell another 4% last year, putting us 52% below 2005 levels, far ahead of the U.S. average reduction of 38%.

Clean energy and economic growth aren’t at odds in Minnesota; they work together.

Strengthening energy independence and security

As the country experiences disrupted supply chains and transitions to an America-first mentality, Minnesota is reducing its reliance on out-of-state electricity. In 2024, only 11% of the state’s electricity came from imports, down from 13% the year prior. That means more energy is produced and consumed at home, keeping dollars circulating in local economies, mitigating geopolitical risks, and improving the efficiency of our electricity grid.

This progress comes as the country braces for unprecedented growth in electricity demand. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, U.S. demand could rise by 35% to 50% by 2040. Meeting that growth will require every available energy solution. Minnesota is already proving what works.

Renewables are rising — and they’re reliable

One-third of Minnesota’s electricity came from renewable sources last year. The state added 388 megawatts of solar capacity, a 35% increase over 2023. Over the past five years, 99% of new power generation in Minnesota has come from renewable sources. These additions are low-cost, flexible, and the quickest to deploy.

National trends echo this momentum. In 2024, U.S. companies signed a record 183 clean energy deals, totaling 28 gigawatts of new capacity. The United States also saw increased market demand for clean fuels, including renewable natural gas and sustainable aviation fuel. These investments reflect a growing recognition that renewables and storage are central to meeting demand and maintaining reliability.

Efficiency drives affordability

Minnesota continues to be a leader in energy efficiency — ranked 10th nationally and first in the Midwest in 2024. Our energy productivity has improved by 37% since 2001, with a 9% gain in the last five years alone.

Even as prices rise across the country, Minnesota is keeping electricity affordable. The state’s average retail rate was 12.36 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024, below the national average of 12.99 cents. Strategic investments and technological innovation in energy efficiency continue to reduce energy waste while saving businesses and households money.

Efficiency programs under the ECO Act save Minnesotans hundreds of millions of dollars annually, showing how well-implemented clean energy policies are also financially responsible.

Laying the groundwork for what’s next

Building on the success of technologies like wind and solar, demand continues to grow for new and emerging energy technologies across all economic sectors. Minnesota is actively investing in the future: scaling up infrastructure for electric vehicles and sustainable aviation fuel, integrating new solutions for heating and cooling homes and buildings, and preparing to lead in clean hydrogen. As of late 2024, more than 65,000 EVs were on Minnesota roads — our highest number yet — with charging infrastructure expanding to support further growth.

This forward-looking approach positions Minnesota to lead in sectors that will define the next era of American energy.

Now is not the time to pull back

Minnesota’s story is one of progress through pragmatic policy. However, continued success, here and across the country, depends on stable, forward-thinking policies at both the state and federal levels.

Congress must protect the bipartisan energy tax credits that fuel private investment, reduce energy costs, and create jobs. These incentives provide the certainty businesses need to plan long-term, deploy capital, and bring new energy projects online. Weakening or reversing them would threaten energy reliability, affordability, and American competitiveness.

State and federal energy policy should match the urgency and opportunity of this moment. With electricity demand rising and grid capacity under pressure, we need to move forward faster, not slower. That means streamlining permitting, modernizing infrastructure, and maintaining tax policies that enable the efficient deployment of innovative clean energy solutions.

Minnesota is the blueprint

The numbers speak for themselves: increased energy independence, affordable electricity, steady economic growth, and lower emissions. Minnesota is delivering and offering the rest of the country a roadmap for what success looks like.

We’re not just keeping the lights on. We’re lighting the way forward.

Building on the successful collaboration between Future Travel Experience (FTE) and Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) for the Aviation & Robotics Summit in 2023 and 2024, the FTE World Innovation Summit — free for airlines and airports to attend — will bring together over 400 air transport industry innovators for a three-day interdisciplinary series of conference sessions, interactive workshops, tours of the new terminal at PIT and across key innovation sites across Pittsburgh, plus extensive networking opportunities.

Energy & Sustainability is a major focus, tackling key topics including approaches to scaling the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), electric, low carbon energy, hydrogen and more across air transport.

The FTE World Innovation Summit agenda, which can be viewed here, features key sessions focused on ‘How do we ensure air transport gets the green credentials it needs at best speed?’ — a session that will be moderated by Mary Kirby, Founder, Editor and Publisher of Runway Girl Network — and ‘What are the best approaches to scaling the use of SAF, Electric & Hydrogen across air transport?’

Plus, there will be Energy & Sustainability innovation tours across Pittsburgh, an Energy & Sustainability ‘Meet the Innovators Pitch Session’, and much more.

Among the high-level speakers are Chad Willis, Director, Planning, Environmental, & Sustainability, Allegheny County Airport Authority; John Thomas, CEO, Connect Airlines; Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Director, ESG & Sustainability Strategy, Edmonton International Airport; and Costa Samaras, Director, Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation; Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University. Here, they each share some compelling insights ahead of the event.

PIT “working to establish a new paradigm as an energy hub”

Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) is a trailblazer in sustainability. Its innovations include the first-of-its-kind microgrid, powering the entire facility — including the new terminal opening this year — with natural gas and solar energy.

“Here at PIT we are working to establish a new paradigm where an airport can demonstrate that it has a role as an energy hub and not simply as a transportation hub,” says Chad Willis, Director, Planning, Environmental, & Sustainability, Allegheny County Airport Authority. “All of the users of an airport have a tremendous need for energy — electricity, hydrogen and fuels — and we believe that we can facilitate cleaner and more resilient options for those users.”

PIT is currently working with partners to build out infrastructure to produce hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) onsite to provide clean fuel options to users. “Furthermore, we are working with partners across multiple industries to position PIT as the preeminent location to test new technology and equipment — things like alternative fuel vehicles and aircraft,” Willis explains.

At the FTE World Innovation Summit, Willis is participating in a session focused on the best approaches to scaling the use of SAF, electric & hydrogen across air transport. “We are very excited to be a part of the discussions at the FTE World Innovation Summit as these always lead to new ways of solving the industry’s problems. The message I have for the industry is that airports can absolutely be an integral partner in furthering the sustainability objectives of those that operate within its ecosystem, so let’s work together and do great things.”

Connect Airlines innovating in zero carbon technology

John Thomas, CEO, Connect Airlines, is participating in an Energy & Sustainability session at the FTE World Innovation Summit focused on ‘How do we ensure air transport gets the green credentials it needs at best speed?’

“The opportunity already exists today with the replacement of aging uneconomic 50-seat regional jets in the U.S. with existing turboprop technology in the likes of the ATR72 and Q400s,” says Thomas.

“The turboprops reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40% and can operate at significantly better economics than the 50-seat RJs. The turboprops under the Connect Airlines business model will also provide a better customer experience than current regional aircraft — for example, the leading-edge Starlink WiFi system is now certified on both the ATR72 and the Q400 that provides free gate-to-gate connectivity for passengers. Both aircraft have larger overhead bins than 50-seat regional jets and the Connect business model calls for the introduction of a premium economy product, both soft and hard, on turboprops — a world first. And all for the same block time as regional jets on the routes that we will serve.”

As an industry innovator in terms of zero carbon technology adoption, Connect Airlines believes the sweet spot in terms of alternative fuels, at least in regional aviation, is liquid hydrogen that powers an electric engine through fuel cell technology. “This combination is 11 times more energy efficient than current jet engines using Jet-A,” Thomas explains.

Looking ahead to the FTE World Innovation Summit, he adds: “There is a lot of innovation in the airline industry at the moment, much of which is under the radar. So, the FTE World Innovation Summit provides a great opportunity to better understand what is going on.”

YEG pioneering hydrogen and new clean technology applications

Edmonton International Airport (YEG) believes in developing the airport as an energy hub. Its approach is pragmatic — supporting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) while actively pioneering hydrogen and new clean technology applications.

“We are engaging with suppliers and airlines to ensure future availability and feasibility for our region,” says Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Director, ESG & Sustainability Strategy, Edmonton International Airport. “For example, in our efforts to advance low-carbon energy, we are working closely with partners — airlines and ground handlers — to support the transition to electric ground operations.”

YEG works closely with the key Edmonton Metropolitan Region’s players on the regional Hydrogen Hub. The Edmonton Region Hydrogen HUB (ERH2) has recently relaunched, further solidifying the Edmonton Region as Canada’s leader in hydrogen innovation.

“We are actively integrating hydrogen into our ecosystem through the whole value chain, starting from ground vehicles to exploring infrastructure development or hydrogen light- or heavy-duty vehicles, to be ready for hydrogen application in aviation,” Chivot-Legris explains.

YEG is a trailblazer in sustainability, including plans for the world’s largest solar farm at an airport, and is driving innovation across multiple areas. “Alongside our hydrogen initiatives, we are continuously upgrading airport facilities — improving lighting, HVAC and overall energy efficiency to reduce consumption,” says Chivot-Legris. “These efforts are essential to our decarbonization strategy.”

Looking ahead, Chivot-Legris is participating in an Energy & Sustainability session at the FTE World Innovation Summit focused on the best approaches to scaling the use of SAF, electric & hydrogen across air transport. “I can’t wait to connect with global leaders and dive into real, actionable solutions for aviation’s energy transition. Events like this aren’t just about ideas — they’re about making things happen! It’s a chance to collaborate, spark new partnerships and push the industry forward. So, don’t miss out — join the conversation, share your insights and help shape the future of sustainable aviation!”

Carnegie Mellon University: “Now is the time for leadership to ensure that the future of air transport is clean and carbon neutral”

Costa Samaras, Director, Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation; Professor, Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), is participating in an Energy & Sustainability session at the FTE World Innovation Summit focused on ‘How do we ensure air transport gets the green credentials it needs at best speed?’

“There is a huge opportunity for clean energy innovation in the air transport sector. Now is the time for leadership to ensure that the future of air transport is clean and carbon neutral,” Samaras explains.

“I’m so excited about the great work the Scott Institute and CMU is doing to deliver energy and climate solutions. These are the technologies, systems, and policies that will tackle climate change, and make energy clean, affordable, reliable, and resilient.”

Looking ahead, Samaras is eager to participate in the FTE World Innovation Summit.

“Pittsburgh International Airport has been a global leader in energy innovation and resilience. We’re proud to collaborate to help translate the latest research into practice for Sustainable Aviation Fuel technology pathways, energy resilience, and more,” says Samaras.

“Pittsburgh is a city of innovators and problem solvers. Gathering global leaders from the air transport industry in Pittsburgh for the FTE World Innovation Summit provides an opportunity to help write the future of this important industry.”

“JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth.
This programme is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”","The deal includes a conditional agreement to purchase up to 100 aircraft, with an option for 100 more, depending on JetZero meeting key development milestones — including a full-scale demonstration flight planned for 2027 — and satisfying United’s safety and operational standards.

The BWB design, which integrates the wings and fuselage into a single aerodynamic structure, is expected to cut fuel consumption per passenger mile by up to 50% compared to similarly sized aircraft. This could help United lower its carbon footprint and operating costs.

The aircraft, named the JetZero Z4, is designed to carry around 250 passengers and fly on both conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel blends.

The design also aims to improve passenger comfort and airport compatibility. JetZero claims the aircraft will offer larger seats, dedicated overhead bin space for each passenger, and wider aisles. Despite the unusual shape, the aircraft is intended to operate from existing airports without requiring modifications to infrastructure.

This investment was made through United Airlines Ventures (UAV), the airline’s venture capital arm.

UAV has previously backed companies developing alternative aircraft technologies including hybrid-electric, hydrogen-powered and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, all aimed at supporting United’s goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.

United Airlines Ventures head Andrew Chang said: “If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.”

JetZero is also under contract with the US Air Force, which committed $235m last year to accelerate the development of a full-scale demonstrator. The military is eyeing the design for cargo transport and refuelling missions — roles that currently make up the majority of its annual fuel use.

JetZero’s chief executive and co-founder Tom O’Leary said: “United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe.

“As a result of this focus, some team members will move to Commercial Airplanes to support our development and certification efforts,” Boeing adds.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes is busy working to bring three long-delayed aircraft through certification: the 737 Max 7, 737 Max 10 and 777-9.
Some analysts always doubted Boeing would actually use truss-braced wings for its next production aircraft, citing complexity and risk.
“NASA and Boeing are currently evaluating an updated approach to the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project that would focus on demonstrating thin-wing technology with broad applications for multiple aircraft configurations,” NASA says.","Boeing this summer will stop developing NASA’s X-66 truss-braced-wing demonstrator aircraft and shift its focus specifically toward developing thin-wing technology that had been central to X-66’s design.

“By this summer, we will complete near-term X-66 demonstrator milestones – specifically the process of removing the wings – and then put the MD-90 activities on pause to focus on the thin-wing technology, which could have more direct benefit on future generations of commercial aircraft,” Boeing said on 25 April.

“As a result of this focus, some team members will move to Commercial Airplanes to support our development and certification efforts,” Boeing adds.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes is busy working to bring three long-delayed aircraft through certification: the 737 Max 7, 737 Max 10 and 777-9.

Several media outlets broke news on 24 April of Boeing’s development pull back.

The $1.15 billion X-66 was to be a heavily modified MD-90 equipped with long, slender wings supported by trusses – a complex design, but one engineers say would generate less drag, improving fuel efficiency.

Boeing in January 2023 won the NASA contract to develop the aircraft under the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator programme, with first flight intended in 2028.

“Development work is inherently dynamic,” Boeing says. “We can deliver value sooner by focusing on thin-wing design, which is applicable to multiple configurations and allows us to establish a sustainable and enduring capability to develop a pipeline of new-wing technologies.”

Boeing executives had previously said the truss-braced architecture might be suited for its next passenger aircraft, but the company never committed to the design. Some analysts always doubted Boeing would actually use truss-braced wings for its next production aircraft, citing complexity and risk.

Boeing now calls thin wings X-66’s “most-promising design feature”.

NASA confirms Boeing’s shift, saying the company now envisions having a “ground-based testbed to demonstrate the potential for long, thin wing technology”.

“NASA and Boeing are currently evaluating an updated approach to the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project that would focus on demonstrating thin-wing technology with broad applications for multiple aircraft configurations,” NASA says. “The Boeing proposal identifies the thin-wing concept as having broad applications for potential incorporation into aircraft with and without truss braces.”

NATA notes that X-66’s design involved a “more-complex” structure of trusses.

The partners had already started modifying the MD-90 at a site in Palmdale, California.

Boeing has been studying truss-braced wings for decades. Named for the trusses that are required to support them, such wings are longer and thinner than traditional wings, which reduces drag, improving fuel efficiency by up to 25%, according to NASA and Boeing.

Drawbacks include the complexity and weight of the trusses and related support structure. Long wings are also more prone to the dangerous condition of flutter.

In awarding Boeing the contract to build the jet in 2023, NASA said it would contribute $425 million, with Boeing and its commercial partners kicking in another $725 million, for a total project cost of $1.15 billion. The aircraft was to have wings measuring 52m (170ft) – about 17m longer than a 737’s.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/5/0/1/109501_boeingtrussbraceconcept011823_336935.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 05:56:26.044318

It marks Malaysia’s emergence as a serious contender in the global clean energy and low-carbon economy,” he said at the signing ceremony.

The planned SAF facility will use the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) process — the same technology behind over 80% of SAF produced globally. The project will combine BZI’s international investment experience with FHE’s deep knowledge in sourcing sustainable biofuel feedstock.

The goal is to establish a fully integrated SAF production facility with a capacity of up to one million tonnes per year. Commercial operations are expected to begin in 2029. As part of the deal, BZI will also acquire a strategic stake in FHE, aligning the two companies on long-term goals related to sustainability and innovation.

The refinery is expected to help Malaysia reduce its dependence on imported SAF, boost energy security, and position itself as a key SAF producer and exporter in Southeast Asia.

“This initiative is in line with the outcome of the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement. It puts Malaysia on the map as a regional leader in the fast-growing SAF sector,” said Nik Nazmi.

The minister emphasized the importance of the project in helping the aviation industry reduce emissions — a key challenge for a sector heavily reliant on fossil fuels. “Air travel is essential, but it must become sustainable,” he said. “This development will support airlines in meeting emissions reduction targets and contribute to Malaysia’s broader net-zero goals.”

The SAF refinery supports several national priorities, including the National Energy Transition Roadmap and the Malaysian Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint. These frameworks call for a gradual increase in SAF blending, starting with a 1% mandate and aiming for a 47% blend by 2050.

In addition to environmental benefits, the project is expected to create economic opportunities for small businesses and local communities involved in collecting used cooking oil and waste oils — key feedstocks for SAF.

“This project shows what’s possible when foreign and local players work together,” Nik Nazmi said. “The partnership between BZI and FHE sets a strong example for the kind of cooperation we need to scale clean energy solutions.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vinesh-Sinha-Fat-Hopes-image-updated.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 10:57:51.891421

EVA Air has taken a significant step towards advancing its sustainability goals by securing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) procurement agreements with three key suppliers: Associated Energy Group, LLC (AEG FUELS) from the United States, COSMO Oil Marketing Co., Ltd. (COSMO) from Japan, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation from Taiwan. This move not only broadens EVA Air’s SAF initiatives but also establishes enduring partnerships with both international and local suppliers, underlining the airline’s long-term commitment to a more eco-friendly aviation industry.

“Today, sustainable development is not just a choice—it is a responsibility,” said EVA Air President Clay Sun. “Our bilateral collaborations with AEG FUELS, COSMO, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation reflect our commitment to net-zero emissions. By actively introducing SAF across our global network, we are reducing our operational carbon footprint and fostering transformation and growth throughout the aviation supply chain.”

As the world strives toward the collective goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the aviation industry’s most effective solutions for carbon reduction. EVA Air is fully aligned with the European Union’s SAF supply policy, with all flights departing from Europe now operating with a 2% SAF blend since the beginning of 2025. The signing of new SAF agreements represents the next milestone in EVA Air’s sustainability journey, with plans to begin regular SAF integration at key hubs in North America, Japan, and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of 2025. These actions are set to significantly reduce flight emissions and pave the way for wider SAF adoption across the aviation industry.

EVA Air has forged partnerships with three prominent suppliers to further its SAF initiatives. AEG FUELS, a globally recognized aviation fuel provider, brings an extensive and reliable international logistics network. COSMO, one of Japan’s leading energy companies, will supply SAF in the Kansai region, including for the Osaka-Kansai Japan Expo through October 2025. Meanwhile, Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, Taiwan’s first company to supply domestically produced SAF, is bolstering the resilience of the local supply chain. These collaborations enhance EVA Air’s fuel supply flexibility, expand SAF usage throughout the Asia-Pacific region, and accelerate the sustainable transition of aviation fuel in the area.

In a significant step forward for SAF adoption, EVA Air successfully introduced domestically produced SAF on April 23, 2025, as part of the Civil Aviation Administration’s pilot program for SAF usage. The SAF was blended into two international flights: BR156 from Taipei Songshan Airport to Seoul Gimpo International Airport, and BR148 from Kaohsiung International Airport to Kansai International Airport in Japan. This marked the official launch of SAF usage at Taiwan’s local airports, showcasing EVA Air’s strong sustainability commitment and highlighting the maturity of Taiwan’s domestic SAF supply chain.

EVA Air has made considerable strides in sustainability in recent years. Its efforts on the environmental front include fleet modernization with new, fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-1000, as well as optimizing flight routes to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Looking to the future, EVA Air will continue to increase its use of SAF and engage actively in global sustainability initiatives.

The company is creating an aircraft design that has the potential to deliver jet fuel efficiency and a greatly enhanced customer experience. The investment includes a path to order up to 100 airplanes and an option for an additional 100. The conditional purchase agreement is based on JetZero achieving development milestones, including flight of a full-scale demonstrator in 2027, among other conditions, including that the aircraft meet United's safety, business and operating requirements.

JetZero’s innovative design reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan, which could lead to as much as 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger mile compared to a similar sized aircraft. The technology could potentially help United lower its carbon emissions while reducing the cost of operations. In 2023, the U.S. Air Force announced a $235 million contract to JetZero to fast-track the development of JetZero’s full scale demonstrator. The JetZero Z4 airplane is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel, with propulsion systems able to utilize sustainable aviation fuel blends.

“If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV). “United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.”

“United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,” said Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. “JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”

Both the airplane’s shape, and the way JetZero plans to enter the plane into service, address industry pain points. The design contributes to a more efficient operation due to its shape and the higher altitude at which it will fly. For instance, a flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain would use up to 45 percent less fuel compared to the twin-aisle aircraft that operate that route today. The airplane also is expected to integrate readily into today’s airport infrastructure, requiring no new accommodations for jet bridges, runways or taxiways.

The aircraft design has the potential to also offer improvements to the passenger experience like flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes, and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat. Additionally, the design streamlines the boarding process with a main boarding door that is wider than that of a comparably sized aircraft, leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution. It may further enhance accessibility by featuring wider aisles and handicap-accessible lavatories, creating a comfortable travel environment for all passengers and in-flight crew.

JetZero’s agreement with the Air Force focuses on advancing airframe technology and capabilities, showcasing its potential, and providing the Department of Defense and commercial industry more options to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Several military aircraft configurations can be made with this design, including air transport and refueling tanker variants, which collectively account for approximately 60% of the Air Force’s total annual jet fuel consumption.

United's corporate venture capital fund, United Airlines Ventures, enables the airline to invest in emerging companies that have the potential to influence the future of travel.

Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

Over the last Corners, we examined the non-CO2 effects of Air Transport that contribute to global warming. Contrails had the largest effects, even larger than the CO2 emissions from Air Transport.

To complete the review of our progress with lower emission actions for Air Transport, we will examine the present situation with SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Jet Fuel

I did a comprehensive run-down of Jet Fuel and SAF a few years ago; you can find it here. Here, we summarize the key points and describe where we are with SAF and SAF blends in our Jet-A1 aviation fuel.

Jet Fuel, or more precisely Jet A1, is a mixture of over 2,000 different hydrocarbons. It’s classified as a Kerosene-type fuel. It’s produced in a cracking process from crude oil, which was, in turn, created from dead zooplankton and algae sediments that changed into oil under heat and pressure over millions of years.

The plankton and algae absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere as they grew. When we burn refined crude oil, we release the fuel’s carbon atoms as CO2. The time separation of absorption and release of millions of years creates our CO2 problem.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF, is a hydrocarbon fuel in which CO2 is absorbed from the atmosphere near the time of its CO2 release when burning the fuel.

There are a wide variety of processes where capturing CO2 into a hydrocarbon mix can create a SAF, Figure 1. The HEFA process is dominant today, where different biomasses are processed into SAF.

Other possible process chains (called Pathways in the industry) involve fermenting alcohols from agricultural or other waste materials and then converting the alcohol into SAF. There is also a waste pathway where waste gasification and Fischer-Tropsch processing form an SAF. Both pathways are of little importance today, but have long-term potential.

The final SAF pathway is called E-fuels, which involves producing hydrogen from water by electrolysis. Carbon atoms are then added to the hydrogen in a Fischer-Tropsch process, where the carbon comes from CO2/CO air capture. The result is an SAF hydrocarbon produced from water and energy (thus the name E-fuel).

SAF volumes and costs, today and tomorrow

The HEFA biofuel process is the lower-cost alternative, resulting in biofuels that cost four to five times the current price of Jet A1. The technology with no restrictions on feedstock, the E-fuels are highly dependent on the cost of the used energy. Until new energy sources such as Solar Power in desert areas are established, the energy costs for E-fuels will make these more costly than biofuels.

The SAF problem areas

SAF has two main problems: ramping up production and aircraft compatibility. Of these, aircraft compatibility is the easiest one.

Classical rubber seals used in aircraft fuel systems rely on aromatic compounds in the fuel to keep the seals supple. Pure biofuel or E-fuels lack such compounds. Therefore, SAFs lacking such compounds must be mixed with Jet fuel to keep the seals from shrinking and generating leaks.

This is the background to the need for blends for aircraft that don’t use modern seal materials for their fuel systems. Right now, most aircraft and engines are approved for up to a 50% SAF blend.

The bigger problem is the ramp-up of production. During 2024, we produced and consumed around 300 million tonnes of Jet Fuel. Of these, 1 million tonnes were SAF, or 0.3%. For 2025, the production of SAF is planned to increase to 1.5 million tonnes, or 0.5%.

We are a long way from producing enough SAF to satisfy a 2030 target of a 10% blend of SAF in Jet Fuel. For that, we need 30 tonnes of SAF (if the consumption stays the same), which is a growth rate of 30 times in five years, or 6 tonnes per year, or 600% in the first year. We have around 50% as the projected SAF production is 1.5 million tonnes in 2025.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-04-25 03:56:26.091034

Sustainable aviation fuel will account for 53% of the company’s decarbonisation, it states, while a further 21% will be sourced from advancements in aircraft and engine technology.

Another 7% will be driven by fleet renewal.

But Wizz Air corporate and ESG officer Yvonne Moynihan warns that the “current pace of change is not enough”.

The airline says industry efforts to meet net-zero by 2050 are sliding “off course”, arguing that achieving the target depends heavily on technological industrialisation which is yet to emerge.

Wizz’s roadmap puts “greater emphasis” on sustainable aviation fuel – rather than “unproven technologies and offsetting” – compared with other airlines, it says.

Such fuel is the “cornerstone” of its strategy and the “biggest lever” for decarbonisation, it adds, but production remains limited and prices are uncompetitive for a budget carrier.

“We need action, not just ambition,” says Moynihan. “That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net-zero possible.”

The airline is pressing governments to scale production of sustainable fuel and introduce incentives to reduce the price gap with conventional fuel.

Wizz adds that a commitment to address the situation is “not just an environmental imperative” but a “strategic necessity” for the European aviation sector if it is to achieve long-term sustainability, competitiveness and resilience.

Beneath the gentle sway of native Midwestern grasses lies an untapped strategic asset—one that may soon soar far above its traditional ecosystem. Recent research from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign casts a familiar plant, switchgrass, into a new light: as a resilient, resource-efficient, and economically viable feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

This development arrives amidst the broader momentum of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, aiming to produce 35 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050. Against this backdrop, the quiet strength of switchgrass may turn out to be a pivotal asset in aligning aviation with carbon-reduction targets.

The Agricultural Legacy with Aerospace Potential

Switchgrass has weathered millennia of climate shifts, and its biology is well-suited for contemporary sustainability needs. A perennial grass, it grows deep root systems and yields abundant biomass year after year—without the annual replanting typical of conventional crops. Its demand for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers is minimal, which means lower emissions during cultivation and reduced strain on agricultural ecosystems.

The new research focuses on modern cultivars—Independence, Liberty, and Carthage—engineered for energy output. Planted across Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota, these cultivars were evaluated over five years for yield and profitability. The results challenge a long-standing belief that marginal lands are economically unproductive.

Land Use Economics and Regional Optimization

The study’s economic angle brings forward an insight beyond bioenergy alone: a redefinition of land value. Liberty and Independence emerged as top performers, depending on the regional climate zone and fertilizer input. For instance, Liberty proved most profitable in zone 5b, while Independence flourished in zone 6a.

Such site-specific profitability modeling allows for targeted guidance to farmers and policymakers alike. With modest nitrogen inputs, these grasses offer returns as early as two years post-planting, particularly on marginal lands. This opens the door to productive use of areas previously dismissed as commercially irrelevant, presenting a land management paradigm that reduces competition with food crops.

A Biochemical Engine with Environmental Perks

Beyond economics, switchgrass also strengthens environmental resilience. A complementary study compared its ecosystem impact with continuous corn farming under no-till practices. The differences were notable.

Nitrous oxide emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, were significantly lower in switchgrass systems—attributable to its reduced fertilizer needs. Similarly, nitrate leaching dropped by 80 percent over three years. Though CO2 emissions from switchgrass plots were higher due to extensive root biomass respiration, this effect could translate into long-term soil carbon storage, enhancing sequestration potential.

These data suggest a dual benefit: enabling renewable fuel production while enhancing soil health and water quality. This positions switchgrass not only as a fuel source but also as a regenerative land steward.

Timing the Takeoff: Market Readiness and System Resilience

While current demand for switchgrass as a SAF feedstock remains low, the infrastructure to deploy it rapidly is now emerging. Economic and policy shifts—including biofuel incentives and carbon pricing—may accelerate this transition.

Importantly, the research underlines a strategic concept: preparedness. Cultivars are now proven, profitable models exist, and ecosystem data confirm sustainability advantages. When the market aligns, the supply chain can pivot to scale switchgrass quickly and effectively.

Conclusion: Rethinking Biomass from Below the Surface

The prairie plant once overlooked as mere ground cover may soon play a critical role in sustainable aviation. Switchgrass is more than a biomass source—it is a resilient, regionally adaptable, low-input crop with layered benefits that extend from soil to sky.

As the world seeks scalable climate solutions that align with both ecological integrity and economic feasibility, switchgrass may very well embody the kind of intelligent agriculture that powers clean aviation without compromise.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-39-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-25 06:56:09.991091

The collaboration, according to the two firms, will deliver one of the world’s most forward-looking sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) refineries in Port Klang - a move expected to transform the regional clean aviation landscape.

Managing Director of BZI (Malaysia) Berhad Datuk Seri Dr Shamir Kumar Nandy said the integrated facility - among the first of its kind in Southeast Asia - will produce SAF via the HEFA pathway, which currently accounts for over 80% of global SAF production.

Backed entirely by BZI’s investment, he said the project is expected to break ground by 2026 and commence commercial operations in 2029.

“We are underwriting the entire sum for now by ourselves. Based on FatHopes’ findings and updates, they’re in the process of getting the necessary approvals and sanctions before they can break ground.

“So I believe that will be a year down the road — about 12 months from today (Friday, April 25),” he said during a press conference at the BZI office here on Friday (April 25).

Also present at the announcement ceremony of the strategic investment between BZI and FatHopes Energy was Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.

He said the collaboration brings together BZI’s global investment expertise and FHE’s leadership in sustainable biofuel feedstock aggregation, laying the groundwork for a highly diversified and scalable SAF platform in the region.

The Port Klang refinery, he said is expected to anchor Malaysia’s broader ambition to produce one million tonnes of SAF annually, bolstering the country’s position as a central player in the global SAF economy.

“This initiative has the potential to reimagine the future of flight.

“We will also explore advanced SAF technologies alongside FHE’s refining partner and technology provider.

“It’s about profit, people and the planet, that’s what inspired this partnership, but most importantly, it’s for the planet,” Shamir added.

From FHE’s perspective, the project is currently at the feasibility stage and is being developed as a 300,000-tonne-per-annum facility.

“That will be the production capacity, which will require about 330,000 tonnes of feed material,” said Vinesh Sinha, Chief Executive Officer of FatHopes Energy.

“The technology is capable of processing multiple feedstocks and will be guided by prevailing policies and certifications.”

While financing has been fully committed by BZI, Sinha acknowledged that the primary challenges lie in the technical aspects of the refinery’s development.

“The biggest challenge that we face is really on the technical front.

“There’s a lot of input materials we need — hydrogen and nitrogen, which are major components of the manufacturing process,” he said.

“We are in the midst of identifying sources for those. And then there’s the port infrastructure, which is also a key factor.

“On our end, we are really focused on technical readiness and securing EIA clearance for this particular plant,” Sinha added.

Earlier in his speech, Nik Nazmi said the proposed SAF refinery in Port Klang will be a game-changer for Malaysia’s energy and aviation sectors.

“This investment will serve as a catalyst for far-reaching transformation across our energy and aviation sectors,” he said.

The renewable diesel segment, which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, reported sales volumes of 2.43 million gallons per day during the first quarter, down from 3.73 million gallons per day during the first quarter of last year. Valero primarily attributed the decreased sale volumes to planned maintenance activities at the DGD St. Charles refinery in Louisiana.

According to Valero, the renewable diesel segment generated $493 million in revenues from external customers during the first quarter, including $391 million from renewable diesel, $39 million from renewable naphtha and $63 million from neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Total revenues for the segment reached $702 million during the first quarter of 2024, with $697 million attributed to renewable diesel and $23 million attributed to renewable naphtha. The segment did not begin producing SAF until late 2024.

The renewable diesel segment reported an operating loss of $141 million for the first quarter, compared to an operating income of $190 million for the same period of 2024. The decrease is attributed to reduced production volumes and feedstock costs.

During a first quarter earnings call, Valero Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance Homer Bhullar said the company currently expects sales volumes for the renewable diesel segment to be approximately 1.1 billion gallons for the full year 2025, reflecting lower production volumes due to economics.

The ethanol segment produced 4.47 million gallons per day during the first quarter of 2025, unchanged when compared to the same period of 2024.

The ethanol segment reported $1.01 billion in revenues from external customers for the first quarter, including $787 million from ethanol and $221 million from distillers grains. Segment revenues for the same period of 2024 reached $914 million, including $638 million for ethanol and $276 million from distillers grains.

According to Valero, the ethanol segment reported $20 million in operating income for the first quarter, up from $10 million during the same period of last year. Adjusted operating income was $20 million, down from $39 million. The company attributed the decrease in adjusted operating income to higher corn prices, lower corn related coproduct prices, and higher operating expenses, which were partially offset by higher ethanol prices.

Moving into the second quarter of 2025, Bhullar said he expects ethanol production volumes to increase slightly, reaching 4.6 million gallons per day.

Overall, Valero reported a net loss attributable to stockholders of $595 million, or $1.90 per share, for the first quarter, compared to net income of $1.2 billion, or $3.75 per share, for the same period of 2024.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biodieselmagazine/posts/web/2019/04/ValeroLogo_15563054304635_1556555203822.jpg,N,,2025-04-24 19:56:52.160136

(WCIA) — A team of researchers at the University of Illinois is working to create a more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
In 2021, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge began with the goal of expanding sustainable fuel production to 35 billion gallons by 2050.
“All the data that helps us estimate switchgrass suitability for SAF comes from small plot research or older forage-type switchgrass cultivars.

(WCIA) — A team of researchers at the University of Illinois is working to create a more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Now, these scientists have turned to a prairie grass to try and make it happen.

Switchgrass is native to North America, can grow in a variety of conditions and often reaches five or six feet in height. It can also be harvested annually — for a decade or more — without needing to be replanted. In 2021, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge began with the goal of expanding sustainable fuel production to 35 billion gallons by 2050. Switchgrass is just one of several kinds of materials that could meet this challenge.

Scientists have been studying the bioenergy potential of switchgrass for decades. Previous studies, however, used a less productive kind of switchgrass, used smaller amounts of land, or overlooked important fertilizer inputs.

In these two new studies, U of I researchers grew “energy” switchgrass at a larger scale to figure out which varieties of the grass are most profitable, where it’ll be most profitable to grow, and how it compares to corn in terms of ecosystem services.

“All the data that helps us estimate switchgrass suitability for SAF comes from small plot research or older forage-type switchgrass cultivars. We wanted to test high-yielding switchgrass cultivars on a larger scale to provide a more accurate picture of the benefits these new cultivars provide,” said DoKyoung Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of ACES at the U of I.

Muhammad Umer Arshad, a postdoctoral researcher, led the team in analyzing the profitability in switchgrass. Three newer varieties of switchgrass were planted — Independence, Liberty, and Carthage — and two forage varieties were planted — Shawnee and Sunburst. The researchers planted the varieties on low-productivity land across four states, and tested nitrogen fertilizer rates. After five years, Arshad analyzed expenses and profits in each location.

“Our findings clearly show that Independence and Liberty are much more profitable than the forage cultivars on all the sites, but the most profitable nitrogen rate varied across locations,” Arshad said. “In most cases, 56 kilograms per hectare achieved higher yields, but in some sites, 28 kilograms performed better in terms of profit.”

The “energy” switchgrass outperformed the forage cultivars, but performed differently across the sites depending on the nitrogen rate.

“With these energy-type cultivars, farmers can put marginal lands to use and see returns after two years,” Arshad said. “Our results can help guide decision-makers to optimize input strategies for biomass production and meet renewable energy demands.”

Postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi led a companion study in field-scale plots in Illinois. Namoi assessed soil greenhouse gas emissions and nitrate leaching in Independence switchgrass. Then, Namoi compared the data to other field ecosystems with different crops.

“One of the many benefits of growing purpose-grown energy crops on marginal lands is ecosystem services associated with the perennial nature of energy crops. They can also potentially generate higher profits than conventional row crops on less productive land,” Namoi said. “Demonstrating ecosystem services of switchgrass, including reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient loss, will promote purpose-grown energy crops on marginal land.”

Namoi found that switchgrass had significantly lower levels of nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching than corn. But carbon dioxide emissions after two years were higher in switchgrass than corn. Namoi pointed to higher levels of biomass below the ground in switchgrass than corn as a potential factor.

Despite this, Lee said the benefits of switchgrass still outweigh the cons.

“For one thing, more root biomass means more long-term carbon sequestration potential,” Lee said. “When we measure total biomass of switchgrass, there’s about 10 megagrams of carbon belowground. That’s huge.”

Another advantage of switchgrass lies in its ability to thrive on marginal land.

“By definition, marginal land is not profitable for commodity crops,” Namoi said. “So switchgrass reduces competition with food crops and makes use of otherwise unproductive areas.”",https://www.wcia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2025/04/lee_dokyoung220609-mh-02.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-04-24 19:56:56.933128

The technology is designed to allow floating import terminals to produce hydrogen from transported ammonia. The ammonia cracker’s modular design is said to enable integration into both hybrid floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) and dedicated floating hydrogen terminals.

In addition, the technology is scalable with an annual send-out capacity of up to 210,000 metric tons of hydrogen; ammonia storage capacities can range from 10,000 to 120,000 cu m.

To date, the project has attracted about EUR5.9 million ($6.71 million) in funding from the Norwegian government’s green platform program.

The ammonia cracker was assembled at Sustainable Energy’s Norwegian Catapult Center in Stord, Norway. Other partners in the project are the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), University of South-East Norway, Sustainable Energy, and BASF SE.

Under the EU’s REPower strategy, there are plans for Europe to import 10 MMmt/year of renewable hydrogen by 2030. As a hydrogen grid emerges, floating infrastructure with ammonia cracking technology could open the way toward large-scale imports, supplying emission-intensive industries with a stable baseload energy source and balance within the energy system, the partners said.

Although hydrogen shows promise as a commercial and sustainable fuel, and can be produced for a relatively low investment cost in countries with plentiful access to renewable power, it is also difficult to store and transport. This is because of its low volumetric energy density with potentially large vaporisation losses.

Ammonia, however, can be stored in liquid form at moderate pressures and temperatures, and it is transported by ships over long distances.

by Ava Splear (Farm Progress/Prairie Farmer) U.S. EPA announced year-round availability of E15 in seven states. Plus, new demand for ethanol is being developed through the sustainable aviation fuel market. -- o E15 has been approved for year-round availability in seven states throughout the Midwest. o Many airline companies are pledging to switch to sustainable aviation fuel, which will increase long-term demand for corn. o Illinois is a strong contender to be a hub for SAF production.

What if you could grow corn, drive a truck powered by ethanol and fly a plane with corn-based fuel? For Maple Park, Ill., farmer and FedEx pilot Chris Gould, that could actually happen.

“It would be cool to be burning the product I’m growing,” says Gould, who also serves as an Illinois Corn Growers Association director.

The possibility is not far off, he says, pointing to several new developments in legislation, facilities, company pledges and sustainability goals that are driving change in corn’s future as a renewable energy source. Farming — and flying — from the heart of the Corn Belt, Gould has a front-row seat.

Changes to E15 legislation

Earlier this year, U.S. EPA announced that E15 will be available year-round for seven states — Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin — starting April 28. Prior to this, EPA had to issue a waiver for pumps in those states to offer E15 from June through September.

...

Legislation for year-round availability is ideal, and Gould is optimistic that the change can happen because E15 has bipartisan support.

E15 previously required a waiver to be sold during summer months because it doesn’t meet Reid Vapor Pressure requirements under the Clean Air Act. Ethanol emissions increase during the summer months due to higher temperatures. According to the Congressional Research Service, seven consecutive fuel waivers have been signed, meaning that E15 has been available year-round for the last seven years in those seven states.

...

New market: Sustainable aviation fuel

...

“Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to be a massive market for corn,” Gould says, explaining that SAF can’t compete in the short term with petroleum jet fuel because it’s more expensive and its production is inefficient. It takes about 1.6 gallons of ethanol to produce 1 gallon of SAF. However, with time and continued research to build the SAF industry, eventually it will become more competitive and beneficial to corn farmers.

Still, it is possible to use SAF as a jet fuel alternative now. In the European Union, there are already mandates in place for using SAF in small quantities.

...

At the Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in March, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both pledged to replace 10% of their fuel usage with SAF by 2030. For American Airlines, this means it would need 400 million gallons of SAF to reach the pledged 10% in a single year.

And United Airlines? The company pledges to be net-zero by 2050, which means using all SAF. According to United, the SAF it uses “has up to 85% lower greenhouse gas emissions than regular jet fuel.”

...

“There are a couple technologies right now that are being developed to commercialize the production of sustainable aviation fuel,” says Brad Stotler, director of government affairs at IL Corn.

...

Illinois makes a good spot to house this new industry because of the large supply of corn and a strong transportation infrastructure, including nine international airports and all Class I railroads touching the state. In addition, a large amount of research is conducted at educational institutions across the state, and a tax credit in Illinois makes it more economically feasible.

“We have existing refiners and other companies looking to locate near our ethanol industry to produce sustainable aviation fuel product,” Stotler says.

Look no further than this list of companies that have announced plans to build SAF plants in Illinois:

Marquis Sustainable Aviation Fuel plans to build a facility in Hennepin.

Leveraging growth in Africa’s’ aviation sector

With Africa’s air transport market poised for significant growth Boeing has forecast that around 1,200 new commercial aircraft will be required over the next 20 years to meet the continent’s growing air connectivity needs and drive its socioeconomic transformation. Boeing currently represents around 70% of the in-service fleet across the continent and to help maintain its footprint in the African market, the OEM has officially opened its new office in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The opening marks the OEM’s second office on the continent with a statement from Boeing saying it “will enhance our ability to serve our airline customers and partners across the continent reinforcing our commitment to the region’s growing aerospace industry and building on our 75-year legacy in Africa.”

According to Ethiopia’s Minister of Transport and Logistics, Alemu Sime, the opening of Boeing’s African office in Addis Ababa “highlights Ethiopia’s increasing importance in global aviation and supports the wider aspiration for a connected and thriving Africa.”

Henok Teferra Shawl, Boeing Africa’s managing director added that he was delighted to welcome Abderahmane Berthe, Secretary-General of the African Airlines Association (AAFRA) as the first guest at the new office to discuss a partnership to support growth of aviation, availing of safety training for airlines and the production and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Africa.

Supported by a broad coalition of labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups(opens in a new tab), the Governor’s commonsense energy plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, speed up permitting, and protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building more energy generation in Pennsylvania – positioning the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.

Last month at Voith Hydro in York(opens in a new tab), one of the world’s largest hydropower manufacturing facilities, Governor Shapiro launched the legislative push for his Lightning Plan. The plan includes a proposal – supported by both Republicans and Democrats – to update the Pennsylvania Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, which was established in 2022, but hasn’t been used, leaving billions in potential economic development untapped. Governor Shapiro also highlighted key components of the plan while visiting Penn England Farms in Blair County(opens in a new tab), where a methane digester is turning farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and generating revenue. The Lightning Plan will expand access to shared digesters to help more farmers benefit.

In January, Governor Shapiro first unveiled the Lightning Plan at Pittsburgh International Airport(opens in a new tab), highlighting a $1.5 billion hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel project creating 3,000 construction jobs. This week, the Governor also announced(opens in a new tab) that federal regulators have approved his new agreement with PJM Interconnection to deliver $21 billion in consumer savings over the next two years, lowering household energy bills and protecting Pennsylvania ratepayers.

By producing more energy, cutting red tape, and advancing innovation, Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan will boost key sectors of the Commonwealth’s economy, including manufacturing, robotics and technology, agriculture, and life sciences. Independent studies(opens in a new tab) confirm that the Governor’s plan will save Pennsylvanians money on their electricity bills, create energy jobs, and lead to billions in new investment in power plants and energy infrastructure.

“Pennsylvania has long been a national energy leader, from Ben Franklin to today, but right now, we’re letting other states outcompete us and we’re losing out on jobs, new investment, and innovation – that has to change,” said Governor Shapiro. “My energy plan will power Pennsylvania forward by incentivizing the building of next generation energy projects in the Commonwealth. We have to meet this moment and this plan – supported by leaders from the energy industry, organized labor and environmental groups, and consumer advocates – will lower costs for consumers, create more jobs, speed up permitting, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. The time for action is now and I look forward to working with leaders in the General Assembly to continue moving this legislation forward.”

Governor Shapiro’s energy plan will provide funding for new projects through an updated EDGE manufacturing tax credit, streamline energy project approvals by creating a state energy siting board to cut red tape, and encourage communities to lower utility bills through shared energy resources. Additionally, the plan increases rebates for energy-efficient appliances to help reduce household energy costs. The Lightning Plan will supercharge energy development in the Commonwealth, positioning Pennsylvania to lead the way in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for years to come.

New studies from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign identify economic and environmental considerations that make switchgrass a candidate for sustainable aviation fuel.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge kicked off in 2021 with the goal of expanding SAF production to 35 billion gallons by 2050, while cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half. Forecasted to contribute up to 230 million dry tonnes annually, switchgrass is one of several purpose-grown bioenergy feedstocks that could help meet this challenge.

Not only does the perennial species produce great quantities of biomass, switchgrass can be harvested annually for a decade or more without repeated planting, requires minimal nitrogen fertilizer compared to corn, and performs important ecosystem services.

Scientists know this because they have been studying switchgrass for its bioenergy potential for decades. But previous studies used less productive switchgrass cultivars, were conducted on smaller and less realistic plots of land, or overlooked the fertilizer inputs required for optimal productivity.

In two new studies, U. of I. researchers grew modern ""energy"" cultivars at the field scale across the Midwest to determine which cultivars are most profitable where, and how they compare to corn in terms of ecosystem services. The articles were published in GCB Bioenergy and Journal of Environmental Quality.

""All the data that helps us estimate switchgrass suitability for SAF comes from small plot research or older forage-type switchgrass cultivars. We wanted to test high-yielding switchgrass cultivars on a larger scale to provide a more accurate picture of the benefits these new cultivars provide,"" said DoKyoung Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at U. of I.

Postdoctoral researcher Muhammad Umer Arshad led the effort to analyze switchgrass profitability. The team planted three newer energy-type cultivars—Independence, Liberty, and Shawnee—alongside two forage cultivars—Carthage and Sunburst—on low-productivity marginal land across four Midwestern states: Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. They also tested two nitrogen fertilizer rates, 28 and 56 kilograms per hectare; for comparison, corn typically gets about 200. After five years of growth, Arshad conducted economic analyses to calculate expenses and profits in each location.

""Our findings clearly show that Independence and Liberty are much more profitable than the forage cultivars on all the sites, but the most profitable nitrogen rate varied across locations,"" Arshad said. ""In most cases, 56 kilograms per hectare achieved higher yields, but in some sites, 28 kilograms performed better in terms of profit.""

Although Independence and Liberty outperformed the forage cultivars, these energy types of switchgrass did not perform equally across the sites. For example, depending on the nitrogen rate, Independence was most profitable in U.S. hardiness zone 6a, whereas Liberty showed the highest profit margins in zone 5b. One forage type, Carthage, was most profitable in zone 4b.

""With these energy-type cultivars, farmers can put marginal lands to use and see returns after two years,"" Arshad said. ""Our results can help guide decision-makers to optimize input strategies for biomass production and meet renewable energy demands.""

During the decade or so that switchgrass is churning out biomass, it's also busy providing ecosystem services—a win-win, according to postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi, who led a companion study in field-scale plots in Illinois.

Namoi assessed soil greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and nitrate leaching in Independence switchgrass over three years, and compared these metrics to other fields planted in continuous corn under no-till management.

""The industry is trying to move away from corn toward more purpose-grown energy crops, but with current commodity prices, switchgrass can't compete with corn,"" Namoi said. ""So how can we promote widespread adoption? We have to look at ecosystem services. The idea with this study was to compare ecosystem services for these two cropping systems on equal footing.""

Nitrous oxide emissions and nitrate leaching were significantly reduced in switchgrass compared to corn, with 80% less nitrate leaching by the third year. Namoi says the nitrous oxide finding is straightforward: with switchgrass getting just 56 kilograms of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare and corn receiving 202 kilograms, there's a lot more nitrogen available in corn fields to be emitted as the potent greenhouse gas.

Carbon dioxide emissions were less straightforward. After the second year, CO2 emissions were over 50% higher in switchgrass than in corn.

""I wasn't expecting that,"" Namoi said. ""But there's a lot more biomass belowground in switchgrass, about five times that of corn.""

More roots mean more respiration, the normal process in which roots convert oxygen and glucose into energy, with carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Lee says he's seen this pattern with switchgrass and other purpose-grown bioenergy crops before, but he's still convinced that the overall benefits of switchgrass outweigh this particular deficit.

""For one thing, more root biomass means more long-term carbon sequestration potential,"" he said. ""When we measure total biomass of switchgrass, there's about 10 megagrams of carbon belowground. That's huge.""

Another key advantage of switchgrass, Namoi added, is its ability to thrive on marginal land.

""By definition, marginal land is not profitable for commodity crops,"" he said. ""So switchgrass reduces competition with food crops and makes use of otherwise unproductive areas.""

With commodity and oil prices at a low point, the demand for purpose-grown bioenergy feedstocks is relatively weak at the moment. But that could all change rapidly as tariffs impact global economies. Namoi says when the market is ready, switchgrass will be, too.

LOUIS, MISSOURI, US — Bunge Global SA and Repsol have incorporated intermediate novel crops camelina and safflower into their renewable energy partnership, expanding the available pool of low-carbon intensity feedstocks for the continued development of renewable fuels in Europe.

The companies said in their April 24 announcement that camelina and safflower will be processed into low-carbon intensity oils and used as feedstock to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a fully compatible drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel, or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the decarbonization of air travel.

Repsol, a Spain-based multi-energy company, will utilize advanced technology in its industrial assets to convert these oils into renewable fuel, creating a new pathway for the development of renewable fuels in Spain. Intermediate novel crops can produce renewable fuel with emission reductions of up to 90% compared to conventional diesel.

“We are committed to be the best-in-class partner to provide innovative solutions and support farmers’ efforts in low-carbon agriculture,” said Julio Garros, co-president, Agribusiness, at Bunge. “Through industry collaborations, we are adding new oil sources to our global supply chains and investing in processing plants with greater ability to handle and process these crops, expanding our offerings of cost-effective, sustainable feedstocks to customers worldwide. We are pleased to partner with Repsol to create clear and scalable paths to support the decarbonization of the industry.”

St. Louis, Missouri, US-based Bunge said it is leveraging its extensive global network of farmer relationships and expertise in oilseed processing, developing value-chain partnerships to promote the adoption of intermediate novel crops and offering a progressive portfolio of readily available, high-performing options.

These oil-rich novel crops, which are designed to be planted on fallow lands, offer distinct advantages: provide farmers a new income opportunity through sustainable crop rotations while improving soil health and boosting biodiversity, Bunge noted. Moreover, these crops are additive to the existing production systems for food, feed and fuel.

Bunge and Repsol recently closed their partnership transaction, which was announced in March 2024, and said they are committed to ongoing research and development to explore further low-carbon feedstock opportunities to boost the supply of advanced renewable fuels, including sourcing novel seeds from Spanish farmers.

Described as the first of its kind in Europe, this partnership was developed to accelerate the ramp-up of production of these fuels mandated by the European Union.

Most of these approaches generate acyclic hydrocarbons that offer high gravimetric net heats of combustion (NHOC) and good combustion properties, but much lower densities than petroleum-based diesel fuel. To address this shortcoming, biosynthetic farnesene was isomerized with a heterogeneous acid catalyst (Amberlyst-15) under mild conditions and hydrogenated to generate a complex mixture of acyclic, monocyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic hydrocarbons. The hydrogenated farnesene isomers (HFI) had a density of 0.852 g mL–1, a gravimetric NHOC of 43.33 MJ kg–1, a 40 °C kinematic viscosity of 3.25 mm2 s–1, and a derived cetane number (DCN) of 40. All of these values are similar to or exceed those of diesel fuel derived from petroleum sources. Compared to farnesane, the direct hydrogenation product of farnesene, HFI exhibited 11% higher density and 9% higher volumetric NHOC due to the cyclic compounds contained in the mixture. 10–40% blends of HFI with conventional jet fuel were prepared and exhibited −20 °C kinematic viscosities ranging from 4.8–7.8 mm2 s–1, which fall within the specification for Jet-A (<8.0 mm2 s–1).

The facility will continue to produce ethylene from a newer steam cracker. Investment will also be refocused on the facility’s decarbonization.

The older cracker has relied on a third-party consumer, which recently decided to end the contract by 2027. “As a result, the steam cracker, which is not integrated to TotalEnergies' downstream polymer production, will no longer have any outlets for its ethylene production”, the French integrated energy company said in an online statement.

“The unit shutdown will allow the site to focus on its more recent steam cracker, whose ethylene production is entirely consumed by TotalEnergies' industrial units in Antwerp and Feluy”.

The shutdown will not result in layoffs. “The 253 employees concerned will each be offered a solution aligned with their personal situation: retirement or an internal transfer to another position based at the Antwerp site”, the statement said. “This project is subject to the legally required employee consultation and notification process, which TotalEnergies will initiate with representatives of Antwerp platform employees in late April”.

The facility, on the other hand, will this year enable a conventional refining unit to co-process biomass to produce 50,000 metric tons a year of sustainable aviation fuel. This will be supplied to aviation customers, TotalEnergies said.

Meanwhile as part of the facility’s decarbonization TotalEnergies has signed a tolling deal for 130 megawatts (MW) from a 200-MW electrolyzer project of Air Liquide. That secures 15,000 metric tons per annum of green hydrogen for the Antwerp complex.

“Upstream of the electrolyzer, TotalEnergies will supply green electricity thanks to its OranjeWind offshore wind project”, TotalEnergies added. “Scheduled for the end of 2027, the project will reduce CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tons per year and contribute to the European targets (RED III) for renewable energy in transport”.

Moreover the facility’s electrification and battery energy storage are “contributing respectively to the decarbonization of its industrial operations and to the growing need to balance Belgian and European high-voltage transmission grids”, TotalEnergies said. “With a power rating of 25 MW and capacity of 75 MWh [megawatt hours], Antwerp’s battery storage system is TotalEnergies’ biggest in Europe”. The storage system was commissioned last year.

David O'Brien, who also leads Lauda Europe, said Malta and other peripheral states like Ireland and Cyprus are being unfairly penalised by EU climate policies that fail to account for their geographic realities.

“We are sleepwalking into a protectionist trap. Current EU policies punish states on the periphery for their geography. Our options are limited. We can’t holiday by road. Aviation is our lifeline, and it's being priced out,” he said.

The CEO was speaking at a joint panel hosted by the Malta Business Network (MBN) and the Irish Business Network (IBN) - the first event jointly organised by the two

O’Brien called on national governments, including Malta, to push back against policies that unfairly burden smaller, island-based nations.

He also criticised the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, saying airlines operating out of Malta are often being charged for SAF even when airports don’t supply it.

“We land in Munich—no SAF available—but we’re still charged. These costs are staggering. The reality is, margins in aviation are wafer-thin, and these new charges may push us over the edge,” he said.

O'Brien's concerns were echoed by other panellists and leading aviation sector figures who spoke at the event.

KM Malta Airlines Executive Chairman David Curmi agreed that Malta faced significant challenges for the future of its connectivity.

The main airlines operating to and from the country, he said, face serious pressure from rising operational costs—many of them policy-driven.

“Destinations like Tel Aviv and St. Petersburg were cut for strategic reasons, but we’re increasingly having to make decisions based on cost pressure, not opportunity. It’s becoming harder to justify routes when the cost of doing business keeps escalating,” Curmi said.

Beyond the EU, panellists also expressed frustration at the lack of strategic planning and foresight from Malta’s own government.

There was a shared sentiment that the country’s approach to long-term connectivity and sustainable growth remains reactive and politically cautious.

Stephen Xuereb, CEO of Valletta Cruise Port, pointed out the growing disconnect between regulatory ambition and practical implementation, especially in infrastructure.

“There’s a lot of talk about sustainability, but not enough investment to match it. We’re expected to meet green targets, but where’s the support to actually get there?” he asked, referencing the cruise industry's growing compliance demands and Malta’s limited infrastructure to support them.

The event was moderated by David Delicata, Partner and Transportation, Hospitality & Services Leader at Deloitte Malta.

“Peripheral economies must be part of the policy conversation—not just policy recipients. Malta needs to lead, not follow, if we want a tourism sector that’s future-ready,” Delicata said.

Fluff pulp is a specialized type of chemical pulp made from softwood trees, prized for its high absorbency and bulk.
A Shifting Fluff Pulp Market: Rationalization or Trend?
The closure of International Paper’s Georgetown mill, which represented approximately 5% of US fluff pulp production, has sparked renewed interest in the underlying drivers of change within the fluff pulp sector.
Looking Ahead at Future Fluff Pulp Supply According to FisherSolve’s Capacity Trends module, no new fluff pulp mills have been announced anywhere in the world.","In a move that has drawn attention across the pulp and paper industry, International Paper (IP) announced the closure of its Georgetown, South Carolina mill in late 2024. The mill, which specialized in fluff pulp production, was a key player in the global supply chain for absorbent hygiene materials. Its closure raises important questions about the evolving dynamics of the fluff pulp market and whether this signals a broader shift for producers and end-users alike.

According to International Paper, the decision was part of a company-wide strategy to streamline operations and focus on more profitable assets. While internal cost and efficiency considerations played a role, industry professionals are questioning if this move also reflects deeper structural changes. These could include moderating demand growth, intensifying global competition, and the emergence of more cost-effective production regions.

What Is Fluff Pulp Used For?

Fluff pulp is a specialized type of chemical pulp made from softwood trees, prized for its high absorbency and bulk. It is primarily used in the production of absorbent hygiene products, including:

Baby diapers

Adult incontinence products

Feminine hygiene pads

Air-laid nonwovens for applications like wipes and medical pads

These products rely on fluff pulp's unique fiber structure to deliver critical performance in absorbency and fluid retention. The hygiene sector, especially in emerging markets, has traditionally driven demand growth for fluff pulp.

A Shifting Fluff Pulp Market: Rationalization or Trend?

The closure of International Paper’s Georgetown mill, which represented approximately 5% of US fluff pulp production, has sparked renewed interest in the underlying drivers of change within the fluff pulp sector. While it might be tempting to view this move as part of a larger market correction due to factors such as oversupply, the data suggests a different story. The shutdown is more accurately seen as a strategic decision tied to cost optimization and shifting corporate priorities rather than a response to excess global capacity.

Contrary to the notion of global oversupply, fluff pulp capacity has remained relatively stable over the past decade. The US continues to dominate production, much as it did 10 years ago. While Latin America and Asia have seen some growth—about 400,000 tons/year and 150,000 tons/year respectively—these increases are modest and have not meaningfully disrupted global pricing or market share. In fact, the production increase in Asia over the entire past decade is only about half the annual output of the Georgetown mill itself.

Instead, the closure underscores a confluence of evolving cost structures and operational realities:

Operational Cost Pressures: North American mills, particularly older sites like Georgetown, face growing challenges from energy costs, labor, and environmental compliance. According to FisherSolve’s Viability Index, Georgetown ranked among the highest-risk fluff pulp mills based on cost position and technical age—underscoring how these factors can make such facilities less competitive compared to newer or more strategically located mills.

Fluff Pulp Mill Viability by Cost and Technical Age (3Q2024)

Source: FisherSolve, Viability Index

Shifting Demand Optimization: While demand for hygiene products—diapers, adult incontinence items, and feminine care—remains strong, manufacturers are increasingly refining how they use fluff pulp. The adoption of advanced superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) and product redesigns have modestly reduced the volume of fluff required per unit, especially in mature markets.

Environmental and Efficiency Standards: Sustainability is no longer optional. Older facilities with higher water usage, energy intensity, or emissions profiles are increasingly difficult to justify in a market where ESG pressures are mounting.

Looking Ahead at Future Fluff Pulp Supply

According to FisherSolve’s Capacity Trends module, no new fluff pulp mills have been announced anywhere in the world. The only expected change is a forecasted production increase at International Paper’s Riegelwood mill in 2026. This suggests that while total capacity may edge upward in specific locations, there is no sign of a boom in new supply.

In this context, the Georgetown closure appears less like the start of a widespread contraction and more like a strategic pruning of less competitive assets. The industry may be entering a phase of consolidation and selective investment rather than dramatic shifts in overall supply.

Leveraging Market Intelligence to Stay Ahead

As the industry navigates strategic shifts like the Georgetown mill closure, companies across the pulp, paper, and hygiene value chains need reliable, data-driven tools to make informed decisions. ResourceWise’s FisherSolve platform delivers a comprehensive view of global market dynamics—covering production assets, cost structures, sustainability metrics, and long-term capacity trends.

Exploring social media When looking into social media activity throughout 2024, there appears to be very little crossover between the top news coverage and social media posts.
Conclusion This review of airline reputation sets out a roadmap for airlines, identifying the six key pillars on which an airline reputation is built.","Brand reputation is more important than ever in today’s digital, interconnected age. The ability for information to spread online (accurate or not), is becoming unstoppable. Consequently, a company’s actions, whether they involve harmful, unethical, or unsustainable practices, or proactive measures such as taking bold steps to protect the planet, or unveiling innovations to enhance services, hold significant weight.

And often, the perception of these actions is even more important. The power and influence of both traditional media and social media have significantly amplified the impact of both positive and negative information, shaping public perception in real-time.

As airlines are responsible for the safe transportation of millions of passengers daily, trust and reliability are paramount. Therefore, for the airline industry, maintaining a solid and positive reputation couldn’t be more crucial.

While safety concerns underpin much of the consumer perceptions of airlines, reputation in this sector is a complex equation. And as the aviation industry continues to grow and evolve, several additional criteria are creeping into the equation. Notably, sustainability and accessibility are growing in importance.

In an era where environmental consciousness and inclusive travel are paramount, airlines are increasingly judged on their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint and ensure equitable access for all passengers. An airline’s products and services have the most influence on passengers.

Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) has partnered with Carma, a media analysis and intelligence service provider, to investigate how cabin design and passenger experience can impact an airline’s reputation.

Methodology

Carma employs a comprehensive approach to gauging reputation, analysing media coverage, social media activity, and audience perception through six pillars: products/services, sustainability, conduct, vision, performance, and culture.

A Reputation Score is calculated separately for traditional media, social media and audience research, and then combined. The score for each component is composed by weighting the presence of the six pillars with the tone and volume of coverage/respondents, which is then weighted by the importance of each pillar to the audience (based on audience research).

The research also provides insights into how reputation impacts purchasing decisions differently across various regions. For instance, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and United Arab Emirates (UAE), reputation is a strong driver of airline choice, while in Asia, purchase decisions are more complex. In the UK, reputation and purchasing decisions are often more separate considerations.

For the purpose of this report, stories and posts have been tracked regarding 12 airlines across 8 different countries, over the course of one year (2024). In total, the analysis considered 55,267 articles and 1,014,058 social media posts.

Full breakdown of sources:

Sources: Online, social media

Time period: 1st January 2024 – 31st December 2024

Areas tracked: Hong Kong, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States (USA), Malaysia

Airlines tracked: British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Malaysian Airlines, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Virgin Atlantic

Total articles in dataset: 55,267

Total social media posts in dataset: 1,014,058

Driving airline reputation

So what factors are truly driving reputation in the airline industry? Carma has created a unique methodology to track reputation, based on its six key pillars:

Products and Services: Anything related to the airline’s customer offering, such as quality, reliability and customer service.

Culture: Anything related to the airline’s organisational culture, such as employee treatment, health & safety, diversity & inclusion.

Sustainability: Anything related to the airline’s sustainability actions including community engagement, environmental impact, and charitable endeavours.

Conduct: Anything related to the airline’s behaviour and conduct, such as authenticity, transparency, compliance, and ethical behaviour.

Performance: Anything related to the airline’s business performance, such as consistency, investment potential, and financial results.

Vision: Anything related to the airline’s direction and vision of the future, such as innovation, value proposition, and expertise.

Analysis of the perceptions of 1,534 people based in the UK, UAE, KSA, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, found that Products and Services was the most influential factor in shaping people’s perception of an airline. Similarly, the study showed that Products and Services was also the biggest driver of coverage, accounting for 70% of traditional media and 65% of social media posts.

Carma also found that Products and Services was a more influential category than Conduct, Performance or Culture. This suggests that by continuing to offer new and innovative services onboard, airlines can maintain or even improve their reputation, helping to influence purchasing decisions.

Regional variations

Carma also found notable variations in how different regions value reputational factors. Notably, in the UK, airline reputation scores were not found to directly align with the volume of media coverage. For instance, Emirates received the best overall score in the region, despite a relatively low amount of traditional media coverage.

Whereas British Airways, despite having the lowest reputation score, was rated the highest in terms of likelihood of usage. This indicates the need for a greater and more positive exposure of BA’s products and services in the media to strengthen its brand reputation.

Meanwhile, in Asia, Singapore Airlines stood out from the pack as the most reputable airline. Notably, the airline scored highly in the Products and Services category, reinforcing the importance of this pillar. However, reputation again wasn’t found to be the most important factor in terms of likelihood of usage. Despite being rated as the most reputable airline, Singapore Airlines was only rated third for likelihood of usage.

Finally, in the UAE and KSA, Carma’s report found that the Middle East-based airlines received the most positivity from the media and audiences. Unsurprisingly, Emirates led the way with the highest reputation score, but was closely followed by Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and Saudia. Similarly to the other regions, the top airlines in terms of reputation also scored highly in Products and Services.

Given the importance of Products and Services on airline reputation score, investing in new and innovative onboard experiences will be essential for airlines moving forward. For airlines looking to bolster their interior products, services and onboard offering, Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) remains the event to attend.

As the world’s leading platform for airlines and cabin interiors professionals, AIX showcases products from all aspects of the cabin, from lighting, seating, galley equipment, and LEDs, to cabin management systems, IFEC hardware, and communications.

Aviation’s sustainability challenge: navigating expectations

Many consumers are aware of aviation’s impact on the environment, and look to fly with airlines that prioritise making sustainable choices and continually improvements. A recent survey from an international aerospace company found that 65% of respondents believe it is time for sustainable air travel. The survey found that 70% of all respondents from across the UK, US, France and Germany are concerned about the role of aviation in climate change.

But what does the media landscape look like when it comes to airline sustainability news? Over the course of 2024, Carma (which analysed over 55,000 articles in the mainstream media) identified six key spikes in activity.

The data showed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) dominated much of the media coverage when it comes to sustainable aviation stories. However, in reality, the landscape for this is much larger. Though SAF is certainly part of the narrative, many airlines are taking significant steps to reduce their carbon emissions and minimise their impact on the environment through sustainable aircraft interiors.

The coverage suggests that there is a huge window of opportunity for airlines to gain a competitive advantage by promoting and generating wider awareness of other sustainability initiatives, whether that be the introduction of lightweight seating, or the use of more recycled materials on-board.

Key media moments in 2024:

09 April: Sustainability was listed as “one of the most pressing issues in aviation” ahead of the 2024 Future Aviation Forum.

03 June: The need to switch to sustainable aviation fuel was highlighted as a key cost to factor in for airlines as demand recovers from Covid-19.

25 June: There was a wave of coverage after Lufthansa, Europe’s biggest airline group, announced it would introduce a surcharge of up to €72 per flight in 2025 to cover the costs of switching to alternative fuels necessary to lower emissions.

07 August: Virgin Atlantic was the subject of significant (largely negative) media coverage after its fuel advert was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which ruled it to be “misleading”.

18 September: Climate technology firm, Air Company, announced that it had secured backing from aviation fuel supplier, Avfuel, in its latest funding round as it looks to convert carbon dioxide into more climate-friendly products.

31 October: There was a spike in news coverage when China-based airline, Xiamen Airlines won the APEX World-Class Airline award, and the company cited ‘Caring for the Earth’ as one of its three core pillars.

Now let’s take a closer look at the news coverage. Excluding sustainable aviation fuel, if we break down the coverage, we can see that:

Collaborations were another significant driver of sustainability coverage, making up 32% of articles.

Events were the focus of 16% of all sustainability articles.

Greenwashing only accounted for 2% of all sustainability articles.

Additionally, if we examine the statistics for sentiment around sustainability news coverage overall, we can see that:

Positive coverage accounted for 53%

Neutral coverage accounted for 25%

Negative coverage accounted for 22%

In terms of geographical distribution, Carma’s data showed that (out of the areas analysed) the top five countries for sustainability coverage included:

UK coverage accounted for 37%

US coverage accounted for 36%

United Arab Emirates coverage accounted for 18%

Singapore coverage accounted for 6%

Malaysia coverage accounted for 4%

Looking at the news coverage in more detail, it is clear that partnerships were very effective at boosting sustainability messaging. Some of the most notable examples of stories in 2024 included:

24 January: Lufthansa Group chose Viasat to install the European Aviation Network (EAN) in-flight connectivity solution.

The articles specifically highlighted how the EAN allows Lufthansa Group to both save money and be more sustainable on its flights because of its ‘small, low weight, low-drag terminals’.

01 May: Turkish Airlines, Airbus and Rolls-Royce entered into a partnership for workforce and innovation.

01 October: Qatar Airways Group announced plans to acquire a minority 25% equity stake in Virgin Australia.

This is an interesting example as the focus isn’t solely on sustainability, but is linked to it largely by spokespeople quoted in the articles.

It is worth noting that in much of the partnership news, sustainability wasn’t the crux of the story. However, as explained above, the sustainability messaging was boosted through spokesperson quotes, indicating the importance of maximising these opportunities for airlines.

Greenwashing was a theme throughout the year, but it did not penetrate news coverage all that widely, appearing in only 2% of all sustainability coverage. Notably, the stories did translate into social media activity in a way other sustainability topics did not. A key example of this was an announcement from the EU it would be investigating 20 carriers for potential ‘greenwashing’. Data from Carma also indicated that the US is more engaged with the topic of greenwashing than any other country.

Exploring social media

When looking into social media activity throughout 2024, there appears to be very little crossover between the top news coverage and social media posts. The lack of continuity between the platforms suggests a potential window of opportunity for airlines to drive further traction in sharing their sustainability stories on social media. From a reputation perspective, there is more that could be done to drive these new stories and translate them into positive conversations on social media.

Spotlighting sustainable cabin interiors

Despite a complex media landscape, airlines across the globe are increasingly investing in a variety of products, strategies and initiatives which are helping to reduce their environmental impact. However, given the data at hand, it seems that many of the top stories are consistently neglecting to mention some of the most innovative strategies for reducing carbon emissions inside the cabin. Sustainable aircraft interiors are a particularly un-reported area in the media.

Some of the most common themes, products and strategies being employed in sustainable aircraft interiors include lightweighting. For airlines, this involves the process of reducing the overall weight of the aircraft, its components and materials, primarily through the use of lighter materials and optimised designs to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. There are a number of different methods of lightweighting, which include lighter weight paint, aircraft seating, galleys, and flooring.

Despite the topic of sustainable aviation gaining significant traction in the media, it is clear that an important segment within sustainability – cabin interiors – is going underrepresented in the news. The aircraft interiors industry is tackling the challenge of sustainability in a variety of ways, which are not being reported on in any great detail in the mainstream national or business media. However, these solutions are being invested in, and they are helping to drive the future of aviation through the medium of sustainable interiors.

Accessibility in aviation: a growing imperative

For airlines, sustainability is not the only ethical concern that they must address. In recent years, discussions around inclusivity and accessibility in aviation have significantly intensified. This growing focus is driven by a greater awareness of the diverse needs of passengers and increasing pressure from a range of industry stakeholders, including affected passengers and their advocates.

Slowly but surely, this pressure is leading to change within the industry. This growing focus also aligns with the importance of the Conduct pillar in airline reputation – the second most important factor – as it underlines the significance of how airlines manage their relationships with passengers. Accessibility accounts for 1.2% of airline coverage, and 2% of social media posts.

Airlines are increasingly recognising that accessibility is a crucial factor, intrinsically linked to their conduct. There is a growing demand for airlines to adapt and innovate to meet the evolving expectations of all passengers, including those with physical disabilities, limited mobility, non-visible disabilities, and neurodiverse differences. This is driving investment in training, infrastructure and technology, to ensure a more equitable and comfortable travel experience, demonstrating a commitment to treating all passengers with fairness and respect.

But what does the media landscape look like around accessibility in aviation? Exploring the data for sentiment around accessibility news coverage, we can see that differs significantly from sustainability, with the vast majority of articles having a neutral sentiment:

Neutral coverage accounted for 61%

Positive coverage accounted for 30%

Negative coverage accounted for 9%

In terms of geographical distribution, Carma’s data found that (out of the countries analysed) the top five countries for accessibility coverage included:

UK coverage accounted for 43%

US coverage accounted for 37%

United Arab Emirates coverage accounted for 11%

French coverage accounted for 6%

Saudi Arabian coverage accounted for 3%

According to data from the Carma platform, the biggest spike in reporting was on the 26th September, as major airline, Virgin Atlantic, announced it would be stepping up its efforts to help deaf and hard-of-hearing travellers, with initiatives including special training for more of its crew.

The story was widely reported across UK publications – with 197 total articles on this in a single day. An important factor in the widespread coverage can likely be attributed to the airline partnering with deaf Gladiators star Jodie Ounsley, and deaf twins and content creators, Hermon and Heroda Berhane.

This collaboration not only put a human face to the airline’s accessibility initiatives, but also amplified the message through the reach and influence of these popular public figures, demonstrating the positive impact of working closely with disabled people, and ensuring greater visibility for the story.

While Virgin’s story gained the greatest traction in the media, there were a number of other stories less widely reported, which shared important updates on the state of accessibility in the airline industry. It is worth noting that the stories around airline accessibility for passengers with physical disabilities or limited mobility were generally more widely covered than the stories discussing accessible changes for neurodiverse passengers or those with invisible disabilities. Another point to observe is that these stories were picked up largely by the aviation and aircraft interiors trade media, as opposed to the national or business media.

Additional coverage on the topic of accessibility included:

The news that Delta Flight Products (DFP), in collaboration with AirForAll – a consortium of design and disability advocate organisations based in the UK – announced the launch of several new accessibility-focus products for the airline industry; including seating systems that allow users to remain in their own wheelchair for the entire journey, and an accessible toilet that accommodates an onboard wheelchair and up to two attendants.

United Airlines announced its collaboration with the United Spinal Association. The partnership was focused on improving the travel experience for customers with disabilities. The airline will be working together with United Spinal to explore future solutions and collaborate with its community of experts to harness their valuable feedback and help better meet the specific needs of customers who use wheelchairs.

In January 2025, Emirates announced it was set to be ‘the world’s first Autism Certified Airline’. Formally awarded by the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (IBCCES), in practice this means over 30,000 staff will be undergoing specialised autism and sensory awareness training. The airline will also be introducing ‘sensory guides’ and sensory products for neurodiverse passengers.

At the end of 2024, Alaska Airlines reported its improved practices for enhanced accessibility for travellers. The airline’s Disability Office teamed up with the Autism Society and port authorities to host a disability practice flight in Portland. The event gave guests with disabilities the chance to practice everything from navigating the airport, to going through security and even simulating a flight.

Reports of crews damaging passengers’ wheelchairs, and other similar issues, was another key theme in accessibility coverage. Again, it is worth noting that these stories were covered by UK national media, as opposed to trade titles. For instance:

20 February: Furious passenger blasts American Airlines and Delta after TWO wheelchairs were damaged and destroyed during separate trips in the same year.

01 May: ‘Degraded’ wheelchair user, 15, forced to shuffle up plane stairs and British Airways lost specialist chair.

29 September: Disabled traveller left ‘housebound’ for months after airline error.

04 December: Gatwick: Holiday ‘ruined’ after wheelchair broke on EasyJet plane.

Notably, Paralyzed Veterans of America’s response to a US Department of Transportation fine against American Airlines for its “unsafe and undignified treatment of passengers with disabilities who use mobility devices” accounted for 81% of the negative news coverage on this topic.

Other incidents also garnered significant coverage. In April, Southwest Airlines received substantial attention for poorly handling athletes’ wheelchairs on flights. The issue stemmed from a lack of communication, leading to the wheelchairs being disassembled despite the passengers’ requests, and then being presented to them in pieces at the end of the flight.

Notably, the coverage around wheelchairs specifically, as opposed to general accessibility articles, was far more negative than the average data set. For social media articles mentioning airlines and wheelchairs, the sentiment was as follows:

Negative coverage accounted for 49%

Neutral coverage accounted for 27%

Positive coverage accounted for 24%

Meanwhile, the majority of the corresponding news coverage mentioning wheelchairs was neutral, due to comments from spokespeople balancing out the overall sentiment of the articles. For example, in the case of Southwest Airlines, when the airline was accused of poorly handling athletes’ wheelchairs, the company’s statement effectively denied the charge.

While social media coverage of the incident may have been negative, the inclusion of the airline’s response in news articles contributed to a more neutral sentiment overall. This demonstrates how airline communication can influence the tone of media reports, even when the initial incident generates negative public reaction.

But what does all this media coverage really tell us? While in comparison to other topics, accessibility isn’t proving to have cut through the ‘noise’ of the media in the same way, it seems that the impact of a negative story – particularly when discussed on social media – can attract significant attention and potentially be hugely impactful to airline reputation.

When faced with negative accessibility coverage, airlines need to do more than just react. The data indicates that a crucial element of effective reputation management is proactively ensuring the inclusion of company spokespeople in media reports. This allows airlines to actively participate in shaping the narrative.

Therefore, airlines should adopt a proactive communication strategy that prioritises the inclusion of their spokespeople in accessibility-related reporting. By providing spokespeople to offer context, address concerns, and articulate the airline’s position, they can exert greater control over the narrative and mitigate the potential damage of negative coverage.

Maksim Jurkov, head of design at aviation innovator, J&C Aero, explains that when it comes to accessibility, regulations play an important role. He highlights the ‘FAA DOT requirements (14 CFR 382.65)’, which demand “Non-discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel” and that “the industry needs to transport persons with reduced mobility (PRM) while maintaining a reasonable level of accessibility during the flight phase.”

He adds, “The key industry players are actively working on accessibility for both linefit and retrofit programmes. Accessibility for persons with limitations on an aeroplane is a must, not an option, as it ensures safety, dignity, and equal opportunity for all travellers – for example, having accessible restrooms and boarding assistance allows everyone to travel independently and comfortably. Without it, people are unfairly excluded and face unnecessary risks or barriers.”

While regulations are essential, accessibility in aircraft interiors is more than just a requirement. It is a commitment to all passengers and to creating a truly inclusive flying experience for everyone on board.

Conclusion

This review of airline reputation sets out a roadmap for airlines, identifying the six key pillars on which an airline reputation is built. By focusing on each pillar of the reputation methodology, and the strategic adjustments that can be made within each area, airlines can significantly improve their overall reputation.

It is clear that there will be opportunities to gain a competitive advantage over competitors by focusing on sustainability initiatives – particularly by implementing those in the cabin, as reputation is largely driven by the Products and Services pillar.

By investing in innovative solutions that transform the cabin, airlines will be able to further strengthen their reputation, not only through products and service offerings, but through the creation of a collective vision which positions the airlines as leaders in responsible air travel.

Though accessibility is not an individual element within the six pillars of the ‘Reputation by Carma’ report, it does play an important role in the conduct pillar. Not to mention, as more and more accessible aircraft interior solutions enter the market, it’s becoming a growing priority for airlines.

There’s also an increasing amount of media coverage and social media discussion around the topic. By using the media to their advantage, airlines can improve their reputation through the spotlighting of accessible interiors solutions.

The data highlighted in this report illustrates an ecosystem of conversations around sustainability and accessibility in the traditional media and on social media. While neither topic may be dominating the media in the same way that some other aviation topics are, it is clear that the impact of these stories can be significant in affecting consumer views and perceptions.

Wizz Air stated that this new roadmap aligns with the targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from international air travel by 2050.
However, in its announcement, Wizz Air pointed out that the aviation industry’s ambition heavily relies on the large-scale production of technology that is not yet fully developed.

The new plan anticipates a nearly 90% reduction in the airline’s own emissions, with the majority of this decrease expected to come from the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reports ESG today.

Wizz Air stated that this new roadmap aligns with the targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from international air travel by 2050.

However, in its announcement, Wizz Air pointed out that the aviation industry’s ambition heavily relies on the large-scale production of technology that is not yet fully developed. The airline emphasized that its own plan prioritizes SAF and advancements in aircraft technology over relying on unproven technologies and carbon offsetting schemes, unlike the plans of some other airlines.

Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air Corporate & ESG Officer, commented, “Wizz Air supports an ambitious vision for net zero, but the truth is that the current pace of change is not enough, and without radical intervention, aviation will fail to meet its commitments.”

Fuel consumption accounts for the vast majority of emissions in the aviation sector. SAF, typically produced from sustainable sources like waste oils and agricultural leftovers, is considered a crucial tool for reducing carbon emissions in the airline industry in the short to medium term. SAF producers estimate that these fuels can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 85% compared to traditional jet fuel.

However, efforts to significantly increase the use of SAF by airlines face considerable challenges, including the limited supply currently available and prices that are much higher than conventional fossil fuels. In 2024, SAF accounted for only about 0.5% of global commercial fuel use.

Wizz Air stated that SAF is the “cornerstone” of its net-zero plan, with the airline aiming for a 53% reduction in carbon emissions through increased SAF usage. The company stressed the need for governments to take action to boost SAF production through long-term policies and incentives to bridge the price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

In addition to increasing SAF usage, Wizz Air’s plan outlines other key ways to reduce emissions. The company aims for a 21% reduction through technological improvements in aircraft and engine technology, 7% through renewing its fleet with newer, more efficient aircraft, 4% through reforms in air traffic management, and 2% through operational efficiencies.

Wizz Air’s own climate goals include reducing its carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Moynihan added, “We need action, not just ambition. That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net zero possible. Aviation needs a policy and investment revolution to shape the industry’s path.”

JetZero's Z4 blended wing body or ""all wing"" design has the potential to enhance passenger experience and improve fuel efficiency by up to 50%2

JetZero was awarded a $235 million contract by the U.S. Air Force to fast-track the development of its commercial demonstrator with first flight expected in 2027

CHICAGO, April 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- United today announced an investment in blended wing body (BWB) aircraft start-up JetZero. The company is creating an aircraft design that has the potential to deliver jet fuel efficiency and a greatly enhanced customer experience. The investment includes a path to order up to 100 airplanes and an option for an additional 100. The conditional purchase agreement is based on JetZero achieving development milestones, including flight of a full-scale demonstrator in 2027, among other conditions, including that the aircraft meet United's safety, business and operating requirements.

JetZero's innovative design reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan, which could lead to as much as 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger mile compared to a similar sized aircraft. The technology could potentially help United lower its carbon emissions while reducing the cost of operations. In 2023, the U.S. Air Force announced a $235 million contract to JetZero to fast-track the development of JetZero's full scale demonstrator. The JetZero Z4 airplane is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel, with propulsion systems able to utilize sustainable aviation fuel blends.

""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,"" said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV). ""United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.""

""United's investment in our company signals the industry's belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,"" said Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. ""JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.""

Both the airplane's shape, and the way JetZero plans to enter the plane into service, address industry pain points. The design contributes to a more efficient operation due to its shape and the higher altitude at which it will fly. For instance, a flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain would use up to 45 percent less fuel compared to the twin-aisle aircraft that operate that route today. The airplane also is expected to integrate readily into today's airport infrastructure, requiring no new accommodations for jet bridges, runways or taxiways.

The aircraft design has the potential to also offer improvements to the passenger experience like flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat. Additionally, the design streamlines the boarding process with a main boarding door that is wider than that of a comparably sized aircraft, leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution. It may further enhance accessibility by featuring wider aisles and handicap-accessible lavatories, creating a comfortable travel environment for all passengers and in-flight crew.

JetZero's agreement with the Air Force focuses on advancing airframe technology and capabilities, showcasing its potential, and providing the Department of Defense and commercial industry more options to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Several military aircraft configurations can be made with this design, including air transport and refueling tanker variants, which collectively account for approximately 60% of the Air Force's total annual jet fuel consumption.

United's corporate venture capital fund, United Airlines Ventures, enables the airline to invest in emerging companies that have the potential to influence the future of travel. UAV has made investments in start-ups developing innovative technologies that have the potential to revolutionize aerospace developments, create value for customers and United's operation and complement United's goal of net zero emissions by 2050. UAV has made a number of alternative aircraft investments including:

+34 91 753 87 87 Bunge Bunge News Bureau Tel.","Repsol and Bunge (NYSE: BG) today announced a major milestone in the development of renewable fuels in Europe: the incorporation of intermediate novel crops in the production of renewable fuels. Specifically, camelina and safflower will be processed into low-carbon intensity oils and used as feedstock to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a fully compatible drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel, or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the decarbonization of air travel. This marks a significant step forward in feedstock innovation to produce renewable fuels in Europe.

Intermediate novel crops expand the available pool of low-carbon intensity feedstocks to produce renewable fuel, with emission reductions of up to 90% compared to conventional diesel. Repsol will utilize advanced technology in its industrial assets to convert these oils into renewable fuel, creating a new pathway for the development of renewable fuels in Spain.

The companies recently closed their previously announced transaction and are committed to ongoing research and development to explore further low-carbon feedstock opportunities to boost the supply of advanced renewable fuels, including sourcing novel seeds from Spanish farmers.

“We are committed to be the best-in-class partner to provide innovative solutions and support farmers’ efforts in low carbon agriculture. Through industry collaborations, we are adding new oil sources to our global supply chains and investing in processing plants with greater ability to handle and process these crops, expanding our offerings of cost-effective, sustainable feedstocks to customers worldwide,” said Julio Garros, Co-President, Agribusiness at Bunge. ""We are pleased to partner with Repsol to create clear and scalable paths to support the decarbonization of the industry.""

“Renewable fuels are a fundamental pillar for Repsol on our road to becoming zero net emissions by 2050, and intermediate crops must play a key role in guaranteeing the supply of the low-carbon feedstocks necessary to produce these fuels. Our strategic alliance with Bunge, a world leader in the vegetable oils production sector, strengthens our capacity to achieve our shared vision of decarbonizing industry and mobility in the most efficient way,” said Juan Abascal, Repsol’s executive managing director of Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy.

Leveraging its extensive network of farmer relationships and expertise in oilseed processing, Bunge is developing value-chain partnerships to promote the adoption of intermediate novel crops in many regions of the world, and is offering a progressive portfolio of readily available, high-performing options.

It enables flow of trade, investment, labour and tourism, which will contribute to our prosperity.","Having acquired AGS Airports, which operates Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton Airports in January, AviAlliance has confirmed a £350 million investment in the sustainable growth of the three UK airports.

AviAlliance, a wholly owned subsidiary of one of Canada’s largest pension investors – PSP Investments, completed the £1.53 billion acquisition of the airport group earlier this year and on Wednesday outlined plans of what will be the single largest capital investment programme in AGS since it was formed in 2014.

Airport transformation

Plans to accelerate the decarbonisation and future growth of the three regional airports include a comprehensive transformation of Glasgow Airport’s main terminal building to accommodate anticipated passenger growth and improve operational and retail facilities, as well as upgrades to airfield infrastructure and energy efficiency initiatives.

Meanwhile, Southampton Airport, which underwent a 164-m runway extension in 2023 will now also undergo redevelopment works within its terminal. Aberdeen Airport, which is also home to Europe’s largest heliport primarily for the offshore industry transporting passengers and cargo between the Scottish hub and oil rigs in the North Sea, will also benefit from improvements to its airfield infrastructure.

Boos for trade and tourism

Underlining the critical role that AGS plays in driving economic and social prosperity across Scotland and the UK, Kam Jandu AGS Airports CEO explained the investment will help facilitate the accelerated growth of AGS which supports more than 30,000 jobs and generates in excess of £2 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) for the UK economy every year. Jandu, who was formerly CEO of Budapest Airport where he worked for 15 years, was named CEO of the airport group when AviAlliance completed its acquisition in January.

“We have ambitious plans for the long-term sustainable growth of our airports including the strengthening of our connectivity, which underpins the success of the regions we serve,” he said. “This significant investment will not only enhance the fabric of our airports, it will enhance the role they currently play in facilitating trade and tourism, and importantly in generating meaningful employment across the country.”

Jandu also welcomed Charles Hammond OBE as the new Chair of AGS. A qualified lawyer, Hammond was previously Chief Executive of Forth Ports, in which AviAlliance is also a majority stakeholder. Hammond revealed he is “relishing the opportunity of working with the AGS board, to ensure AGS can play an even greater role in supporting our regions to boost trade and tourism.”

Sustainable growth

Deputy First Minister of Scotland, Kate Forbes (pictured with Kam Jandu) reinforced that the investment will bring huge benefits to the wider economy through improved infrastructure. “Good international connectivity is key to economic growth in Scotland. It enables flow of trade, investment, labour and tourism, which will contribute to our prosperity. Additionally, the commitment to sustainability is welcome as we progress towards a net zero future.”

All three airports achieved carbon neutrality status on the Airport Carbon Accreditation initiative for the emissions under their direct control (Scopes 1 and 2) in 2020. The aim is to achieve net zero carbon for indirect emission by the mid-2030s through the decarbonisation of cars and public transport, the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and aircraft fuel efficiency programmes, as well as the decarbonisation of third part owned and operated operational vehicles and the deployment of fixed electric ground power and electric tugs to replace aircraft taxiing. The group’s sustainability strategy is based on three pillars: achieving net zero by the mid-2030s; supporting and enhancing the economic and social benefits of the communities each airport serves; and supporting its staff through providing good employment conditions, respecting diversity and equal opportunities for all staff.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kam-Jandu-and-Kate-Forbes-at-Glasgow-Airport-.jpg,N,,2025-04-24 07:56:44.204441

This announcement was made during a feasibility study workshop on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), held in Entebbe. The event was organized by UCAA in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), with support from the Government of the United Kingdom.

According to the United States Department of Energy, SAF is a renewable jet fuel that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Its adoption is aimed at enhancing environmental protection and mitigating aviation’s contribution to climate change.

SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, plant oils, agricultural residue, and captured carbon dioxide. It is typically blended with traditional fossil jet fuel, with the blending ratio influenced by availability and cost considerations—given the high production costs of SAF when used on its own.

The global aviation industry is pursuing the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with SAF seen as a cornerstone of that transition. ICAO reports that over 360,000 commercial flights have already utilized SAF at 46 airports globally, mainly in the United States and Europe.

While aviation currently accounts for approximately 2% of global CO₂ emissions—and 12% of emissions from the transport sector—SAF has the potential to cut carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fuels.

In his opening address at the workshop, UCAA Director General Fred K. Bamwesigye reaffirmed Uganda’s commitment to the global net-zero emissions target by 2050. He emphasized the country’s proactive role in supporting ICAO’s environmental agenda, particularly through the promotion of SAF and cleaner energy alternatives.

The workshop brought together stakeholders from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, airline operators, fuel suppliers, and academic institutions. Its objective was to assess Uganda’s capacity to produce and integrate SAF into its aviation framework.

“This initiative offers tremendous potential—not only to improve environmental sustainability but also to generate socio-economic benefits throughout the country,” Bamwesigye noted.

Speaking at the recent Uganda-UK Trade and Business Forum in Kampala, UK High Commissioner to Uganda Lisa Chesney stressed the importance of SAF compliance as Uganda Airlines expands into European airspace. She highlighted the European Union’s SAF mandate, known as ReFuelEU Aviation, which requires airlines to incorporate SAF into 2% of their fuel use by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050.

This regulation is central to the EU’s broader climate goals of reducing aviation-related emissions.

Uganda Airlines CEO Jennifer Bamuturaki assured stakeholders that the airline is prepared to meet these sustainability requirements. She noted that the London route, in particular, will be served by one of the most modern aircraft with minimal emissions, in line with international airport standards.",https://govinfohub.go.ug/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-1.png,N,,2025-04-24 05:56:12.914497
,,2025-04-24 07:00:59+00:00,www.farmprogress.com,Corn-based sustainable aviation fuel: New market for Illinois farmers - Farm Progress,Ava Splear,,,,,https://www.farmprogress.com/corn/corn-based-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emerges-as-promising-market-for-illinois-farmers,"New market: Sustainable aviation fuel According to IL Corn, about 30% of corn grown in Illinois, or 657 million bushels, is used for ethanol production annually.
As a pilot himself, Gould says farmers need to watch what’s coming down the pipeline for sustainable aviation fuel.
At the Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in March, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both pledged to replace 10% of their fuel usage with SAF by 2030.
“We have existing refiners and other companies looking to locate near our ethanol industry to produce sustainable aviation fuel product,” Stotler says.
As a potential replacement for the 30 billion-gallon-a-year U.S. jet fuel market, SAF “could be a large opportunity for our domestic feedstocks,” Stotler says.","What if you could grow corn, drive a truck powered by ethanol and fly a plane with corn-based fuel? For Maple Park, Ill., farmer and FedEx pilot Chris Gould, that could actually happen.

“It would be cool to be burning the product I’m growing,” says Gould, who also serves as an Illinois Corn Growers Association director.

The possibility is not far off, he says, pointing to several new developments in legislation, facilities, company pledges and sustainability goals that are driving change in corn’s future as a renewable energy source. Farming — and flying — from the heart of the Corn Belt, Gould has a front-row seat.

Changes to E15 legislation

Earlier this year, U.S. EPA announced that E15 will be available year-round for seven states — Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin — starting April 28. Prior to this, EPA had to issue a waiver for pumps in those states to offer E15 from June through September.

Gould says year-round availability for E15 in seven states is helpful for an increase in corn demand, but nationwide access to E15 year-round would have a much larger impact.

“Any increased demand is good,” Gould says.

In Congress, a bill exists called the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025, which would allow year-round access to E15 nationwide. According to IL Corn, if passed, this bill would equate to an additional 133 million bushels of corn demand for U.S. farmers.

Legislation for year-round availability is ideal, and Gould is optimistic that the change can happen because E15 has bipartisan support.

E15 previously required a waiver to be sold during summer months because it doesn’t meet Reid Vapor Pressure requirements under the Clean Air Act. Ethanol emissions increase during the summer months due to higher temperatures. According to the Congressional Research Service, seven consecutive fuel waivers have been signed, meaning that E15 has been available year-round for the last seven years in those seven states.

This change in legislation is in stark contrast to the electric vehicle mandates prioritized under the Biden administration. According to EPA, one previous proposal projected that electric vehicles would make up 67% of newly manufactured light-duty vehicles and 46% of medium-duty vehicles by 2032.

New market: Sustainable aviation fuel

According to IL Corn, about 30% of corn grown in Illinois, or 657 million bushels, is used for ethanol production annually. Ethanol is an established market for corn, and new ways to use ethanol continue to develop. As a pilot himself, Gould says farmers need to watch what’s coming down the pipeline for sustainable aviation fuel.

“Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to be a massive market for corn,” Gould says, explaining that SAF can’t compete in the short term with petroleum jet fuel because it’s more expensive and its production is inefficient. It takes about 1.6 gallons of ethanol to produce 1 gallon of SAF. However, with time and continued research to build the SAF industry, eventually it will become more competitive and beneficial to corn farmers.

Still, it is possible to use SAF as a jet fuel alternative now. In the European Union, there are already mandates in place for using SAF in small quantities.

The global airline industry burns 100 billion gallons of jet fuel each year, and the U.S. accounts for 30% of that, or nearly 30 billion gallons. According to IL Corn, SAF has the potential to be a 30 billion-gallon-per-year market in the U.S., if petroleum jet fuel is replaced with the sustainable fuel.

At the Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in March, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both pledged to replace 10% of their fuel usage with SAF by 2030. For American Airlines, this means it would need 400 million gallons of SAF to reach the pledged 10% in a single year.

And United Airlines? The company pledges to be net-zero by 2050, which means using all SAF. According to United, the SAF it uses “has up to 85% lower greenhouse gas emissions than regular jet fuel.”

Many airline companies have made ambitious pledges to take steps to meet sustainability goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Even with these pledges, it will take time to establish the infrastructure, legislation, supply chain and growing practices required to meet them.

Gould says more production plants will be required to meet the demand for these pledges.

“There are a couple technologies right now that are being developed to commercialize the production of sustainable aviation fuel,” says Brad Stotler, director of government affairs at IL Corn.

One of these technologies is refiners turning renewable diesel fuels made from vegetable oil into SAF. Another technology takes ethanol products made with low carbon-intensity practices and turns them into SAF, also known as Alcohol-to-Jet.

Although corn is one of the major sources of renewable feedstocks used for SAF, other sources include waste fats, greases and oils.

SAF finds home in Illinois

Stotler says Illinois is poised to be a leader in the SAF industry as it grows. According to Gould and Stotler, Illinois makes a good spot to house this new industry because of the large supply of corn and a strong transportation infrastructure, including nine international airports and all Class I railroads touching the state. In addition, a large amount of research is conducted at educational institutions across the state, and a tax credit in Illinois makes it more economically feasible.

“We have existing refiners and other companies looking to locate near our ethanol industry to produce sustainable aviation fuel product,” Stotler says.

Look no further than this list of companies that have announced plans to build SAF plants in Illinois:

Both Marquis Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Avina Clean Hydrogen project they’ll produce up to 120 million gallons of SAF at each of their facilities annually.

Although SAF likely will be a large market in the long term, many logistics still must be figured out, such as what practices will need to be implemented during corn production for it to qualify for use in SAF.

“The scope of the potential market is large,” Stotler says, noting that the Renewable Fuel Standard is 20-some billion gallons. When the RFS was passed in 2007, the demand for ethanol increased and corn prices boomed. As a potential replacement for the 30 billion-gallon-a-year U.S. jet fuel market, SAF “could be a large opportunity for our domestic feedstocks,” Stotler says.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt3c3e1109f78fc2f8/68091f8ae2bc460c8eb1d754/0421W1-3241a-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-24 03:56:17.213255

Investments and strategic partnerships To enable the planned use of SAF, Wizz Air has already entered into long-term partnerships.","The Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air addressed politicians and industry with compelling words in a public appearance in Budapest on March 22, 2025. The occasion was the presentation of its future plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Under the title ""Flying Towards Net Zero,"" the company presented an ambitious roadmap based on five key pillars. The airline, which describes itself as a pioneer in European air transport, sees itself not only as a trailblazer but also as a warning voice.

The international aviation industry had already agreed years ago to become climate-neutral by 2050, as part of the goals of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, according to Wizz Air, there is currently little sign of this goal. On the contrary: progress in reducing emissions has stalled. According to the company, this is primarily due to the slow industrial development and availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is considered a key technology for a lower-emission future.

""Everyone talks about SAF as the most promising way to reduce emissions, but the truth is: there simply isn't enough of it. And what is available is far too expensive,"" explained Yvonne Moynihan, ESG and Corporate Responsibility Officer at Wizz Air. The industry's expectations were based on an overly optimistic assessment of production capacity.

The five pillars of the roadmap

Wizz Air bases its “Net Zero” plan on five concrete measures:

53 percent emission reduction through SAF

The greatest contribution is to be achieved through the use of sustainable aviation fuel. However, the company believes this will require a massive expansion of production infrastructure and targeted government support.

21 percent through technological innovations

According to the plan, advances in aircraft and engine development should also contribute to emissions reduction. A particular focus is on more efficient turbines and aerodynamically improved fuselage designs.

7 percent through fleet renewal

The continuous modernization of the company's own fleet, for example by replacing older models with the more fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo, is another component of the concept.

4 percent through air traffic management reforms

According to Wizz Air, more efficient flight routing and better coordination in European airspace could also save a significant amount of emissions.

2 percent through operational optimizations

These include measures such as reduced ground running times, optimized loading and maintenance improvements.

Investments and strategic partnerships

To enable the planned use of SAF, Wizz Air has already entered into long-term partnerships. These include an agreement with the British company Firefly Green Fuels, which intends to build a production facility in Essex. Wizz Air will source up to 15 tons of SAF from this facility over 525.000 years. A partnership also exists with the Finnish producer Neste, which is expected to supply 36.000 tons annually.

These contracts demonstrate that Wizz Air is willing to make advance payments. However, the tone of the event was that one airline alone cannot handle this transformation.

European regulation under fire

A central point of criticism for the company is directed at current European regulatory policy. It argues that this policy places a significant financial burden on airlines and prevents necessary innovations through excessive bureaucracy. Wizz Air is therefore calling on governments and regulators to fundamentally reform the framework.

""We no longer need fine-sounding declarations of intent. It's time to act. Politicians must understand that the future of aviation will be secured not through regulations, but through targeted support,"" Moynihan emphasized.

Fleet policy with vision

In 2023, Wizz Air put a total of 32 new Airbus A321neo aircraft into service – aircraft that are not only more modern but also more fuel-efficient.

For example, if an AI system identifies a potential problem in the fuel injection system, it can alert ground crews to replace or recalibrate components before they cause fuel wastage. AI-driven maintenance tools also help extend the life of aircraft components by ensuring optimal usage conditions, contributing to long-term fuel savings and sustainability.

Beyond hardware, AI systems are also capable of analyzing maintenance logs, pilot reports, and weather data to identify correlations between flight conditions and system performance. This holistic view allows airlines to develop more targeted maintenance programs that optimize fuel usage while ensuring safety and compliance.

Revolutionizing Aviation Fuel Supply Chain Management

Managing the aviation fuel supply chain is a complex endeavor involving multiple stakeholders, strict regulations, and fluctuating demand patterns. AI is now playing a crucial role in streamlining supply chain operations and enhancing transparency. AI-based inventory management systems provide real-time visibility into fuel stocks at airports, enabling more accurate forecasting and procurement planning.

AI-powered platforms analyze historical consumption trends, seasonal patterns, and flight schedules to anticipate demand with high precision. This reduces instances of overstocking or fuel shortages, thereby minimizing wastage and associated costs. Moreover, AI algorithms can optimize fuel storage logistics by calculating the most efficient allocation of storage space and delivery routes.

In procurement and supplier management, AI tools evaluate vendor performance, assess contract compliance, and recommend negotiation strategies based on market trends. Automation of procurement tasks through AI also reduces administrative overhead and improves response times. For airlines operating in multiple jurisdictions, AI ensures regulatory compliance by generating accurate reports and flagging potential discrepancies.

One planned change will add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production capacity via coprocessing.","Heritage Aviation, along with Avfuel Corp.—a leading independent supplier of aviation fuel and services—is proud to announce the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport (KBTV).

In celebration of the new offering, Heritage Aviation—the 100% employee owned fixed-base operation (FBO) and FAA-certified 145 repair station responsible for servicing the airport’s general aviation aircraft—hosted the Honorable Mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, and Airport Director Nic Longo at its state-of-the-art, LEED Gold Standard facility on March 21.

This visit underscored the vital role Heritage Aviation plays in supporting Vermont’s aviation industry and the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, while recognizing the FBO for being at the forefront of sustainable aviation operations. Indeed, when Heritage Aviation welcomed its first load of SAF in February, it became Avfuel’s first customer in the Northeast U.S. to provide the new sustainable alternative to jet fuel and commit to its consistent availability.

“We were honored to welcome Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak to our facility, showcasing the dedication and expertise of our employee-owners, and our commitment to sustainability and the next generation of fuel,” said Matthew Collins, chief executive officer of Heritage Aviation. “We are thrilled to partner with Avfuel and to be its first branded FBO location in the Northeast to offer SAF, bringing the next generation of fuel to Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport.”

During the visit, Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak and Longo met with Heritage Aviation’s employee-owners to learn more about SAF, the company’s commitment to providing exceptional aviation services, fostering a culture of employee ownership, and embracing sustainable business practices. As an employee-owned business, Heritage Aviation exemplifies a model of shared success and long-term investment in the region’s economic development.

Heritage Aviation’s SAF from Avfuel—produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR)—is made using the HEFA SPK process, meaning it uses lipids, like used cooking oil, to produce the fuel, and can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel if used in its fully concentrated form. All SAF is required to be blended with jet fuel prior to delivery. With target blend percentages of 30% neat SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel, the SAF Avfuel delivers can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 24% when compared to conventional jet fuel alone.

“We are proud to partner with Heritage Aviation—Avfuel’s premier branded FBO partner in Burlington, Vermont (KBTV)—to bring SAF to the Northeast,” said C.R. Sincock, II, Avfuel’s executive vice president. “It’s a testament to the FBO’s pioneering spirit, and commitment to its community and sustainability efforts.”

Wizz Air has unveiled a bold £12 billion net-zero roadmap aimed at drastically cutting carbon emissions across Europe by 2050. Central to this strategy is a 53% reduction in emissions through the widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), alongside the deployment of one of the continent’s youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets, including the Airbus A321neo. This comprehensive initiative, titled Flying Towards Net-Zero, marks a major leap forward in sustainable air travel, reinforcing Wizz Air’s leadership in green aviation and its commitment to reshaping the future of European skies through innovation, investment, and environmental responsibility.

Wizz Air, recognised as EMEA’s most environmentally sustainable airline*, has launched its ambitious and detailed net-zero roadmap, titled Flying Towards Net-Zero, in a bold move to transform the European aviation sector. Backed by a £12 billion investment, the strategy focuses on three primary levers—Flights, Fuel, and Footprint—and offers a clear, data-driven path to decarbonisation. This comprehensive initiative responds to the urgent climate crisis and addresses the rising financial and regulatory pressures facing aviation. By investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), modern aircraft, and operational efficiency, Wizz Air not only reinforces its environmental commitment but also ensures long-term resilience and competitiveness across Europe’s skies.

Wizz Air Commits £12 Billion to Power the Future of Sustainable Aviation

The net-zero roadmap is a pillar of Wizz Air’s broader Customer First Compass initiative, representing one of the largest financial commitments made by a European low-cost airline toward sustainable aviation. With £12 billion allocated for fleet upgrades, SAF production, and digital optimisation tools, Wizz Air is positioning itself as a frontrunner in green innovation.

This comes at a time when climate ambitions across the aviation industry appear to be veering off course. With rising carbon regulations and stagnation in SAF availability and adoption, Wizz Air’s strategy realigns the sector’s trajectory toward realistic and immediate impact.

A Manifesto Built on Five Decarbonisation Pillars

At the core of Flying Towards Net-Zero are five strategic pillars that clearly outline how Wizz Air will reduce emissions in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)’s net-zero by 2050 goal:

53% emissions reduction through increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

21% via aircraft and engine innovation

7% from fleet renewal

4% through air traffic reform

2% from operational efficiencies and AI-based optimisation

This approach contrasts with airlines that heavily depend on carbon offsetting or speculative technologies. Instead, Wizz Air doubles down on proven, scalable solutions that can deliver tangible results within the decade.

Flights: Advancing Aviation Innovation with the Airbus A321neo

Wizz Air boasts the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleet in Europe, with a strong focus on the advanced Airbus A321neo as the backbone of its operations. These next-generation aircraft offer significant environmental advantages, including a 20% reduction in fuel consumption and up to 50% quieter engine performance compared to previous-generation models, reinforcing the airline’s commitment to cleaner, quieter, and more efficient air travel.

As part of its roadmap, Wizz Air aims to cut per-passenger emissions by 25% by 2030—a goal it is on track to meet through continuous investment in next-gen aircraft. However, reaching deeper levels of decarbonisation requires regulatory support for SAF-ready technologies and aircraft that can accommodate blends beyond the current 50% SAF limit.

Wizz Air is urging the aviation industry to accelerate innovation timelines and calls upon European policymakers to approve and fund research that fast-tracks technological readiness.

Fuel: Scaling SAF Production with Urgent Government Support

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plays a central role in Wizz Air’s decarbonisation strategy, accounting for the majority share of its projected carbon emissions cuts. But current global SAF production covers less than 1% of total aviation fuel demand. For SAF to deliver climate benefits at scale, production must ramp up tenfold by the early 2030s.

Wizz Air has taken a proactive role by investing in emerging SAF technologies, entering equity partnerships, and securing future offtake agreements. Still, it warns that government intervention is essential to make SAF affordable for low-cost carriers.

The airline advocates for a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan and SAF incentive frameworks that include tax breaks, guaranteed purchase agreements, and infrastructure grants to close the price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Footprint: Fixing Europe’s Broken Airspace

Air traffic inefficiencies are responsible for millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions each year. The fragmented airspace over Europe forces aircraft to take indirect routes, waste fuel, and suffer from delays. Reform in this area has lagged for decades.

Wizz Air is pushing for urgent reform in European air traffic management (ATM) and full implementation of the Single European Sky initiative. This alone could yield a 10% reduction in emissions across the continent.

Already, Wizz Air is deploying AI-powered tools to optimise route planning, reduce holding patterns, and improve turnaround times. But the airline argues that without cross-border ATM cooperation and regulatory overhaul, the aviation industry will fall short of its climate goals.

A Strategic Necessity, Not Just an Environmental Ideal

Wizz Air’s path to net-zero is far more than an environmental initiative—it’s a calculated move to address pressing business challenges. As climate regulations become more stringent and weather-related disruptions intensify, airlines that delay action risk financial consequences, loss of investor confidence, and damage to brand reputation.

By contrast, Wizz Air’s early mover advantage in green aviation enhances its brand value, investor confidence, and customer loyalty—especially among Gen Z and Millennial travellers who prioritise sustainable brands.

This strategy also improves operational resilience by future-proofing the airline against volatility in fossil fuel markets and aligning with the broader European Green Deal objectives.

Customer First Compass: Sustainability Meets Experience

Wizz Air’s Customer First Compass is a larger framework that goes beyond environmental targets to deliver value, convenience, and ethics across the travel journey. Sustainability is embedded at every customer touchpoint—from booking to disembarkation.

Examples include:

Eco-conscious digital check-in processes

Fuel-efficient aircraft scheduling

Transparent carbon footprint calculators

Inspiring travelers to support eco-friendly initiatives by redeeming their loyalty points for sustainability-focused projects.

The net-zero roadmap sits at the heart of this initiative, reflecting a belief that responsible travel and profitability can go hand-in-hand.

Call to Action for Governments, Industry, and Travellers

Wizz Air has taken a strong first step, but the success of Flying Towards Net-Zero hinges on collective industry action and political will. The airline urges:

Governments to introduce clear SAF mandates, subsidies, and infrastructure development plans.

Airspace regulators to implement the Single European Sky reforms and adopt AI-driven ATM.

Passengers to support sustainable travel by choosing airlines with concrete climate plans.

With all stakeholders aligned, the European aviation sector can become a global beacon for green air travel.

Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air Corporate and ESG Officer, said: “Wizz Air supports an ambitious vision for net-zero, but the truth is that the current pace of change is not enough, and without radical intervention, aviation will fail to meet its commitments.

“Achieving a net-zero roadmap is fraught with uncertainties. The most significant challenges extend beyond scientific issues and encompass policy decisions, investment strategies, market dynamics, and the timely implementation of essential measures. Scientific advancements also encounter obstacles related to cost, infrastructure, and regulatory approval.

“We need action, not just ambition. That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net-zero possible. Aviation needs a policy and investment revolution to shape the industry’s path.

“Flights. Fuel. Footprint. This is our commitment. This is our journey. This is how we fly towards net zero”.

Wizz Air has launched a £12 billion net-zero roadmap across Europe, aiming for greener skies by 2050 through 53% SAF emissions cuts and a modern Airbus A321neo fleet.

Conclusion: Leading EMEA Into a Clean-Skies Future

With its Flying Towards Net-Zero roadmap, Wizz Air has set a new gold standard for airline sustainability in Europe and beyond. By focusing on Flights, Fuel, and Footprint, and putting £12 billion behind its vision, the airline is tackling the climate crisis head-on while securing its competitive edge.

This roadmap proves that environmental responsibility and financial sustainability are not mutually exclusive. They are, in fact, mutually reinforcing.

As climate urgency intensifies and regulatory pressures mount, Wizz Air’s actions show that leadership in the aviation industry will belong to those who move first, think boldly, and invest wisely.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/aircraft-4-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-24 03:56:50.738792

Imagine smart cities, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles becoming even more integral in our daily lives. But here’s the unexpected part: liquid fuels like diesel and jet fuel will still be in high demand.

This may seem surprising, but it’s not. It’s a reflection of a sharp decrease in global poverty and global population growth.

Prosperity brings change

How much has global poverty decreased? According to the World Bank Group, it fell from 26.8% in 2002 to 9% two decades later.

This rise in prosperity has led to increased demand for the products ExxonMobil has been making for more than 150 years.

Add to that a growing population–about 25% more people in the world by 2050, by our estimates–and global energy demand is expected to rise even further.

With more people in more countries seeking access to transportation, the energy needed for transportation is expected to increase by more than 20%.

Gasoline demand is projected to fall, but liquid fuels will remain essential for the commercial transportation sector—particularly in countries across Africa and Asia, where the middle class is expanding every day

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), petroleum liquids like diesel and jet fuel will continue to meet most transportation energy demands through 2050.

During that same time, the EIA also projects jet fuel demand to increase at a faster rate than any other liquid transportation fuel.

And right now, there’s no suitable replacement for liquid fuels.

The future of energy

In 2050, more people will be driving electric vehicles. But when it comes to powering those big diesel rigs, cargo ships and air carriers that crisscross time zones and continents, the energy density of diesel and jet fuel is tough to beat.

That’s where we step in.

No other international oil company matches our scale when it comes to chemicals, lubricants and fuels. Over 80% of our facilities are integrated, meaning our refining and petrochemical units are interconnected.

This unique setup allows us to adjust and reconfigure our assets to meet customer demands, by optimizing infrastructure and adding capacity as needed.

While we’re pioneering technology that helps reduce GHG emissions—like fast-charging battery materials, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel—we’re also ensuring that heavy transport—on the ground, at sea and in the air—has the energy it needs to get people and goods where they need to go.

(Minnesota Pollution Control Agency) Forever Green Initiative continuing study of camelina’s suitability to make jet fuel -- Camelina is what’s considered an ancient crop, one that Europeans cultivated thousands of years ago. It’s also considered an orphan crop, displaced by other more successful oilseeds like canola. With a $75,000 grant from the MPCA, however, the University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative intends to make it a crop of the future that will help Minnesota develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry.

“Minnesota has the right reasons to lead on sustainable aviation fuel: a track record of environmental leadership, smart tax incentives, and a strong infrastructure,” said MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler, chair of the Governor’s Climate Change Subcabinet. “The MPCA is proud to invest in research that will help Minnesota grow a sustainable aviation fuel industry on our own soil from the ground up.”

Growing interest in growing camelina

One of over 15 crops the Forever Green Initiative is developing — and one of dozens of potential sources of sustainable aviation fuel — winter camelina has already generated a good deal of interest among Minnesota’s farmers for two big reasons, according to Mitch Hunter, the co-director of the initiative.

One, its tiny seeds produce a relatively high amount of an oil that can be crushed into cooking oil or further refined and blended to create jet fuel. This resulting sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes flying now without modifications, making it one of the highest-impact near-term strategies to cut emissions from the aviation sector. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%.

Two, because it’s planted in the fall and harvested in the spring, hardy winter camelina makes for an excellent cover crop, one that provides farmers another source of revenue to supplement their income while protecting soil health and water quality. According to Hunter, camelina can reduce soil erosion by up to 80% and nitrate leaching by up to 90%.

As if all that weren’t enough, camelina blooms early in the spring, Hunter said, making it a resource for pollinators just waking up from their winter naps.

Camelina is on the first leg of its commercialization journey in Minnesota and the wider region.

“Farmers are already getting bags of seed and selling crops,” Hunter said. On-farm pilots of camelina have grown rapidly since the first was planted in 2021 — up to about 5,000 acres this year — and the first commercial flight fueled in part by camelina grown in Minnesota flew from MSP to La Guardia last September.

There’s still work to do before camelina takes off as a “cash cover crop,” as Hunter put it. He said if farmers across the region grow at least 1 million acres of camelina by 2035, the crop should have a steady flight path. To reach that goal, though, the Forever Green Initiative will need to “pull out all the stops” in terms of continued research, education and outreach, figuring out risk management for the crop, determining supply chain needs and regulatory barriers, and building market demand.

The MPCA grant will help the initiative create what Hunter called a “road map” to get to that million-acre goal.

“We are grateful that the State of Minnesota sees the potential of winter camelina to simultaneously help our farmers, environment, economy, and climate,"" Hunter said. “Minnesota is lucky to have partnerships across governments, businesses, academic institutions, and nonprofits that are driving Minnesota forward as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel.”

Scaling up sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel remains in its infancy not just in Minnesota but in general. Of the billions of gallons of jet fuel the industry uses every year, about 25 million gallons — less than 0.1% — is considered sustainable. Burning those billions of gallons of jet fuel in air travel has a big impact on the planet: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, aviation accounts for 2-3% of all carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.

That’s one reason why Minnesota has taken steps to build its sustainable aviation fuel industry. In 2023, the state partnered with Greater MSP, the regional economic development partnership for Minneapolis and Saint Paul, to launch the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub, focused on scaling the industry up to meet its demands for sustainable aviation fuel.

Also in 2023, the state passed a tax credit of $1.50 per gallon for producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel. Gov. Tim Walz’s 2025 budget builds on that with a comprehensive SAF funding and policy package with an ask of $20 million over the next 10 years for tax credits that will promote SAF production in Minnesota.

The state is also focusing on a strategy of “recruit, review, and regulate” to build that sustainable aviation fuel industry.

Recruit: The state will attract SAF producers by providing regulatory clarity, aligning incentives, and working with supply chain and development partners to support industry growth.

Review: State agencies will assess potential SAF production proposals to weigh their climate benefits and ensure impacts on water, air, and soil quality are fully understood.

Regulate: Minnesota will create a clear and effective permitting process that ensures environmental protections and business transparency.

This strategy will inform a roadmap for the development of the sustainable aviation fuel industry that will guide state agencies and businesses. The roadmap is expected to be completed in 2025. READ MORE

Winter camelina, an oilseed crop in the same family as canola, could be a climate change problem solver, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

The agency has announced that it will fund a $75,000 grant for the University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative for an independent study on how the state can scale up to 1 million acres of winter camelina, MPCA commissioner Katrina Kessler said Tuesday at the university’s crop research fields in Falcon Heights.

“I think this is a great opportunity to support rural Minnesota, rural communities, farmers who want to innovate – and decarbonize the airline industry to help us meet our goals around getting to carbon neutral in 2050 as a state,” Kessler said.

What is SAF and how do crops help?

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is fuel made from non-petroleum sources blended with traditional jet fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%, according to the MPCA.

Winter camelina has a high oil content and a low carbon intensity score, which makes it beneficial for sustainable aviation fuel, according to the MPCA. The crop also helps to improve soil health and water quality. Additionally, it can be used to create animal feed, food and bioplastic, according to Forever Green Initiative co-director Dr. Mitch Hunter.

“Right now, we don’t have a pipeline, so to speak, built to take on farm production and turn it into fuel,” Hunter said. “The study that we’re launching will lay out the steps that we need to take to get there.”

Planning for 1 million acres

In September 2024, Delta Air Lines used SAF derived in part from winter camelina to fuel a flight from Minneapolis to New York. The demonstration flight was the first out of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to use SAF.

Every winter, about 17 million acres of cropland in Minnesota has nothing growing on it, according to Hunter. He said these cold months are a missed opportunity for farmers to grow crops like winter camelina, which is planted in the fall and harvested in the spring.

“If we can put productive, profitable crops on those acres that can protect the soil and give farmers something to harvest, we can make progress on improving farm economics, improving water quality and protecting the soil that we depend on for growing food today and for future generations,” Hunter said.

Close to 5000 acres of the crop were planted in the upper Midwest in the fall of 2024, according to Hunter, but the goal for Minnesota alone is to cover 1 million acres.

“We have an ambitious goal, which is to have 1 million acres of winter camelina in the upper Midwest by 2035,” Hunter said. “We will really have to pull out all the stops to get to that goal, but we have a big, committed coalition of supporters who are all behind us in that goal, and that gives me hope that we can get there.”

Farming the crop

The university and MPCA are encouraging farmers to consider growing winter camelina to help drive the demand for climate-smart crops.

Ben Penner, a farmer from Mankato, said that in 2024, Penner Farms planted close to 150 acres of winter camelina.

Penner said there hasn’t been a crop to hit the market to help with fuel emissions like winter camelina and its relatives, since soybeans, which grows in the summer months and can also be used for sustainable aviation fuel. The potential for a crop like winter camelina is there, he said, but it’s new and that means there’s still a lot to learn.

“The demand is there, and it is a fuel pathway that will grow,” Penner said. “What I tell farmers is, ‘Let’s learn everything we can now so that when that market comes fully online, then we’ll be able to partake in the market rather than watch someone else do it.’”

Along with soybeans and winter camelina, other crops that can be used as SAF feedstock include pennycress, woody biomass and corn, according to the MPCA.

“The journey that soybeans were on 80 years ago is the journey we’re on with winter camelina; taking a promising plant and turning it into a high-performing crop,” Hunter said.

Federal and state funding

According to the MPCA, Gov. Tim Walz’s 2025 budget includes $20 million over the next 10 years for tax credits to promote SAF production in Minnesota. In 2025, the state will also complete a roadmap for SAF industry development and regulation.

“This is part of our whole government approach around climate change,” Kessler said. “We need to be doing whatever we can across the state, across all of our economic sectors to reduce greenhouse gases.”

Kessler and Hunter acknowledged that many environmental organizations and efforts have experienced federal funding cuts under the Trump administration and are unsure whether this will impact their plans.

“We were selected for a $10 million grant from the Department of Energy, which would greatly further our research on camelina and pennycress, and we understand that that grant is currently under review by the new administration,” Hunter said.

Despite the uncertainty, Kessler and Hunter said the state remains committed to supporting this initiative.

“We remain hopeful that it will come through, and in the meantime, we are extra thankful for the support of all of these partners who can continue the work while we wait,” Hunter said.

The Forever Green Initiative is partnering with Greater MSP’s MBOLD coalition and SAF Hub, Friends of the Mississippi River, Minnesota Environmental Partnership, the McKnight Foundation, MPCA and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture to conduct the study and fund the total cost of the research, which is between $250,000 to $500,000, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-SAF-0423-01.jpg?w=1024&h=616,N,,2025-04-23 17:56:52.943659

The case centers on a 2022 decision by the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reinstate a waiver under the Clean Air Act, allowing California to enforce tougher emissions standards than those set by the federal government.

A subsidiary of Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) and several fuel industry groups are appealing a lower court ruling that found they lacked legal standing to sue.

Both conservative and liberal justices questioned whether the challengers could plausibly argue that California’s regulations harm their businesses by reducing demand for liquid fuels.

Some justices appeared open to the idea that the challengers’ economic claims might be enough to establish standing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted that relying on “common sense” could meet the legal threshold for a case, according to Reuters.

The Clean Air Act generally bars states from setting their own emissions standards but allows the EPA to grant California exceptions. Since 1967, the state has received over 75 such waivers.

Relevant: Supreme Court: EPA Rules For Coal and Natural Gas Emissions Reduction Stand (For Now)

The 2022 waiver restored California’s authority to enforce strict tailpipe emissions limits and a zero-emission vehicle mandate through 2025, undoing a Trump-era reversal.

Critics, including former Trump administration lawyer Jeffrey Wall, argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and unfairly disrupted fuel markets.

However, government lawyers contend that the challengers have not shown direct harm and thus cannot sue.

The Supreme Court’s decision, expected by June, could impact how easily businesses can challenge environmental regulations.

In recent years, the court has limited the EPA’s authority in several major rulings, including restrictions on air and water pollution rules.

If the justices side with the fuel producers, it could open the door to more legal challenges against environmental regulations that affect industry profits.

According to Wizz, the new roadmap reflects the goals set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to achieve net zero carbon emissions from international aviation by 2050.

In a statement announcing its new roadmap, however, Wizz said that the industry’s ambition relies heavily on the industrialization of technology that has not yet occurred. The airline said that its own plan puts a greater emphasis on SAF and new aircraft technologies, rather than unproven technologies and offsetting, relative to other airlines’ plans.

Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air Corporate & ESGEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. More Officer, said:

“Wizz Air supports an ambitious vision for net zero, but the truth is that the current pace of change is not enough, and without radical intervention, aviation will fail to meet its commitments.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, however, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels, with SAF accounting for only around 0.5% of global commercial fuel use in 2024.

Wizz said that SAF is the “cornerstone” of its net zero plan, with the airline targeting 53% decarbonization from the increased use of SAF. The company noted a need for governments to take action to scale SAF production through long-term policy frameworks, and incentives to close the price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

In addition to increasing SAF usage, Wizz’s plan outlines other key emissions reduction levers, with the company targeting 21% decarbonization through technological advancements in aircraft and engine technology, 7% through fleet renewal, 4% through air traffic reform and 2% through operational efficiencies.

Wizz’s own climate goals include reducing carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.

Moynihan added:

“We need action, not just ambition. That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net zero possible. Aviation needs a policy and investment revolution to shape the industry’s path.

The green light paves the way for VA’s return to long-haul international flying through a wet-lease arrangement, with 28 weekly flights to Doha set to commence in mid-2025.

A Strategic Gateway for Global Connections

In terms of the deal, VA will operate flights from Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, and eventually Melbourne to Doha using widebody aircraft leased from QR. This will be facilitated by Hamad International Airport's hub connectivity, enabling smooth onward travel to more than 100 destinations across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The new alliance enhances connectivity for Australian travelers heading to the region and expands loyalty program benefits for both Velocity and Privilege Club members.

With long-haul operations not part of VA’s network since its restructuring in 2020, the partnership allows the carrier to access international expertise, capacity, and infrastructure without shouldering the risks associated with acquiring new aircraft.

The venture is also expected to revive healthy competition on major international routes, particularly to Europe, which has long been the domain of a few carriers.

Economic, Employment Impact

The alliance is expected to provide an economic benefit of AUD$3 billion (around USD$1.96 billion) over five years. The agreement will also create jobs in Australia’s aviation and tourism sectors while boosting passenger growth. QR will deploy 20 VA pilots and 40 cabin crew members to cross-train and gain international experience.

Investment, Sustainability Synergies

This regulatory approval comes on top of February's sign-off from the Australian Government for QR's 25% equity stake in VA, which has already given the Gulf carrier a leg up in the market alongside majority owner Bain Capital. The deepened partnership is intended to facilitate enhanced operational and commercial integration between the two airlines.

Simultaneously, both carriers have pledged to work together on a sustainability roadmap formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding, signed in October 2024. This work will include key initiatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) development, waste and energy management, and sustainable procurement practices that align with the long-term environmental goals of both carriers.

In a significant update to its environmental progress, the Premier League giant announced that it has reduced its Scope 1 emissions directly from its own operations by a remarkable 89% since the 2019/20 season.

That’s not all. The Club has also achieved a 17% reduction in Scope 3 emissions, encompassing indirect sources such as travel, supply chain, and construction, which are typically the most challenging to address. These figures were shared in its latest annual sustainability report, aligning with ambitions in its strategy, The Red Way.

Liverpool’s long-term climate target? A 50% absolute emissions reduction across all scopes by 2030, compared to its 2019/20 baseline. So far, it has already chalked up a 15% overall reduction, with Scope 1 progress leading the way.

A series of strategic energy decisions is driving this dramatic decline in operational emissions: the Club has transitioned to a green gas tariff for natural gas and implemented a combination of new technologies and behavioral efficiency measures to reduce its energy use.

Scope 2 emissions? Essentially zero, for years now. In the 2023/24 season, 96% of the Club’s electricity came from renewable or low-carbon sources, including on-site solar arrays and green energy purchases.

All residual emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3 are being fully offset, a proactive move as the Club marches toward net zero.

Scope 3 is notoriously challenging for any business, and for Liverpool FC, it accounts for more than 80% of its total carbon footprint. But the Club isn’t shying away. Instead, it's taking bold, deliberate steps.

In the 2023/24 season, it introduced a new sustainable travel policy, developed in collaboration with teams across medical, travel, and impact departments. Domestic charter flights? They are replaced mainly by biofuel-powered buses and ground transportation. In cases where flying remains unavoidable, the Club is now using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credits through a ‘Book and Claim’ model, meaning the carbon-saving fuel enters the system, even if not burned directly by the team.

The result? Domestic team flights made up just 0.1% of total emissions last season.

While flights grab headlines, the bulk of Scope 3 emissions came from two surprising sources:

Anfield Road Stand redevelopment (a massive 22% of the footprint) and

Fan travel contributed nearly 20%.

Rishi Jain, the Club’s director of impact, said: “The Red Way is more than a strategy – it’s a key priority for the club and is embedded into every aspect of the business.

“We have set ambitious targets, including achieving net zero by 2040, and we understand that we are on a journey and there is still much more to do.

Approximately 6,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would be available for domestic and international airlines to use at airports across Taiwan this year, which would help curb about 15,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said yesterday.

The use of SAF is part of government efforts to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The nation’s three largest airlines — China Airlines Ltd (中華航空), EVA Airways Corp (EVA, 長榮航空) and Starlux Airlines Co (星宇航空) — yesterday began using SAF in their aircraft, the first time domestic airlines used eco-friendly fuel in Taiwan.

CPC Corp, Taiwan (台灣中油) imported 400 tonnes of the SAF available for use this year, while Formosa Petrochemical Corp (台塑石化) produced 5,500 tonnes, the ministry said.

China Airlines and Starlux use the CPC-imported SAF, while EVA Airways uses the fuel produced by Formosa Petrochemical.

An inauguration ceremony, held the day after Earth Day, at Kaohsiung International Airport yesterday afternoon was attended by Minister of Transportation and Communications Chen Shih-kai (陳世凱), Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hsu Chih-chieh (許智傑), Civil Aviation Administration Director-General Ho Shu-ping (何淑萍), China Airlines chairman Kao Shing-hwang (高星潢) and CPC chairman Fang Jeng-zen (方振仁).

At the event, SAF was pumped into a China Airlines aircraft and an EVA plane, while video showed SAF being used by EVA and Starlux aircraft at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport) and Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport respectively.

The ceremony was held at the Kaohsiung airport because it obtained carbon footprint certification from Airport Council International in 2014, making it the nation’s first green airport, Ho said.

“Making SAF available at international airports is a global trend as international airlines seek to reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization,” she said.

“Like other countries, we are encouraging, rather than mandating, that Taiwanese airlines use SAF. Hopefully, by 2030, at least 5 percent of the total aviation fuel would be SAF,” she added.

CPC and Formosa Petrochemical secured certifications from the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation in December last year and Feb. 2 respectively.

CPC “will begin producing SAF next year,” Fang said. “The main problem is importing waste cooking oil from other countries, which we would resolve by working with the Ministry of Environment.”

Kao said the supply of SAF remains insufficient, adding that China Airlines would begin using it on flights heading to EU nations, which have begun implementing fuel regulations.

Using SAF would increase the airline’s fuel costs, but they would gradually decrease with the increase in supply, he said.

Vestas, the Danish wind turbine manufacturer with a global footprint, is stepping up its sustainability game by scaling up the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in offshore wind operations. After piloting SAF-powered helicopter transport in the Baltic Sea, the company is now expanding the initiative to the North Sea—one of Europe’s busiest offshore wind regions.

Let’s face it, offshore wind construction isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Getting technicians to and from turbines out at sea involves complex logistics and a heavy carbon footprint, especially when helicopters are part of the equation. But with SAF, Vestas is trying to cut through the carbon fog.

Baltic Sea Pilot Project: A Promising Start

In early 2024, Vestas began testing SAF in real-world conditions. They deployed a SAF-fueled helicopter to shuttle technicians during the construction of 50 offshore turbines in the Baltic Sea. According to the company, the move slashed greenhouse gas emissions by 38% compared to standard Jet-A1 fuel. That’s not just a marginal improvement—it’s a significant dent in the emissions typically associated with offshore wind logistics.

The trial not only proved that SAF can be effective, but also demonstrated its compatibility with the demanding timelines and safety standards required in offshore environments.

Moving to the North Sea: Bigger Scope, Bolder Goals

Now, Vestas is scaling the project to the North Sea, backed by a multi-year agreement with a cluster of aviation and fuel industry players. The new initiative marks a milestone for Esbjerg Airport, which is now introducing SAF into its aviation fuel supply chain for the first time.

Partners in this initiative include NHV Group, Airbus Aircraft, DCC & Shell Aviation Denmark A/S, and Esbjerg Airport—a network that brings together helicopter operators, aircraft manufacturers, fuel suppliers, and infrastructure providers. That’s a serious coalition of logistics firepower.

The objective? Cut emissions from crew-change flights that connect technicians to offshore turbines in the North Sea. All flights departing from Esbjerg will now operate using at least a 40% SAF blend—one of the highest feasible levels currently allowed under aviation standards.

What’s in the Fuel?

This isn’t your average biofuel. The SAF used in these operations is produced from biowaste materials, primarily used cooking oil (UCO). Think about that: what once fried your french fries is now flying technicians over cold North Sea waters. Talk about full-circle sustainability.

Using a 40% SAF blend brings operations close to the technical and regulatory limits for blending SAF with conventional jet fuel. While that cap might sound restrictive, it’s actually pushing the envelope of what’s currently possible in commercial aviation.

A First for Airbus H175 in Offshore Wind

Another noteworthy development? The use of the Airbus H175 helicopter model exclusively for offshore wind installation flights. This marks the first time the H175 has been deployed for this kind of work in the North Sea. Known for its long-range capabilities and high payload capacity, the H175 is well-suited to offshore logistics—but it’s never flown quite like this before.

The combination of new technology, sustainable fuel, and high-capacity aircraft opens a new chapter in the offshore wind playbook. With more offshore wind farms in the pipeline and larger turbines further from shore, reducing the carbon impact of supporting logistics is becoming more than just a nice-to-have—it’s a must.

A Signal for the Future of Offshore Logistics?

Let’s not ignore the broader context here. Offshore wind is growing fast, and so are its emissions—especially those linked to operations and maintenance. If SAF can reliably reduce emissions by 30% or more, why isn’t everyone using it?

The answer is scale, cost, and supply. SAF is still relatively expensive and not yet widely available. But moves like this one from Vestas help build the case—and the demand—that could encourage wider production and adoption.",https://breakbulk.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cropped-BBN_Logo-800x800-1-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-04-23 14:57:08.473517

The federal government has supported SAF through the Inflation Reduction Act, Clean Fuel Production Credit and the Department of Energy’s SAF Grand Challenge.
In-state SAF production in Nevada is currently dependent on two fuel producers: Edgewood Renewables in Las Vegas and New Rise Renewables near Reno.
The incentivization of SAF began in 2019 when production and infrastructure development was integrated into the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which rewards clean fuel producers.
These financial programs alone are not enough to spur an ecosystem of SAF production in Nevada.","In a state known for taking chances, the Nevada Legislature is reviewing a bill that could lay the groundwork for sustainable aviation. With an economy dependent on air travel and an industry racing to meet decarbonization targets, the state of Nevada and the aviation sector are weighing their odds on this year’s legislative session.

AB481 makes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — an alternative fuel made from sources such as municipal solid waste or plant oils — more affordable for airlines, which signals to producers that there’s a reliable market in Nevada worth investing in. Earmarked for $10 million, the proposed SAF Incentive Program would offer up to $2.50 per gallon in credits to help reduce the gap compared with the price of regular jet fuel, since greener fuel can cost up to six times more than its conventional counterpart.

The bill, which passed the Assembly Committee on Growth and Infrastructure on April 11, would establish a special revenue fund in the state treasury. This means that airlines can claim incentives by submitting requests to the treasurer, who may also accept grants, gifts and donations to bolster the program.

SAF can reduce emissions from air transportation by as much as 80 percent. It is currently the only viable solution for decarbonizing the sector as it can be integrated into existing airline fleets without the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. Despite this environmental and operational promise, SAF is subject to a classic supply and demand problem, accounting for just .3 percent of total jet fuel worldwide in 2024. Low production yields and high demand lead to high costs per gallon.

States that already have policies to support in-state SAF production, such as California and Washington, have been encouraged by how the fuel fosters economic growth, development and energy security.

The federal government has supported SAF through the Inflation Reduction Act, Clean Fuel Production Credit and the Department of Energy’s SAF Grand Challenge. Though SAF production has increased, these incentives alone are not enough to help the fuel’s affordability.

The benefits of SAF are mutual for Nevada and the airline industry, with the state advancing its environmental and transportation goals, and airlines securing a sustainable fuel source that helps them meet mounting industry and regulatory pressure to decarbonize.

Nevada’s economy is largely sponsored by the tourism industry and relies on domestic and international flights. Harry Reid International Airport and Reno-Tahoe International Airport serve 58.4 and 4.8 million passengers, respectively, with the Las Vegas airport serving all major U.S. airlines and connecting passengers with 160 airports worldwide.

High passenger traffic comes with an environmental cost. Emissions from transportation are the largest among other sectors in Nevada, with aviation’s emissions growing rapidly. To tackle this, state agencies have developed two complementary strategies for decarbonization: the Transportation Strategy, led by the Department of Transportation, and the Priority Climate Action Plan, created by the Division of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Governor’s Office of Energy. Both strategies specifically note SAF as the ace in the hole.

In-state SAF production in Nevada is currently dependent on two fuel producers: Edgewood Renewables in Las Vegas and New Rise Renewables near Reno. Both are in early development and production stages. While having two producers is more than what other states may offer, the reason these companies are choosing Nevada may have more to do with our neighboring state.

California has long been a gold standard of sustainability. The incentivization of SAF began in 2019 when production and infrastructure development was integrated into the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which rewards clean fuel producers. A recent partnership with Airlines for America has encouraged them to aim for 200 million gallons of SAF supplied by 2035. This attracts investment and shows momentum in the SAF sector.

The sale of SAF in California’s market, supported by cross-state regulatory benefits and proven logistics infrastructure, is a sure bet. As of March 2025, producers earned approximately $60 per metric ton of carbon dioxide reduced, based on market conditions and carbon intensity of the fuel. Meanwhile, Nevada offers no comparable incentives.

Confirmed in the bill’s testimony by Southwest Airlines’ State and Local Affairs Director Ruben Zaragoza, there is interest in producing SAF in Nevada, but without state-based programs and incentives “these gallons will be diverted to California and other markets.” This strips Nevada of a revenue possibility.

Nevada has the potential to develop a SAF-friendly environment that can create a sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem, attract industry leaders, boost local economies, create jobs and reduce emissions. Now, that’s a jackpot!

Nevada’s business incentives are already working with existing SAF producers through grants and tax abatement. In 2024, the state approved $11.7 million in tax abatements for Edgewood Renewables as part of these efforts. The Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance backed the project, noting it could create 60 jobs within two years and involve a $100 million capital investment.

These financial programs alone are not enough to spur an ecosystem of SAF production in Nevada. AB481 proposed a new mechanism that not only incentivizes in-state production but also encourages in-state use. Yet, two critical questions remain: Can Nevada outmatch the incentives offered across the border in California? And does the state have the fiscal capacity to sustain such a program long term?

To meet that bar, Nevada should first leverage its existing assets such as abundant renewable energy, municipal waste streams and its logistics-friendly geography. Second, it must offer enough confidence, infrastructure and support to make investment here worthwhile. This involves broader alignment with state priorities, such as clean energy goals, workforce development and long-term economic resilience.

SAF production isn't just an environmental bet; it’s a commitment to Nevada’s future competitiveness.

Even more significantly, we prevented over 80 million pounds of CO₂e emissions, which is the equivalent of taking 124,368 vehicles off the road.

Brands, among others, on their annual ESG publication to report on the used cooking oil we recycled together.
Restaurant Technologies helped save 29.6 million pounds of trash and reduced CO2e emissions by over 80 million pounds.","First, the bad news: As restaurant owners and managers know, waste cooking oil poses significant environmental challenges if not disposed of properly. In addition to clogging drains, it can pollute water and soil, according to a study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.

The good news is, however, that used cooking oil also offers significant potential as a renewable energy source. “Imagine a world where the ingredients for the food you consume are converted into renewable fuel,” said Diana Geseking, chief legal officer of Restaurant Technologies. “It would simply be a cleaner and healthier planet to live in.”

Here, Geseking, who also serves as the chair of Restaurant Technologies’ ESG committee, discusses how the company’s Total Oil Management solution is helping restaurants bring that vision to life by converting 363.7 million pounds of used cooking oil into renewable diesel or biodiesel in 2024, and how the solution can meet a variety of ESG goals for foodservice operators.

How does the process of converting used cooking oil into renewable diesel or biodiesel help reduce environmental impact, and what role does innovation play in making this transformation more efficient and sustainable?

Bio-based fuels like these reduce our reliance on petroleum by replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable alternatives. And because we recycle oil that’s already been used, we avoid the environmental impacts of growing and processing virgin oil crops, conserving emissions, water and land. Our closed-loop model also eliminates the packaging waste associated with traditional jugs-in-boxes, cutting down significantly on plastic and cardboard sent to landfills.

In fact, by our customers switching to bulk oil delivery and collection, we kept nearly 30 million pounds of waste out of the trash and saved 8.9 million cubic feet of landfill space. Even more significantly, we prevented over 80 million pounds of CO₂e emissions, which is the equivalent of taking 124,368 vehicles off the road.

Innovation is at the heart of this impact. Our custom-designed equipment allows us to deliver oil in bulk and collect used cooking oil that is clean and free of debris, unlike conventional rendering tanks. As a result, nearly every drop of oil we collect can be converted into renewable fuel instead of going to waste. This high standard of quality control makes the entire recycling process more efficient, more reliable and better for the environment.

Our partnerships with convenience stores such as Sheetz and Chevron Renewable Energy Group are just one example of industry leaders coming together to form an innovative sustainability solution and process. Together, we have built a circular fuel economy where we deliver fresh cooking oil to Sheetz, it gets used in their fryers, Restaurant Technologies collects it, REG converts it and we deliver it back to Sheetz to be used in their fryers. The potential is nearly limitless.

Restaurant Technologies has significantly increased its sustainability efforts, recycling over 363 million pounds of used cooking oil in 2024. What strategies or innovations were key to achieving this record-breaking milestone?

Our customers and renewable energy partners play a pivotal role in helping us make it all happen. As mentioned earlier, 100% of the used cooking oil we collect is recycled so, as Restaurant Technologies grows and delivers more oil to more customers, we will also be able to recycle more oil. To put it simply, the bigger we are, the more that gets recycled but that doesn’t mean we’re content depending on this growth.

Also mentioned earlier was the circular fuel economy and the potential for expanding that into other convenience stores. We are also present in many universities and theme parks where buses and shuttle services run on fuel. There is potential there for converting used cooking oil from dining halls and food courts and using them for public transportation on campuses across the country. While we’ve been around for over 25 years now, it really feels like we’re just getting started when it comes to sustainability.

You have a diverse customer base that includes industries like restaurants, hotels and grocery stores. How does Restaurant Technologies collaborate with these customers to help them meet their ESG goals?

We are proud to play such a significant role in our customer’s ESG strategy. Every single customer can say that their business is more sustainable when they work with us. We work with various national franchises such as McDonald’s, Shake Shack and Yum! Brands, among others, on their annual ESG publication to report on the used cooking oil we recycled together.

It’s not a secret that sustainability is huge within the hotels/resorts industry. Many hotels, especially the ‘big’ ones, are required to report sustainability statistics monthly, quarterly and/or annually to corporate with the promise of incentives/rewards based on how sustainable that hotel/resort is. So our partnership with them is pivotal to help them achieve their own sustainability goals.

Restaurant Technologies helped save 29.6 million pounds of trash and reduced CO2e emissions by over 80 million pounds. Can you provide more details on how these outcomes directly impact the environment and the communities where your customers operate?

Our business, naturally, helps protect the environment. Before we even recycle and convert UCO, our closed loop automated systems are already protecting water sources from grease spills and runoff that could find its way into nature. Saving pounds of trash, reducing emissions and all the other aforementioned benefits inherently come with avoiding plastic and cardboard packaging from conventional JIBs, which are not recyclable due to the oil residue left behind. The additional emissions we prevent by displacing petroleum-based fuels leads to improved local air quality and contribute to global efforts to slow the most extreme effects of climate change. Together, these outcomes support cleaner, more sustainable communities.

Sustainability is clearly a core value at Restaurant Technologies. Looking ahead, what are some of the key goals or initiatives the company has for continuing to break sustainability records and pushing the envelope in the renewable energy space?

We really believe our potential is sky-high to make a difference. While nothing is definite, we are always thinking about what’s next – from expanding the circular fuel economy to other convenience stores and utilizing UCO for college dining halls/food courts, to sourcing cooking oil from regenerative farms to reduce impact at the start of the supply chain. We’re also looking at ways to expand the use of biofuel in our own fleet and support innovation in renewable energy, including emerging solutions like sustainable aviation fuel.

Renewable Fuels Month highlights the importance of renewable biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, especially for Nebraskans.
Fueled by Nebraska, a partnership of Nebraska biofuels organizations, and the Nebraska Soybean Board, invite you to join them to celebrate renewable fuels in your classrooms, at work and in your community this May.
Important Renewable Fuels Month Dates • May 6: Gov.
Jim Pillen will declare May as Renewable Fuels Month • May 5 and 12: Tune into upcoming Renewable Fuels Month segments on Pure Nebraska, which airs on Channel 10/11 live weekdays from 9-10 a.m. (0) COMMENTS Welcome to the discussion.","LINCOLN, Nebraska — As the summer driving season kicks off in May, Nebraskans are encouraged to fuel up on clean and cost-saving biofuels. Renewable biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, play a vital role in decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil, boosting the nation's economy and supporting thousands of jobs in rural communities. May is Renewable Fuels Month in Nebraska celebrated by the Nebraska Corn Board (NCB), Nebraska Ethanol Board, Renewable Fuels Nebraska and Nebraska Soybean Board.

In Nebraska, ethanol is the third-largest agriculture commodity. According to recent data, Nebraska drivers saved approximately $375 million in 2024 by using ethanol blends of E10 and above. Ethanol blends reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% compared to regular gasoline, making them a more environmentally friendly choice.

Most vehicles (2001 and newer) can safely use blends of ethanol up to E15, enjoying significant additional savings per gallon. Flex fuel vehicle owners can use blends up to E85 and experience even greater savings.

As the second-largest producer of ethanol in the country, Nebraska is poised for further growth in the industry. Landmark legislation passed in 2024 provides a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced in Nebraska, which can reduce emissions by more than 50% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Renewable Fuels Month highlights the importance of renewable biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, especially for Nebraskans. The month of May marks the beginning of the summer driving season, making it an ideal time to fuel up on clean and cost-saving biofuels. Ethanol, renewable diesel and biodiesel help to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil, boost our nation's economy, and support thousands of jobs in rural communities.

“Nebraskans are beginning to drive and take advantage of biofuel benefits more this month as the weather warms up for sports, vacations and holiday events,” said Brandon Hunnicutt, chairman of NCB. “By choosing a renewable fuel such as ethanol, drivers can support local agriculture, reduce their carbon footprint and save money on fuel costs.""

Integrating SAF into offshore operations is a key step toward reducing environmental impact, as SAF can cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions from fuel used for air travel.

As wind turbines are built farther offshore, aviation plays an increasingly important role in the offshore wind industry. Helicopters offer efficiency through speed and reliability, which ensures safe transport in challenging sea conditions and enhanced crew well-being.

Lars-Henrik Thorngreen, CEO at NHV, emphasized the significance of the partnership with Vestas.

“We are proud to be supporting Vestas with helicopter flights using SAF. Alongside utilizing a modern fleet and broader sustainability efforts, this initiative underscores our commitment to grow our international business in an increasingly sustainable way, supporting the environmental objectives of NHV Group, our clients, and our partners.”

Lisa Ekstrand, vice president and head of sustainability at Vestas, commented on the impact of the collaboration:

“Integrating sustainability into every aspect of our operations remains a high ambition for Vestas. We are further expanding the use of SAF in our offshore wind operations and are pleased with the close collaboration with NHV and the strong commitment of all parties involved in this project.”

Uganda is committed to implementing of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Programme in order to support the global environment protection cause.

Fred K. Bamwesigye, the Director General at Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) made the revelation on Tuesday at the launch of the Kick-off Workshop for Feasibility Study for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Programme in Uganda.

“Uganda has always joined the rest of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Member States in supporting the ICAO standards, policies and strategies set to limit and mitigate the impact of aviation carbon emissions on the global climate. As an ICAO Member State, Uganda is prepared to take necessary action and advance initiatives on environmental protection including action on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF),” said Bamwesigye, adding: “… in our efforts to support the global environment protection cause, Uganda made a choice to be part of the ICAO’s initiative on Capacity Building for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programme.”

He added that the workshop will kick-off a feasibility study to outline a roadmap for the implementation of SAF programme in Uganda.

“This programme builds on the adoption by the 41st ICAO Assembly resolution of a long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) of net-zero aviation carbon emissions by 2050,” he said, adding: “The initiative we are launching today is also framed in the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) and other Aviation Cleaner Energies adopted in the third ICAO Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) in 2023. I also wish to inform you that ICAO and its Member States, including Uganda, established the Global collective aspiration to reduce aviation Carbon emissions by 5% in 2030 through the use of SAF and cleaner energies.”

He urged participants in the kick-off workshop to engage in this initiative so that it can provide not only environmental benefits, but also social opportunities to the people of Uganda.

He said the launched Feasibility Study calls for collective effort in assisting with information collection that should be provided to the ICAO experts in their endeavor to identify basic data that will inform Uganda’s potential in production and use of SAF.

“Please, engage with them and provide contact information where possible so they will be able to follow-up with all relevant national stakeholders who could contribute to data collection to identify and promote opportunities for Sustainable aviation fuel programme in Uganda,” he said.

Bamwesigye further said UCAA’s National Focal Point on aviation environment protection will also be available to ICAO experts and should be able to coordinate all interactions between the experts and the key stakeholders.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a type of jet fuel produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oils, plant oils, agricultural waste and municipal waste.
Chemically similar to conventional jet fuel, SAF can be used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modifications.
It is currently more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, and the supply is limited due to the finite availability of sustainable feedstocks.","Sustainable aviation fuel is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, but challenges hinder its widespread use in aviation, an industry that contributes 2.5% of the world’s CO2 emissions.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a type of jet fuel produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oils, plant oils, agricultural waste and municipal waste. Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil sources, SAF is considered a more sustainable alternative as it significantly reduces carbon emissions produced during flights. Depending on the feedstock and production method, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil fuels.

Chemically similar to conventional jet fuel, SAF can be used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modifications. It can be blended with traditional fuel up to 50%, and looking ahead, aircraft will be capable of using 100% SAF by 2030. The term ‘drop-in fuel’ refers to SAF’s compatibility with current airport fuelling systems, making its integration into the aviation industry relatively straightforward.

The environmental benefits of SAF are substantial, notably its reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Additionally, using waste materials like household rubbish for fuel production helps prevent these materials from ending up in landfills, reducing harmful methane emissions.

While SAF is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuel, its cost is expected to decrease as production technologies improve and economies of scale are achieved. SAF plays a crucial role in helping the aviation industry meet its carbon reduction targets of net zero by 2050, contributing to a more sustainable future for the aviation industry.

As Cherie Wilson, Delta’s Vice President of Government Affairs and Sustainability, stated: “SAF is the only solution available today that can yield immediate results and drastically cut airline lifecycle GHG emissions.”

What are the problems with sustainable aviation fuel?

Despite its potential, SAF faces numerous challenges that hinder its widespread adoption. One of the primary issues is the high production cost. Currently, SAF can cost between two to seven times more than traditional jet fuel due to the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks and the early stage of production technology. This price disparity makes it difficult for airlines to adopt SAF on a large scale, especially when economic pressures often prioritise lower operational costs.

Another challenge is the limited supply of SAF. The production of SAF is not yet at a scale large enough to meet global aviation demand, and there is a reliance on feedstocks such as used cooking oils and agricultural waste, which are limited.

Additionally, the infrastructure for SAF distribution is still small scaled. While SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel, the infrastructure at airports and refineries needs significant investment to support its widespread use.

SAF production may also be impacted by global politics as the need for investment is imperative for upscaling. However, as seen in recent events in America under President Donald Trump, SAF’s impact could be reduced.

Finally, there are concerns about the environmental impact of some feedstocks. For instance, the large-scale cultivation of certain crops for SAF production could lead to land-use changes, potentially causing deforestation or competing with food production. This makes it crucial to ensure that SAF production meets sustainability criteria. However, new pathways are being uncovered. One company, Firefly Green Fuels, has announced a new novel pathway to SAF made from sewage sludge.

Is SAF better than jet fuel?

SAF is considered better than traditional jet fuel in terms of environmental impact. SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, compared to conventional jet fuel, thanks to its renewable feedstocks. This reduction is primarily because the CO2 absorbed by plants during their growth is roughly equal to the emissions produced when SAF is burned, making it near carbon-neutral.

However, SAF is not without its challenges. It is currently more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, and the supply is limited due to the finite availability of sustainable feedstocks. While SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel up to 50%, the infrastructure to support its widespread use is still under development. Despite these challenges, SAF remains a key solution for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint and moving towards greener air travel.

Why is SAF not widely used?

SAF is not widely used primarily due to its high production cost. The current cost of SAF is significantly higher than conventional jet fuel, largely because the production technology is still developing and the feedstocks, such as used cooking oils and agricultural waste, are limited and expensive. This price gap makes it difficult for airlines to adopt SAF on a large scale, especially in a competitive industry where cost-efficiency is crucial.

Additionally, SAF production is not yet at a sufficient scale to meet global aviation demand. The supply of sustainable feedstocks is finite, and increasing production will require substantial investment in infrastructure and technology.

SAF’s availability is also constrained by the current lack of widespread distribution infrastructure at airports and refineries. As a result, despite its environmental benefits, SAF’s adoption remains limited.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2510038881.png,N,,2025-04-23 02:56:27.009364

It’s now up to the House Transportation Committee to approve the changes.","Hold onto your wallets, Washington drivers—more changes are on the horizon, and they’re not exactly small ones.

The state House of Representatives is preparing to roll out a major overhaul to ESSB 5801, a transportation funding bill that’s about to get bulked up with a laundry list of tax hikes, fee increases, and infrastructure investments.

The bill, already hefty when it left the Senate, will undergo a turbocharged “striking amendment” in the House on Wednesday during a meeting of the House Transportation Committee.

While the Senate’s version had a public hearing in that committee on Tuesday, the discussion might end up being somewhat moot. Why? Because this striking amendment—essentially a full rewrite of the Senate bill—can only be proposed during an executive session, not in public hearings.

Here’s what’s being proposed in what is effectively the House’s new version of the bill:

Gas up, pay up

Starting July 1, 2025, the gas tax jumps 6 cents per gallon, bumping the rate from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. That part hasn’t changed from the original Senate bill.

Diesel drivers? You’re not off the hook. Diesel sees a 6-cent total hike—3 cents in 2025 and another 3 cents in 2027.

And that’s not the end of it. Beginning in 2026, most fuel taxes will automatically increase 2% per year due to inflation. Diesel gets its own inflation-based increases starting in 2028.

Where’s all that money going? Mostly into the Motor Vehicle Fund, with 2.5% going to cities and another 2.5% to counties—same as in the Senate version.

One notable change? The House version ditches the electric and hybrid vehicle fee increases proposed in the Senate. The Senate had called for boosting the annual fee from $100 to $150 and adding extra charges for new registrations. The House said “no thanks” to that.

Fee-nomenon

Almost every vehicle-related fee is going up. Starting in 2026, truck weight fees will be standardized to $30 per ton. Passenger car weight fees will also increase:

Up to 4,000 lbs.: Still $35

4,001–6,000 lbs.: Now $65

6,001–8,000 lbs.: $82.50

8,001 lbs. and up: $96

Other fee increases include:

Title changes: from $15 to $18

Registration renewals: from $8 to $11

And that abandoned RV fee? It’s going from $6 to $8.

Luxury rides and high-end toys targeted

Got a luxury car habit? Might want to downshift.

Starting January 2026, Washington will impose:

An 8% tax on vehicles priced over $100,000 (with the threshold increasing by 2% each year).

A 10% tax on non-commercial aircraft worth more than $500,000.

Trade-ins won’t help you dodge this tax.

Revenue from these luxury taxes will be funneled into the Multimodal Transportation Account, and for aircraft, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Account, though some details still depend on other pending legislation.

Rental car sales tax jumps from 5.9% to 11.9% in 2026, then drops to 9.9% in 2027

The same applies to peer-to-peer car rentals like Turo—not just traditional companies

And don’t forget: a new $1-per-tire fee is coming on retail sales of new vehicle tires. Retailers can keep 10% to cover their costs for tire disposal. The rest goes to the Department of Revenue, which may allocate it to the Department of Ecology for cleaning up illegal tire piles.

Ferries, tolls, and big events—Oh my

Washington State Ferries are getting a financial boost. Starting this October, they would tack on a 50-cent capital vessel surcharge, with more increases (10 cents) in 2027 and 2029.

Also, a 3% surcharge will be added to all ferry credit card transactions.

Tolling changes? Say goodbye to the free ride on SR 520’s on- and off-ramps—they’re all going to be tolled.

Stadiums and event venues are getting pulled into this, too. Events at arenas with 17,000+ seats will face a $1-per-head transportation fee starting in 2026. The Senate had proposed a 20,000-seat threshold, which would have spared Climate Pledge Arena—but not anymore.

Cameras, permits, and carbon cuts

Speeding through a work zone? Starting July 2026, it’ll cost you $125, thanks to new automated camera enforcement.

Driver’s license and ID fees are rising, too. From October 1, 2026, an 8-year license goes from $72 to $80, with inflation-based increases each year after that.

In a twist, the House version repeals some climate-focused transportation accounts—but boosts programs like bicycle safety grants and Shared Street projects.

And creates the Sandy Williams Connecting Communities Account, which funds safer walking, biking, and rolling infrastructure in overburdened communities along highways.

And yes, there are even more fee increases sprinkled throughout the bill, not to mention changes to red light camera rules, pedestrian path expansions, and other non-financial transportation policies.

This bill is massive.

The bigger picture

Washington is trying to hold its crumbling transportation system together while pivoting toward a greener, more modern future. Lawmakers argue that these changes are crucial to meet the state’s infrastructure needs, climate goals, and evolving transportation demands.

Critics, though, are already warning that the bill will hit working-class residents the hardest, especially with gas prices and inflation already squeezing wallets.

It’s now up to the House Transportation Committee to approve the changes. If they do, the bill goes to a full House vote. and if approved, heads back to the Senate. If the Senate accepts all the rewrite done by the House, then it’s off to the Governor’s desk.

But the reality is—with this many moving parts, it’s unlikely the Senate will rubber-stamp the House rewrite without changes.

And remember—there are just five days left in the session. If lawmakers can’t finish in time, the Governor may need to call a special session to get it across the finish line.

Aviation has just twenty-five years to meet its ambitious 2050 net-zero emissions target. While this timeline might seem long, the road ahead is steep. Achieving carbon neutrality will demand coordinated efforts across policy, infrastructure, innovation, and public perception.

Rather than viewing the challenge as a looming crisis, it can become a transformative opportunity. The path forward lies in embracing complexity, encouraging cross-sector collaboration, and funding scalable solutions that yield both short-term impact and long-term transformation.

Embracing Demand Without Compromising Goals

The aviation sector is facing an exciting surge. Growing middle-class populations, particularly in developing economies, are taking to the skies in unprecedented numbers. This signals opportunity but also risk.

Relying on older, fuel-hungry aircraft to meet this demand could derail emissions goals. However, investing in newer, more efficient models and operational changes—even if initially costly—presents a chance to future-proof fleets and set a precedent for sustainable growth.

The Four Strategic Foundations for Future Investment

Sustainable aviation cannot rest on promises alone. It requires strategic alignment across four interconnected pillars:

1. Shaping a Culture That Welcomes Change

To ensure successful transition, the aviation industry must invest in educational campaigns that explain the stakes and communicate the tangible benefits of sustainability. People support what they understand. Widespread public and stakeholder buy-in is not a luxury—it is a necessity.

These efforts go beyond branding. They build trust, validate technological shifts, and prepare the market for policies and pricing structures that support long-term goals.

2. Making Sustainable Aviation Fuel More Accessible

SAF is one of the most immediate tools available. It does not require new engines or major infrastructure changes. But high production costs and limited supply remain critical barriers.

Governments and private entities must jointly support SAF development. Investment in feedstock innovation and production capacity is essential to reducing costs and improving availability. SAF alone will not deliver net zero—but it is an important step in the transition.

3. Supporting Incremental Technological Progress

Not all sustainability wins are flashy. Some are found in flight path optimization, lightweight materials, and smarter maintenance schedules. These incremental gains, though subtle, can dramatically improve fuel efficiency over time.

When combined with SAF, such improvements could cut emissions by as much as 70 percent by 2050, even with expected traffic increases. The challenge is less about the technology itself and more about deploying it rapidly and at scale.

4. Prioritizing Game-Changing Innovation

Hydrogen-powered aircraft. Battery-electric regional jets. Renewable energy generation at airports. These are not science fiction—they are part of a growing wave of aviation innovation.

However, transforming propulsion systems and redesigning aircraft requires significant research, time, and regulatory clarity. To unlock their potential, stakeholders must not only fund these innovations but also ensure there is a supportive infrastructure and an efficient certification process.

Regulation and Risk: Managing the Next Phase

Innovators need certainty. Investors need confidence. A clear, globally recognized pathway for certifying and deploying new technologies is essential. Without it, the cost and risk of sustainable innovation could deter even the most ambitious projects.

Governments and regulatory agencies must take the lead here—not as gatekeepers, but as partners in accelerating meaningful change. Their role is to create a transparent, agile framework that rewards progress without compromising safety.

Time to Lead, Not Linger

The 2050 target may now feel distant, but time is short. Every year without decisive investment and bold policy action pushes sustainability further out of reach. Some industry experts believe a new target date may eventually be needed.

Regardless of timelines, one truth remains: action today will define aviation’s legacy tomorrow. Those who lead this charge will not only shape the future of flight but also secure their relevance in a low-carbon world.

Conclusion: Progress Begins With Purpose

Decarbonising aviation is not just a technical challenge—it is a social, economic, and cultural transformation. It requires courage to invest in innovation, willingness to challenge the status quo, and persistence to build a new ecosystem from the ground up.

By focusing on the four foundational pillars—public engagement, SAF adoption, incremental efficiency, and radical innovation—industry leaders can chart a practical yet visionary course.

BY Erin Voegele

California Air Resources Board on April 4 released a third set of proposed changes to the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. More than 80 public comments were filed ahead of an April 21 deadline, including those filed by representatives of the ethanol, biobased diesel and biogas industries.

CARB on Nov. 8, 2024, approved updates to its LCSF that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045. The updates also include a variety of technical changes to the LCFS program, including those requiring fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; requiring independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; changes prohibiting palm-derived fuels from receiving credits; a cap on the use of soybean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels; and updates that phase out avoided methane crediting associated with the use of biomethane as a combustion fuel but extend the use of biomethane for renewable hydrogen.

CARB submitted its final regulatory package on the approved LCFS amendments to the California Office of Administrative Law on Jan. 3. OAL on Feb. 18 notified CARB of its intention to disapprove the LCFS amendments citing “clarity” issues, effectively pausing implementation of the changes.

CARB on Feb. 25 received a Decision of Disapproval of Regulatory Action from OAL, which details the reasons for the disapproval. That document indicates that OAL has identified 26 proposed regulatory provisions where additional modifications may be necessary to ensure the regulatory provisions can be “easily understood by those persons directly affected by them.”

Under California state law, CARB has 120 days to rewrite and resubmit the amendments, which any substantive modifications subject to a new public comment period.

CARB on April 4 announced the availability of modified text and opened a 15-day public comment period. According to information posted to CARB’s website, 81 public comments were filed, including comments filed by the Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy, Clean Fuels Alliance America, the RNG Coalition and the American Biogas Council.

The RFA is criticizing CARB’s decision to maintain “unnecessary and unworkable” feedstock sustainability criteria. “With its latest proposed modifications to the LCFS program, CARB had an opportunity to substantially revise or remove its needless sustainability requirements for U.S.-origin ethanol feedstocks,” RFA said in a statement. “Instead, CARB made only a few slight tweaks to other provisions and the agency appears poised to move ahead with its costly and burdensome sustainability criteria.”

According to the RFA, CARB alleges that its proposed feedstock sustainability requirements for grain-based ethanol are need to provide “guard rails” against “rapid expansion of biofuel production and biofuel feedstock demand…that could result in adverse and use changes.” In its comments, RFA stresses that empirical data clearly undermine this rationale, proving that the number of corn acres needed to meet California ethanol demand has actually fallen by 700,000 acres, or 20%, since the LCFS program began in 2011.

Growth Energy said CARB’s proposal continues to undermine the role of crop-based fuels in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. “Biofuels like ethanol have long been the backbone of the California LCFS and have contributed to the success of the program,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “Despite OAL’s rejection of the proposed amendments for their lack of clarity, CARB’s revisions fall short by failing to add any meaningful details to the amendments’ sustainability provisions. CARB’s proposal still undermines the important role that crop-based renewable fuels must play in decarbonizing the transportation sector in California. Not only do these amendments run counter to the state’s own environmental agenda, they undercut California’s leadership in spurring renewable energy production across the U.S. and giving consumers access to more affordable fueling options. We urge CARB to embrace renewable fuels, rather than keeping them on the sidelines to the detriment of both American farmers and California consumers.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America also criticized CARB’s treatment of crop-based biofuels, specifically the feedstock cap that is to be implemented for soybean, canola and sunflower oils. In addition, Clean Fuels is speaking out against a newly proposed change to the proposed regulations that would eliminate the possibility of new fuel pathways for biomass-based diesel from being approved after Jan. 1, 2031, if a certain number of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) or near zero emissions vehicles (NZEVs) are on the road.

The RNG Coalition addressed the market impact of regulatory delays in its comments. “Given the LCFS credit surpluses, a significant stepdown in the Annual Carbon Intensity (CI) Benchmarks cannot be delayed any further,” the group wrote. “At this stage, the top priority should be the expeditious finalization and 2025 Q1 implementation of the target step down.”

“All parties received adequate notice throughout this extended rulemaking process and are prepared for implementation of the new rule, effective at the start of the 2025,” the RNG Coalition continued in its comments. “Few, if any, parties could have anticipated changes requested by the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). Clean fuel credit generators—such as RNG producers—should not be punished with any further administrative delays to the rule. Obligated parties (deficit generators) are all well informed about the rule changes and further delays are not necessary.”

The American Biogas Council also addressed the negative impacts of regulatory delays in its comments. “The recent administrative disapproval of the program’s amendments from the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) has unfortunately delayed the implementation of these vital amendments,” the ABC said in its comments. “The ABC would like to underscore the importance of concluding this rulemaking as soon as possible. Any further delay to the rulemaking diminishes the necessary signal the market needs to facilitate and encourage the continued investments in clean fuels. Without a strong policy signal, the state risks missing opportunities to further reduce GHG emissions from transportation fuels. Thus, the ABC strongly encourages CARB to swiftly address the concerns laid out in the disapproval, resubmit the package to OAL, and begin implementation of the new amendments promptly.”

Minnesota Pollution Control Agency officials gathered next to a field of bright-green pennycress at the University’s St. Paul campus to announce $75,000 in state funding for the U of M’s research into sustainable aviation fuel — and celebrate Earth Day.

MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler said sustainable aviation fuel is a way to cut down on emissions from transportation — Minnesota’s biggest source of pollution.

“Aviation is a sector that is really hard to decarbonize, but today we have a clear opportunity to lead,” Kessler said.

The funding is part of the state’s push to scale up sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. Instead of fossil fuels, it’s made from crops like soybeans, corn, camelina and pennycress. It’s blended with typical fuel, and can run in commercial planes without any modifications.

Researchers say SAF emits less greenhouse gases — up to 70 percent less than standard jet fuel. It’s caught the attention of the aviation industry, as airlines aim to cut emissions without cutting service. Delta is part of a Minnesota partnership with a goal of getting 100 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport by 2030.

To get there, researchers say they’ll need to plant a lot more crops.

The new funding from MPCA will support a study aimed at planting one million acres of camelina across the region.

Mitch Hunter is the co-director of the U’s Forever Green Initiative, which is leading the effort to step up production of winter-hardy crops, like camelina and pennycress. Hunter said at this point in the spring, there are 17 million acres of cropland in Minnesota with nothing growing on them. Winter crops could fill that space, keep soil healthy and prevent erosion, and they have ready buyers in the airline industry.

But he said it’s a challenge to quickly get seeds to farmers, grow the crops and produce SAF — all steps that still need to be built in the budding industry.

“We, in some sense, need to solve all of those at the same time so that we can lift the whole supply chain at once,” Hunter said.

Hunter said this project will build a “road map” for getting more crops in the ground.

The $75,000 from the MPCA is topping off other funding, including $10 million from the U.S. Department of Energy. But Hunter said the federal government is reassessing that award as it makes sweeping cuts.

Kessler said that federal uncertainty makes the state funding all the more important.

“We can't control what's happening in DC and at the federal level, but I know that we are all doing as much as we can to make sure that we underscore the needs here, and that we can take care of the economy and the environment within Minnesota,” Kessler said.",https://img.apmcdn.org/f92223b8f02d896fe211afc358aaedd589d9aabe/widescreen/9b1d75-20250422-renewable-aviation-research01-2000.jpg,N,,2025-04-22 16:57:16.075887

With just a quarter-century remaining to achieve the internationally recognized goal of net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050, industry stakeholders and governments must acknowledge that the target is in serious doubt. To achieve the overall goal at the earliest possible date, they must also recognize its complexity. It involves several key interconnected factors: effectively managing the anticipated surge in passenger numbers, establishing incentives to drive tangible short-term progress and forging a transparent and efficient process for certifying groundbreaking innovations crucial for long-term industry transformation.

Crucially, some of those tasks will require substantial financial investment and unwavering governmental support. The time for aspirational declarations has passed. What the industry needs today is concrete action and resource allocation.

Addressing Escalating Air Travel From a Rapidly Growing Middle Class

Middle-class populations are growing rapidly worldwide, especially in developing countries. As a result, air travel is an option for the first time for significant numbers of people, and flight service providers are anticipating significant growth.

However, to meet this need effectively, airlines will likely be tempted to simply expand their existing fleets using current, readily available aircraft. Needless to say, bringing more traditional aircraft and technologies online will increase the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality.

That approach will require significant upfront investment from air carriers, potentially leading to a short-term increase in ticket prices and probably impacting current growth models. The long-term benefits of a sustainable aviation industry will outweigh these immediate issues, of course, but clearing the near-term hurdles will be challenging.

Investing in a Sustainable Future: Four Key Pillars

To reduce its carbon footprint, the aviation industry must make good on its commitments to substantial investments in cutting-edge technology and supporting infrastructure. It must also ramp up its educational efforts to ensure everyone understands what is at stake, the benefits of carbon-neutral aviation and the hurdles ahead. Sustainability initiatives must be built on these four pillars:

1. Cultivating acceptance of change

Given the critical need for widespread understanding and support, the aviation sector must continue to invest in comprehensive education initiatives targeting all stakeholders and the public regarding the value of sustainable aviation. Proactive and consistent communication will help promote acceptance of necessary changes and build confidence in the industry’s commitment to a greener future. By clearly articulating the critical need for decarbonization, the tangible benefits of innovative technologies and the long-term vision for a truly sustainable air transport network, the industry can create a more supportive environment. More than a public relations exercise, these efforts are necessary to ensure the long-term viability and acceptance of a transformed aviation industry.

2. Steady movement toward sustainable aviation fuel

Another important aspect of this initiative is the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). While SAF offers the significant advantage of requiring minimal to no modifications to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure, its widespread impact hinges on substantial commitment and investment from both private and public sectors. Unfortunately, fears that the commitment won’t be forthcoming have cast doubt on achieving the 2050 net-zero goal.

Currently, SAF production is carbon-intensive, and its cost is approximately double that of conventional jet fuel. In addition, the necessary investments in feedstock development and infrastructure to support its growth could further increase its relative cost. The report also suggests that even if the entire global fleet operated solely on SAF, emissions would only be reduced by approximately 23%, so it is also vital to view SAF as just part of the near-term solution.

3. Incremental yet meaningful technological advancements

The third critical area involves continuous technological innovation aimed at reducing fuel consumption. This includes optimizing ground and flight operational profiles for greater efficiency and developing more fuel-efficient aircraft designs and engines.

While these changes might be gradual and subtle, their cumulative effect will have a substantial impact on overall emissions. Optimizing flight paths and deploying cleaner engines in more aerodynamic aircraft will eventually yield significant reductions, justifying the considerable effort these advancements will require. It has been estimated that a combination of widespread SAF adoption alongside these incremental technological improvements could enable the industry to reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 70% by 2050, even with a projected annual air traffic growth rate of 3%. Still, the willingness of stakeholders to invest at the speed and pace necessary to achieve net zero by 2050 remains in question.

4. Radical innovation in aviation systems and resources

The fourth and most transformative area requires long-term investment in entirely new propulsion systems and alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and other clean energy sources, to replace existing jet fuel-powered fleets. While these developments hold immense potential for substantial carbon emission reductions, the pathway to realizing battery-powered propulsion for short-haul flights and hydrogen or other sustainable fuels for longer-range travel will be complex and require significant advancements.

This longer-term phase of innovation will likely require a complete rethinking of fundamental aircraft designs and the development of entirely new propulsion technologies, alongside the establishment of the necessary supporting infrastructure. This includes airport facilities but also crucial downstream aspects, such as producing hydrogen in ways that are, themselves, carbon neutral. Battery technology must also evolve and improve rapidly to make power sources more energy-dense, safer and easier to produce at scale.

Navigating Regulations and Managing Risk

A clear and efficient path to certification must be established for all types of innovation. This will provide a crucial sign and encouragement to those willing to invest in sustainable aviation. Investors will only realize returns on their investments when their innovative technologies can be implemented widely across various sectors, supported by forward-thinking regulatory authorities.

And, of course, innovation involves risk. The aviation and aerospace industry has a history of costly and, at times, dangerous failures. For innovative companies (and the industry generally) to succeed, they will need help managing risk effectively.

Stakeholders must also be aware that potential shifts in the global economic landscape could introduce instability, potentially deterring the long-term investments necessary to achieve carbon neutrality. Similarly, regulatory bodies that fail to provide a clear and timely process for certification will also hinder progress. Therefore, strong public-private synergy is essential to cultivate an environment conducive to success.

The Imperative of Immediate Action

The commercial aviation sector’s transition to net-zero emissions will be long and intricate. Significant changes are inevitable as technologies mature, and despite the most dedicated efforts, achieving complete decarbonization by 2050 remains a formidable challenge. In fact, many believe it is already unattainable and that setting a new, more sensible date for reaching net-zero is advisable.

Either way, the time for decisive action is now. Those entities that enthusiastically embrace this challenge, drive innovation and set the standard for the next century of aviation stand to gain significantly from the ever-increasing global population of air travelers and the goodwill of people rooting for sustainable aviation to become a reality.

BURLINGTON, Vt. / April 22, 2025 / Aviation News – Heritage Aviation, along with Avfuel Corporation—a leading independent supplier of aviation fuel and services—is proud to announce the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport (KBTV).

In celebration of the new offering, Heritage Aviation—the 100% employee owned fixed-base operation (FBO) and FAA-certified 145 repair station responsible for servicing the airport’s general aviation aircraft—hosted the Honorable Mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, and Airport Director Nic Longo at its state-of-the-art, LEED Gold Standard facility on March 21.

This visit underscored the vital role Heritage Aviation plays in supporting Vermont’s aviation industry and the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, while recognizing the FBO for being at the forefront of sustainable aviation operations. Indeed, when Heritage Aviation welcomed its first load of SAF in February, it became Avfuel’s first customer in the Northeast U.S. to provide the new sustainable alternative to jet fuel and commit to its consistent availability.

“We were honored to welcome Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak to our facility, showcasing the dedication and expertise of our employee-owners, and our commitment to sustainability and the next generation of fuel,” said Matthew Collins, chief executive officer of Heritage Aviation. “We are thrilled to partner with Avfuel and to be its first branded FBO location in the Northeast to offer SAF, bringing the next generation of fuel to Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport.”

During the visit, Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak and Longo met with Heritage Aviation’s employee-owners to learn more about SAF, the company’s commitment to providing exceptional aviation services, fostering a culture of employee ownership, and embracing sustainable business practices. As an employee-owned business, Heritage Aviation exemplifies a model of shared success and long-term investment in the region’s economic development.

Heritage Aviation’s SAF from Avfuel—produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR)—is made using the HEFA SPK process, meaning it uses lipids, like used cooking oil, to produce the fuel, and can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel if used in its fully concentrated form. All SAF is required to be blended with jet fuel prior to delivery. With target blend percentages of 30% neat SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel, the SAF Avfuel delivers can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 24% when compared to conventional jet fuel alone.

“We are proud to partner with Heritage Aviation—Avfuel’s premier branded FBO partner in Burlington, Vermont (KBTV)—to bring SAF to the Northeast,” said C.R. Sincock, II, Avfuel’s executive vice president. “It’s a testament to the FBO’s pioneering spirit, and commitment to its community and sustainability efforts.”

This fund is dedicated to accelerating SAF production and supporting projects that meet RefuelEU Aviation or Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) certification standards.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Important Factors

Increasing Airline Commitments

Airlines globally are increasingly adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve net-zero by 2050. United Airlines, for instance, is aiming for 100% green flights by 2050 through the use of SAF, which lowers lifecycle emissions by as much as 85% and can be added to existing planes without changing them. United Airlines was also the first to use SAF in normal flying operations and offers customers a way to pay for the production of SAF through its sustainable flight account. Despite its present limitations and cost, the airline sees SAF as the most scalable solution and emphasizes lower-carbon flying options. United collaborates with multiple SAF producers and energy firms, investing in the production of the future to propel the sustainability of flight.

Technological Advancements in the Fuel Production

Technological innovations in SAF production are making it more efficient and less expensive, thus more commercially feasible. LanzaJet's Georgia-based Freedom Pines Fuels, the world's first ethanol-to-jet SAF refinery, will produce 0.009 billion gallons of SAF annually. Supported by the DOE since 2016, the plant will generate USD 0.07 billion in economic activity, USD 0.005 billion in salaries, and 80 new jobs. This achievement drives the DOE's Synthetic Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge and accelerates SAF adoption via LanzaJet's proprietary ATJ technology, introducing sustainable fuels to airlines and advancing aviation decarbonization.

Slow Development of Infrastructure

One of the largest barriers to SAF adoption is insufficient infrastructure for large-scale production, storage, and distribution. Airports have a key role to play in upscaling SAF to serve 2050 net-zero aspirations since it can substantially lower Scope 3 emissions. Adoptions are however limited by factors like policy risk, cost, technology availability, and feedstock supply. Airports can shape the evolution of SAF by encouraging incentives, policy support, and industry collaboration to establish supply chains. Nevertheless, retrofitting current fuel infrastructure to accommodate higher SAF blends remains challenging without costly modifications.

Adoption in Emerging Markets

SAF demand is growing outside North America and Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East are becoming serious players. India has set energy independence by 2047 and net-zero by 2070, with the inaugural commercial SAF-flown flight from Pune to Delhi as a milestone. The government aims for 1% blending of SAF by 2025, which will demand 14 crore litres per year, and is gearing up for 5%. SAF production utilizing sugarcane molasses as feedstock will give an impetus to the rural economy and generate green jobs, and India can emerge as a global SAF hub potential.

Over 75% of current SAF production employs this technology, with pioneers in its expansion being Neste, World Energy, and BP. The key advantages are high efficiency, refinery compatibility, and top-notch regulator support, although feedstock availability is a limiting factor.

By aircraft, the fixed-wing aircraft segment dominate the market

Fixed-wing aircraft, such as commercial airliners, cargo aircraft, and military aircraft, are the largest consumer segment of SAF. Airlines are increasingly using SAF to lower carbon emissions, with United, Delta, and Lufthansa making long-term commitments to SAF use. The sector benefits from established supply chains for fuels, but the expense of SAF prevents widespread take-up.

By biofuel blending capacity, the over 50% SAF blending segment led the market

Above 50% blending of SAF is yet in the experiment stage since existing aviation regulations restrict SAF blending to 50%. Still, successful flights operated on 100% SAF (such as Virgin Atlantic's transatlantic flight in 2023) suggest that higher blends of SAF will become the new normal once regulations improve.

By platform, the commercial aviation segment led the market

Commercial aviation accounts for the greatest use of SAF, and major airlines such as British Airways, American Airlines, and Qantas have pledged to achieve net-zero by 2050. Governments around the globe are encouraging the use of SAF by making blending mandates and subsidies available, and commercial aviation is the fastest-growing driver of the SAF market.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Major Breakthroughs

In March 2022, Neste partnered with DHL Express to announce one of the largest Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) agreements in history. This deal marks Neste’s most significant SAF initiative and stands as a key milestone for the aviation industry’s shift toward sustainability. Through this collaboration, Neste will strengthen its global network, enhancing connectivity and supporting the industry’s transition to cleaner aviation fuel.

Aemetis has been issued Authority to Construct air permits for its Riverbank, California, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Renewable Diesel (RD) plant. The plant will manufacture up to 0.09 billion gallons annually of SAF and RD. The permits are the result of technical evaluations, public notice, and earlier City of Riverbank approval. They allow Aemetis to proceed with engineering, financing, and construction of the plant. The project is aligned with increasing SAF demand and will be eligible for SAF tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Gevo purchased Red Trail Energy's North Dakota properties for USD 0.21 billion, including a plant that produces ethanol and carbon capture equipment. Redesignated ""Net-Zero North,"" it should produce USD 0.03-0.06 billion of revenue per year. The transaction financed with Gevo equity and a USD 0.105 billion loan provided by Orion Infrastructure Capital. Gevo will grow SAF production and increase carbon sequestration.

The first tranche of revenue certainty mechanism contracts will be given to UK projects that produce SAF using non-HEFA technology and feedstocks only. This means SAF which is not derived from refining vegetable oils, waste oils or fats. With the SAF mandate commencing since 1 January 2025, and a ratcheting requirement of SAF within the aviation fuel supply mix to catalyse demand, implementation of a bankable, robust and deliverable mechanism to attract investment in UK SAF plant construction will be critical to meet the SAF mandate but also to improve energy security by reducing reliance on imports. As of 2024, 60% of imported SAF arrived from China.

The government is clear that it wants to see the UK capture its share of the global SAF market by playing a leading role in development, production and use. Producers, especially those in a nascent industry such as SAF without proven technological readiness, struggle to obtain the significant debt and equity investment required to construct these first-of-a-kind projects. The difficulty is exacerbated by the unpredictable nature of the offtake market, even with a SAF mandate and the regulatory uncertainty within the asset class. This increases the risk premium for equity and makes it almost impossible to attract project financing.

DfT aims to remove the revenue uncertainty component by implementing the GSP mechanism, along the lines of the contract for difference used in the wholesale electricity market for renewable electricity generation. The CfD regime successfully provided revenue stability to attract investment across solar, offshore wind, onshore wind and soon floating offshore wind. The GSP mechanism will involve a private law contract between UK SAF producers and a government agency counterparty setting a strike price that a producer will receive for eligible SAF. Where the reference price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the difference to the counterparty. Where the reference price is below the strike price, the producer receives a payment for the difference from the counterparty.

The Government's stated position that the GSP mechanism must be funded by the aviation industry, following the 'polluter pays' principle. A levy will be charged on aviation fuel suppliers, who will pass on the costs to its offtaker airlines, who will apply costs to flight ticket prices. The user of civil aviation therefore ultimately pays. This is akin to the levy on renewable electricity CfDs which apply to electricity suppliers, who indirectly pass on the costs to electricity consumers.

DfT considers that the revenue certainty mechanism is likely to lower the cost of capital of SAF production plants, meaning producers could sell SAF at a lower market price than in the absence of the revenue certainty mechanism. However, producers and fuel suppliers will incur payments back to the counterparty or by levy payments, depending on the difference between the market price and the strike price of SAF.

DfT's current estimates of the potential impact on airline ticket prices of the revenue certainty mechanism show that the cost per passenger is likely to be limited and in line with the usual market variation of ticket prices.

Next steps

The consultation period on the funding of the GSP ended on 31 March, and we await the results from DfT. The Government's expectation is that all required legislation to implement the GSP will be in place by the end of 2026. Further engagement will be expected before final legislation is passed. Beyond the question of how the GSP will be funded (which is the subject of the current consultation), other key questions that will need to be answered include:",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white/aviation-teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-22 13:58:40.695518
