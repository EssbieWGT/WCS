Aotearoa New Zealand has a genuine opportunity to be part of building a thriving SAF market that could benefit our aviation sector, climate goals and economic competitiveness.
It includes sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.","Comment: When I board my flight from Wellington to Sydney, I’m not just thinking about the meetings ahead. As CEO of a transport energy company, I’m acutely aware that the fuel powering that aircraft represents one of our greatest decarbonisation challenges.

New Zealand is a geographically remote island, which means air travel is vital to our connection with the rest of the world. Tourism also makes up an essential part of our economy. The overwhelming majority of visitors get on a plane to visit and air transport enables the export of some of our most valuable products to customers across the globe every day.

While critical, its contribution to carbon emissions is a challenge that needs to be addressed. Aviation accounts for around 2-3 percent of global carbon emissions, but unlike road transport where we’re seeing the adoption of electric vehicles, the technology pathway for low-carbon aviation is far more challenging. There is no battery technology currently on the horizon to power long-haul international flights. For the foreseeable future, if we want to keep flying, we need liquid fuels.

Beyond changes such as reducing flights or deploying more efficient aircraft, airlines are looking to alternative jet fuel options, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as the most viable solution currently available for a lower-carbon emission future in air travel.

SAF is an industry term used for a form of alternative jet fuel made using feedstocks such as forestry residues, municipal waste, or used cooking oils with the goal of reducing the lifecycle carbon footprint of jet fuel. SAF is most typically used by international airlines when blended with conventional jet fuel to form part of the overall fuel mix and is considered as a ‘drop‑in’ fuel, meaning it can be used in an existing aircraft fleet.

SAF was first used in New Zealand in September 2022, when Z, in partnership with Air New Zealand and Neste, imported 1.2 million litres – enough fuel to power approximately 400 return flights between Wellington and Auckland. This remains the largest SAF shipment New Zealand has made to date.

The aviation sector globally is showing growing interest in SAF. Some airlines have set carbon emission reduction targets, passengers are increasingly conscious of their carbon footprints, and international regulations are generally evolving towards tighter environmental standards. Yet today, SAF represents less than 1 percent of total aviation fuel use worldwide, primarily due to limited supply and high costs.

One of the biggest challenges for SAF production is getting enough of the right feedstock (raw material from which fuels are produced). There are several different feedstocks that are commonly used, such as tallow and vegetable oils. Other feedstocks such as woody biomass or hydrogen can technically be used, however these can be harder or more costly to manufacture. The additional layer of complexity with any feedstock is that many have alternative uses in the energy transition, so the best use case for each feedstock needs to be taken into consideration as countries and industries navigate the energy transition.

For me it isn’t a question of if we need SAF in New Zealand, but how we will be able to successfully establish its supply for the domestic and Trans-Tasman markets when international demand for the product is increasing.

At Z, we’ve spent considerable time over the past few years working with industry partners across Aotearoa to understand what it would take. Our conclusion is clear: we need supportive policy settings to give industry the confidence to invest, combined with strategic partnerships and economies of scale that can deliver SAF reliably and in the most cost-effective way to our airline customers.

The global policy race is already underway

All of New Zealand’s top 10 trading partners now either have SAF-supportive policies in place or have shown support for it. Many countries already have minimum SAF-blending requirements, and over time, market access may depend on meeting these requirements. Without action to establish policy settings that create a level playing field, our region risks losing competitiveness, increased exposure to offshore compliance costs, and being shaped by policies set by others.

The call for supportive policy settings extends beyond Z. Air New Zealand’s public support for a SAF mandate last year reflects broader industry recognition of what’s needed. We’re continuing to collaborate with fuel supply chain partners, airports and airlines and their representative groups to help inform the Government on policy settings that aim to keep New Zealand competitive in an increasingly regulated global aviation market.

Collaborative advantage

Z’s view is that New Zealand’s approach to SAF should play to our strengths – our strong relationships, particularly our Trans-Tasman connections, may allow us to access SAF supply more effectively than attempting to build domestic production capacity from scratch.

That is why Z is looking to our parent company Ampol, to see what opportunities we can leverage with our joint scale. Ampol’s Memorandum of Understanding with GrainCorp and Industry Funds Management Investors (IFM) to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels* industry presents one possible opportunity.

The initial priority under the memorandum saw Ampol and IFM progress a feasibility assessment of a renewable fuels facility at Ampol’s refinery in Brisbane and work with GrainCorp to explore the supply of homegrown feedstocks, including additional crushing capacity to supply canola oil to the potential future plant. The feasibility work for the plant is now complete, and the project has moved into the next phase of pre-FEED (front-end engineering and design).

The project is still very much in its infancy, with much progress to be made before it’s determined viable, but it’s a step in the right direction. It’s not the only project on the table, there are others exploring similar opportunities, and every initiative will keep more options on the table to hopefully see the industry create a viable market in the future.

The opportunity remains

New Zealand needs to evaluate any SAF policy announced in Australia and be ready to consider how it might be mirrored or adapted for the New Zealand market.

This isn’t just about following Australia’s lead; it’s about ensuring we don’t create unnecessary barriers that fragment what could be a unified Trans-Tasman market. When policies are aligned, this will help investment stay in our region.

Aotearoa New Zealand has a genuine opportunity to be part of building a thriving SAF market that could benefit our aviation sector, climate goals and economic competitiveness.

This ambitious program seeks to achieve its environmental objectives by promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for all domestic flights. This is not merely another aid scheme; it represents the very first such initiative approved by the Commission that specifically champions the widespread adoption of SAF.

The Danish scheme, slated to run until December 31, 2027, is meticulously crafted to incentivize airlines operating within Denmark to transition to SAF on their domestic routes. A key objective of this initiative is to ensure that at least one domestic air route operates using a minimum of 40% SAF, a figure remarkably close to the current technical limit of 50%.

Under the framework of this progressive scheme, the financial assistance will be disbursed as monthly direct grants. These grants are specifically earmarked to cover the additional costs incurred by airlines when utilizing SAF as opposed to conventional kerosene. This comprehensive coverage also extends to supplementary expenses related to airport infrastructure adaptations necessary for handling and supplying SAF. To ensure fiscal responsibility and maximize the impact of the aid, the level of support will be determined through a competitive bidding process. This mechanism is designed to guarantee both cost-effectiveness and efficiency in the allocation of funds. The program is projected to support a minimum of 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations on a weekly basis, spread across one or more domestic routes within Denmark.

To prevent any instances of overcompensation, the scheme incorporates stringent rules. These include the explicit exclusion of supported SAF from any parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive. Furthermore, the scheme strictly prohibits the use of SAF that has previously received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or any third countries, ensuring that the aid contributes genuinely new reductions in emissions.

Denmark, for its part, has committed to ensuring that the aid will result in overall CO2 reductions and will not merely lead to a displacement of emissions from one sector to another.

This approval highlights the continued evolution of the 2022 CEEAG, which provides vital guidance on how the Commission assesses the compatibility of environmental protection, climate protection, and energy aid measures that fall under the notification requirement of Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. These Guidelines establish a flexible and fit-for-purpose enabling framework, designed to empower Member States in providing the essential support needed to achieve European Green Deal in a targeted and cost-effective manner.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-30 14:56:53.166807

The company plans to assemble the prototype core for testing starting around year’s end at its recently acquired test site at Colorado Air and Space Port in Watkins. Located close to Denver International Airport and the company’s Centennial headquarters, the facility will be expanded for follow-on, full-up propulsion system tests later in 2026.

Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl noted July 28 on social media that “first chips” had been cut by a computer numerically controlled lathe that was newly installed in the company’s Denver “Supercenter” facility. Other recently acquired machine tools include a 65,000-lb. mill for producing precision machined large castings and forgings. Parts will be combined with a growing collection of other core components already produced, including additively made turbine blades and outer blade air seals.

Texas-based high-temperature materials and components partner ATI is providing materials for Symphony’s high-pressure compressor integrated blade and disk stages, as well as the turbine disk. Other engine partners in the Boom-led propulsion program include Standard Aero and Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT), a unit of Kratos.

In development for Boom’s planned Mach 1.7 Overture airliner, the two-spool, 3:1 medium-bypass turbofan engine will feature a single-stage 72-in.-dia. hollow blade fan and be optimized for prolonged supersonic operation with an air-cooled, single-stage high-pressure turbine and three-stage low-pressure turbine. The overall propulsion system will weigh 14,000 lb. and measure 41-ft. long, of which 12 ft. will be made up by the core.

Originally targeted at around 35,000 lb.-thrust, Boom’s design analysis subsequently indicated the requirement for additional thrust. Although hinted at by Scholl earlier this year, the move to 40,000 lb.-thrust was confirmed by David Lazzara, staff scientist in aerodynamics at Boom.

Speaking at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation Forum in Las Vegas on July 25, Lazzara says Symphony “is an ambitious attempt to bring a new engine to market that fits in between existing off-the-shelf options as a 40,000 lb.-thrust class medium bypass ratio engine. It is already designed to be 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatible, so that we can plug that in once the infrastructure is ready for use.

“On top of that, it has a key set of design features going from the inlet to the trailing edge at the back of the nozzle that enables it to meet the noise regulations as part of the package overall with Overture,” Lazzara says. “We have some experienced partners in the industry that have helped with the turbomachinery design, as well as others who have been a part of engine OEMs and aircraft OEMs that have come together to bring the design in a way that would not be possible by simply pulling an off-the-shelf engine.”

Explaining the difference between a conventional aircraft design approach and the integrated airframe-engine process underway at Boom, Lazzara says “airframe design and the engine design are basically two separate design worlds that are brought together and oftentimes in a suboptimal marriage. When Boom made the choice to bring the engine in-house, they essentially brought those two worlds and made them one, allowing for optimal integration, mission performance and even closure of a business model. This is what sets Boom apart from other attempts at high-speed flight in the past,” he adds.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-07-30 14:57:01.826058

The 230,000-panel installation was developed by Energy Solutions Group (ESG), the Belgian green energy firm, which invested 90 million euros in the project, according to reporting by De Tijd.

The De Groene Energie Corridor (DGEC) solar farm, covering 100 hectares, lies under Schiphol’s approach routes and is capable of powering around 40,000 households. A Dutch court recently ruled that only part of the site (two of its four zones) must be taken down due to potential glare during landings. However, Schiphol is now pushing for the entire farm to be removed.

Safety concerns

In a letter to the Dutch infrastructure minister, Schiphol CEO Pieter van Oord warned that from late August to early April, glare from the panels could force runway closures and lead to ""accidents with potentially fatal consequences."" The airport argues that this would reduce capacity, increase noise elsewhere, and potentially cause millions in damages.

“The main issue is who is responsible for the costs""

ESG and DGEC say they are disappointed with Schiphol’s decision to escalate the issue politically after losing in court. They continue that the project has an irrevocable permit and have proposed reorienting the panels to reduce reflection, but are asking Schiphol to contribute to the cost. “The main issue is who is responsible for the costs,” ESG said.

The dispute marks a setback for ESG, which has grown rapidly with support from investors including Patronale Life, SFPIM and France’s Infranity. The Limburg-based company recently raised 125 million euros and is seen as a potential green energy unicorn.

While solar farms near airports are a growing trend, they remain sensitive. Brussels Airport aims to be carbon neutral by 2030 and has conducted extensive reflection studies for its own solar installations. At Ostend-Bruges Airport, solar panels were also added without issue.

That opportunity, radiating with promise and potential, is green hydrogen.

The upcoming Global African Hydrogen Summit 2025 is not merely another forum for dialogue; it is a clarion call for bold leadership and decisive action. The vision of Africa as a global green hydrogen powerhouse is no longer a distant aspiration. It is an emerging reality, and is fuelled by the continent’s abundant renewable energy resources, a surge in political will, and, most significantly, a dynamic generation of young Africans ready to innovate and lead change.

Consider this: over 60% of the world’s most abundant solar resources shine upon Africa. When combined with expanding wind corridors, burgeoning geothermal developments, and ongoing improvements to hydropower infrastructure, Africa holds an unparalleled natural advantage. This positions the continent to produce green hydrogen at a globally competitive scale and cost. Yet, this journey is not solely about electrons and molecules — it is a roadmap to transformational development, one that uplifts lives and empowers communities.

Green hydrogen is a catalyst for inclusive growth, delivering benefits across multiple sectors:

Decarbonising industries and forging new global value chains: By embracing green hydrogen, we can revolutionise our industrial landscape, positioning itself at the heart of emerging green global value chains. This ushers in a new era of sustainable industrialisation — one that is both environmentally sound and economically resilient.

Creating dignified jobs and empowering local talent: The green hydrogen economy is a powerful engine for employment. From electrolyser manufacturing and advanced engineering services to logistics and infrastructure, this sector offers career pathways that build skills, foster economic independence, and empower individuals and communities alike.

Empowering local communities with clean energy and infrastructure: Beyond large-scale industrial developments, green hydrogen brings direct benefits to communities. It means modern infrastructure and access to clean, reliable energy to power homes, schools, and businesses — transforming lives from the ground up.

Unlocking new markets for African exports: Green hydrogen presents a unique opportunity to enhance the value of African exports. From green hydrogen-based fertilisers to green steel, the continent can open new market frontiers, adding value to agricultural and mineral resources and strengthening trade competitiveness.

However, as we embark on this transformative journey, the future must be built intentionally, grounded in equity, justice, and African ownership. Africa must not repeat the patterns of the past, and must chart a new and fairer course.

The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €36 million (DKK 268 million) Danish measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the domestic aviation sector. This will be achieved through encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuel (‘SAF’) for domestic flights. This is the first State aid scheme approved by the Commission that promotes the use of SAF and represents a significant step towards decarbonising the aviation sector, aligning with both national and EU climate objectives.

The Danish scheme

The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes. It will be in place until 31 December 2027. The goal is to support at least one domestic air route using 40% SAF, which is very close to the current technical limit of 50%. This exceeds the minimum set by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which requires fuel suppliers to achieve a minimum share of 2% during the scheme period.

Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure. The aid level will be determined through a competitive bidding process, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The measure will support at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly, on one or more domestic routes in Denmark. The scheme includes rules to prevent overcompensation, namely by ensuring that supported SAF is excluded from parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive, and by prohibiting the use of SAF that has already received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or third countries.

The Commission’s assessment

The Commission assessed the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (‘TFEU’), which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (‘CEEAG’), which allow Member States to support measures reducing or removing CO2 emissions.

The Commission found that:

The scheme is necessary and appropriate to support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector in line with national and EU environmental targets.

The scheme has an incentive effect, as airlines benefitting from the measure would not use SAF to the same extent without the public support.

The aid has limited impact on competition and trade within the EU. It is proportionate as the aid will be limited to the minimum necessary, given the use of a competitive bidding process. Denmark committed to ensure that the aid delivers overall CO2 reductions and that it does not merely displace emissions from one sector to another.

On this basis, the Commission approved the Danish scheme under EU State aid rules.

Background

The 2022 CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission will assess the compatibility of environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy aid measures which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU.

The Guidelines create a flexible, fit-for-purpose enabling framework to help Member States provide the necessary support to reach the European Green Deal objectives in a targeted and cost-effective manner. The rules involve an alignment with the important EU’s objectives and targets set out in the European Green Deal and with other recent regulatory changes in the energy and environmental areas and will cater for the increased importance of climate protection.

From hydrocracker hacks in Croatia to post‑Brexit fuel moonshots in the UK, from Hawaii’s island‑energy puzzle to solar‑made jet fuel in Switzerland, a new wave of innovators is showing how to crack the hardest code in aviation: scaling SAF without breaking the system that keeps planes (and economies) in the air.

The Hydrocracker Hack: CLG & INA Break New Ground

The first code cracked? Making old refineries run like new.

Chevron Lummus Global (CLG) and Croatia’s INA recently pulled off a milestone demonstration at INA’s hydrocracker unit, proving that legacy infrastructure can be deftly retooled to co‑process bio‑based and fossil feedstocks at scale. The test involved 1,000 tonnes of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) alongside fossil feedstocks — a first for the site — yielding ISCC‑certified clean fuels under the watch of independent body Bureau Veritas d.o.o.

This wasn’t just a “plug‑and‑play” switch. The project required custom filters, re‑engineered laboratory methods, and boosted capacity in both hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units — all while keeping the biogenic feedstock within safe operating parameters.

CLG and INA’s work shows how existing assets can be bent toward the future without breaking budgets or production schedules. And this isn’t a one‑off stunt: INA plans to complete all preparatory work by 2029, positioning itself for continuous SAF supply.

Post‑Brexit: The UK’s Fuel Codebreakers

If Bletchley Park cracked wartime ciphers, the UK’s Department for Transport (DfT) is cracking the supply code for jet fuel’s low‑carbon future.

Through its Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), DfT just backed Essar Energy Transition to build one of the UK’s largest advanced SAF production hubs at Stanlow. The Methanol‑to‑Jet facility is slated to produce 200,000 tons of SAF per year, drawing from 550,000 tpa of renewable e‑methanol and bio‑methanol, including supplies from Essar Future Energies’ upcoming project in Gujarat, India.

The roadmap is clear: pre‑FEED design by March 2026, full FEED by Q2 2026, and a final investment decision by late 2027. When online, the hub will flow directly into the Manchester Jet, Midlands, and UKOP pipeline systems— using existing jet fuel “arteries” to pump green molecules across the UK.

And Essar isn’t the only player in this decoding effort. LanzaTech Global just secured an $8.5M AFF grant for its DRAGON projects:

DRAGON 1 will turn recycled ethanol into jet fuel at a Port Talbot facility using LanzaJet’s Alcohol‑to‑Jet tech.

DRAGON 2 will pioneer the conversion of waste CO₂ + green hydrogen into ethanol for SAF at a UK site yet to be named.

Meanwhile, LanzaJet’s Project Speedbird (36% owned by LanzaTech) also got AFF backing, helping scale SAF production inside the UK.

Island Ciphers: Hawaii & Tahiti Rewrite Their Fuel Future

For islands, energy is its own Enigma — and Hawaii is cracking the code with one of its biggest SAF plays yet.

Par Pacific Holdings, Mitsubishi, and ENEOS Corporation have joined forces under the banner Hawaii Renewables to produce renewable fuels at Par Pacific’s Kapolei refinery. Mitsubishi and ENEOS, via Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, are putting up $100M for a 36.5% stake, with Par Pacific leading project execution.

Once operational, Hawaii Renewables will pump out roughly 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, SAF, naphtha, and low‑carbon LPG — with up to 60% SAF capacity aimed squarely at decarbonizing the islands’ aviation sector.

And in French Polynesia, Atoba Energy and Air Moana are taking a similar path, locking in a 10‑year SAF offtake deal that ramps up from 2026 through 2035, blending physical delivery with a book‑and‑claim system to meet ReFuelEU targets.

Solar Decoded: SWISS & Synhelion Turn Sunlight Into Jet Fuel

In perhaps the most poetic codebreak yet, SWISS International Air Lines became the first airline to integrate solar‑made jet fuel into regular operations.

Swiss‑based Synhelion delivered 190 liters of synthetic crude — created at its DAWN solar‑thermal plant — to a northern German refinery, where it was processed into certified Jet‑A1 fuel. It was then fed into the Hamburg Airport supply system and blended for SWISS flights.

“A genuine milestone,” said CEO Jens Fehlinger, calling it a proud investment in Swiss innovation and a vital step toward wall‑to‑wall renewable aviation.

Cracking the Registry: Ensuring Trust in SAF

Even SAF tracking is getting its code cracked.

The Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) and 4AIR have joined forces to harmonize SAF registries across commercial and business aviation, eliminating double‑counting risks and streamlining emissions claims. “It sends a strong demand signal for more SAF,” said 4AIR President Kennedy Ricci, emphasizing the importance of transparency and integrity in the emerging market.

From Riga to the Runway: The Baltic Breakthrough

And in Latvia, a priority project for the Latvian Investment and Development Agency has broken ground: a 236,000‑ton feedstock plant in Riga, expected to produce 93,000 tons of HVO and 87,000 tons of SAF annually — enough to cover 100% of Baltic aviation demand and export 70% of production.

The Bigger Picture: From Enigma to Everyday

Each of these moves — whether hacking hydrocrackers, repurposing pipelines, or rewriting sunlight into fuel — chips away at the central cipher: How do we make enough SAF, cheaply enough, to decarbonize global aviation?",,N,,2025-07-30 13:56:28.768342

One of the primary contributors is the low weight of the big jet, thanks to its composite materials.
Now, if you ask any pilot or air traffic controller (ATC), every landing is different, and that means that landing speeds are too.

The A350-900 By The Numbers Airbus’ original extra-widebody A350 officially entered commercial service in 2015 with the first delivered A350-900 going to Qatar Airways.","One of the top qualities of the Airbus A350 widebody series, at least if you ask pilots and operators like Cathay Pacific, is its exceptionally slow approach and landing speed coupled with a short ground roll. That performance feature allows flights to haul more cargo or land at airports with short runways and makes operations both more flexible and profitable for carriers as well as improving safety for pilots.

The way Airbus achieved that in its latest widebody series is a combination of a few engineering factors. One of the primary contributors is the low weight of the big jet, thanks to its composite materials. The other big contributor is the aerodynamic shape of its wings and the performance of its engines. So, without any further ado, let's break it down.

How Slow Does The A350 Go?

Now, if you ask any pilot or air traffic controller (ATC), every landing is different, and that means that landing speeds are too. Even with that in mind, the A350 generally comes in around the 140-knot (259 kmh) mark on approach and touchdown. That low speed makes landing safer and smoother during normal operations, but the qualities that make that possible also unlock other potential. In the post-pandemic era of recovery, airlines need the flexibility to fly to virtually any destination with many different load factors and route profiles while keeping costs low.

The large wing surfaces of the A350 with extending flaps and other control surfaces make it highly controllable in harsh weather or under tough conditions like hot or high operations. When the air is thin in hot weather or at high-altitude airfields, the A350 is unbothered, and flights run like business as usual. Its reverse thrusters also shorten the rolling distance the A350 needs to stop once it hits the tarmac, which opens more destinations and increases the max payload potential. That means carriers can fly more, fly further, and go to more places than before with better operating efficiency than ever before.

Airbus has been locked in a rivalry with Boeing for decades over both the narrowbody and widebody market, which has inspired innovation by both aerospace juggernauts. As Boeing struggles with certification and production issues on both the 737 MAX and 777X, Airbus has had an opening to shine. The A350 has impressed airlines around the world with its flexibility, efficiency, and excellent flying characteristics, filling the order books and even prompting a specialized ultra-long-haul variant, the A350-900ULR, to be made for Singapore Airlines.

The A350-900 By The Numbers

Airbus’ original extra-widebody A350 officially entered commercial service in 2015 with the first delivered A350-900 going to Qatar Airways. The first of its class, the -900, is not a small plane by any means. Purpose-made to be a champion of long-haul flying, it also carries a strong seat count that makes it highly useful for both dense hubs and distant connections. Over 560 of the -900 model have been built for customers all over the world, from the United States to China or Qatar, along with almost 100 of the -1000 variant thus far.

The -900 so impressed with its fuel efficiency and range that Singapore ordered seven jets with more fuel capacity to make nonstop flights between Changi International Airport (SIN) and New York’s John F Kennedy International (JFK), which covers 9,537 miles (15,349 km) and is nearly 19 hours long. The high-lift aerodynamic design that makes low-speed landings possible also gives it that incredible range.

The A350-1000 By The Numbers

Three years after its predecessor, the stretched A350XWB variant would arrive at Qatar as well, with the first A350-1000 touching down at Doha International Airport (DIA) in 2018. The -1000 has the more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines compared to XWB-84 on the -900 but virtually identical wings, but thanks to its elongated fuselage, it can carry more fuel to fly even further.

The A350-1000 has an equally good reputation for low-speed handling that makes takeoff and landing a smooth and safe experience for aircrew and passengers alike. The freighter variant A350F that is expected to debut in 2027 will use the same platform as the -1000, just swapping seats out for pallet anchors. The -1000 has been a success serving the largest hubs in the world for global airlines like Emirates, Japan Airlines (JAL), British Airways, and Air France, to name just a few.

Composite Airframe Weight Savings

Airbus claims that by using composites known as carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and other weight-saving techniques, the A350 cut 1.2 metric tons of weight compared to conventional alloys. Minimizing the aircraft's systems, structures, and installation architecture also enabled this weight loss regimen. These advances in material science were applied to both the -900 and the stretched -1000.

The A350 program advanced the aerospace application of cutting-edge carbon fiber. The support structure of the landing gear, as well as the upper and lower wing covers, all use the same material, in addition to the fuselage structures. CFRP helped make the cabin quieter, and its greater strength allowed for a reduced cabin altitude of 6,000 ft (1,828 m). The wider and longer cabin also allowed for bulkheads in the rear and cockpit to be changed, with 30 extra seats possible thanks to the new layout.

In the first recorded incident of a serious A350 crash that occurred in Japan last year, the composites materials were credited with actually saving lives. At Tokyo Haneda Airport(HND), the JAL A350-900 collided with a Coast Guard Bombardier Dash-9 patrol plane en route to Niigata with humanitarian aid. The Dash-9 crew all perished in the mishap, but all 379 passengers and crew of the Airbus escaped, which was attributed to the fire-resistant qualities of the plane’s materials in a report by Plastics Today.

The use of advanced carbon-fiber composites made the A350 lighter, which makes its lowest airspeeds before stall better than the previous generation. That material also dramatically increased the performance of its control surfaces and wing, which enhanced its lift generation and aerodynamic properties in all flight regimes.

Aerodynamics For Ideal Handling

Each variant of the A350 has essentially the same wing with a flexing shape that “twists” as it flies through different conditions of speed, altitude, and load factors. That wing enables it to fly efficiently at high cruising speeds as well as land with slow, gentle handling characteristics. The carbon composite material that makes up much of the wing’s composition allows it to have this incredible flexibility while also being very light and strong.

A report by the International Council of Aeronautical Sciences (ICAS) praised the engineering of the A350, saying:

“‘Shaping Efficiency’ was the directive for the design of the aircraft, which was valid for all involved disciplines but of special motivation for aerodynamics. That means for the high-lift system to deliver maximum aerodynamic efficiency for low approach speeds and low take off drag, while keeping the overall system small and simple to provide low weight and low complexity.”

The wings of the A350 are very large and get even larger when the leading Droop Nose Device (DND) and slat surfaces drop down to increase lift. The Adaptive Drooped Hinge Flaps (ADHF) extend as the plane nears the runway, which raises the wing’s lifting power even more. There are also seven spoilers on the wing to complement the flaps’ effects. All of these qualities make both the A350-900 and -1000 a slow, safe, and predictable widebody jetliner when it returns from the sky and gently sets back down on earth.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-the-airbus-a350-has-such-a-slow-landing-speed-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 12:58:08.732889

The successful test, conducted within a CLG-licensed hydrocracking unit, underscores the adaptability of existing refinery infrastructure for producing renewable fuels. This development is particularly crucial as the aviation industry seeks viable pathways to decarbonize and reduce its environmental footprint. The ability to integrate new feedstocks into current operational units offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for increasing SAF production capacity.

""This test-run conducted at INA's hydrocracker unit, along with several other recent tests by CLG licensees, showcase how our technology can be integrated into customers' existing infrastructure to co-process a wide range of feedstocks to produce clean fuels,"" stated Arun Arora, Chief Technology Officer, Chevron Lummus Global. Arora further emphasized, ""The results also underscore the flexibility and scalability of our technologies and how they help customers maximize the value of their assets while achieving their sustainability goals."" His comments highlight CLG's commitment to fostering innovation that supports both economic viability and environmental responsibility.

The testing phase involved the co-processing of 1,000 tonnes of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) feedstock, a biogenic material, alongside conventional fossil-based feedstocks. The rigorous process and the resulting biofuels were meticulously certified by Bureau Veritas d.o.o., an independent certification body, in strict adherence to the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard for sustainable biofuels. This certification provides crucial validation of the sustainability credentials of the produced SAF and renewable diesel.

Prior to the commercial test, CLG and INA engaged in extensive collaboration to overcome the inherent complexities associated with processing a novel feedstock like POME, which possesses distinct physical and chemical properties. This collaborative effort encompassed a wide array of preparatory activities, including the procurement of specialized filters, the adaptation of existing laboratory methodologies, and crucial modifications to enhance the capacity of both the hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units. Furthermore, meticulous attention was paid to ensuring the controlled and safe handling of the biogenic feedstock within the refinery's existing operational parameters.

Petrolimex will introduce E10 at 36 fuel stations across Ho Chi Minh City, while PVOIL will begin sales at six locations, including four in Hanoi and two in Hai Phong.

Despite the upcoming launch, concerns remain about ethanol supply. Vietnam currently has six ethanol production plants with a combined capacity of around 500,000 cubic metres per year. However, only two facilities are currently operating, producing just 100,000 cubic metres annually.

Dao Duy Anh, deputy director of the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Agency for Innovation, Green Transition and Industry Promotion, noted that Vietnam may need to import ethanol in the early stages. Major ethanol-producing countries such as the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as regional suppliers like Singapore and South Korea, are expected to help fill the gap.

In the meantime, domestic ethanol producers are preparing for a potential rebound in demand. The Petrovietnam Central Biofuels Joint Stock Company is working to restart key production facilities, including the Dung Quat plant, which is expected to resume operations by late 2025.

This approval marks the first time the Commission has greenlit a state aid scheme focused specifically on promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reflecting a key step towards decarbonising the aviation sector, reports European Commission.

The Danish government’s plan targets domestic flights, encouraging airlines operating within the country to switch from conventional jet fuel to SAF. The scheme will remain in effect until the end of 2027 and aims to ensure that at least one domestic air route operates with 40% SAF—just below the current 50% technical limit and well above the 2% minimum required under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.

To support this transition, airlines will receive direct monthly grants to cover the extra costs of SAF compared to regular fuel. These grants will also help offset any associated infrastructure expenses at airports. The aid will be awarded through a competitive bidding process to guarantee cost-effectiveness. The scheme is expected to support a minimum of 20 commercial one-way flights each week using SAF on one or more domestic routes.

The program includes safeguards to avoid overcompensation. It ensures that supported SAF does not benefit from other forms of government or EU subsidies, including those under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the ReFuelEU framework. SAF that has already received funding from Denmark, other EU countries, or third countries will not be eligible for support under this scheme.

The European Commission evaluated the Danish scheme under Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), which permits state aid that supports economic development, and the 2022 Climate, Environmental Protection and Energy Aid Guidelines (CEEAG).

The Commission concluded that the plan is both necessary and appropriate for helping Denmark and the EU meet their environmental goals. It determined that the public support gives airlines a real incentive to switch to SAF—something they would not likely do on their own at this scale. The Commission also noted that the scheme is designed to minimize market distortion, as the aid is limited to what’s necessary and awarded through a competitive process. Denmark has committed to ensuring the measure leads to genuine carbon reductions, not merely shifting emissions elsewhere.

US refiners criticize Trump biofuels approach

New York, 29 July (Argus) — A US oil refining trade group wrote to top Republican lawmakers to criticize federal biofuel policies that are favorable to farmers and to voice opposition to a bill that would authorize higher-ethanol gasoline blends. ""Recent policy decisions will negatively impact consumers, our members, and the President's energy dominance agenda,"" the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) wrote in a 25 July letter to House speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader John Thune, which was obtained by Argus . AFPM has long criticized biofuel policies it says hike energy costs and threaten domestic refining capacity. But the group was previously noncommittal on legislation that would allow the year-round sale of 15pc ethanol gasoline (E15), which nearly passed Congress late last year. The bill — previously seen as a narrow compromise with oil interests since it also offers some small refiners targeted relief from biofuel blend mandates — is a top priority for ethanol advocates this year and could now require further changes to assuage the oil industry. The outreach suggests that Republicans' efforts to boost fossil fuel companies after an unfavorable regulatory environment during former-president Joe Biden's tenure are not entirely succeeding. And the letter is notable too given some other oil companies' recent support for stronger biofuel incentives. The American Petroleum Institute joined a lobbying push this year for a steep increase in biomass-based diesel quotas and has supported the E15 bill. AFPM focuses much of the letter on the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners and importers to annually blend certain amounts of biofuels or buy credits from those that do. The Trump administration recently proposed requiring record-high biofuel blending the next two years and halving credits for fuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. The US plans to finalize those new biofuel quotas before November. The changes could mean not just pricier credits for oil refiners with limited biorefining capacity but also thinner margins for companies that saw renewable diesel as their way to escape the program's mounting compliance costs. The fuel lacks the blend limits of ethanol and biodiesel and can be made through a similar hydrotreating process as crude refining, but renewable diesel producers say domestic feedstock options are limited. US refiners used South American tallow and Asian used cooking oil to make more renewable diesel than ever before last year, frustrating farm groups that see foreign supplies as curbing demand for domestic crop-based fuels and feedstocks. The letter also faults the Environmental Protection Agency for its delays resolving a long backlog of small refiners' requests for program exemptions and signaling it could require larger companies to compensate for any future waivers by blending more biofuels themselves. AFPM did not confirm the letter, although the group told Argus it has ""deep concerns with federal biofuel policy and the latest [Renewable Fuel Standard] proposal, especially"" and that it is sharing these concerns with the administration and Congress. The letter points to other policies too, including ""eleventh-hour"" emergency waivers allowing E15 year-round in 2025. Some refiners had already spent millions of dollars preparing for a now-delayed shift to a lower-volatility summertime gasoline blend in the midcontinent, which would have allowed E15 blending in that region. AFPM is also frustrated with recent legislative changes to a biofuel tax credit — upping subsidies for corn ethanol in future years while cutting off eligibility for renewable diesel made from many foreign inputs — and with tariffs on renewable feedstock imports. Valero and Phillips 66 — which both told analysts last week that they would throttle biofuel output because of poor margins — are members of AFPM alongside other major renewable diesel producers like Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, and HF Sinclair.

US-EU deal sets impossible energy sales goal

Washington, 28 July (Argus) — A deal the EU negotiated with President Donald Trump's administration in a bid to avoid a major trade war committed the European bloc to purchasing $250bn/yr in US energy commodities in the next three years — a target that outstrips current US production and export capacity. Comments from European officials indicate that the commitment is likely to focus on LNG, in the broader context of efforts by the EU to phase out the remaining imports of Russian pipeline natural gas and crude. EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Monday called the $250bn/yr target ""achievable"", and the White House said the deal will ""strengthen the US energy dominance, reduce European reliance on adversarial sources, and narrow our trade deficit with the EU"". US exports of crude, refined products, LNG and natural gas liquids (NGLs) to the 27 members of the EU amounted to $74.3bn in 2024, based on US Department of Commerce data. The new deal would require the EU to quadruple the value of those exports — and increase the volume of exports by an even higher amount, since oil prices are lower this year than in 2024. The US exported 1.54mn b/d of crude and 655,000 b/d of refined products to EU members last year — at a total customs value of $58bn. At current WTI prices, US crude exports to the EU would hypothetically need to increase to over 10mn b/d to achieve the US-EU deal's target — about 75pc of current total US output and significantly higher than the total US exports last year. US LNG exports to the EU amounted to 1.7 Tcf of gas equivalent last year — about 22pc of total US LNG exports, US Energy Information Administration data show. The average LNG export price for EU destinations was $6.59/mmBtu last year, and the value of US LNG exports to EU members was $12.2bn. The total value of US LNG exports was $28bn last year. The energy component of the US-EU trade deal is outwardly similar to the so-called ""Phase 1"" deal Trump's first administration signed with China in January 2020 — and is likely to encounter the same issues with enforcement as political commitments clash with market realities. The US-China 2020 deal required Beijing to step up purchases of energy commodities by $18.5bn in 2020 and another $33.9bn in 2021. Hitting the target when the agreement was concluded in January 2020 would have required buyers in China to import an extra 1.2mn b/d at then WTI export prices. Just months later, the Covid-19 pandemic upended global oil markets and resulted in significantly lower oil prices — so achieving the export target would have required an even higher volume of US exports. China, in the end, never reached the Phase 1 deal energy purchase target. US-China trade relations continued to worsen even in the interlude between Trump's two presidencies. Unlike the EU, China has responded with strong countermeasures against tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year. Washington and Beijing are negotiating terms of new trade arrangements against a deadline of 10 August for the snapback of even higher tariffs.

Spain's Moeve sees wider refining margins in 2H

Madrid, 28 July (Argus) — Spanish integrated Moeve expects wider refining margins in the second half of 2025 to support group earnings, after weakness in April-June contributed to a fall in company profit. Moeve's refining margin fell to $5.80/bl in April-June from 7.60/bl a year earlier, it said today. There was regional weakness earlier in the quarter and the firm's entire 464,000 b/d refining system had to shut and restart after a blackout on 28 April. But margins have been above $10/bl throughout July and will continue to be supported by ""stronger product cracks, higher yields and the adaptability of our refining business,"" Moeve's chief financial officer Carmen de Pablo said today. De Pablo sees the visibility of the refining business improving in July-December in terms of marine and aviation fuels, as the timeline becomes clearer for transposition of the EU's renewables directive RED III in Spain. The directive is unlikely to be fully brought into Spanish law before the end of 2025. The outlook for sales of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is positive for the second half of the year, de Pablo said, because airlines have been purchasing and ordering more than the 2pc regulatory minimum blend mandated by RED III in 2025 ahead of directive's transposition. The blackout, combined with scheduled maintenance at the 220,000 b/d Huelva refinery in April and May, drove refinery output 14pc lower on the year to 4.6mn t in the second quarter. Capacity utilisation was 82pc, compared with 94pc in April-June 2024. Moeve's Energy business, which includes its core refining and marketing segments, reported a 31pc drop on the year in adjusted replacement-cost earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) to €277mn ($325mn). Initial estimates for losses resulting from the power cut for Moeve's refineries alone are ""well above €50mn, which we will claim"" said de Pablo. She did not quantify the blackout-related losses at Moeve's aromatics-focused chemicals division, but noted the firm is over the ""worst of the chemicals environment"". Adjusted Ebitda at the business fell by 24pc on the year to €58mn, and sales were down by 12pc at 547,000t. Upstream Ebitda fell by 24pc on the year to €63mn. Moeve's crude production fell by 13pc on the year to 30,000 b/d, reflecting the divestment of 60pc of its upstream portfolio over the past few years. Moeve plans no further disposals this year, de Pablo said, having sold its 25pc stake in exploration block 53 offshore Suriname to TotalEnergies in June. Moeve's adjusted Ebitda fell by 31pc on the year €356mn in the second quarter, and its adjusted profit increased by 8pc to €186mn on unspecified lower depreciation and amortisation charges. Profit including the inventory effect and other unspecified one-time items fell by 49pc to €89mn. Moeve is fully owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth investor Mubadala and US private equity firm Carlyle. Its unlisted status allows it to provide only limited financial information in its earnings results. Group net debt was steady on the year at €2.5bn as of the end of June. Capital expenditure (capex) fell to €502mn from €673mn, and Moeve expects this to be lower still in the second half resulting in capex of ""less than €1.0bn"" for the full year, de Pablo said.

More than a decade after the first SAF-powered test flight, this cleaner alternative is becoming more available in big countries, and wider availability also leads to better affordability.

Avfuel is committed to bringing more and more SAF to the business aviation sector. SAF customers range from major OEMs and airports to corporate flight departments. Avfuel is working with multiple SAF production partners (Neste, Valero, TotalEnergies, and Gevo) and is also actively supporting innovative production technologies (such as power-to-liquid and woody biomass SAF).

Eight of 57 Avfuel fueling locations are SAF strategic supply points across the US. Denver, Colorado, is the latest to join the club, alongside California, Florida, Texas, and New Jersey. This new supply hub in Denver will be the first of its kind in the entire region, which can contribute significantly to making SAF more readily available to operators in the central United States.

The clean fuel that will be available at the Denver location is SAF produced by Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture between an affiliate of Valero (which is a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation) and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients. This is a HEFA-type of SAF, meaning it's made using lipids (fats) such as used cooking oil. This type of SAF claims to reduce GHG emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

However, because SAF can only be used in a blend with conventional fuel, in accordance with the current legislation, this level is much lower in actual operations. More specifically, a blend of 30% SAF and 70% jet fuel can lower GHG emissions by approximately 24%.

This might seem like a small percentage for a clean fuel, but the industry agrees that it's the best alternative available right now, taking into account factors like costs and availability. Even if the percentage is moderate, SAF's greenhouse gas footprint is small enough to be worth it overall.

Avfuel joined forces with Valero to set up this new supply point in Denver, and this kind of agreement between suppliers and producers is essential for advancing the commercial use of SAF. On the other hand, major airlines such as United, Qantas, and Air New Zealand are also investing in green jet fuel and gradually increasing the use of SAF for regular operations.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/new-saf-supply-point-in-denver-is-the-first-of-its-kind-in-the-region-255115_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 04:56:28.855795

Solar Jet Fuel Used for the First Time in Civil Aviation

A reputable European airline and a clean tech startup are the players behind a pioneering move related to green aviation: SOLAR FUEL WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CIVIL AVIATION, and it was successful. In terms of numbers, it is only a small step, but the implications are tremendous, paving the way for a cost-efficient, sustainable alternative to conventional jet fuel.

SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) is a term that is currently widely used when talking about zero-emission aviation, but solar fuel isn’t a well-known alternative to conventional fuel. Solar jet is a type of synthetic crude oil produced using solar energy. Synhelion, a Swiss-based clean tech startup, describes the process of making solar jet fuel[i] as a combination of affordable feedstock, cheap renewable energy, and cost-effective thermal storage.

SYNHELION has benefited from support from Swiss (Swiss International Airlines) since 2020. That is when Swiss became a strategic partner. Two years later, it turned into an investor. Five years after their collaboration began, Swiss and Synhelion were able to demonstrate the use of solar fuel in civil aviation for the first time. It was a premiere for the entire aviation industry.

Although both players are based in Switzerland, the solar fuel was delivered and used in Germany. That’s because it was used as part of the fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. First, Synhelion[ii] delivered a barrel of its synthetic crude oil to a refinery in Northern Germany. Here, the oil was processed and turned into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel.

The crude oil used for this industry trailblazing delivery was manufactured at

using proprietary thermal energy storage system. [CLICK on image to see fascinating video on the process.]

For the next phase, this processed fuel was integrated into the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport, from which it was then used for Swiss flight operations. It wasn’t something big, like an entire flight powered by solar fuel, but it was a first step and a symbolic start.

This first use of solar fuel wasn’t about quantity, but about getting the ball rolling. Synhelion only delivered a 190-liter (50 gallons) barrel of crude oil, and the resulting jet fuel represented only around seven percent of the total fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. The goal was to confirm that THIS ALTERNATIVE FUEL CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY USED TO POWER AIRPLANES via a seamless logistical process.

Could solar fuel become as popular as SAF currently is? Perhaps, but there’s still a long way to go. The production infrastructure required for commercial levels is still in its infancy, and availability is poor. Synhelion has full support from the Swiss, which enables it to move down the certification and scaling-up ladder faster.

Synhelion is now looking to secure the sustainability certification for both its fuel and production process, according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive.

[i] A solar fuel is a synthetic fuel produced using solar energy, through photochemical (i.e. photon activation of certain chemical reactions), photobiological (i.e., artificial photosynthesis), electrochemical (i.e. using solar electricity to drive an endogenic reaction such as hydroelectrolysis),[1][2][3][4] or thermochemical methods (i.e., through the use of solar heat supplied by concentrated solar thermal energy to drive a chemical reaction).[5][6] Sunlight is the primary energy source, with its radiant energy being transduced to chemical energy stored in bonds, typically by reducing protons to hydrogen, or carbon dioxide to organic compounds.

A solar fuel can be produced and stored for later use, when sunlight is not available, making it an alternative to fossil fuels and batteries. Examples of such fuels are hydrogen, ammonia, and hydrazine. Diverse photocatalysts are being developed to carry these reactions in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.

[ii]Solar energy is converted into high-temperature process heat beyond 1’200°C. At DAWN, this solar heat is generated either by renewable solar power from a PV field through an electric heater, or by heliostats that direct the solar radiation onto a solar receiver.Part of the generated solar heat is fed into the thermochemical reactor that produces syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. The syngas is then processed into fuels, such as jet fuel, gasoline, or diesel, using standard gas-to-liquid technology. The other part of the heat is saved in the thermal energy storage to enable continuous 24/7 operation.

[iii] nucleus of a helium atom, a doubly positively charged cation. The term helion is a portmanteau of helium and ion, and in practice refers specifically to the nucleus of the helium-3 isotope, consisting of two protons and one neutron.

[iv] ✈️ The FAA’s approval process for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rigorous and rooted in international standards to ensure safety, compatibility, and environmental integrity.

Certification Standards

SAF must meet ASTM International specifications, primarily:

ASTM D7566: Covers synthesized hydrocarbons for aviation turbine fuel. SAF must be blended with conventional jet fuel and meet ASTM D1655 standards after blending.

ASTM D1655: Standard for conventional Jet A/Jet A-1 fuels. Once SAF is blended and meets this spec, it’s considered fully certified for use.

Approved SAF Pathways

There are currently 11 ASTM-approved production pathways, including:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)

FT-SPK (Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene)

ATJ-SPK (Alcohol-to-Jet)

CHJ (Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet) Each pathway has specific feedstock requirements, conversion processes, and blend limits—typically up to 50% with conventional jet fuel.

FAA’s Role

The FAA supports SAF development through testing, evaluation, and streamlining approvals.

It collaborates with ASTM, OEMs, and research institutions like ASCENT to validate SAF performance and safety.

FAA also contributes to international efforts via ICAO’s CORSIA program, ensuring lifecycle emissions reductions are credible and standardized. Incentives & Legislation

SAF producers may qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, with up to $1.75/gallon based on lifecycle GHG reductions.

The FAA administers FAST grants to support SAF infrastructure and blending at airports.

For more information about H2G and GEIH, please visit: https://h2g.green.","As H2G innovates in novel hydrogen production technologies, the biochar byproducts of its process will be refined and commercialised under the agreement.

SINGAPORE, July 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — H2G Green Limited (SGX:5AI) (“H2G” or the “Company“, together with its subsidiaries, collectively the “Group“), a leader in sustainable energy solutions, and its subsidiary Green Energy Investment Holding Private Limited (“GEIH“) today announced a licence agreement with Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (“A*STAR“).

GEIH is an innovator in sustainable hydrogen with proprietary technologies that repurposes and transforms waste biomass into green hydrogen, as well as biochar and other high-value, sustainable materials. GEIH will commercialise a proprietary treatment process by A*STAR Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (A*STAR IMRE) to purify biochar, a by-product, into high-value hard carbon material for market use. Hard carbon materials are primarily used as anodes for batteries such as sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, due to their unique properties. They are also found in applications for water and air purifications as well as conductive additive in paints and coatings.

Following execution of the licence agreement, GEIH and A*STAR will begin the next phase of scaling up to accelerate the commercialisation pathway of the biochar purification process, focusing on producing hard carbon as anodes for use in sodium-ion batteries.

Mr. Sydney Kwan, CEO of GEIH, remarked: “We are deeply grateful to A*STAR for their ongoing collaboration and support. Our joint efforts are transforming the nation into a hub for sustainable technologies and green energy.”

An earlier exploratory phase found that the hard carbon GEIH produces tends to be superior to existing commercial materials due to a high graphite content, which makes the material favourable for anodes in sodium-ion batteries. These have possible applications for grid-scale energy storage, electric vehicles, and consumer electronics. The abundance of sodium makes sodium-ion batteries a more sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries.

GEIH’s technologies make it especially suited to this endeavour. The Company’s proprietary high-temperature thermochemical process turns any type of biomass without silica into hydrogen, biochar, bio-oil (for sustainable aviation fuel), and wood vinegar. The entire process incorporates circularity of materials as a guiding principle, and production of biochar results from incorporating carbon sequestration. The output materials power sectors as diverse as data centres, wafer fabrication, construction, agriculture, food manufacturing, laundry services, and central kitchens.

Mr. Pek Hak Bin, CEO of H2G, added: “Hydrogen is the energy of the future and a core part of Singapore’s low-carbon energy strategy. H2G is expanding possibilities for Singapore and beyond by pioneering a novel hydrogen production process that is cost-effective, less carbon intensive than electrolysis, and repurposes waste into sustainable materials. These power sustainable industries, as our hard carbon anode materials for sodium-ion batteries will empower a broader range of industries to reduce their environmental impact. In this way, H2G creates win-win-win sustainability solutions to multiple problems across industries.”

More people think the aviation industry should focus on improving flight punctuality rather than reducing emissions, a new survey suggests.

Some 63% of UK adults polled said ensuring planes take off and land on time should be a priority for the sector.

That is compared with 56% who said the same for cutting emissions.

The figure for reducing emissions is up from 53% in 2024, but down from 70% in 2020.

Air traffic control (ATC) provider Nats commissioned the research.

The Government has a target for the UK aviation industry to reach net zero for carbon emissions by 2050.

There are concerns that green policies – such as using more sustainable aviation fuel – could lead to higher air fares.

Nats said it has worked closely with aviation partners over the past 12 months to enhance punctuality and resilience.

This includes using tools such as intelligent approach, which optimises the distances between arriving aircraft.

Nats said it was responsible for 1.2% of total delays to flights en route to Europe in June, despite handling nearly a quarter of air traffic.

Thousands of UK airline passengers have suffered delays because of industrial action by French ATC staff in recent months.

The survey indicated that 52% of UK adults had flown internationally in the previous 12 months, while 32% flew domestically.

Some 26% of respondents expected to fly more in the following year.

The poll also suggested there is growing acceptance of aviation innovation such as drones, flying taxis and AI-enabled services.

For example, 68% of respondents supported using AI to screen bags while 50% were in favour of it managing flight routing.

Simon Warr, Nats’ communications director, said: “The 2025 Aviation Index highlights the public’s clear priorities: reliable service, greater environmental performance, and smart use of innovation.

“As the aviation industry continues to modernise, aligning with these expectations will be key to maintaining public trust and delivering the benefits aviation brings to society.”

Hughes Energy plans to develop a $12 million demonstration facility in Innisfail to convert municipal solid waste into homogeneous fiber which can be used for cardboard manufacturing, biofuels, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The provincial government announced last week it was providing $5 million toward the project through Emissions Reduction Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) program.

It was one of 18 projects to share in up to a $49 million disbursement through the program.

“Support from the provincial government through Emissions Reduction Alberta is instrumental in launching our organics processing pilot facility in Alberta,” said Dane McSpedon, Hughes Energy Group’s chief executive officer, in the province's funding announcement.

“By converting organic material into clean, high-value cellulosic fiber, we’re helping avoid methane emissions from landfills and creating low-carbon feedstocks that support decarbonization across multiple downstream industries,” he said.

Meanwhile, a project planned for Sundre is also receiving funding through the program.

FutEra Power Corp. plans to construct a $15 million closed loop geothermal pilot project. It will receive $5 million through the TIER program.

The TIER fund uses industry dollars to help Alberta facilities invest in innovative emissions-reduction technology to stay globally competitive, create jobs and save money, according to the government.

The 18 projects will reduce about 3.4 million tonnes of emissions by 2030, the government says, and will create close to 1,600 jobs and inject $233 million into Alberta’s economy.

While Emissions Reduction Alberta did not release info on FutEra Power Corp. plans for Sundre, it did give some details of Hughes Energy's proposal for Innisfail.

This project, according to Emissions Reduction Alberta, aims to demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the Hughes System as a step towards commercial-scale operations.

""The modular design of the pilot facility will enable optimization of system performance, validation of feedstock and product quality, and the establishment of long-term partnerships with municipalities and off-takers. At full-scale commercial operation, the facility is projected to process up to 170,000 tonnes of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) annually, diverting this amount from landfills and reducing approximately 300,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions per year,"" it says.

The project is expected to create three to five full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs and 25-35 indirect jobs during the pilot phase, with 50 FTEs and 250-300 indirect jobs anticipated at the commercial scale.

In its submission to the Federal Government’s Economic Reform Roundtable, GrainCorp argued that the agriculture sector has consistently lifted productivity over decades through innovation, resilience and scale. It stands ready to lead the nation’s economic transformation.

“Agriculture has quietly been one of Australia’s most reliable productivity engines,” said GrainCorp Managing Director and CEO Robert Spurway.

“In the grains industry, growers have embraced innovation and continuously adapt to volatility in weather, markets and politics – all while driving more value from every hectare, every tonne, every season.

“Our message to the Government is to let agriculture be an example for other sectors, and to build on that success.”

GrainCorp highlighted the opportunity to establish a sovereign renewable fuels industry that leverages Australia’s agricultural strengths. In partnership with Ampol and IFM Investors, GrainCorp is exploring the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel using local feedstocks such as canola, tallow and used cooking oil.

Spurway said with the right policy settings, such as targeted production incentives and a robust certification framework, this industry could contribute up to $36 billion in market value by 2050 and abate 230 million tonnes of CO₂-e emissions.

“Australia exports billions in feedstocks each year, but we’re missing the opportunity to value-add through local refining and production,” he said.

“A renewable fuels sector doesn’t just support our net zero ambitions, it’s a nation-building investment in energy security, regional jobs and industrial capability.”

The second reform priority outlined in the submission is the urgent need to modernise Australia’s regional freight infrastructure.

Inefficiencies in freight and logistics infrastructure, particularly underinvestment in rural roads, short rail sidings and port congestion, result in significant avoidable costs for growers and exporters each year.

Spurway said smarter investment in freight and digital infrastructure will cut emissions and improve export flow.

“Our supply chain moves more than 60 million tonnes of grain annually, yet it’s being constrained by outdated infrastructure and fragmented planning.

“Improving first- and last-mile freight and unlocking modal shift from road to rail isn’t just an agricultural issue, it’s an economic one.”

GrainCorp’s third area of focus is on regulatory streamlining, pointing to inconsistent and outdated compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

The submission calls for a nationally harmonised freight access scheme for harvest, standardised rail and road protocols, and a single-window digital approvals platform to consolidate infrastructure and environmental applications.

“We’re not asking for weaker regulation, we’re asking for smarter, faster, more consistent regulation,” said Spurway.

“If we want to encourage investment and unlock supply chain performance, we need to match the ambition of our industries with equally modern policy settings.”

GrainCorp’s proposals align closely with the Government’s Five-Pillar Productivity Agenda, particularly in supporting the net zero transition, improving regional infrastructure and using data to drive smarter decision-making.

“These are not sectoral wish-lists,” said Spurway.

“They are nation-building ideas with relevance across multiple industries, and with the potential to create long term economic value.”

GrainCorp said in a statement it will continue to work closely with Government, industry groups and supply chain partners to ensure reforms deliver meaningful outcomes across the broader economy.",https://primemovermag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GrainCorp-Managing-Director-and-CEO-Robert-Spurway.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 00:56:49.137754

This collaboration marks an additional step forward in Luxaviation’s commitment to decarbonizing business aviation, building on the company’s ambitious sustainability roadmap.

The agreement foresees the delivery of up to 10,000 metric tonnes of RFNBO-compliant eSAF annually, beginning in 2029, under a 15-year offtake framework. The fuel, to be produced near Iceland’s Keflavík International Airport using renewable electricity and recycled CO₂, will be certified to meet EU RED II and ReFuelEU criteria and distributed via a book-and-claim system within the European Economic Area.

""The agreement reflects what it takes to make eSAF work: long-term demand, credible certification, and delivery systems that can scale,” said Nanna Baldvinsdóttir, CEO of IdunnH2.

“From a producer’s perspective, this is exactly the kind of agreement we need to move capital into needed eSAF infrastructure.”

The collaboration addresses the urgent need for scalable, high-integrity SAF solutions and supports broader policy goals, including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). The pricing assumptions are within the lower end of current industry benchmarks, and the offtake agreement is expected to reach finalization by September 2026.

“History often shapes the future,” said Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group.

“Today’s agreement with IdunnH2 not only accelerates our SAF ambitions, it also pays tribute to the longstanding aviation bond between our two countries. Just as Luxembourg once opened its skies to Icelandic innovation, we are now forging the next chapter in that story through climate-conscious aviation.”

The Helguvík eSAF facility, operated by IdunnH2, will leverage Iceland’s 100% renewable energy mix and favorable regulatory environment. Once operational, it is expected to produce up to 65,000 tonnes of eSAF per year, positioning Iceland as a key supplier for Europe’s growing SAF demand. Luxaviation’s role as a launch customer demonstrates the vital role that business aviation and long-tenor SAF agreements can play in unlocking infrastructure investment and accelerating aviation’s transition to net zero.

Luxaviation Group continues to set the pace in aviation sustainability, from introducing carbon calculators in its mobile app to electrifying its ground handling fleets and expanding SAF access across its global network.

Kahirós Kahirós is Uruguay's first green hydrogen project to enter construction.","Energy sector decision-makers and stakeholders gathered in Uruguayan capital Montevideo for local renewables chamber Auder's annual conference – Latam Renovables.

Event partner is the Uruguayan branch of the World Energy Council.

BNamericas looks at some of the takeaways from the first day.

Auder president Diego Oroño said a double transition was underway: energy and digital.

The two are closely intertwined, Oroño told the 11th version of the conference.

Citing the opportunities for Uruguay presented by data center investments, Oroño underscored the need to carefully plan, given the potential for competing demand for resources such as water.

""There's no AI without electricity,"" he said, warning of the global risk of AI-related electricity demand playing against emissions-reduction efforts.

Google is building an US$850mn data center in Canelones department dubbed DC-01.

Clean energy matrix

Uruguay obtains over 95% of its electricity from carbon-free sources, but the pace of growth of new clean energy capacity has slowed. Energy must accompany and support economic growth, the event was told.

Renewables expansion will likely be led by solar PV, followed by wind. Multiple projects are in the environmental review phase, many linked to future green hydrogen projects.

State power company UTE has solar PV capacity of around 100MW in development, via 75MW project Melo and a 25MW initiative in San José department.

To bolster the network, a new 500kV transmission corridor is needed, conference attendees heard. About 20% of UTE's budget is earmarked for grid infrastructure, said the company's CEO Andrea Cabrera.

Environment minister Edgardo Ortuño Silva said Uruguay's challenge was carrying out a second energy transition, after building up its clean energy muscles. He cited as work areas electromobility and green hydrogen.

Industry, energy and mining minister Fernanda Cardona also referred to the competitive edge provided by the country's clean energy park.

Uruguay knows where it is heading, Cardona said. The country now needs to take another step, citing decarbonization of industry, and the importance of state policy as an enabler. She referred to the potential of green hydrogen to help achieve this.

The country needs to consider how it can benefit from AI, she said, adding that public-private collaboration and citizen consultation was critical.

An objective is exporting ""value,"" the audience was told. ""This is a government of opportunities,"" Cardona said.

Green hydrogen

In terms of green hydrogen, officials have been in talks with developers in spheres such as planning, local content and financing.

Uruguay has two major green hydrogen projects in the environmental permitting phase: Enertrag's US$1bn Tambor and HIF's US$6bn Paysandú, both targeting derivative e-methanol.

The country has a process underway to create a strategic evaluation system for green hydrogen projects. Uruguay is seen well-positioned to supply the global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market.

Cecilia San Román, the head of state hydrocarbons firm Ancap, said that to support resilience, diversifying the country's energy matrix was key.

Leveraging Argentine gas, reincorporating biodiesel in the finished diesel mix and producing sustainable fuels are part of the strategy, the event heard.

Oil demand has remained largely flat in Uruguay with growth in renewables and electromobility.

Ancap and UTE have a pilot project underway to produce green hydrogen for fuel-cell powered trucks, with a key objective being knowledge and skills-building.

The hydrocarbons company also wants to gradually convert the La Teja refinery into a biorefinery to produce SAF for export. The project is in the basic engineering phase, San Román said. Biofuel unit Alur would provide feedstock and is looking at the potential of nonfood raw materials. Potential processing capacity is 150,000t/y pre-treated oil. A final investment decision is due next year, with Ancap currently looking for partners.

Ancap is also looking to explore for naturally occurring hydrogen, the conference was told. A bidding round could be held.

Regarding offshore production of green hydrogen, Ancap has been working on a planned auction. This project, however, has dropped down the list of priorities, San Román said.

Green hydrogen project update

Tambor

Tambor is planned for three sites, for production, logistics and carbon capture, Enertrag planner Griselda Castagnino told the event.

Wind (194MW) and solar (188MW) parks are planned, along with a grid connection and a reservoir for storage of surface water. Proposed electrolyzer capacity is 140MW, to produce 84,000t/y e-methanol for export. Tambor is in the environmental evaluation phase.

Use of underground water is not planned but could be required for backup.

Ancap

Ancap energy transition manager Santiago Ferro said for ""quite some time"" various energy sources, clean and polluting, will have to co-exist.

The transition is turning out to be more difficult and costly than originally thought, he said, adding that clean sources have expanded the generation park, not substituted other technologies.

Offshore green hydrogen production could be underway by 2040, Ferro said, adding that Uruguay needed to start seeking interested parties. Ancap requires the nod from the government to advance with an auction process.

Planned for San José department, Ancap and UTE's US$8-10mn hydrogen fuel cell project is in the prefeasibility phase. The objective is to supply 2-3 Ancap trucks. Proposed electrolysis capacity is 1MW. A final investment decision is due around the turn of the year.

Eventual offshore production of hydrocarbons could generate revenue to help accelerate development of sustainable fuel initiatives, Ferro said. Oil and gas exploration projects have been filed for environmental review.

Paysandú

The first of four planned modules has capacity to produce 150,000t/y e-fuels. HIF is negotiating with UTE for power supply for the first phase.

A 1.1GW wind park is planned, called Elena. A 921MW solar PV park, Lucía, is also planned along with 160km of transmission lines.

HIF Uruguay head of communities and environment Pablo Montes said a revised layout reduces the production plant's physical footprint.

Carbon dioxide, e-methanol and the e-fuels would be transported by pipeline. The rail network would also be used for transport of the finished product for export.

The project is in the environmental evaluation phase and the next stage involves construction, Montes said, adding that an environmental decision was expected around the middle of 2026.

Kahirós

Kahirós is Uruguay's first green hydrogen project to enter construction.

With Grupo Santander as investor, the Kahirós hydrogen fuel cell project is being built in Río Negro department as a pilot initiative. Kahirós is being developed by three companies: Korean industrial giant Hyundai, transport company Fraylog and generation park construction firm Ventus.

Due online by around the middle of 2026, Kahirós comprises a 4.9MW solar PV park, a 2MW electrolyser, a 77t/y hydrogen plant, a fueling station and six fuel cell trucks, geared to the forestry sector.",https://cdnimg.bnamericas.com/XcmWQvWZJUDpSOWRcrccUoHZxAiEgqgWpUcNsidETXwlGkYlULYlAvhwzQqKLwBg.jpeg,N,,2025-07-29 18:56:36.718333

Industry sources reported on July 27 that SK Energy dispatched approximately 6,000 tons of HVO from its Ulsan refinery in early June.
This delivery represents the company’s first HVO export in 2025 and its second overall.
Furthermore, SK Energy has committed to supplying over 20,000 tons of SAF to Cathay Pacific Airways in Hong Kong by 2027, showcasing its commitment to supporting the aviation industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources.
Through these ongoing efforts, SK Energy is not only expanding its export portfolio but also contributing meaningfully to global decarbonization goals, as highlighted by several media reports.","SK Energy has marked another milestone in the eco-friendly fuel sector by successfully exporting a second shipment of hydrogenated biodiesel (HVO) to Europe, reinforcing its growing presence in the global green energy market. This achievement follows the company’s pioneering move in 2023, when it became the first South Korean firm to export Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Europe, according to several media reports.

Industry sources reported on July 27 that SK Energy dispatched approximately 6,000 tons of HVO from its Ulsan refinery in early June. The shipment is expected to arrive in Europe by mid-August. This delivery represents the company’s first HVO export in 2025 and its second overall. The initial shipment, involving around 5,000 tons, was made in December 2023.

Hydrogenated biodiesel, or HVO, is a renewable alternative to traditional diesel. It is derived by treating plant-based oils, such as used cooking oil, with hydrogen. The result is a fuel compatible with existing diesel engines in vehicles like buses, trucks, and passenger cars, requiring no engine modifications. HVO is recognized for its significant environmental benefits, including the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to standard diesel.

The European Union’s increasingly stringent environmental policies, especially its Renewable Energy Directive (RED), are key drivers behind the rising demand for HVO. Under this directive, EU member states are obligated to ensure that at least 29% of the energy used in transportation comes from renewable sources by 2030. These regulations are accelerating the shift toward cleaner fuel options across the continent.

Reflecting this growing demand, HVO prices in Europe have recently surged. On June 20, the price of HVO reached $2,216 per ton — a peak not seen in seven months, as per industry data. A representative from the energy sector explained, “The tightening carbon regulations in Europe are elevating the importance of low-carbon fuels like HVO. By 2026, HVO consumption across Europe is expected to reach record levels.”

In alignment with this global trend, SK Energy has made strategic moves to solidify its role in the low-carbon transportation fuel market by focusing on both HVO and SAF. The company began full-scale production of SAF at its Ulsan refinery in early 2024 and successfully completed its first SAF export to Europe earlier this year. Furthermore, SK Energy has committed to supplying over 20,000 tons of SAF to Cathay Pacific Airways in Hong Kong by 2027, showcasing its commitment to supporting the aviation industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources.

Through these ongoing efforts, SK Energy is not only expanding its export portfolio but also contributing meaningfully to global decarbonization goals, as highlighted by several media reports.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-29 17:58:15.731265

DENVER, Colo. / July 29, 2025 / AVIATION NEWS—Avfuel Corporation, the leading independent supplier of aviation fuel and services, is expanding its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) footprint with the addition of a new, strategic supply point in Denver, Colorado—the first of its kind in the region.

Denver’s key location will play a crucial role in improving SAF accessibility across the central United States, offering a reliable, regional supply point and negating the need to transport fuel from the West and East coasts.

The expansion marks another milestone in Avfuel’s mission to support business aviation’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The company’s SAF supply chain leads the industry in scale, spanning coast to coast with eight supply points throughout California, Texas, New Jersey, Florida and now Colorado.

“We continue to see interest in SAF adoption,” said C.R. Sincock, II, Avfuel’s executive vice president. “Avfuel is proud to have established the first SAF supply point in this region, significantly enhancing our national supply infrastructure and leading the way in providing sustainable solutions for aviation operations.”

This latest supply point is made possible by Avfuel’s agreement with Valero Marketing and Supply Company (Valero), a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO). The neat SAF produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR), is made using the HEFA SPK pathway process, meaning it uses lipids—like used cooking oil—to produce the fuel, and can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel. With target blend percentages of 30% neat SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel, SAF can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 24% when compared to conventional jet fuel.

ICJ opinion could open door for more climate litigation

London, 28 July (Argus) — A landmark outcome from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 23 July found that countries have an obligation to contribute to cutting emissions, and wealthy, industrialised nations should take the lead on tackling climate change. The court left the door open for further climate litigation, finding that breaching these obligations constitutes a ""wrongful act"" for which ""injured states"" could claim restitution and compensation. The ICJ's advisory opinions are not legally binding but carry significant weight and may contribute to the development of international law, non-profit the Centre for International Environmental Law says. International climate treaties — such as the 2015 Paris Agreement — ""establish stringent obligations upon states to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions"", the ICJ said. Countries ""must fulfil their duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence"", the ICJ said. It noted the discretion built into UN climate body the UNFCCC for nations to determine the means by which they cut emissions. But it was clear that ""this discretion cannot serve as an excuse for states to refrain from co-operating with the required level of due diligence or to present their effort as an entirely voluntary contribution which cannot be subjected to scrutiny"". The court found that countries party to the Paris Agreement have an obligation to present national climate plans that align with its primary temperature goal of limiting the global rise to 1.5°C from a pre-industrial baseline. The ICJ also focused on the primary cause of GHG emissions — burning fossil fuels. ""Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act... attributable to that state"", it found. ""Where several states are responsible for the same internationally wrongful act, the responsibility of each state may be invoked,"" it said. Definitive legal guidance The ICJ's opinion ""will equip judges with definitive guidance that will likely shape climate cases for decades to come"", environmental organisation ClientEarth lawyer Lea Main-Klingst previously told Argus . Existing pathways could allow countries to take legal action against other nations, ""and no changes to international law are needed for it to happen"", CIEL climate and energy programme director Nikki Reisch tells Argus . Individual states could vary in how they interpret the court's findings, but the opinion was comprehensive and punctured arguments often used to push back on more stringent climate action. The ICJ noted that ""it is scientifically possible to determine each state's total contribution to global emissions, taking into account both historical and current emissions"", and that states could be found responsible if they do not regulate emissions caused by ""private actors"" under their jurisdictions. Climate litigation has risen steadily in recent years and cases including those challenging fossil fuel projects are ""more often reaching the highest courts around the world"", researchers at the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute say. And the damage caused by climate change is growing, increasing the pressure to define legal parameters and responsibilities. The ICJ proceedings hit several milestones. The issue drew the highest level of participation in a proceeding seen by the ICJ or its predecessor. And the court adopted the advisory opinion unanimously — just the fifth time in its 80-year history that this has happened. But it made the point that international law is just one tool in the fight against climate change. The proceedings ""concern an existential problem of planetary proportions"", the ICJ said. ""International law… has an important but ultimately limited role in resolving this problem"".

NZ will miss GHG targets without policy change: report

Sydney, 28 July (Argus) — The New Zealand government needs to act ""urgently"" to meet emissions reductions targets over 2026-35, including amending its emission trading scheme (ETS), the country's Climate Change Commission (CCC) has warned. The centre-right coalition government's plans are ""insufficient"" to meet the 2026-30 and 2031-35 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions goals of 50pc and 51-55pc below 2005 levels respectively, the CCC said on 25 July in its monitoring report for emissions reductions. The country is on track to meet its 2022-25 emissions reduction goal of 39pc from 2020 levels , which the CCC said was primarily due to a change in how emissions are measured. New Zealand needs to adapt the NZ ETS for it to be effective from 2026. The net emissions cap — the targeted level of net emissions the government seeks to achieve from sectors covered by the NZ ETS — is expected to reach zero in the late 2030s, and the scheme is not incentivizing significant gross emissions reductions. These issues need to be addressed before the government releases the third emissions budget in 2029 for the country to meet its 2050 net zero goal. It may also be ""too late"" for planned NZ ETS incentives for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) because of declining reserves and the uncertain outlook for gas, making investment uneconomic, the CCC said. Other policies need to be introduced to compliment the NZ ETS, the report found, focusing on the agriculture, renewable energy and transport sectors. Emissions from the transport sector could be reduced by incentivising the use of zero emissions heavy vehicles, making low-carbon fuels and sustainable aviation fuels more accessible, and increasing EV batteries, especially for larger vehicles. NZ's jet fuel market is expected to grow , according to the government's draft national fuel security plan. Air New Zealand must use a 10pc blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with traditional jet fuel to meet its GHG reduction target of 20-25pc by 2030 from 2019, it said in May. In 2023, agricultural emissions accounted for 53pc of New Zealand's gross emissions. Further reductions are in part reliant on technologies, such as a methane-reducing capsules, that do not have certain timelines. This could be helped by focusing on high-value, low-emissions land uses. The government plans to implement agricultural emissions planning by 2030. Legislative changes were made last year to keep the agricultural sector out of the NZ ETS . The government announced rules to limit the conversion of farmland to forests late last year but the CCC is uncertain of this policy's impact. ""How this policy will affect afforestation rates and the NZ ETS incentive for gross emissions reductions is uncertain,"" it noted.

US Republicans seek to block Paris climate funds

Washington, 25 July (Argus) — US congressional Republicans are moving to block funding for a number of UN climate change programs tied to the Paris climate agreement. The US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on Wednesday voted 35-27, along party lines, to advance a fiscal year 2026 funding bill for the State Department and other foreign operations. It includes language that would prohibit directing funds to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to implement the Paris climate agreement and to the related green climate, clean technology and loss and damages funds. The bill does not specify any amount of funding that would be affected, but it could be in the billions, based on past US contributions to the UN programs. The committee did not respond to requests for comment. The restrictions would be in line with the President Donald Trump's decision to pull back from global engagement on climate change. Trump, in one of his first actions back in office, ordered the withdrawal of the country from the Paris agreement, and the State Department in February rescinded about $4bn in pledged US funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The vote comes less than four months before the UN Cop 30 climate talk in Brazil, which plans to deliver a ""roadmap"" setting out how global climate finance could be increased to $1.3 trillion/yr. Brazilian officials have acknowledge that Trump's return to office could complicate those efforts. Committee Democrats warned the bill would put US interests at risk and further isolate the nation from the rest of the world. ""Their bill surrenders our efforts to combat the climate crisis — eliminating support for climate adaptability and clean energy, ignoring the nexus between climate, conflict, and migration, and jeopardizing the safety and security of our children and our grandchildren,"" ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut) said. The GCF finances projects in developing and emerging countries with a focus on mitigation, adaptation and resilience efforts, such as climate-friendly agricultural methods, reforestation or coastal protection. It recently approved more than $1.2bn in funding for 17 projects across 36 countries. The GCF now has a portfolio of 314 projects, which total $18bn in GCF resources and $67bn including co-financing. The appropriations bill still has several more steps to clear before the funding restrictions become law, including a vote by the full House. In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee still has to take action and has not yet released its own version of the State Department bill. The committee is chaired by US senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), a supporter of US participation in the Paris agreement. The committee did not respond to a request for comment. A group of 41 Democratic senators on Wednesday called on Collins not to allow any appropriations bill to include ""poison pill"" policy riders, or language restricting the ability of federal agencies to carry out certain environmental policies that is often included in such legislation.

The plans are a key part of HAMR Energy’s strategy to capitalize on incoming international regulations allowing methanol as a feedstock for producing SAF.

Using methanol is a major breakthrough for the aviation industry, according to HAMR Energy, unlocking production scale as demand for low-carbon liquid fuel soars.

Methanol can be produced from a wide range of sustainable sources, offering a versatile, scalable drop-in fuel to decarbonize air travel.

This will be essential for the aviation sector to meet emissions-reduction targets and help close the estimated global SAF supply shortfall of 10 million metric tons by 2030.

HAMR Energy’s proposed SAF production facility will convert 300,000 tons of low-carbon methanol made from forestry residues and hydrogen at its Portland Renewable Fuels project into approximately 125 million liters (over 33 million gallons) of SAF—enough to decarbonize around 3.5 million economy-class passenger trips between Sydney and Melbourne each year.

The proposed SAF production facility is expected to attract hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.

HAMR Energy’s feasibility study identified refining technology, which provides a commercial, scalable pathway to produce SAF from methanol.

It went on to assess key project factors, including renewable power costs, market access and construction economics, identifying South Australia and Victoria as ideal locations for the facility.

The company’s vertically integrated model looks after the whole production process from biomass to fuel.

This model, supported by feedstock arrangements for finite renewable biomass, gives the company the lowest cost of production—an attractive proposition for users such as airlines racing to secure low-carbon liquid fuels.

“With the right policy settings, Australia has the opportunity to build a world-class low-carbon liquid fuels industry, creating regional jobs, strengthening fuel security and leveraging abundant renewable energy and biomass resources” said David Stribley, co-founder of HAMR Energy.

“This methanol-to-jet feasibility study demonstrates our ability to delivery competitive, bankable projects to help hard-to-abate industries like aviation decarbonize while attracting significant investment and improving national fuel security,” he added.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_47953b31c83d4710827d493e5d147b2f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_750,h_500,al_c,q_85/80995f_47953b31c83d4710827d493e5d147b2f~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-29 17:59:20.556451

The European Commission has approved a €36 million Danish initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in domestic aviation by promoting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This marks the first State aid scheme approved by the Commission to encourage SAF use, aligning with EU and national climate goals.

Scheme Details

The scheme, effective until December 31, 2027, aims to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes. It targets at least one domestic air route to use 40% SAF, nearing the current technical limit of 50%. This surpasses the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation's minimum requirement of 2% SAF during the scheme period.

Funding and Implementation

Under the scheme, airlines will receive monthly direct grants to cover the additional costs of using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including airport infrastructure expenses. The aid level will be determined through a competitive bidding process to ensure cost-effectiveness. The scheme supports at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly on one or more domestic routes in Denmark.

Mike Kane MP visits Sheffield

Announced by the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane MP, the University of Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million project to commercialise its new SAF production technology and attract investors to build SAF production plants in order to boost the supply of the cleaner fuel to the aviation industry.

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK), and received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council and Qatar Airways.

SAF is typically produced using bio or waste feedstock. However, there are concerns over whether a sufficient level of feedstock is possible to establish and maintain.

The University of Sheffield’s new production pathway eliminates this reliance as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.

The Sheffield-led project, called NextGen-SAF, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF – a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor.

The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2, and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF.

The plant will demonstrate the operability, reliability and performance of the integrated system so the method can be scaled up.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said: “We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project, we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK.

“This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Announcing £63 million of funding for 17 projects to accelerate SAF production, Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: ""This £63 million is liftoff for Britain's green aviation revolution.

“We're not just backing brilliant British innovation, we're creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

""From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.""

The University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre is home to some of the most advanced clean energy research facilities in Europe.

This offers pilot-scale testing facilities that enable academics and businesses to collaborate to test new clean energy technologies, including sustainable aviation fuel, before scaling up and commercialising.

The University hosts the UK SAF Clearing House – one of only two centres in the world – that supports fuel producers in obtaining the certification needed for use in the aviation industry.

Sheffield was also part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from the University analysed the impact of SAF on the flight’s particulate emissions and contrail formation using the unique SAF research facilities at the Energy Innovation Centre. The results demonstrated up to a 70 percent reduction in emission levels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said: “It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

Companies can’t afford to risk their credibility and reputation by making a loose promise or claiming an environmental benefit that isn’t verifiable. All participants have a lot at stake.

As momentum builds in the voluntary market through insets like SAFc, let’s set the record straight about decarbonizing with sustainable fuels and insets.

Myth: There isn’t a clear roadmap for addressing Scope 3 emissions.

Reality: Insets have created a plan for companies to follow.

Corporations with ambitious emissions reduction goals have been using insets like SAFc as indirect mitigation tools, even though they haven’t had a universal way for those reductions to be recognized. These first movers have set a clear example of how to use insets as a responsible business strategy. Their commitments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Now, with certification measures and tracking systems — all of which create trusted conditions for participants to invest in clean fuels— the market has established guidance to help more companies use insets with confidence.

For example, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) audit and verify that physical products and industrial supply chains meet or exceed environmental standards. In parallel, registries track environmental attributes to create transparency and accurately issue credits to the right customers.

Companies are demanding the highest standards in quality assurance and traceability — and industry leaders are meeting the call with an increasingly clear roadmap. Effective systems and models are operating at full speed to foster trust and confidence in addressing Scope 3 emissions through clean fuels and insets.

Myth: SAFc works by replacing conventional jet fuel with an equal volume of SAF.

Reality: Not all SAF is created equal. What matters is the fuel’s carbon intensity, which is measured by efficiency — not volume.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is bought exclusively for propulsion, fuels like SAF have two distinct purposes: propulsion and decarbonization.

Volume or price per gallon doesn’t accurately measure the efficiency of a clean fuel and its potential for decarbonization. If a company’s goal is to reduce emissions, then the best metrics relate to the carbon intensity of the products available — and not all clean fuels are equal in terms of their impact.

Carbon intensity (CI) is a measure of the total GHG emissions associated with producing and using a fuel, expressed as the amount of carbon dioxide (or equivalent emissions of another gas) produced per unit of energy (e.g., grams CO₂e/MJ). At World Energy, we help organizations rethink the efficiency and impact of their investments in biofuels by focusing on the carbon intensity of fuel, rather than on its volume. For example, the SAF we produce today has an emissions reduction level of up to 85 percent, on a full life-cycle basis.

Let’s compare that, volume-to-volume, to a SAF product that might look the same on the surface but that has life-cycle carbon emissions reductions of just 50 percent. An organization would need to purchase 67 percent more of the less efficient fuel to yield the same carbon reduction.

Myth: It’s the end product that matters — not how the fuel is made or delivered.

Reality: Every step counts in biofuels production.

To reduce emissions through sustainable fuels and insets, most customers are paying for — and should be concerned with — decarbonization services that start long before any fuel is produced. To that end, the behind-the-scenes production process absolutely contributes to the integrity of the fuel and its potential for carbon reduction.

For example, commercial producers of biofuels like SAF need to grapple with upstream environmental effects: How does the production process impact farms and food systems? What are the environmental costs of land and water use? Is the displacement of conventional fuels creating unintended environmental challenges?

To stand behind investments in SAF or other clean fuels, it is therefore critical for customers to understand the full social and environmental impacts of fuel alternatives so they can truly evaluate the impact of the insets they’re purchasing. This is where certification bodies such as RSB and ISCC come in, ensuring that clean products meet specific standards and are audited from end to end — with their entire supply chain and production methods accounted for.

Myth: Fuels like SAF are too scarce and costly to decarbonize aviation.

Reality: SAF is projected to account for 65 percent of aviation’s emissions reductions by 2050. 1

It’s true that SAF is more expensive than conventional jet fuel and is not readily available to address all aviation emissions. But the ecosystem is evolving quickly and dramatically through SAF and SAFc, and customers already have mechanisms to manage emissions from business travel and cargo delivery. As more leading companies invest in sustainable fuels through insets, and as advanced technologies continue to emerge, a virtuous cycle of demand is expanding availability for everyone.

One major accelerator of SAF supply and distribution is the current movement toward long-term offtake agreements. This trend of companies structuring multiyear commitments for decarbonation services through SAF and SAFc doesn’t just benefit individual customers. It also helps expand the entire biofuels market by raising confidence with investors who, in turn, provide more capital to build SAF refineries and develop systems to deliver it into the supply chain efficiently. These multiyear agreements are creating demand certainty and playing a crucial role in expanding the US supply of SAF, lowering customer costs, and reducing the environmental impact of aviation.

Insets offer a market mechanism that can displace conventional fuels used in day-to-day business operations — without having to physically exchange molecules for molecules.

Trump Administration Releases Info on Latest Trade Agreements

European Union Deal: Tariff Elimination and Market Growth

The newly announced trade deal with the European Union includes significant provisions aimed at opening European markets to American goods. Most notably, the agreement will eliminate all EU tariffs on U.S. industrial products. While the focus is broad, agriculture plays a key role in the package.

According to the White House, the agreement will allow U.S. producers—including farmers, ranchers, and fishermen—to grow their export footprint and increase competitiveness in the European marketplace. In addition to tariff reductions, the EU has committed to addressing long-standing non-tariff trade barriers that have hampered U.S. agricultural exports. These include improvements to the sanitary certification process for American dairy and pork products—areas that previously faced regulatory bottlenecks.

This enhanced market access is expected to fuel growth across the U.S. economy by enabling small and large businesses alike to reach millions of European consumers. As tariffs fall and regulations align, American-made and American-grown products will now compete more effectively across the Atlantic.

Japan Deal: $8 Billion in U.S. Agricultural Purchases

The trade agreement with Japan, another key U.S. partner, centers on strategic agricultural exports. Japan has committed to purchasing $8 billion worth of American goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

This deal not only deepens the U.S.-Japan economic relationship but also supports American farmers and producers facing oversupply or seeking stable overseas markets. The inclusion of sustainable aviation fuel and bioethanol also underscores a mutual commitment to clean energy and renewable agricultural products.

Indonesia Agreement: Tariff Barriers Removed on U.S. Food and Agriculture

Meanwhile, the trade deal with Indonesia includes a dramatic reduction of trade restrictions—eliminating approximately 99% of all tariff barriers on U.S. agricultural and food products. This agreement paves the way for a sharp increase in American exports to Southeast Asia, giving U.S. producers access to one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing consumer markets.

By removing nearly all agricultural tariffs, this agreement levels the playing field for U.S. farmers and creates new commercial opportunities in a region with rising demand for high-quality food imports.

More Agreements Expected Soon

With a deadline of August 1st, additional trade deals are anticipated in the coming days. These agreements are part of a broader effort by the administration to reshape global trade, strengthen America’s export economy, and reinforce the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture on the world stage.

As reported by Dale Sandlin with Southeast AgNet, the international trade outlook is shifting rapidly—and U.S. agriculture stands to benefit from expanded access and renewed international demand.",https://southeastagnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/grain-export-Depositphotos_422454432_L-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 12:57:07.570372

Union Pacific merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails.
Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups on rails in the East.
However, just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades.
Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027.","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.

The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific’s rail network in the West with Norfolk’s rails that snake across Eastern states.

The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage that so many businesses rely on.

The railroads said the tie-up would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods across the country by eliminating several days of delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.

Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.

But if the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge so they can compete. The continent’s two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved.

Some big shippers like chemical plants may be wary of the merger because of fears about the monopoly power the combined railroad would wield over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may back the deal if it means their packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh in on the deal before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.

Consumers would benefit if the deal does reduce shipping rates and delivery times as the railroads predict.

There’s speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.

Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.

Union Pacific’s stock rose slightly to $229.35 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern’s stock dipped more than 2% to $279.95.

Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has been championing a merger, said the deal could make it possible for lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh to all reach their destinations more seamlessly.

“Railroads have been an integral part of building America since the Industrial Revolution, and this transaction is the next step in advancing the industry,” Vena said.

A combined Union Pacific and Norfolk would have an advantage because they won’t have to hand off shipments in the middle of the country anymore, enabling them to make deliveries more quickly and likely at a lower rate.

U.S. railroads have already gone through extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads that handle the majority of shipments nationwide.

Rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and he may be interested in completing one last major deal before he gives up his role as chief exeucutive at the end of the year.

Last week Buffett threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but given that he rarely uses investment bankers that doesn’t mean that he and his successor, Greg Abel, aren’t considering their options. After all, Buffett reached the agreement to buy the rest of BNSF for $26.3 billion in a private meeting with the CEO in 2009.

Yet there’s widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial industry.

That’s largely because of the aftermath of an industry consolidation nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. Union Pacific merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups on rails in the East.

However, just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.

There were some unique factors in that deal that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America.

Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027.

On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That’s up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.

Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Transcontinental_Railroad_Merger_25210415968361-1568x1045.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 12:57:36.895998

Introduction: Why Insetting Matters Now

The global push for climate resilience is redefining corporate responsibility. While carbon offsetting has long been an organizational staple, a more holistic and impactful approach is gaining significant traction for companies aiming to neutralize emissions. The term insetting is making the rounds in executive discussions and rising through the ranks of sustainable business strategies. Offsetting as an approach has become polarizing in markets and among sustainability professionals. Insetting is a more integrated, value-chain-driven approach to achieving real, measurable, and supply-chain-aligned impact.

But what exactly is Carbon Insetting, and how does it differ from offsetting?

ESG News breaks down key descriptions to ramp up your insetting knowledge—what it is, how it works, who’s doing it, and why it’s a critical tool in tackling Scope 3 emissions in alignment with science-based climate goals.

What Is Insetting?

When it comes to decarbonization, insetting refers to the practice of investing in emission reduction or carbon removal projects within a company’s own value chain. Unlike the arguably dated approach of carbon offsetting, which funds external projects (such as forest preservation or renewable energy in unrelated regions), insetting focuses on interventions that directly benefit the company’s supply chain, operations, or upstream/downstream stakeholders.

Insetting projects are typically designed to:

Reduce Scope 3 emissions (the indirect emissions across a company’s value chain)

Build resilience and sustainability into supply chains

Generate shared value for suppliers, farmers, and local communities

Carbon Insetting vs. Carbon Offsetting: What’s the Difference?

Carbon Insetting is increasingly seen as a direct, strategic sustainability investment, while offsetting is often regarded as a short-term mitigation tactic that doesn’t directly address the environmental, social, and financial impact of a company’s operations.

Why Insetting Is Gaining Traction

Carbon Insetting has emerged as a credible solution for addressing Scope 3 emissions, which often account for 70% or more of a company’s total carbon footprint. These emissions are notoriously difficult to measure and manage because they originate from suppliers, distributors, and consumers.

Key drivers of insetting adoption include:

Pressure from investors and regulators for credible emissions reductions

Scope 3 accounting standards set by frameworks like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)

Corporate net-zero commitments and ESG disclosures

The desire to achieve co-benefits such as improved soil health, biodiversity, water use, and farmer livelihoods

How Insetting Works: Real-World Examples

General Mills (GIS) – Supports regenerative agriculture in U.S. wheat and dairy supply chains, reducing emissions and improving soil carbon and farmer income.

LVMH (MC.PA) – Its “LIFE 360” program includes insetting efforts across natural material supply chains (leather, cotton, grapes, flowers).

Unilever (UL) – Works with suppliers to adopt renewable energy in manufacturing, cutting Scope 3 emissions.

Mars, Incorporated – Funds climate-smart cocoa and rice farming projects in West Africa and Southeast Asia to help suppliers reduce emissions.

Nutrien (NTR) & Athian – Piloting bovine feed additives to reduce dairy methane emissions, quantified for internal Scope 3 accounting.

Nissan (NSANY) – Partners with steel/aluminum suppliers to reduce emissions through recycled content and low-carbon production.

Nestlé (NSRGY) – Invests in agroforestry and farmer training for coffee and cocoa supply chains to reduce emissions and boost resilience.

What Can Be Counted as an Insetting Project?

To be legitimate, an insetting project should:

Be tied to the company’s core supply chain

Deliver quantifiable GHG reductions or removals

Be additional (i.e., not business-as-usual)

Be verifiable and traceable

Align with broader sustainability goals (e.g., biodiversity, livelihoods)

Examples include:

Regenerative or climate-smart agriculture

Livestock methane reduction (e.g., feed additives)

Reforestation within supply chain zones

Clean energy for suppliers

Water efficiency technologies for manufacturers

Challenges and Evolving Standards

Carbon Insetting is still maturing. Challenges include:

Accounting complexity – Risk of double-counting emissions reductions

Verification standards – Lack of a unified global framework; IPI and GHG Protocol are developing guidance

Costs and scalability – Especially for smallholder farmers

Legal attribution – Companies must prove ownership of Scope 3 reductions as they become financially material

Insetting and the Future of Scope 3 Reporting

Scope 3 emissions—those occurring across a company’s value chain—represent the largest share of corporate emissions and the most difficult to manage. They encompass raw material extraction, transportation, consumer use, and product end-of-life.

Frameworks such as TCFD, ISSB, ESRS, and the U.S. SEC climate rule are increasingly holding companies accountable for these emissions.

Insetting is emerging as a key strategy.

How Insetting Aligns with the Future of Scope 3 Reporting

Strengthening Supplier Relationships and Transparency

Insetting fosters collaboration with upstream suppliers, driving transparency, emissions data collection, and climate resilience.

Improving Operational Efficiency and Risk Resilience

Tactics like soil health improvement or renewable energy use reduce costs, boost efficiency, and improve supply chain resilience to inflation and climate shocks.

Demonstrating Environmental and Social Impact with Credibility

Unlike offsets, insetting provides localized, measurable impact aligned with ESG goals. Projects often yield biodiversity, water stewardship, and social co-benefits.

Meeting Regulatory Requirements and Audit Preparedness

With robust MRV systems, insetting offers auditable, traceable proof of emissions reductions—critical for avoiding greenwashing claims.

Unlocking Capital Through ESG Performance

Insetting helps companies qualify for green finance products, attract ESG-focused investors, and improve credit ratings through credible decarbonization plans.

A Compliance-Aligned Strategy for the Next Decade and Beyond

What was once optional is becoming required. As ESG regulation tightens, insetting is fast becoming a core tool for Scope 3 compliance and long-term value creation.

Bottom line: Insetting bridges the gap between ambition and action—offering measurable, aligned, and credible decarbonization.

Conclusion: A Strategic Shift Toward Integrated Climate Action

Insetting as a tool helps evolve the complex accountability of carbon reduction to become a strategic lever for resilience, value creation, and credible ESG performance. By investing in their own operations, companies can truly future-proof their supply chains, support frontline communities, and meet the mounting demands for transparent, science-aligned climate action.

As sustainability reporting matures, expect to see insetting approaches shift from a niche strategy to a mainstream pillar of corporate decarbonization—and ESG News will be here to report on global progress.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Is-Carbon-Insetting-What-You-Need-to-Know-about-the-Strategy.jpeg,N,,2025-07-29 09:56:11.715968

A basic manure heap or composting system that converts natural waste materials into organic fertilizer is an age-old example of agri‑waste valorization and a localized circular economy in action.

Farms and food processors are taking advantage of new technologies to systematically repurpose agricultural byproducts and waste, either reintegrating them into field level operations or deriving wider commercial value from them. Major companies and startups are channeling technical innovation into processes that convert crop residues, processing waste and manure into biofertilizers, bioplastics, and bioenergy as part of an emerging sustainable farming ecosystem.

A Breakdown of Food Loss and Waste across the World

How an AgTech - Enabled Circular Economy can Function

The simplest way to create a circular economy built around agri‑waste valorization is to establish an on-farm nutrient recycling framework. Manure and crop residues are processed naturally on site and reintegrated into operations as compost and biofertilizers etc. These basic (and low cost) frameworks can be enhanced by data-driven cover cropping and crop rotation and intercropping strategies, as well as the application of biochar to create a sustainable and low impact circular economy farming operation that substantially reduces dependence on chemical inputs.

Local biorefineries can process agricultural waste to generate clean bioenergy, biochemicals, and biofertilizers. Innovative anaerobic digestion processes, fermentation, controlled composting methods and even insect bioconversion can also convert waste into valuable resources. Byproducts from the refining process such as digestate or nutrient rich ash can be returned to local farms. An emerging trend is the creation of economic incentives and regulatory support for circular‑agriculture models.

One of the more unusual techniques for agri‑waste valorization is the use of insects. Dutch company Protix uses the black soldier fly to transform food waste into high quality nutrients for aquaculture and livestock and pet food, while converting process byproducts into fertilizers. Approximately one third of all food is wasted, mainly at the retail and consumer end of the supply chain. This food requires disposal, often via landfill sites and inevitably creates a carbon footprint, as well as additional impacts. Protix’s goal is to use science-based innovation to create a profitable low-footprint food chain that generates nutritionally dense proteins. There is still a way to go in creating consumer interest in insect-derived foods for humans, but the aquaculture and animal feed market offers strong potential for growth.

Another good example is ICL Group, a leading global specialty minerals company and one of the largest fertilizer manufacturers in the world. The company has a longstanding commitment to sustainability and the creation of circular economies. One area where ICL is consistently innovative is in brine and phosphate recycling, particularly within the context of fertilizer solutions. The raw materials for ICl’s Puraloop® fertilizer are obtained by recycling phosphorus from organic waste streams as a sustainable alternative to utilizing mined phosphorus rock. The key advantages of Puraloop® are its versatility, ease of application on open fields, orchards and plantations, and minimal environmental impacts. Puraloop® is a flagship circular economy solution that turns waste matter into a valuable crop nutritional solution.

Versalis is an Italian company that is investing in the creation of large scale circular economies. Versalis uses groundbreaking technologies to create high quality industrial-grade monomers, polymers, and elastomers from waste materials. They also produce bionaphtha from used vegetable oils - detritus from the very end of the food supply chain. It can be used to produce polymers or sustainable aviation fuel and diesel alternatives. Versalis also offers a broad spectrum herbicide solution called Sunpower that is produced from renewable materials. It is designed for the control of annual and perennial weeds in urban and industrial locations.

BlueFire Renewables (previously BlueFire Ethanol) is a pioneering biofuel company that converts waste material into ethanol. The company utilizes a complex chemical process to break down waste and extract natural sugars. The sugars in turn undergo a yeast fermentation which produces ethanol. Once produced, the ethanol can be used in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, citric acid and edible xanthan gum for food ingredients. Ethanol is also used as a fuel, and is emerging as a cleaner alternative to petrochemical fuels. BlueFire Renewable’s Concentrated Acid Hydrolysis Technology Process is proving scalable and the company has been awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Energy to construct a new commercial scale cellulosic ethanol production facility.

Conclusion: Anticipating a Transition to Circular Economy

Pioneering companies like ICL Group, Versalis and Protix are demonstrating that the integration of circular economies that repurpose waste and byproducts within, or for, the agricultural sector are commercially viable. The creation of on-farm recycling frameworks is a straightforward venture and the core principles are scalable. Localized biorefineries and large scale commercial enterprises can all contribute to the development of resilient and sustainable agricultural systems. The key message is that repurposing waste is potentially profitable, and also delivers powerful ESG and reputational advantages for businesses.",https://www.finextra.com/finextra-images/member_photos/thumb_161503_jacobo_weizenblut_11.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 10:56:16.957941

The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes.
Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure.

It is the first State aid scheme approved by the Commission that promotes the use of sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] and represents a significant step in aviation decarbonisation.

The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes. It will be in place until 31 December 2027.

The goal is to support at least one domestic air route using 40% SAF, which is very close to the current technical limit of 50%. This exceeds the minimum set by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which requires fuel suppliers to achieve a minimum share of 2% during the scheme period.

Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure. The aid level will be determined through a competitive bidding process, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

The measure will support at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly, on one or more domestic routes in Denmark.

The scheme includes rules to prevent overcompensation, namely by ensuring that supported SAF is excluded from parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive, and by prohibiting the use of SAF that has already received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or third countries.

Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, said “This Danish scheme paves the way for more sustainable aviation by fostering the use of sustainable aviation fuel beyond current EU mandates.”

Saudi Arabia alone plans to elevate the logistics market to a staggering $15.31 billion by 2030, developing 59 logistics zones.
Emerging markets have a unique opportunity Emerging markets, in particular, bear a disproportionate burden in the green transition.
“Emerging markets, including China, have strong momentum in green logistics innovations.","The logistics sector accounts for up to 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Emerging markets can leapfrog directly to state-of-the-art green innovations.

At the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, experts deliberated on how emerging economies can fast-track green logistics development.

Logistics is the backbone of the global economy, but the sector is also a major contributor to climate change, accounting for up to 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions, if warehouses and ports are included alongside freight transportation.

With accelerating digitalization, shifting trade patterns and rising climate urgency, the global logistics sector stands at a critical inflection point. Global freight demand is expected to double between 2019 and 2050. Emerging markets such as China and the Middle East are central to the surge, driven by rapid urbanization, growing trade and infrastructure investment and technological innovation.

China has become the largest e-commerce market globally, generating almost 50% of the world's transactions, with efficient logistics systems underpinning this expansion.

Meanwhile, the Middle East and Africa freight and logistics market is projected at $173.27 billion in 2025, expanding at a 6.36% compound annual growth growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 on the back of major port expansions and cross-border corridors. Saudi Arabia alone plans to elevate the logistics market to a staggering $15.31 billion by 2030, developing 59 logistics zones.

The industry in emerging economies is experiencing unprecedented green transformation, driven by maturity in technologies and increasing climate regulations. For example, battery electric and hydrogen fuel trucks are already surpassing 500km range, and as they mature, the cost ownership will further decrease. China has launched five clusters dedicated to fuel cell vehicle demonstrations, consisting of more than 40 cities; and 36 countries have committed to 100% zero-emission truck sales by 2040.

Emerging markets have a unique opportunity

Emerging markets, in particular, bear a disproportionate burden in the green transition. Their infrastructure often lags behind, and outdated vehicle fleets contribute to higher emissions.

These disparities underscore the urgency of accelerating green logistics to ensure no region is left behind in the global sustainability agenda. Equally importantly, cases have been proven that the transition itself brings the regions robust economic growth and competitive edges.

Moreover, emerging markets can leapfrog directly to state-of-the-art green infrastructure by deploying clean technologies from the outset, instead of much retrofitting of the legacy systems or having high risk locking in carbon-intensive operations for decades.

In the recently wrapped Annual Meeting of the New Champions (AMNC) in Tianjin, China, the Net-zero Opportunities for Value-chain Action (NOVA) initiative convened industry leaders to have deliberated the championing role of the emerging economies in fast-tracking the green logistics development through innovative approaches and modalities.

AMNC participants deliberated through multiple sessions on the championing role of the emerging economies in fast-tracking the green logistics development through innovative approaches and modalities.

“Emerging markets, including China, have strong momentum in green logistics innovations. We are seeing growth in areas such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), green fuel for ships, and heavy truck battery change. International cooperation is key to navigating an effective global transition in the sector,” said Liu Peng, Director-General,Global Sustainable Transport Innovation and Knowledge Center, Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China.

In China, battery electric heavy trucks made up 20.9% of new sales in December 2024 – more than double January’s share – signalling rapid fleet electrification. In parallel, investors poured $757 billion into electrified transport worldwide in 2024 – part of a record $2.1 trillion in energy-transition capital – marking a clear market tipping point for green logistics.

Technology and ‘soft’ innovations that power the logistics transition

To unlock green transition and market opportunities, disruptive innovation across the logistics ecosystem is essential. As sustainability imperatives and market dynamics evolve, companies must pursue multidimensional advances in both technology and business models to decarbonize operations, enhance efficiency and unlock new value creation opportunities.

Key innovation areas include:

Fuel switch solutions: Adoption of low- and zero-carbon fuels such as green hydrogen, methanol and biofuels like sustainable aviation fuel.

Vehicles and propulsion technology: Deploying electric/hydrogen trucks, sustainable aviation fuel-ready aircraft, low-emission ships and locomotives.

Green logistic infrastructure: Building green fuelling networks, smart transport hubs and sustainable warehouses.

Digital operation and optimization: Use of artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and digital platforms to improve routing, tracking and system efficiency.

Modal shifts: Moving freight to rail, inland waterways and coastal shipping to cut carbon intensity and boost efficiency.

Operating models innovations: Scaling circular logistics, last-mile innovations and workforce upskilling for sustainable performance.

Together, these innovations form the foundation of a greener, more resilient logistics system – one that meets rising demand while enhancing company competitiveness.

“A decarbonized future for the logistics sector will be driven by technology, scale and action. From advancing electric vehicle capabilities to transforming last-mile delivery, we see disruptive innovations becoming the reality across the entire logistics value chain,” said Aditi Rasquinha, Chief Executive Officer, Greater China, DHL Global Forwarding.

Pressing priorities in unleashing the potential of the innovations

However, implementation and scaling of innovative technologies continues to face several significant barriers, such as cost pressures, policy uncertainty and misalignment of resource allocation.

Green fuels, for instance, remain significantly more expensive than conventional alternatives. Sustainable aviation fuel carries roughly a 3.1x price premium over conventional jet fuel, Jet-A, while the total cost of ownership for hydrogen fuel-cell Class 8 trucks is 3-4x that of equivalent diesel rigs, making carriers hesitant to absorb such premiums.

On the policy front, volatility in international regulations poses risks to business stability and supply chain security. Insufficient alignment between upstream supply and downstream demand hampers the scaling of green technologies, underscoring the need for more integrated planning and investment.

“In Guizhou Tyre, we see huge opportunities to work with the value chain partners to jointly decarbonize the sector. But to truly scale these solutions, we need stronger partnerships. De-risking instruments and strong policy signals are still essential to build long-term market confidence,” said Wang Kun, General Manager, Guizhou Tyre.

An ecosystem for sustainable growth

Leading players across both public and private sectors are piloting new collaboration models, scaling blended finance mechanisms and embedding sustainability metrics into decision-making. These frontrunners offer a blueprint for others to follow, demonstrating that when incentives are aligned and ecosystems mobilized, green logistics can move from aspiration to acceleration.

Governments are increasingly adopting integrated policy frameworks that combine regulatory clarity, fiscal incentives and infrastructure planning to drive systemic transformation.

Ethanol, colorless, volatile alcoholic liquid, is a central figure in the modern world of energy and industries. Primarily used as a fuel additive and biofuel, ethanol finds application in the pharmaceutical, beverage, and cosmetic sectors also. Its environmentally friendly badge of reducing greenhouse gas emission has made ethanol a popular choice to substitute fossil fuels.

Understanding the ethanol supply chain is crucial in a continuously expanding global economy that is focusing on sustainability, energy independence, and circularity. From farm-level production to international trade, the ethanol supply chain is highly interlinked with geopolitics, environmental laws, and innovation and hence it is critical and timely to understand in today's world.

This blog addresses the key drivers of ethanol's global supply chain.

Raw Material Sourcing

Primary Raw Materials:

• Corn: Main feedstock in the U.S.

• Sugarcane: Dominant in Brazil.

• Crops: Wheat, sorghum, barley (used in EU, India, and China).

• Lignocellulosic biomass: Agricultural residues (e.g., corn stover, bagasse) and woody materials for second-generation ethanol.

Top Producing Countries:

• United States (corn ethanol)

• Brazil (sugarcane ethanol)

• India, China, Thailand are growing rapidly due to biofuel mandates.

Sourcing Challenges and Sustainability Trends

Ethanol manufacturing is susceptible to several sourcing issues. Crop yields are susceptible to weather and seasonality, such as droughts and floods. Export restrictions, subsidies, and trade tensions represent geopolitical concerns that can upset supply chains. Deforestation (such as that in Brazil), food vs. fuel competition, and water-intensive crop growing are environmental issues.

To meet these challenges, the industry is moving towards non-food feedstocks and non-sustainable agriculture practices. Certification initiatives such as Bonsucro and RSB are also being utilized to support environmentally and socially responsible sourcing.

Processing and Intermediate Logistics

After raw material collection, ethanol production involves fermentation and distillation. Carbohydrate-rich feedstocks are broken down into sugars, fermented by microorganisms (typically yeast), and distilled to separate ethanol from water. Advanced processes like enzymatic hydrolysis are used for cellulosic ethanol. Post-processing includes dehydration to achieve fuel-grade ethanol (typically 99.5% purity).

Transport methods: Ethanol is transported from production plants to storage or blending facilities via pipelines (in regions with developed infrastructure like the U.S.), rail tankers, trucks, or drums. Due to its hygroscopic nature, ethanol must be transported separately from gasoline until the final blending stage. Key industrial hubs include the U.S. Midwest, Brazil’s southeastern states, and parts of Europe and China with bio-refining clusters.

Key Industrial Zones:

• U.S. Midwest (Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska)

• Brazil’s Southeast (São Paulo, Minas Gerais)

• EU zones: France, Germany

• China: Jilin and Henan provinces

Storage, Handling, and Safety

Ethanol requires storage in tightly closed containers, usually stainless steel or lined carbon steel tanks, so as not to absorb moisture and contamination. It is extremely flammable, necessitating fire-resistant materials and explosion-proof equipment in storage and handling areas. Temperature control is not particularly rigid, but proper ventilation and grounding are essential to prevent vapor buildup and static discharge.

Handling procedures adhere to rigorous safety protocols by international organizations like OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). SDS is required to be kept, and PPE and proper training are necessitated for all handlers. Emergency response systems consist of spill containment units, fire extinguishing units, and vapor monitoring systems. Adherence to such safety standards allows ethanol to be safely managed from production to final end-use applications.

Global Trade and Distribution

Ethanol is a widely traded commodity, particularly between regions with high production capacity and those with fuel blending mandates but limited domestic output. The United States and Brazil are the top exporters, while countries like Canada, the European Union, Japan, and India are significant importers.

Global trade is shaped by global oil prices, blending mandates, and climate policies, with frameworks like the EU’s RED II and California’s LCFS influencing trade flows. The U.S. exports primarily corn-based ethanol, while Brazil's is sugarcane-based, often preferred for its lower carbon footprint. Freight logistics involve marine tankers, rail shipments, and containerized transport, each requiring specialized equipment and safety measures.

Ethanol trade has become a strategic component of global decarbonization efforts, shaped by both economic and environmental considerations. Tariffs, customs regulations, and sustainability certifications—such as ISCC—add layers of complexity to cross-border transactions. Increasingly, carbon intensity scores and environmental reporting requirements are influencing trade patterns and buyer preferences. However, the sector faces significant barriers, including import duties (e.g., in India), volatile logistics costs driven by fuel prices and geopolitical tensions, and disruptions caused by container shortages.

Global Production Landscape

Ethanol is produced in various regions, each contributing based on their resource availability and industrial infrastructure.

Top 5 Importers and Exporters of Ethanol

Production Process Used

United States: Corn-based ethanol, dry milling, natural gas-powered, mainly Midwest, world’s top producer.

Brazil: Sugarcane ethanol, bagasse energy, São Paulo-centered, efficient and major exporter.

China: Starch ethanol, coal-powered, carbon-intensive, key in northern provinces.

India: Molasses and grains, natural gas energy, expanding fast, blending goal 20% by 2025.

Production Capacity

As of 2024, the following reflects the market share distribution of major ethanol-producing countries based on their production capacity.

Top Exporting Countries and Their Key Import Partners (2024)

The Evolving Landscape: Ethanol and Supply Chain Transformation

The switch to cleaner fuels is transforming the position of ethanol in the world energy mix at a rapid pace. Ethanol, which has been conventionally employed as a chemical feedstock and biofuel, is increasingly emerging as a cleaner fuel for transportation and industry. With increasing focus on sustainability, improved production technologies, policy backing, and the changing trade routes are restating its supply chain dynamics.

These include the U.S., Brazil, and India, which are not just increasing traditional ethanol production from crops such as corn and sugarcane, but also in second-generation and cellulosic ethanol from farm waste and non-food biomass.

While higher-end ethanol is still pricier, policy support, carbon requirements, and investor support are driving it faster into use—especially in air travel, heavy transport, and blended fuels to decarbonize road transport.

What to Expect Moving Forward

• Shifts in Sourcing and Trade Flow: Regional crop availability and decarbonization policy are driving ethanol trade realignment. As net-zero initiatives move forward, nations might favor domestic production, while exporters might target new markets with supporting mandates.

• Second-Generation Ethanol Projects: Future plants in India, Europe, and North America based on agri-residues and municipal waste mark a departure from biofuels derived from food. They intend to upscale cleaner ethanol with reduced land and water footprints.

• Policy and Regulation: Ethanol's destiny is inextricably linked with government policies—such as the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), India's 20% blending goal, and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. Carbon credits, emissions limits, and renewable blending requirements will have a major influence on production economics and trading volumes.

Conclusion

FAQs

Q1: What are the primary challenges in shipping Ethanol?

Shipping ethanol comes with flammability and compatibility concerns—it is usually denatured to prevent tax and safety issues. Railway, road tanker, and sea shipments entail compliance with rigorous safety standards.

Q2: Is Ethanol an environmentally friendly fuel?

Yes—particularly when produced from waste biomass (second-generation ethanol). It produces far fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels and is frequently utilized in low-emission fuel blends.

Q3: What effect does Ethanol have on world fuel prices?

Ethanol influences local fuel prices by reducing dependence on gasoline, particularly where blending requirements are in place. Volatility in crop yields or policy changes can affect supply and influence global biofuel economics.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-29 09:57:44.084910

This outperformance, driven by food, non-food, and automotive fuel sectors, signals a broader European consumer market renaissance. For investors, the question is no longer whether the rebound is happening, but which underappreciated stocks and sectors are best positioned to capitalize on this momentum.

The Drivers of Growth: Food, Non-Food, and Automotive Fuel

Eurostat's Q2 2025 figures highlight Spain's retail strength:

- Food, drinks, and tobacco rose 0.8% quarterly and 4.2% annually.

- Non-food items (excluding fuel) grew 0.2% quarterly and 3.8% annually.

- Automotive fuel surged 1.3% quarterly and 4.8% annually.

These trends reflect resilient consumer spending, bolstered by Spain's 2.8% GDP growth and a decade-low unemployment rate of 12.3%. The surge in automotive fuel sales, in particular, underscores a revival in mobility and tourism—a sector that contributed to 7.1% quarterly growth in Spain's primary sector.

Undervalued Sectors and Stocks: A Strategic Playbook

The Spanish equity market, trading at a P/E ratio of 12.22 (vs. 26.51 for the S&P 500), offers compelling value. Here are the most promising sectors and stocks to consider:

1. Renewable Energy and Automotive Fuel: Neste Oyj (HEL:NASTE)

Finland's Neste is a leader in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, with a 19.6% discount to fair value. Its partnership with Chevron Lummus Global positions it to benefit from EU green energy mandates and Spain's surging fuel demand.

2. Telecom Infrastructure: Cellnex Telecom, S.A. (BME:CLNX)

Spain's Cellnex, trading at €34.09 (vs. a fair value of €62.57), is expanding 5G networks and energy transition infrastructure. With a 53.25% projected earnings growth over three years, it's a linchpin in Spain's digital and energy transformation.

3. Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare: Laboratorios Farmaceuticos Rovi (BME:ROVI)

This Spanish firm, down 49.4% from fair value, is gaining traction in the EU's pharmaceutical market. Its 16.5% annual earnings growth and focus on generic drugs align with Spain's aging population and rising healthcare demand.

4. Logistics and Retail Real Estate: PostNL N.V. (ENXTAM:PNL)

PostNL, trading at €1.06 (38.9% below fair value), is modernizing EU logistics networks. With 32.9% annual earnings growth projected, it's well-positioned to support Spain's 850 new supermarket openings in 2025.

5. Non-Performing Loan Management: doValue S.p.A. (BIT:DOV)

This Italian-Spanish firm, down 49.7% from fair value, is profiting from a 9.9% annual revenue growth in managing bad debt. As consumer spending rebounds, its role in financial recovery becomes critical.

The Retail Investment Boom: A Structural Tailwind

Spain's retail investment hit €8.4 billion in Q1 2025, a 54% YoY jump. This surge, fueled by prime asset demand and low retail stock density, is attracting global capital. For example, two shopping center deals in Q1 accounted for half of Spain's retail investment, reflecting confidence in tourism-driven retail.

The EU's broader shift to modern trade (e.g., discounters and online channels) is another catalyst. Online grocery sales in Europe grew 2.0 percentage points above the average in 2025, with Spain's supermarket expansion outpacing the EU. Retailers leveraging AI for personalized shopping (e.g., chatbots) are gaining market share, as seen in major European grocers' digital transformations.

Risks and Considerations

While the outlook is optimistic, investors should monitor:

- Inflationary pressures: Spain's 2.2% annual inflation could temper spending, though core inflation remains stable.

- Debt levels: Neste and PostNL have high leverage, requiring careful cash flow management.

- Regulatory risks: EU green energy mandates and data privacy laws may impact sector valuations.

Conclusion: A Strategic Entry Point

Spain's retail surge is not an isolated phenomenon but a harbinger of the EU's consumer market rebound. Undervalued stocks like Neste, Cellnex, and Rovi offer exposure to sectors directly aligned with this growth. For investors with a 12-18 month horizon, these opportunities present a compelling case—leveraging Spain's economic resilience and the EU's structural shifts to unlock long-term value.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-29 09:58:01.544059

Phillips 66 on July 25 released second quarter financial results, reporting the company’s Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California continues to run at reduced rates due to market conditions. Pre-tax income for the renewables segment was up when compared to the first quarter due to higher realized margins, including inventory impacts as well as increased credits, according to the company.

Phillips 66’s renewable fuels business segment processes renewable feedstocks into renewable fuels at its Rodeo facility in California and the Humber refinery in the U.K. The segment also includes global activities to procure renewable feedstocks, manage certain regulatory credits and market renewable fuels.

Development on the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex began in mid-2022 and the facility reached full processing rates during the second quarter of 2024. The biorefinery began producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in September 2024. According to Phillips 66, the facility has the capacity to produce approximately 50,000 barrels per day (800 MMgy) of renewable fuels.

Renewable fuel production during the second quarter averaged 40,000 barrels per day, down from 44,000 barrels per day during the first quarter of 2025, but up when compared to the 31,000 barrels per day produced during the second quarter of last year.

Sales of renewable fuels averaged 71,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, up from 45,000 barrels per day during the same period of 2024.

The renewable fuels segment reported a $133 million earnings loss for the second quarter, compared to a $185 million loss reported for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $110 million, compared to negative $163 million.

During an earnings call, Phillips 66 Executive Vice President of Marketing and Commercial Brian Mandell confirmed that renewable margins were slightly weaker during the second quarter than they were during the first three months of the year. “We are running at reduced rates,” he said. “In the second quarter, we ran at reduced rates, and we continue to run at reduced rates.” Operations during the third quarter will depend on various market conditions, he indicated.

Mandell pointed to several regulatory headwinds the Rodeo facility is facing. This includes changes in the 45Z clean fuel production credit that limit credit eligibility to fuels made from feedstocks produced in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and eliminate the premium value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). He also noted that the U.S. EPA’s proposal to reduce renewable identification number (RIN) generation for fuels made from imported feedstocks “will present a challenge.”

“We’re doing a lot of things in self-help, including talking to state and federal regulators to promote profitability for the plant,” Mandell added. “Additionally, we’re working very hard on lowering the cost of operating the plant…and we’re thinking about how to adjust operations to increase SAF production and also to provide additional optionality for feedstocks.”

Mandell also highlighted some market tailwinds, including potentially stronger Low Carbon Fuel Standard and RIN credits as a result of tighter regulations. In addition, he noted European markets are driving greater incentives, with the company exporting to Europe almost every month this year. “There are stronger biofuels programs in Oregon and Washington and stronger Canadian markets as well,” Mandell added.

According to Mandell, the Rodeo complex is one of the world’s largest renewable diesel and SAF facilities. “We can…generate up to 15% of the country’s D4 and D5 RIns,” he said. “So ensuring profitability for the plant will be important for energy supply for affordable energy across the country, given the RIN generation and for energy dominance in the United States.”

Phillips 66 President and CEO Mark Lashier said that the losses for the renewable fuels segment are “unacceptable and unsustainable,” noting that the Rodeo facility is strategic asset not just for Phillips 66, but for the country due to the volume of renewable diesel it produces and the capability to produce SAF. “We are fully engaged at the federal level and fully engaged at the state level in California to make sure all the right choices are made to support this strategic asset,” Lashier added.

Overall, Phillips 66 reported second quarter earnings of $877 million, up from $487 million during the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 billion, up from $736 million during the first quarter, and earnings per share was at $2.15, compared to $1.18.

By 2024, the airline had slashed its net debt ratio to 1.7x, secured $3.53 billion in liquidity, and refinanced nearly all non-fleet debt, reducing interest expenses by over 50%. This financial discipline was complemented by operational rigor: the airline achieved an 85%+ on-time performance rate, streamlined processes via Lean methodologies, and invested in digital tools like touchless check-in and real-time analytics. These measures not only improved efficiency but also reduced unit costs, enabling LATAM to maintain profitability even as fuel prices and labor costs fluctuated.

A critical component of LATAM's strategy has been its focus on premium traffic. By enhancing its first and business class offerings, the airline has captured higher yields without proportionally increasing costs. For example, its upgraded cabins now feature modern interiors, improved catering, and priority services, aligning with global trends toward premiumization in air travel. Analysts project that this focus on premium segments will drive revenue per available seat mile (RASM) growth of 12–15% in 2025, outpacing competitors focused on commoditized domestic routes.

Navigating Regional Demand and Global Shifts

Latin America's aviation market is uniquely positioned to benefit from shifting global demand patterns. While North America and Europe face saturation and regulatory headwinds, Latin America's air travel growth has averaged 6–8% annually over the past five years, fueled by rising middle-class incomes, urbanization, and tourism. LATAM's extensive network—spanning 151 destinations across 27 countries—positions it to capitalize on this growth. For instance, its June 2025 expansion included new routes like Bariloche (Argentina) to Guarulhos (Brazil), catering to leisure travelers and connecting regional hubs.

Moreover, LATAM's cargo operations are gaining traction. In June 2025, the airline increased cargo capacity by 5.2% year-over-year, leveraging its fleet's flexibility to meet surging demand for perishables and e-commerce shipments. This diversification into freight—a sector with higher margins than passenger operations—provides a buffer against cyclical downturns in leisure travel.

Risks and Opportunities in a Competitive Landscape

Despite its strengths, LATAM faces challenges. The proposed merger between Gol and Azul airlines in Brazil could intensify price competition in the region's largest market. Additionally, foreign exchange volatility—particularly the depreciation of the Brazilian real and Colombian peso—poses a risk to USD-denominated revenues. However, LATAM's hedging strategies and cost structure, which are 60% in local currencies, mitigate these risks.

The airline's long-term outlook hinges on its ability to maintain operational flexibility. For example, its 2025 capital expenditures are focused on fleet modernization and airport slot acquisitions, ensuring it can scale capacity in high-growth corridors. Meanwhile, its sustainability initiatives—such as a 97% reduction in single-use plastics and a target of 5% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030—align with global ESG trends and could attract environmentally conscious investors.

Investment Implications: A Buy for the Long Haul

LATAM's financials and strategic positioning make it a compelling investment. With a current market cap of $11.58 billion and a forward P/E ratio of 9.2x, the stock appears undervalued relative to its projected earnings growth of 43% in 2025 (from $3.72 to $5.32 EPS). Analysts have upgraded the stock to “Outperform,” citing its strong cash flow generation, low leverage, and leadership in a high-growth region.

For long-term investors, LATAM offers exposure to Latin America's economic renaissance. While short-term risks like regulatory changes or currency swings exist, the airline's focus on premium traffic, cargo expansion, and operational efficiency creates a durable competitive moat. As global demand shifts toward emerging markets, LATAM's strategic recovery positions it as a leader in a sector that could outperform broader equity indices over the next decade.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-29 02:56:29.923821

Sam Singh, R- East Lansing, and Joe Bellino, R- Monroe, to support the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in our state.
These measures, otherwise known as House Bills 4424-25 and Senate Bills 235-36, offer a practical, forward-looking approach to strengthening rural Michigan while helping our state lead in clean energy innovation.
The SAF proposal could not have come at a better time for Michigan farmers.
Much like ethanol did in years past, tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel are a powerful way to drive investment into rural communities — unlocking broad economic gains.","In Michigan, we know how to get things done — especially when we work together. That’s why I’m proud to be part of a bipartisan, bicameral coalition advancing a new path forward for our farmers, economy and environment.

Recently, I introduced legislation with state Sens. Sam Singh, R- East Lansing, and Joe Bellino, R- Monroe, to support the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in our state. These measures, otherwise known as House Bills 4424-25 and Senate Bills 235-36, offer a practical, forward-looking approach to strengthening rural Michigan while helping our state lead in clean energy innovation.

As chair of the House Agriculture Committee, a longtime dairy farmer and lifelong supporter of Michigan’s farm families, I believe this effort represents a smart, balanced approach to the future. We’re not choosing between clean energy and rural prosperity; we’re showing how the two can work together. And, we’re not forcing change from the top down, we’re building it from the ground up, with Michigan-grown solutions.

The SAF proposal could not have come at a better time for Michigan farmers. Shrinking margins, rising costs and uncertainty about the future are taking a huge toll on rural families, and this legislation could offer needed relief for all of Michigan’s farming communities.

The simple truth is that things are changing, whether we like it or not. Clean energy standards are fast approaching. Markets are shifting. And in agriculture, we feel that uncertainty every day. One change in federal policy or a single press conference can send ripple effects through the entire system. Our farmers are watching, waiting and wondering what the future holds. This legislation offers them something solid to stand on, and a new opportunity to grow.

SAF is a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel, capable of reducing emissions by up to 80%. And the best part is, it can be made from crops grown in Michigan. With the right incentives in place, our farmers can be at the center of this emerging industry: supplying corn, soybeans and other feedstocks that help power planes taking off from Michigan’s airports.

But this isn’t only about cleaner fuel, It’s about rural jobs and long-term economic resilience.

SAF production means more opportunities in towns that have seen too many family farms and small businesses disappear. It means consistent demand for what our farmers already produce, new construction jobs to build biorefineries and new careers in bio-manufacturing and logistics. It also offers a way to build that opportunity while also cutting emissions and strengthening the state's energy independence.

This legislation shows what’s possible when we put politics aside. It’s backed by Democrats and Republicans, agriculture leaders and energy advocates, urban interests and rural communities. That kind of cooperation is rare these days, but it’s exactly what Michigan needs more of.

I won’t pretend this is the answer to every challenge we face. But it’s a strong step forward. It sends a message to our farmers that we have their backs; to our communities, that we’re investing in their future; and to the country, that Michigan is ready to lead.

Much like ethanol did in years past, tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel are a powerful way to drive investment into rural communities — unlocking broad economic gains. This strategy supports President Donald Trump’s vision of strengthening U.S. energy independence and growing American jobs. Moving SAF forward means building long-term prosperity throughout the agricultural supply chain.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/19/PDTN/75296660007-gunrightsmarch-mich-capitol-14.JPG?crop=2997,1686,x1,y56&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-29 00:02:52.141218

It delivers a powerful signal that the U.S.–Japan alliance is not only a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific, but also a driver of global growth and innovation.

Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries. It is the single largest foreign investment commitment ever secured by any country and will generate hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations, the White House affirmed.

At President Trump’s direction, these funds will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s industrial base including energy infrastructure and production. Investment will also be directed into the semiconductor industry, critical minerals mining, pharmaceutical and medical production, and commercial and defense shipbuilding.

The United States will retain 90 percent of the profits from this investment, ensuring that American workers, taxpayers, and communities reap the overwhelming share of the benefit.

As part of this agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15 percent tariff rate.

In addition to raising billions in revenue, this new tariff framework, combined with expanded U.S. exports and investment-driven production, will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall U.S. trade position.

This approach reflects the United States’ broader effort to establish a consistent, transparent, and enforceable trade environment in which American workers and producers are no longer disadvantaged by outdated or one-sided trade rules.

For decades, U.S. companies have faced barriers when seeking access to Japan’s market. This agreement delivers breakthrough openings across key sectors. Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75 percent, with a major expansion of import quotas; Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. The US will also expand its energy exports to Japan.

Moreover, Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft. Japan will also purchase billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. defense equipment, enhancing interoperability and alliance security in the Indo-Pacific.

Longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks will be lifted, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese consumer market and U.S. automotive standards will be approved in Japan for the first time ever.

Learn Today Solar jet fuel → Synthetic aviation fuel made using solar energy, reducing carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) → Alternative jet fuels that lower environmental impact, including solar and biofuels.","On July 24, 2025, Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) became the first airline to use solar jet fuel in regular flights, marking a major step for sustainable aviation. The Solar jet fuel, made by Swiss company Synhelion, was added to SWISS’s flights from Hamburg to Zurich, covering about 7% of the fuel needed for that journey. This move shows that solar jet fuel can work with current airport systems and could help reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

The solar jet fuel came from Synhelion’s DAWN plant in Jülich, Germany. This plant, running since late summer 2024, uses solar heat to turn carbon dioxide and water into syngas, which is then made into synthetic crude oil and refined into Jet-A-1 fuel. The first batch delivered to SWISS was 190 liters, a small but important start. According to analysis by VisaVerge.com, this event proves that solar jet fuel can be used in real-world flights and could help the industry move away from fossil fuels.

Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS, said the airline is proud to lead in using new technology for a cleaner future. Philipp Furler, Synhelion’s co-founder, called the milestone a real step toward making solar jet fuel available worldwide. The Lufthansa Group, which owns SWISS, supports these efforts and wants to help scale up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.

Solar jet fuel is certified as Jet-A-1, meaning it meets all safety and quality standards for use in planes. This makes it easy to add to existing airport and refinery systems. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects SAF production, including solar jet fuel, to reach 2.7 billion liters in 2025. However, this is still less than 1% of the world’s jet fuel needs. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set goals for SAF to help cut aviation’s carbon emissions by 5% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

The DAWN plant can make several thousand liters of solar fuel each year. Solar energy heats the plant’s reactors to over 1,200°C, driving the chemical reactions needed to create fuel. Solar jet fuel can cut carbon emissions by up to 100% if captured carbon is used, and it also reduces other pollutants like soot and sulfur.

Right now, solar jet fuel costs more than regular jet fuel—about 2 to 10 times as much. Production is still small, so ticket prices may go up until more fuel is made. Still, airlines, airports, and refineries can use solar jet fuel with little change to their systems.

Synhelion plans to build a larger plant in Spain and expand production. Pilatus Aircraft, another partner, wants to use solar jet fuel for its own planes soon. Governments are also pushing for more SAF use, with the United States 🇺🇸 aiming for 3 billion gallons by 2030.

It’s a compelling example of how aviation innovation can extend far beyond air travel and directly serve planet-positive business goals.","Aviation is under pressure to clean up its act, and fast. The industry’s flagship climate tool, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), is already faltering. A new report has revealed that only one project has issued carbon credits eligible under CORSIA rules. That’s a startling supply crunch for a scheme meant to help airlines hit emissions targets by purchasing offsets, especially as international flights ramp back up post-pandemic. With the voluntary carbon market (VCM) unable to keep pace, airlines could be flying into a serious climate credibility gap.

CORSIA was never meant to be the entire solution. But this shortfall underscores a deeper truth: Aviation can’t offset its way out to sustainability. Airlines and aircraft manufacturers need viable, scalable ways to reduce emissions at the source.

And while policy lags and viable jet fuel alternatives remain limited, the innovation pipeline tells a more hopeful story: A surge of new technologies is reimagining a sustainable future for aviation. Many are still early stage, but they point to a future where the need for offsets shrinks, not grows.

Here are five standout solutions helping aviation cut emissions. Each one tackles the problem from a different angle – and together, they offer a glimpse of what cleaner flight could look like.

Ceramic fuel cells powered by liquid sodium could unlock electric flight

Image credit: Gretchen Ertl

A team at MIT has developed a liquid sodium metal fuel cell designed to overcome one of electric aviation’s biggest hurdles: battery weight.

Instead of using traditional, rechargeable batteries, this system runs on inexpensive liquid sodium and could deliver more than three times the energy density of current lithium-ion tech. The goal? Make electric aircraft feasible for commercial use, without the heavy baggage of today’s battery limitations.

How it works

The system is built around a solid ceramic electrolyte that separates liquid sodium fuel from ambient air. Oxygen from the air reacts with sodium ions that pass through the membrane, producing electricity in the process. Unlike batteries, there’s no need for recharging – just refuel with more sodium. That makes the setup not only lighter and more energy-dense, but also safer, since the two reactive components are separated and one of them (air) is non-combustible. The prototype is currently small, but scalable, and is being further developed by a startup called Propel Aero based at The Engine – MIT’s innovation hub.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

Aviation consumed around 99 billion gallons of fossil fuel in 2024 alone and remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. If this technology scales, it could help phase out fossil jet fuel entirely for short- and medium-haul flights. That’s a major opportunity for climate-focused companies – whether it’s greening business travel, decarbonizing supply chains, or investing in breakthrough tech. It’s not just a fuel cell; it’s a potential route to net-zero aviation.

Turning waste polystyrene into a critical SAF ingredient

Image credit: Fred Zwicky

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have developed a method to convert waste polystyrene – the kind found in packaging and containers – into ethylbenzene, a key aromatic hydrocarbon used in aviation fuel.

Aromatics make up 8-25 percent of jet fuel and are essential for ensuring proper combustion and sealing within fuel systems. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) often lack sufficient aromatics, limiting their use. This breakthrough could help unlock safer, more scalable SAF blends.

How it works

The process relies on thermal pyrolysis, where polystyrene is heated and broken down into a styrene-rich liquid. The team then adds hydrogen to the mix, producing crude ethylbenzene. After distillation, the result is a product that’s 90 percent pure and performs just as well as fossil-derived alternatives when blended with SAF.

Even more impressively, a lifecycle analysis shows a 50-60 percent reduction in emissions compared to petroleum-based ethylbenzene. It’s also cheaper to make.

Yes, it’s still at the lab stage; but the team is aiming to scale to continuous pilot operations and is building partnerships for waste-stream sourcing and sorting to ensure a steady supply of low-cost feedstock.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This innovation checks multiple boxes: waste reduction, emissions savings and better SAF performance. For companies relying on air freight or business travel, it offers a real pathway to lower-carbon aviation. And for brands working toward circularity goals, it’s a powerful reminder that today’s trash could fuel tomorrow’s transport, literally.

Scaling up next-gen SAFs with ‘Aerobrew’

Image credit: Metafuels

Swiss startup Metafuels is pioneering a new process to produce synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) at scale, using a system it calls ‘Aerobrew.’ While SAF has long been recognized as a key to decarbonizing aviation, high costs and low production volumes have held it back. Metafuels’ approach aims to deliver a higher-yield, lower-cost alternative that could replace fossil jet fuel without modifications to existing aircraft.

How it works

The Aerobrew process begins by combining green hydrogen – produced through renewably powered electrolysis – with captured CO₂, sourced from technologies such as direct air capture. These inputs are used to synthesize green methanol, which is then converted into SAF. Unlike other SAF production methods, Aerobrew maximizes conversion efficiency from methanol to jet fuel, which significantly boosts yield and reduces production costs.

The result is a drop-in fuel that works across all aircraft types, with no need for changes to engines or infrastructure. Backed by $22 million in funding, including a recent $5 million grant from the Swiss Government, Metafuels is now moving toward commercial scale. A newly announced facility in Denmark, built in partnership with European Energy, is expected to produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

Aviation emissions are rising fast, and SAF remains one of the most promising tools to counter them. But scalability is the sticking point. Metafuels offers a real-world path to volume production of SAF, powered by renewables and carbon capture. For brands with global operations, freight logistics or ambitious climate targets, this innovation could enable cleaner skies without waiting decades for electric or hydrogen planes to arrive.

Using AI flight planning to stop planet-warming contrails

Image credit: chamillewhite

Contrails – those familiar white streaks trailing behind jets – are a surprisingly potent climate threat. They trap heat in the atmosphere and are responsible for up to 60 percent of aviation’s climate impact. Until recently, avoiding them was considered too complex. But UK-based climate tech startup Satavia is proving otherwise. Its DECISIONX platform uses AI to help airlines plan flight paths that avoid contrail formation – cutting emissions without requiring new fuels or hardware.

How it works

Satavia’s system draws on high-resolution weather forecasting, aircraft performance data and atmospheric modeling to predict where and when contrails are likely to form. Built on its 5-DX digital twin of the atmosphere, DECISIONX lets airlines reroute or adjust altitude just slightly – sometimes by as little as a few hundred feet – to avoid the narrow atmospheric bands where contrails form. These minor tweaks can prevent warming.

Importantly, the platform also quantifies the climate impact of these changes – allowing airlines to validate and monetize contrail avoidance by converting it into future carbon-equivalent units, tradable on the VCM. It’s already in use: Etihad Airways has signed a multi-year contract to embed the tech into daily operations.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This is climate mitigation without compromise – no new aircraft, no major costs; just smarter routing. For companies concerned with Scope 3 emissions from business travel or air freight, supporting contrail prevention could offer measurable reductions in climate impact. It also opens the door to carbon credits backed by science, rather than sometimes-questionable offsets.

Solar-powered, autonomous aircraft for continuous, zero-emission monitoring

Image credit: Radical

US startup Radical has developed a high-altitude, autonomous aircraft designed to fly for months at a time without landing – powered by nothing but sunlight. While conventional aviation emits vast amounts of CO₂, this ultra-lightweight aircraft offers an emissions-free alternative with powerful potential across multiple sectors – from climate monitoring to communications.

How it works

The aircraft is powered by solar panels that charge on-board batteries – enabling autonomous, sustained flight at high altitudes. Unlike satellites, these aircraft can hover over precise areas for extended periods – providing real-time, high-resolution data and coverage. Potential applications include monitoring wildfires, weather systems and illegal activity at sea; as well as acting as a low-orbit platform for mobile and internet connectivity, delivering broadband directly to devices.

Radical’s innovation is not just theoretical. After testing a small prototype in October 2023, the company has raised $4.5 million in seed funding from investors including Scout Ventures and Y Combinator. The next step: a full-scale test flight within the year to validate long-duration performance.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This isn’t about transporting passengers; it’s about enabling smarter, climate-positive infrastructure. For companies involved in agriculture, conservation, telecoms or ESG reporting, these aircraft could offer persistent, zero-emissions solutions for data gathering and connectivity, at lower cost and higher resolution than traditional satellite systems. It’s a compelling example of how aviation innovation can extend far beyond air travel and directly serve planet-positive business goals.",https://sb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/production/52506/conversions/production-asset-thumb--offsetting-wont-save-aviation-innovation-2025-07-28-82c6b9d7d9b7100ba04c0aa755b4c792-fbimg.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 16:56:33.675371

Pharmaceuticals comprise over 12 percent of India’s total airfreight export value, and nearly 80 percent of this volume demands some form of temperature control, according to IATA.

“The weakest link is no longer airlift—it’s cold chain consistency from shipper to consignee,” observed Bhasker A, Associate Vice President of Engineering and Projects at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. “GDP-compliant handling and validated lanes are critical if we are to compete with hubs in Europe or Singapore.”

The concern is validated by discrepancies in airport infrastructure across Indian cities. While metro hubs such as Mumbai and Hyderabad have made progress in pharma-certified facilities, regional airports remain under-equipped to handle high-value cold chain cargo, threatening India’s ability to decentralise pharmaceutical exports.

Digital infrastructure as the invisible enabler

A quiet but profound shift is underway in India’s airfreight sector: the digitalisation of cargo processing and inter-agency coordination. Vineet Malhotra, Director at Kale Logistics, explained how Cargo Community Systems (CCS) at key airports have reduced shipment dwell times by 22 percent and streamlined customs-clearance documentation.

This effort aligns with India’s ambition to improve its ranking in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI), where it now ranks 38th globally, a significant improvement from its 44th position in 2018.

“Interoperability between forwarders, airlines, ground handlers and customs is no longer aspirational—it’s fundamental,” Malhotra said. “A paperless ecosystem not only improves turnaround time, but reduces regulatory friction and enhances compliance traceability.”

Policy professionals monitoring digital trade facilitation will note that this evolution aligns with broader WTO efforts on Trade Facilitation Agreements (TFA), where data integration and real-time visibility are central to reducing cross-border inefficiencies.

High-Security & Precision Logistics

India’s rise as a hub for high-value, high-security cargo—ranging from banking assets to high-end electronics and jewellery—has triggered innovation in secure logistics services.

“India’s growth story in this segment is limited, not by demand but by scalable and standardised solutions,” said Rajkumar S, CEO of Sequel Logistics, a market leader in secure logistics. “We’re witnessing a strong uptick in inter-city express movement, especially among banking and bullion sectors.”

Sequel’s model, built on vault-to-vault tracking, temperature integrity, and end-to-end risk management, represents a critical edge in markets where data security, chain of custody, and audit trails are under increasing scrutiny.

Decentralisation: Beyond Metro-Centric Growth

While India’s six major metro airports account for nearly 80 percent of airfreight throughput, speakers at the panel urged policymakers to focus on capacity-building across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, especially as Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes decentralise manufacturing.

“India’s cargo growth will be driven not just by volumes, but by regional inclusivity,” stated Himanshu Pant, Managing Director & CEO of MGH Group. “We must incentivise the development of smaller cargo terminals and multimodal linkages in the hinterland.”

The success of regional air connectivity schemes like UDAN and the viability of smaller freighter operations will depend heavily on how India integrates cargo-specific incentives into regional airport modernisation plans.

Institutional execution remains a bottleneck

Despite strong policy ambition, experts cautioned that execution gaps remain—particularly around the National Air Cargo Policy Blueprint (2019), which remains largely unimplemented. Industry professionals highlighted the need for harmonised policy across ministries, centralised stakeholder coordination, and enforceable service-level benchmarks.

“India is at the cusp of a logistics revolution—but unless we institutionalise governance, standardisation, and training, we risk squandering the opportunity,” noted moderator Ramesh Mamidala, Head of Cargo at Air India.

A framework akin to the European Union’s Single Window Environment for Customs (EU SW-CERTEX), or a cross-sector regulatory authority for cargo, could help India accelerate execution while reducing regulatory fragmentation.

Implications for Global Trade and Sustainability

India’s airfreight expansion intersects with broader global challenges—particularly supply chain resilience, decarbonisation mandates, and digital trade compliance. With the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Fit for 55 proposals reshaping trade regulation, operators in India will need to adapt quickly to sustainability reporting, carbon footprint tracking, and green fuel adoption.

“We need visibility not just of cargo, but of carbon,” said one panel participant. “India must develop its SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) strategy in lockstep with trade policy, or risk being excluded from future air corridors with green mandates.”

In this context, India’s airfreight policy must be better integrated with its climate strategy, trade agreements, and aviation decarbonisation targets to ensure compliance and competitiveness.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Page-9-shutterstock_1936631263-1080x724.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:56:08.481501

As part of the agreement with Japan, Japan will increase the quota for rice imports and has committed to purchasing $8 billion worth of U.S. goods. Although details are few, the EU and United States reached a framework deal over the weekend that may lower some tariffs on agricultural goods.

Reports indicate the United States and EU will have zero-for-zero tariffs on some agricultural products. The tariff rates for wine and spirits are not yet established. The remaining tariff level will be set at 15%, up from the 10% bar reset on April 9 and in line with the other renegotiated deals in recent weeks. National Grain and Feed Association President and CEO Mike Seyfert said this is a “meaningful step forward in opening one of the world’s most restrictive markets to American producers.” Seyfert added NGFA is “encouraged by the president’s call to diversify agricultural trade with the EU, and we look forward to ongoing discussions to build on that goal.”

Japan is expected to immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, representing a major expansion of import quotas. In addition, the framework establishes Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the ninth largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion, the U.S. Grains Council shared. “This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol,” said USGC President and CEO Ryan LeGrand.

USA Rice President and CEO Peter Bachmann added, “Japan is consistently among our top export markets in terms of both value and volume, but this will be the first opportunity since the 1990s to further that market access.” From 1999 to 2024, Japan imported an annual average of 326,828 MT of U.S. rice, valued at approximately $222.7 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). U.S. rice that enters Japan outside the tariff rate quota system faces a tariff of 341 yen per kilogram, which in U.S. dollars is roughly $2.33 per kg or $2,330 per MT, USA Rice reported.

The framework with Indonesia also addresses non-tariff barriers for U.S. agriculture. Specifically, Indonesia will address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Indonesian market, including by: (1) exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all of Indonesia’s import licensing regimes including its commodity balance policy; (2) ensuring transparency and fairness with respect to geographical indications including meats and cheeses; (3) providing permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin (FFPO) designation for all applicable U.S. plant products; and (4) recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight, including listing of all U.S. meat, poultry and dairy facilities and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

While U.S. soybeans and soy products already enjoyed duty-free access into the market, the framework also announced a commitment from Indonesia to purchase $4.5 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and soybean meal.

Yet, despite achieving a modest increase in revenue, the airline’s net profit for the first quarter of 2025 has suffered a sharp decline of 59%. The reasons behind this decline include lower interest income, the underperformance of its partner, Air India, and intensifying competition in the aviation sector. This financial setback carries significant implications not just for the airline itself, but for the broader tourism and travel industry in Southeast Asia and beyond.

The SIA Group reported a total revenue of S$4.79 billion, a slight rise from the previous year’s S$4.72 billion, yet its operating profit slipped by 13.8%. The steep drop in profits raises several concerns about the economic pressures faced by the aviation sector, which has seen a notable shift due to volatile market conditions and increasing competition. For tourists planning to travel across Southeast Asia, these changes are bound to affect the landscape of air travel, and by extension, tourism as a whole.

The relationship between airlines and tourism is inextricable. As global tourism continues to rebound, airlines, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, are vital in making destinations accessible to travelers. The profitability of major airlines like Singapore Airlines has direct consequences on travel pricing, availability of flights, and the overall travel experience. A decline in airline profits could signal the possibility of reduced flight frequencies, higher fares, and less competition in certain sectors.

SIA’s passenger numbers, however, paint a more optimistic picture. The group carried a record 10.27 million passengers in Q1 FY2025/26, marking a 6.9% increase from the previous year. The high demand for air travel despite the financial struggles faced by the airline reflects the resilience of Southeast Asia’s tourism sector, where travel is still booming.

However, this growth comes at a cost. SIA’s passenger yields, which represent the average fare paid per mile flown by each passenger, fell by 2.9%. This decline indicates a more competitive environment in which customers may struggle to find affordable tickets, potentially deterring tourists from traveling as frequently or to farther destinations. The concern here is not just about higher ticket prices but also the reduced availability of budget-friendly travel options that appeal to price-conscious tourists, particularly in the leisure and mid-range segments.

The Air India Factor: How Partnerships Affect Tourism

One of the most significant contributors to SIA’s profit decline is its partnership with Air India, particularly after Air India fully integrated Vistara, which was previously partially owned by SIA. The decision to account for Air India’s financial performance as part of its own balance sheet has significantly impacted SIA’s profits, largely due to Air India’s losses. This, in turn, affects the travel plans of many passengers, especially those considering routes that involve multiple airlines under the same partnership.

With the growing dominance of Air India in the South Asian market, the fall of SIA’s profits could slow the progress of joint ventures and collaborations in the region, potentially reducing the number of travel routes or destinations offered by these carriers. For tourists, especially those traveling between Southeast Asia and South Asia, this could mean fewer choices in flights, possibly leading to higher costs or less direct routes. This could affect travel itineraries, particularly for business travelers and leisure tourists heading to destinations like India, Malaysia, and Thailand, where airlines like SIA play a key role in the tourism infrastructure.

Tourism Growth Amid Financial Struggles

Despite the financial setbacks, both Singapore Airlines and its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, achieved all-time high passenger numbers. The high load factors (the proportion of available seats filled with passengers) of 86.6% for Singapore Airlines and 91.5% for Scoot illustrate that demand for air travel remains robust, even in the face of financial uncertainty. This is particularly important for tourism, as airlines are a primary vehicle for both inbound and outbound travelers in the region.

However, the lower passenger yields paint a concerning picture for the tourism industry. These falling yields, caused by increased competition from other carriers adding more capacity, could result in higher operational costs. Airlines may respond by passing these costs onto customers, particularly tourists who are already facing rising prices for accommodations, activities, and other travel expenses.

On the other hand, the strong performance in passenger volumes provides optimism for the future. Tourists continue to flock to destinations across Asia, and Singapore remains a central hub for international travelers, offering access to key regional destinations such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The travel demand in the region is likely to continue, albeit with a cautionary note about pricing.

The Future of Air Travel and Tourism in Southeast Asia

Singapore Airlines’ strong network, including recent expansions in destinations like Iloilo in the Philippines and Vienna in Austria for Scoot, signals that the company is actively exploring new growth opportunities. This is vital not only for the airline’s recovery but also for the sustainability of tourism in the region. Expanding networks and increasing capacity to high-demand destinations help mitigate some of the potential negative impacts caused by economic fluctuations.

Moreover, the group’s partnership with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) suppliers such as Neste and World Energy demonstrates its commitment to sustainability, a critical consideration for tourists who are increasingly concerned with the environmental impact of their travels. With sustainability becoming a more prominent factor in the travel decisions of consumers, airlines that prioritize eco-friendly practices may be better positioned to maintain loyalty from environmentally-conscious travelers.

Additionally, the airline’s strategic initiatives to counterbalance market fluctuations, such as increasing capacity on Asian routes following the closure of Jetstar Asia, could help provide stability in the tourism sector. This will be particularly beneficial for tourists looking for budget-friendly travel options and for countries in the region dependent on international tourism as a key driver of their economy.

Financial Health and Resilience Amid Challenges

Despite the profit decline, the SIA Group remains in a strong financial position. The group’s balance sheet shows a solid equity base of S$15.8 billion, a reduction in debt, and a healthy cash balance of S$7.8 billion. These financial strengths provide the group with the resilience needed to weather the ongoing economic uncertainties, positioning it well for future growth.

For the tourism industry, this strong financial backing is a sign of stability. It suggests that, despite short-term financial challenges, Singapore Airlines will continue to be a major player in the Southeast Asian travel landscape. This is important for both tourists and businesses that rely on the airline’s vast network for logistics and transportation.

Conclusion: Looking Ahead to a Robust Travel Landscape

While the recent decline in Singapore Airlines’ profits raises concerns about the future of air travel and tourism in Southeast Asia, the airline’s commitment to passenger growth, sustainability, and expanding its network offers a promising outlook. The robust demand for air travel, combined with SIA’s strategic efforts to navigate economic uncertainties, ensures that the region’s tourism industry will remain resilient.

The key takeaway for travelers and industry professionals is that while challenges persist, the tourism sector in Southeast Asia remains strong. Tourists will likely continue to flock to popular destinations such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, with airlines adapting to meet these demands. The ongoing investments in infrastructure, sustainability, and route expansions demonstrate that the tourism and travel industries are resilient and will continue to thrive, albeit with careful navigation through uncertain economic times.

The deal slashes tariffs on Japanese vehicles, opens Japanese markets to U.S. energy and agriculture, and commits a staggering $550 billion in Japanese investment into the U.S. economy.

Investors are already seeing the impact: Japanese auto stocks jumped double digits on the news. But the ripple effects go way beyond Toyota and Honda… and the smartest investors are positioning now for the next wave of winners.

Let’s break down what’s in this deal, who stands to gain, and how to play it.

What’s actually in the deal?

Here’s the quick breakdown:

Lower tariffs: Japanese autos entering the U.S. will now face a flat 15% tariff—a big drop from the ~27.5% originally threatened.

Massive Japanese investment: Japan pledged $550 billion for U.S. industries, including semiconductors, energy, shipbuilding, and AI.

Market access for U.S. agriculture and energy: Japan will expand U.S. rice imports by 75%, and buy more corn, soybeans, fertilizer, and even sustainable aviation fuel.

Technology and supply chain collaboration: The deal gives U.S. companies better access to Japan’s high-tech industries—like AI, semiconductors, and robotics—while allowing Japanese firms to take part in U.S. supply chain reshoring. It’s a two-way partnership aimed at reducing reliance on China and strengthening critical industries in both countries.

Who’s already winning (and losing)?

The biggest pop came in Japanese automakers, which suddenly got cheaper access to the U.S. market. These companies now enjoy a huge cost advantage over U.S. automakers—at least in the near term.

Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), Nissan (NSANY), and Mazda (MZDAY) all surged within hours of the news.

Sony Group (SONY) also rallied thanks to its heavy electronics and supply chain exposure.

Unfortunately for Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), this deal makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market—right when Ford and GM are still struggling to manage EV costs and shifting supply chains.

GM and Ford now face a major disadvantage. They’ll eventually have to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S.—but that takes time and money. Until then, their margins will lag while Japanese automakers sell cheaper.

But this isn’t just about cars. The $550 billion Japanese investment package targets strategic sectors:

Semiconductors and critical minerals – bolstering supply chains and advanced manufacturing

Energy and shipbuilding – more U.S. LNG, sustainable aviation fuel, and maritime projects

AI and advanced tech – joint development and IP-sharing opportunities

U.S. agriculture – expanded rice, soybean, corn, and fertilizer exports

Think of it as a two-way street: Japanese exports (like cars and electronics) gain a smoother path to U.S. consumers… while U.S. companies get better access to Japanese demand for energy, food, and technology.

And there’s another recurring winner from deals like this: Boeing (BA).

Why? Because trade deals often use big-ticket purchases, such as airplanes, to balance deficits. Japan is expected to boost its orders of U.S.-made aircraft… which will send Boeing soaring.

The next trade deal catalysts

Japan is just the first in a series of deals coming ahead of the August 1 deadline.

Two under-the-radar countries that could become our next trade partners: Cambodia and Bangladesh.

Why does that matter? Because those countries are massive apparel exporters. If the U.S. signs favorable trade deals with them, Gap (GPS), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Ralph Lauren (RL), and PVH Corp (PVH) could see a 10–15% pop, similar to what we just saw with Japanese automakers.

So keep an eye on these future negotiations—they could trigger the next round of trade-related stock surges.

How to play it

Here’s a simple roadmap for investors:

Go long Japanese exporters: Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), Nissan (NSANY), Mazda (MZDAY), and Sony (SONY) should continue to benefit from tariff relief and stronger U.S. demand.

Avoid Ford and GM for now: Both face cost and pricing disadvantages until they relocate more production domestically.

Own Boeing as a recurring trade-deal winner: BA often sees orders tied to major bilateral deals.

Watch apparel stocks for the next wave: Gap (GPS), Levi’s (LEVI), Ralph Lauren (RL), and PVH Corp (PVH) could surge if apparel-heavy countries sign similar deals.

The big picture

This U.S.–Japan deal is more than a tariff tweak—it’s a strategic alignment that unlocks new flows of trade and investment. It rewards companies that can pivot quickly… and punishes those stuck with outdated cost structures.

These deals create immediate pops in the companies most exposed to them. If you can position yourself early—before CNBC starts talking about it—you can ride those 10–20% surges.

And with more countries lining up to negotiate before the August deadline, there’s plenty more opportunity on the horizon.",https://www.curzioresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/us-japan-usd-jpy-800.png,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:15.328176

Lawmakers rely on this scorekeeper to provide impartial analysis. But what happens when those projections miss the mark? A new bill from Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) aims to answer that question by holding the CBO more accountable when its forecasts fail to match reality.

Barr’s CBO Scoring Accountability Act (H.R.2666) would require the agency to publish follow-up analyses of major legislation after they’ve been enacted into law. This would ensure Congress and the public have a clearer picture of how well CBO estimates hold up once policies are implemented.

There’s often a disconnect between what legislation is projected to cost and what it ends up costing once implemented. CBO’s estimates are not always accurate—and there’s little formal review when reality diverges from projection. Barr’s bill aims to close that gap by requiring CBO to compare original projections to real-world outcomes—helping Congress learn from past mistakes and improve future policymaking.

CBO’s Role in the Budget Process and the Risks of Inaccurate Scores

CBO was established as a neutral budget scorekeeper by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Before this, Congress was generally dependent on the White House’s Office of Management and Budget for fiscal analysis. CBO plays a pivotal role in the development of policy, producing official cost estimates for hundreds of bills each year. In addition, members of Congress and their staff routinely consult with CBO for informal analysis while drafting legislation.

CBO’s estimates play a major role in shaping policy debates, but they are not infallible. Many factors can cause actual fiscal outcomes to diverge from projections, including unexpected economic shifts, policy implementation challenges, and incorrect assumptions. For example, CBO’s dramatic underestimation of the cost of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits and its overestimation of the revenue impact of IRS enforcement funding both illustrate how uncertainty can lead to significant discrepancies between projections and reality.

We at NTUF successfully urged CBO to better highlight uncertainty in its estimates, ensuring that lawmakers and the public have a clearer understanding of the potential range of outcomes. Instead of burying these details deep within explanatory text, CBO now summarizes key points of uncertainty more prominently in its reports, particularly in the sections presenting top-line budgetary impacts. This change helps policymakers better assess the reliability of estimates and recognize when projections might be overly optimistic or pessimistic.

However, these points of uncertainty are often overlooked, and sometimes CBO’s estimates can be significantly off the mark. Understanding that CBO’s scores are well-considered but not infallible will be crucial for having a clear view during this year’s tax debate. Taxpayers should be cautious when analyzing estimates that depend on numerous uncertainties. Here are some of the key misses from CBO in recent years.

Inflation Reduction Act Electric Vehicle Tax Credits

One of the most costly miscalculations in recent memory involves the expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) Tax Credit under the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The law removed a cap on the number of eligible EVs per manufacturer, massively broadening the credit’s reach.

Though originally intended to boost demand, recent research shows that 75% of the credit’s claimants likely would have bought the electric vehicle anyways, meaning the credit functions more as a subsidy than an incentive. But Congress had little idea of the potential price tag, in part because CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) dramatically underestimated the cost.

In 2022, CBO estimated that IRA’s clean vehicle credits would cost around $14 billion over the decade. Revised and follow up estimates range from around $200 billion from CBO, to around $400 billion from the Penn-Wharton Budget Model with some of the overrun tied to a Treasury Department loophole for leased vehicles.

To rein in these runaway costs, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) phases out or eliminates many of the green energy tax credits created under the IRA. This includes repealing the electric vehicle subsidy. OBBBA also rolls back production and investment tax credits for wind and solar, and eliminates credits for clean hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, advanced manufacturing, and zero-emissions facilities. These reforms are expected to save roughly $500 billion over the next decade.

Medicaid Expansion Flop

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has faced criticism on many fronts, but one of its most costly provisions for taxpayers is the Medicaid expansion. Beginning in 2014, states were permitted to expand their Medicaid coverage to non-elderly, able-bodied adults with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. When the ACA passed in 2010, the CBO, assuming nationwide adoption, projected sixteen million new enrollees by 2019. Yet by 2019, enrollment in expansion states had already reached fifteen million—even though only about three-fifths of states had implemented the expansion. This is also a huge contributing factor to why the program has been roughly 157% more expensive than anticipated. CBO scored Medicaid expansion repeal at around $800 billion in the ten year budget window back in 2017, which is likely far higher now that additional states have implemented the expansion.

Improving Transparency and Accuracy in Budget Scoring

Budget misses such as these undermine effective policymaking. These cost estimates of enacted laws get included in CBO’s baseline, and, when they are faulty, lead to a skewed outlook of outlays and revenues. More accurate evaluations of major legislation are essential to improving fiscal discipline and accountability.

Under the bill, CBO would assess the actual budgetary effects of such laws and compare them with its original estimates. If actual outcomes diverge from initial projections by more than 10%, CBO must notify Congress and provide an explanation of the discrepancy. The bill also requires federal agencies to cooperate with CBO by supplying data and support necessary for these analyses.

Barr’s bill would build on efforts already undertaken by CBO. For example, it already publishes a variety of recurring reports, such as its ten-year budget and economic outlook and long-term outlook, which include analyses of legislative and economic factors that lead figures to differ from what CBO had previously reported. CBO also regularly examines the accuracy of its baseline. However, these reports do not always dig into the impacts of specific laws.

Barr’s legislation would fill a critical gap by ensuring ongoing reviews of the actual costs of major legislation. These reviews may be challenging due to the many variables that affect both cost estimates and real-world outcomes. However, requiring them would help CBO learn how policies actually unfold and use those insights to improve its future scoring models.

Conclusion

Rep. Barr’s CBO Scoring Accountability Act is a commonsense reform that would strengthen the accuracy and accountability of CBO’s cost estimates—an especially important step following the enactment of sweeping legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Requiring regular updates on the real-world fiscal impact of major laws will help lawmakers assess whether a policy is working as intended or needs correction. By improving oversight of budget projections, this bill would help ensure more responsible policymaking, provide for improved estimates from CBO, and lead to better outcomes for taxpayers.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2025/03/CBO.jpeg?v=20250303031100,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:18.081870

In a moment marking the end of an era in aerospace testing, Rolls-Royce officially retired its legendary Boeing 747-200 engine testbed, N787RR, on 9 July 2025.

Stationed at Tucson International Airport, the aircraft concluded nearly two decades of ground-breaking flight trials, leaving behind a legacy that has shaped the evolution of modern jet propulsion, Vintage Aviation News reported.

From testing cutting-edge business jet engines to flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), N787RR became a workhorse of engineering advancement and a symbol of ingenuity in aviation research.

From passenger carrier to flying laboratory

Originally delivered to Cathay Pacific in 1980 as VR-HIA, the aircraft went on to serve with Air Atlanta Icelandic before its transformation by Rolls-Royce began in June 2005. Re-registered as N787RR, the Boeing 747-200 was meticulously refitted into a state-of-the-art flying laboratory. Stripped of passenger seating, the aircraft was equipped with high-tech instrumentation, recording systems, and a distinctive five-engine mounting configuration—allowing it to safely carry and test experimental engines in real-time flight conditions. Its robust four-engine design made it the ideal platform, enabling engineers to evaluate new powerplants without compromising safety.

Pioneering sustainable aviation fuel

The N787RR’s contribution to aerospace went far beyond structural modifications. In October 2021, the aircraft flew a Trent 1000 engine powered entirely by 100% SAF—demonstrating the potential of greener aviation technologies. The aircraft flew from Tucson airport in Arizona, passing over New Mexico and Texas, with a Trent 1000 engine running solely on 100% SAF while the remaining three RB211 engines ran on standard jet fuel.

The three hours and 54 minutes flight, which soared to 43,000 feet, validated the real-world performance and environmental promise of alternative fuels.

Deborah Robinson, Director of Test and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce, described the aircraft as “a great asset to us… we can take the opportunity to test the corners of the flight envelope and feed back into our extensive models.”

Testing the future: The Pearl 10X

Two years later, the N787RR entered another pivotal chapter as the testbed for Rolls-Royce’s Pearl 10X engine, destined for the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet. Beginning in March 2024, a series of high-altitude flights validated critical systems—ranging from fan vibration characteristics to in-flight relight capabilities. By mid-2024, at least ten test flights had been completed, with data gathered helping accelerate certification timelines and enhance engine reliability ahead of service entry.

Challenges of an ageing airframe

Despite these impressive achievements, age eventually caught up with the aircraft. Approaching 45 years of service, N787RR faced mounting maintenance and operational costs. With an average of 25 test flights per year, each sortie required increasing logistical support to maintain airworthiness.

A promising plan shelved

Rolls-Royce had once planned to replace the 747-200 with a newer 747-400 variant, registered as N747RR and acquired from Qantas in 2019. But that project was ultimately shelved in 2022 due to the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rolls-Royce invested £56 million ($94 million) in the acquisition and refurbishment of the aircraft. This is in addition to a £90 million investment in Testbed 80 in Derby, described by the company as “the largest and most intelligent testbed in the world.”

The 747-400 in question, once known as VH-OJU “Lord Howe Island,” had served Qantas for two decades, carrying 2.5 million passengers across more than 70 million kilometres. Upon retirement from commercial service, it was flown to AeroTEC’s flight test centre in Moses Lake, Washington, to begin a two-year conversion into a next-generation flying testbed. “This is a significant investment that will expand our world-leading test capabilities,” said Gareth Hedicker, Director of Development and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce at the time. However, as engine development timelines contracted and testing demands evolved, the project was deemed surplus to requirements.

Looking ahead: A new era in testing

In the wake of N787RR’s retirement, Rolls-Royce is pivoting towards ground-based testing and new aviation frontiers. With ongoing development of its UltraFan demonstrator, ALECSys lean-burn engine, and research into hydrogen-compatible propulsion systems, the future of engine testing may increasingly rely on digital modelling and advanced ground rigs like Testbed 80 in Derby.

The end of an icon, the rise of new possibilities

Nonetheless, the gap left by N787RR will not be easily filled. It provided unmatched flexibility, accommodating everything from widebody Trent engines to business jet powerplants on a single adaptable platform. The aircraft didn’t just generate terabytes of performance data; it embodied the philosophy of innovation through rigorous in-flight testing. It made headlines, inspired engineers, and proved time and again that theory only takes flight when tested in the sky.

The 787RR bridged generations of engine technology, offering critical insights from Trent to Pearl and laying the groundwork for what comes next. It showed the aviation world that with the right vision and platform, even a decades-old airframe could remain at the cutting edge of aerospace advancement.

Au revoir, magnificent multi-tasker of the skies!

With its retirement, Rolls-Royce bids farewell to a “magnificent multi-tasker of the skies”, an aircraft that redefined what flying laboratories could achieve. Its legacy now fuels the next wave of cleaner, more efficient engines poised to power the aircraft of tomorrow.

The sun may have set on N787RR’s final mission, but its contrails of innovation continue to stretch far into aviation’s future.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:21.382890

Last month, Vistara operated a wide-body aircraft on a long-haul international route using sustainable aviation fuel, first time for an Indian airline. A blend of 30% SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel was used on a ferry flight between Charleston International Airport, South Carolina to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, which resulted in the reduction of approximately 150,000 pounds of CO2 emissions over the fuel’s life cycle.

On this occasion, Mr. Vinod Kannan, Chief Executive Officer, Vistara, said, “We have always been committed to driving sustainability and innovation in aviation, and are delighted to carry out yet another industry-first initiative of operating a commercial flight on a wide-body using SAF. We are thankful to our partners and the relevant authorities for their support.”

Vistara, along with other airline companies of the TATA group, has been working extensively towards reduction of carbon emissions through use of sustainable technologies. Last year, they had signed an MoU with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – Indian Institute of Petroleum to collaborate on the research, development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). Vistara is also working through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), to lower CO2 emissions for international flights and to curb the industry’s impact on climate change.

Vistara is India’s highest-rated airline on Skytrax and TripAdvisor, and it has been the winner of several ‘Best Airline’ awards, besides being lauded for world-class cabin cleanliness and upholding high safety standards. The airline has recently been featured amongst World’s Top 20 Airlines while being recognised as the ‘Best Airline in India and Southern Asia’ for the second time in a row, ‘Best Airline Staff Service in India and Southern Asia’ for the fourth consecutive year, ‘Best Cabin Crew in India and Southern Asia’ for the second time in a row and ‘Best Business Class in India and Southern Asia’ at the coveted Skytrax World Airline Awards 2022. Vistara was also named the ‘Best Overall Airline’ in Central/Southern Asia at the 2023 Regional Passenger Choice Awards. Additionally, Vistara had recently received the ch-aviation Asia’s Third Youngest Airline Fleet award for the second consecutive year.",https://eraviation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/345202436_141518732227043_2379230507548153037_n.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 18:56:23.603976

White House Releases Fact Sheet on the U.S.- Japan Trade Deal

On July 23, 2025 the White House published a Fact Sheet on a proposed trade and investment agreement with Japan.

As part of the agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate. On the other hand, Japan has committed to increase market access for U.S. goods on a host of products. For instance, Japan has agreed to increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with an expansion of import quotas and agreed to purchase $US 8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft. The Fact Sheet states that Japan has agreed to lift “longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks” and recognize U.S. automotive standards.

Further, the Fact Sheet states that Japan will invest $US 550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries in sectors such as energy, semiconductors, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals and commercial and defense shipbuilding. The United States is expected to retain 90% of the profits from all investments.

The White House and Indonesia reach a Framework Deal on Reciprocal Trade

On July 22, 2025 the Trump administration and the Indonesian government agreed to a Framework for Negotiating an Agreement on Reciprocal Trade. In exchange for an IEEPA Reciprocal tariff rate of 19% set to begin on August 1, 2025, Indonesia has agreed to purchase commitments and offered a host of tariff and non-tariff related concessions to the United States.

Indonesia has agreed to procure (i) Boeing aircraft currently valued at $US 3.2 billion, (ii) purchase agriculture products, including soybeans, soybeans meal, wheat, and cotton with an estimated total value of $US 4.5 billion and (iii) energy products, including liquefied petroleum gas, crude oil, and gasoline, with an estimated value of $US 15 billion.

According to the Joint Statement, “Indonesia will eliminate approximately 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Indonesia.” It is unclear whether this means that Indonesian tariffs on a majority of U.S. origin goods will be eliminated altogether or significantly reduced. The countries have agreed to negotiate rules of origin to ensure that the benefits of the agreement are limited to the parties.

Indonesia has also agreed to address nontariff barriers on industrial and agricultural exports. These include accepting vehicles built to U.S. federal motor vehicle safety and emissions standards; accepting FDA certificates and prior marketing authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals; exempting U.S. exports of cosmetics, medical devices, and other manufactured goods from certification and labeling requirements among others; exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all import licensing regimes (including commodity balance requirements) and recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight (including listing of all U.S. meat, poultry, and dairy facilities) and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities. Further, Indonesia has committed to remove restriction on exports of critical minerals to the United States.

The country has also committed and address a number of other issues such as barriers to digital trade, protection and enforcement of labor rights, maintaining and enforcement of environmental laws and address global excess capacity in the steel sector by joining the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity.

As indicated above, the current agreement is a “Framework” and the United States and Indonesia are expected to continue negotiate and finalize a formal agreement in the coming weeks.

OFAC To Update Licensing Hotline With New Online Platform

Position Paper

The company’s position paper underscores the importance of implementing verification mechanisms that are transparent, equitable, and fraud resilient, as it safeguards the credibility of the biofuel market, fosters trust among customers and industry stakeholders, and supports environmental goals.

The position paper supports EU reforms for sustainable biofuel verification, calls for fair and uniform rules applicable to both EU and non EU producers/operators and all feedstock types. Provides caution against overly burdensome controls that could disrupt supply, this especially applies to limited supply products such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Advocates for practical, transparent and recognised verification processes with stakeholder input.

Verification System

It also advocates balanced roles for certification bodies and member states. Emphasises the importance of fairness in enforcement processes, including the procedures for certificate invalidation and recommends building on existing system strengths and learning from national experiences. Supports reforms to improve EU Biofuels Database (UDB) for better traceability.

EcoCeres believes that the verification system is fundamental in the EU’s ambition for a better climate and sustainability goals. Matti Lievonen, chief executive officer of EcoCeres believes the certification to be an essential infrastructure for the renewable fuels market. Lievonen said:

“As a producer committed to authentic waste-to-fuel pathways, we view rigorous certification not as a hurdle but as essential infrastructure for the renewable fuels market. Our position paper reflects our dedication to fostering a transparent, equitable, and fraud-resistant ecosystem for biofuels that benefits all stakeholders – from producers and policymakers to consumers and the environment.”

Washington, DC, July 28, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) welcomed the inclusion of multiple industry-supported policies in the Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies (THUD) bill passed by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee.

The Senate THUD bill includes $22.4 billion in funding for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), $13.8 billion of which is allocated for agency operations, $4 billion for facilities and equipment and $290 million for research and development. As with the THUD bill passed by the U.S. House Appropriations Committee on July 18, the Senate measure also recommends funding for the hiring of 2,500 new air traffic controllers.

These initiatives are consistent with the aims of the Modern Skies Coalition, a group of more than 50 international industry stakeholders, including NBAA, supporting a comprehensive upgrade of the nation’s ATC system that serves approximately 45,000 flights and 2.9 million passengers every day.

“We are grateful that the Senate Appropriations Committee recognized the need for swift action to approve this comprehensive funding measure that will enhance safety and reliability of ATC, in addition to many other positive steps to ensure the U.S. maintains its global leadership in aviation,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “We urge Congress to finalize passage of this important legislation.”

Bolen also thanked Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-WA), as well as Senate THUD Committee Chair Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and Ranking Member Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) for their work on the measure.

In line with the House funding bill, the Senate measure also eschews calls to privatize the nation’s ATC network. “The committee does not support any efforts to transfer the FAA’s air traffic functions to a not-for-profit, independent, private corporation,” the bill reads, adding such a system would have led to funding shortfalls, ATC layoffs and significant safety risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The committee further cited the U.S. general aviation industry’s support for 1.3 million jobs and its $339 billion contribution to annual economic output and encouraged the DOT and FAA to support workforce development and expanded trade policies. “Collectively, aviation is the second-largest manufacturing export sector and the largest positive trade balance of any manufacturing sector,” the committee added.

Other NBAA-supported priorities in the Senate bill include recommendations for increased funding for FAA airport improvement grants and the hiring of 91 new agency safety inspectors and engineers; expansion of alternative fuels research and production of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF; and the safe implementation of expanded unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and commercial advanced air mobility (AAM) operations.

The committee also expressed support for the development of next-generation radar altimeters resistant to interference from high-strength 5G wireless communications, while also calling on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to work with the FAA on an interagency working group to identify potential spectrum impacts on aviation safety systems.

Lawmakers also called upon the FAA to look toward expanding implementation of safety management systems (SMS) to Part 145 repair facilities, parts manufacturing approval holders and supplemental type certificate holders, among other aviation operations.

Any surplus funds should be used to install radar systems in Class D airport control towers that frequently experience severe weather conditions or are located near adverse terrain, the committee added. Many of these airports are frequently used by business aviation operators.

The company, which generated revenues of $117.5 billion in the last twelve months, has maintained strong liquidity with a current ratio of 1.62. As the company continues to leverage its operational excellence and strategic positioning, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects.

Company Overview and Recent Performance

Valero Energy, with a market capitalization of approximately $44 billion as of July 2025, has established itself as a dominant player in the refining sector. The company’s Gulf Coast-centric operations and disciplined capital allocation have been key factors in its success.

In the second quarter of 2025, Valero exceeded expectations with a strong earnings report, addressing investor concerns and showcasing its ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions. This performance has reinforced the company’s reputation for operational excellence and efficient capital management. According to InvestingPro, ten analysts have recently revised their earnings estimates upward for the upcoming period, suggesting growing confidence in the company’s prospects. InvestingPro’s analysis indicates that VLO is currently trading below its Fair Value, presenting a potential opportunity for investors.

Refining Market Dynamics

The refining sector has experienced significant volatility in recent years, with supply and demand fluctuations impacting margins. Analysts project a robust outlook for refining economics in the latter half of 2025, driven by sustained supply/demand tightness. This environment is expected to benefit Valero, given its strategic asset positioning and operational efficiency.

Crack spreads, a key indicator of refining profitability, have shown improvement, particularly after a challenging period in late 2024. Seasonal factors and industry-wide maintenance activities have contributed to a more favorable pricing environment for refiners like Valero.

Renewable Fuels and Sustainability Initiatives

Valero has been expanding its presence in the renewable fuels market, particularly through its renewable diesel segment. This diversification strategy aligns with broader industry trends towards sustainability and lower-carbon fuel options. However, analysts note that the renewable diesel segment faces near-term pressure due to low Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing.

The company’s growing exposure to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) presents an additional avenue for growth, although this market is still in its early stages. Valero’s investments in these areas demonstrate its commitment to adapting to changing energy landscapes and regulatory environments. With a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.46 and an Altman Z-Score of 4.19, InvestingPro data shows the company maintains financial flexibility to pursue these growth initiatives while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Capital Allocation and Shareholder Returns

Valero’s disciplined approach to capital allocation has been a cornerstone of its strategy. The company targets a payout ratio of 40-50% of cash flow from operations, balancing shareholder returns with investments in growth and sustainability initiatives. Notably, VLO has maintained dividend payments for 37 consecutive years, currently offering a dividend yield of 3.18%. The company’s free cash flow yield stands at 8%, supporting its ability to maintain these shareholder returns.

For 2025, capital spending is projected at $2 billion, with $1.6 billion allocated for sustaining operations and $400 million for growth projects. This balanced approach aims to maintain Valero’s competitive edge while positioning the company for future opportunities.

Competitive Positioning

Valero’s operational excellence and cost leadership have allowed it to capture above-average margins across market cycles. The company’s advantaged feedstocks, export market access, and relatively lower regulatory burdens compared to peers contribute to its strong competitive position.

Analysts view Valero as one of the best-positioned refiners in the industry, citing its ability to navigate macroeconomic challenges and capitalize on market opportunities. The company’s focus on operational efficiency and strategic investments is expected to support its performance in the face of long-term industry headwinds.

Bear Case

How might declining petroleum product demand impact VLO’s long-term prospects?

The refining industry faces long-term challenges from the gradual shift towards alternative energy sources and improved vehicle efficiency. As global efforts to reduce carbon emissions intensify, demand for traditional petroleum products may decline, potentially impacting Valero’s core business.

Analysts note that consensus estimates for 2026 may be overly optimistic, with potential downside risks due to these structural changes in energy consumption. Valero will need to continue adapting its business model and expanding its renewable fuel offerings to mitigate the impact of declining traditional fuel demand.

What risks does VLO face from potential regulatory changes in the refining sector?

The refining industry is subject to stringent environmental regulations, which can significantly impact operational costs and profitability. Future regulatory changes, particularly those aimed at reducing emissions or promoting alternative fuels, could pose challenges for Valero.

While the company benefits from its Gulf Coast operations, which face fewer regulatory hurdles compared to other regions, any tightening of federal or state-level environmental policies could necessitate additional investments in compliance measures. This regulatory risk remains a key consideration for Valero’s long-term strategy and financial planning.

Bull Case

How does VLO’s operational excellence position it to capture above-average margins?

Valero’s track record of operational efficiency and cost leadership has been a key driver of its success. The company’s ability to optimize its refining processes and capture advantaged feedstocks allows it to maintain profitability even in challenging market conditions.

Analysts highlight Valero’s consistent execution and disciplined approach to operations as factors that enable the company to outperform peers in terms of margin capture. This operational excellence provides a buffer against market volatility and positions Valero to capitalize on favorable market conditions when they arise.

What growth opportunities exist for VLO in renewable fuels and sustainable aviation fuel?

Valero’s investments in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) represent significant growth opportunities. As global demand for lower-carbon fuels increases, driven by both regulatory requirements and consumer preferences, Valero’s early mover advantage in these sectors could prove valuable.

The company’s existing infrastructure and expertise in fuel production and distribution provide a strong foundation for expanding its renewable fuel offerings. While near-term challenges exist due to pricing pressures, the long-term potential for growth in these segments aligns well with broader energy transition trends.

Upgrades to the facility not only allow for improved production capabilities but also create a new avenue for soybean oil through co-processing technology.

The processing upgrades were celebrated at a ribbon cutting ceremony in July, where the CountryMark team and top Indiana ag leaders gathered to highlight the wins this will have for Indiana farmers.

Background on renewable fuel

“Renewable fuel” seems to be a catch-all phrase — at least, that is what I’ve noticed during my travels and conversations. But the truth is that these updated processing pathways create new market opportunities for farmers while supporting sustainability goals. In the case of this CountryMark expansion, new technology will allow for production of renewable diesel fuel.

Soybean oil is combined with conventional diesel to make co-processed renewable diesel fuel. Differing from biodiesel, this fuel offers more desirable characteristics, according to CountryMark President and CEO Matt Smorch.

“It is important to understand that renewable diesel differs from biodiesel in several ways,” Smorch says. “Renewable diesel meets ASTM D975 diesel specifications, is stable in long-term storage and has a low cloud point, while biodiesel does not have those characteristics.”

This expansion could mark a turning point in the renewable fuels industry, which may prove benefits to Indiana farmers. Using renewable feedstocks, the renewable diesel fuel produced at this facility alone will drive demand for up to 20 million gallons of soybean oil each year.

“This is a multi-win for farmers,” says Don Lamb, director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture. “The farmers will benefit from the sale of the product from the farmer-owned cooperative, and they will have another purchaser in CountryMark.”

Next steps

While this expansion is a huge stride in the renewables space, there is still work to be done. It will take more refinery expansions and upgrades to match the growing output from Indiana and U.S. farmers, but this new market opportunity is a step in the right direction.

Looking ahead, another area that will need to stay top of mind is sustainable aviation fuel. And it will be important to keep these opportunities close to home.

“One area we could grow in would be within sustainable aviation fuel and encouraging the development of that technology,” Lamb adds. “We need to look for the companies who are already in Indiana and making these types of products and encourage them to create new products to increase demand for farmers and ROI for their business.”

Not only is this expansion a good move for farmers, but it also will offer a new avenue to match the need for sustainable solutions. Rather than putting that burden on the next generation, CountryMark is taking the initiative now to bring these solutions to Indiana, where both local farmers and consumers can reap the benefits.

This move comes after the company made history in 2023 by becoming the first in South Korea to export Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Europe, reports Maeil Business Newspaper.

According to the oil refining industry on July 27, SK Energy shipped approximately 6,000 tons of HVO from its Ulsan refinery to Europe in early June. The shipment is expected to arrive in mid-August. This marks the company’s first HVO export this year and second overall, after exporting around 5,000 tons in December 2023.

HVO is a cleaner alternative to conventional diesel, produced by processing vegetable-based materials such as used cooking oil with hydrogen. It serves as a direct replacement for diesel in vehicles like trucks, buses, and passenger cars, and can be used without modifying existing engines. Compared to earlier forms of biodiesel, HVO can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%.

Demand for HVO in Europe is growing rapidly, driven by the European Union’s stricter rules on fuel composition and carbon emissions. Under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED), member countries must ensure that at least 29% of fuel used in transport is renewable by 2030.

Reflecting this increased demand, HVO prices in Europe recently hit a seven-month high. On June 20, prices rose to $2,216 per ton, according to industry data. An industry official said, “Europe is placing more value on eco-friendly fuels like HVO due to tighter carbon regulations. By 2026, Europe’s HVO consumption is expected to reach its highest levels yet.”

SK Energy is positioning both HVO and SAF as central to its strategy for entering the low-carbon transportation fuel market. These fuels are seen as essential to reducing reliance on fossil fuels, especially as the EU steps up its clean energy goals.

Earlier this year, SK Energy completed its first export of SAF to Europe after beginning mass production at its Ulsan refinery in 2024.

Qualifying international approved projects would have to implement solid traceability standards capturing material flows and the role of waste workers.

An EPR-funded global scheme would work in tandem with other plastics-related treaty mechanisms and private initiatives.

The international community is negotiating a new UN Plastics Treaty to end plastic pollution, with the sixth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee session scheduled for August. A central piece of the treaty is Article 11, financial provisions that are meant to arrange how developed countries will provide financial resources, capacity-building and technology transfer to developing countries.

The stakes are high: Without adequate financing, many low-income countries simply cannot develop the waste infrastructure needed to stem plastic leakage. Yet, reaching consensus on a funding mechanism has proven difficult, and there is a real risk that finalizing the details could be pushed off to future Conferences of the Parties after the treaty is signed. Such delays would be costly.

Every year of inaction means millions more tons of plastic flowing into communities and ecosystems. The treaty’s success, therefore, hinges on finding creative ways to bridge the funding gap now, even as the formal mechanisms are still being negotiated.

Leveraging extended producer responsibility

One immediately available solution is to tap into the resources generated by Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes in high-income countries. EPR programmes make producers (e.g. brands and manufacturers) financially responsible for the post-consumer waste their products generate, often through fees or tradeable credits that fund recycling and waste management. Dozens of countries have EPR systems, from long-standing systems in Germany and Japan to newer laws in South Africa and the Philippines, usually focused on packaging and single-use plastics.

The United Kingdom’s Packaging Recovery Note and Export Note (PRN, PERN) system offers a compelling example of the scale of funding available. In the UK, producers must purchase PRNs (tradeable certificates) for every ton of plastic packaging they put on the market to meet recycling targets. In 2024 alone, the value of plastic PRNs bought by brands was around £338 million, according to the National Packaging Waste Database.

EPR fees are essentially private-sector money already being spent on compliance with recycling obligations. We propose channelling 10% of the value of these EPR credits into a dedicated fund for certified plastic waste management projects in emerging countries. In the UK’s case, such an allocation would equate to roughly £33-34 million per year directed to emerging economies’ waste infrastructure.

Importantly, this mechanism could be replicated across multiple high-income nations. France, Belgium, the Netherlands and others are piloting similar packaging EPR certificate systems. Were each group to allocate 10% of their EPR revenues to the Global South, the resulting multiplier effect would be evident.

Crucially, this idea does not require waiting for new tax legislation or the creation of a formal UN fund (which could take years). Governments can act in partnership with industry to earmark a share of existing EPR fees or credits for overseas projects. By doing so, developed nations and global brands can demonstrate their commitment to treaty goals now, jump-starting progress, instead of stalling until a complex multilateral fund is operational. It’s a proactive step that complements the treaty process.

Integrity and impact in emerging countries

Any mechanism directing funds to emerging countries must ensure the money is used effectively and transparently. Fortunately, we can draw on proven models from international climate finance. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol showed how high-income countries could invest in emissions-reducing projects in emerging nations and count the resulting credits toward their own targets.

Similarly, under a plastics-focused scheme, countries contributing a slice of EPR funds abroad could potentially count those gains (e.g. tons of waste collected and managed and/or recycled) toward their national action plans under the new treaty.

A common question is: How do we ensure that producers actually contribute and that the money reaches the communities and workers who need it most? First, governments can enforce a mandatory allocation into approved international projects, just as they currently require PERNs (Plastic Export Recycling Notes) or equivalent certificates. This makes the contribution non-optional, while still leveraging familiar systems.

To become an approved international project, traceability should be a mandatory requirement, introduced through a phased approach that supports projects in adopting it over time. Scalable technologies already exist to generate a robust digital trail from the point of plastic collection, capturing not only material flows but also the role of waste workers.

Traceability must include both material and social data to ensure accountability at every level. While a global data standard combining both does not yet exist, it is not a barrier to action. Adapting national EPR policy – focusing on pollution control in emerging economies – would rather catalyze the generation of a global data standard.

A number of organizations are already advancing this space, and the World Economic Forum’s circular innovation initiative is actively convening these efforts. Additionally, independent third-party certification, such as Verra’s Plastic Waste Reduction Standard and Zero Plastic Oceans Social Plus standard, can further ensure that only credible, results-based projects qualify for funding.

Finally, transparency can be enhanced through public registries and regular reporting by fund administrators. Projects would be required to publish annual impact reports, including how much waste was managed, how many workers were employed, and how funds were distributed.

Joining forces against plastic pollution

It’s worth emphasizing that an EPR-funded global mechanism would not exist in isolation. It complements other financial solutions under discussion and in practice. For example, the treaty negotiations can consider a “plastic polymer levy” – essentially a small fee on the production of new (virgin) plastic resin. This fee would be collected upstream from polymer producers, while EPR fees are collected downstream from product manufacturers and retailers, making the two tools naturally synergistic.

Additionally, our proposed mechanism would amplify and scale voluntary private-sector investments already underway. In recent years, alliances of companies and investors have begun dedicating funds to fill critical gaps, from corporate pledges to eliminate plastic leakage, to impact investors backing recycling start-ups.

However, these voluntary efforts, while important, remain far below what’s needed. By contrast, leveraging a fraction of mandatory EPR payments provides a sustained, significant funding stream, driven by regulation but implemented in partnership with industry. It can co-exist with other innovative financing approaches, such as the World Bank’s outcome bond, or venture funds for circular economy infrastructure. Such efforts would build a financing ecosystem where public, private and blended capital reinforce each other and decrease the risk together.

The upcoming UN negotiations offer a pivotal chance to move this idea from proposal to reality. While delegates hash out the details of Article 11’s official funding mechanism – a process that could stretch on even after the treaty’s text is agreed – they should also embrace parallel solutions that can start delivering impact immediately.

What is the World Economic Forum doing about plastic pollution?

The world produces over 430 million tonnes of plastic each year, with 19 million tonnes leaking into the environment annually. Plastic pollution fuels climate change, biodiversity loss and ocean degradation, threatening ecosystems, public health and livelihoods.

With plastic waste projected to rise dramatically by 2040, the stakes couldn’t be higher.

Since its launch in 2018, the World Economic Forum’s Global Plastic Action Partnership (GPAP) has brought together governments, businesses, and civil society to combat plastic pollution and advance a circular economy for plastics. By informing multilateral efforts at the global level and building national partnerships, GPAP translates commitments into action for a sustainable, inclusive future free from plastic pollution.

GPAP has forged partnerships with 25 countries across Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia, making it the world’s largest initiative tackling plastic pollution.

To date, GPAP has:

Driven change for over 1.5 billion people worldwide.

Mobilized $3.17 billion to combat plastic pollution.

Improved livelihoods for 12,000 informal waste workers.

Published 10 evidence-based action roadmaps on financing, biodiversity and gender equality and social inclusion.

Amid rising expectations from regulators, customers, and investors alike, the sector is under growing pressure to develop credible environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks—not as an afterthought, but as core infrastructure for trade competitiveness.

This urgency was brought into sharp focus during the Air Cargo Forum India (ACFI) Annual Conclave 2025 in a pivotal session titled “Green Corridors and Sustainable Trade Lanes – Airfreight’s ESG Imperative.” The panel, comprising airport operators, freight integrators, ground handlers, and global policy voices, explored the complex path towards a decarbonised cargo supply chain—and the institutional gaps that remain.

Gateways to market access

Sustainability, once a reputational bonus, is now becoming a gatekeeping condition for trade access—particularly with Europe and North America. The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), which from 2024 covers all intra-European flights, and ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), entering its first mandatory phase in 2027, will increase compliance pressure on cargo operators from non-OECD countries, including India.

“The decarbonisation of airfreight is not just about climate—it’s about staying eligible for trade,” said Glyn Hughes, Director General of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA). “If India’s airfreight industry cannot report, reduce, and verify emissions in line with international standards, its access to premium trade lanes will diminish.”

Hughes urged the Indian government and private sector stakeholders to accelerate alignment with global reporting protocols and carbon offsetting schemes. Inaction, he warned, would amount to regulatory non-alignment—effectively creating trade barriers.

From infrastructure to climate enablers

Kadhir Kadhiravan, Deputy CEO of GMR Hyderabad Airport, highlighted the evolving role of airports as environmental intermediaries. “We are no longer just physical infrastructure—we are climate infrastructure,” he said.

Hyderabad Airport, widely recognised for its early green investments, has reduced emissions at its cargo terminal by 17 percent since 2022. This was achieved through the electrification of ground support equipment (GSE), increased solar capacity, and energy-efficient cooling systems. Yet Kadhiravan cautioned against premature celebration. “We have built the pilot projects, but scaling this across India’s cargo airports requires standardisation, policy support, and investment in SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] infrastructure.”

Notably, India’s SAF availability remains negligible. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India produced under 50,000 tonnes of alternative aviation fuels in 2023, compared to the EU’s 1.5 million tonnes.

The sector’s emissions blind spot

While aircraft emissions attract the most regulatory scrutiny, emissions from ground operations remain largely unregulated—despite accounting for up to 30 percent of airport-related emissions, according to industry estimates.

“Handling operations are often the ‘invisible carbon’ in air logistics,” noted Anupama Kachhap, Head of Commercials at Worldwide Flight Services (WFS). “But if we are serious about ESG, they can no longer remain a blind spot.”

WFS data suggests that electrified ground handling equipment can reduce on-site emissions by 40 percent. Yet India’s adoption remains below 15 percent, mainly due to fragmented ownership models and limited access to capital.

Solar jet is a type of synthetic crude oil produced using solar energy. Synhelion, a Swiss-based clean tech startup, describes the process of making solar jet fuel as a combination of affordable feedstock, cheap renewable energy, and cost-effective thermal storage.

Synhelion has benefited from support from Swiss (Swiss International Airlines) since 2020. That is when Swiss became a strategic partner. Two years later, it turned into an investor. Five years after their collaboration began, Swiss and Synhelion were able to demonstrate the use of solar fuel in civil aviation for the first time. It was a premiere for the entire aviation industry.

Although both players are based in Switzerland, the solar fuel was delivered and used in Germany. That's because it was used as part of the fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. First, Synhelion delivered a barrel of its synthetic crude oil to a refinery in Northern Germany. Here, the oil was processed and turned into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel.

The crude oil used for this industry trailblazing delivery was manufactured at Synhelion's DAWN facility, using proprietary thermal energy storage system.

For the next phase, this processed fuel was integrated into the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport, from which it was then used for Swiss flight operations. It wasn't something big, like an entire flight powered by solar fuel, but it was a first step and a symbolic start.

This first use of solar fuel wasn't about quantity, but about getting the ball rolling. Synhelion only delivered a 190-liter (50 gallons) barrel of crude oil, and the resulting jet fuel represented only around seven percent of the total fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. The goal was to confirm that this alternative fuel can be successfully used to power airplanes via a seamless logistical process.

Could solar fuel become as popular as SAF currently is? Perhaps, but there's still a long way to go. The production infrastructure required for commercial levels is still in its infancy, and availability is poor. Synhelion has full support from the Swiss, which enables it to move down the certification and scaling-up ladder faster.

Synhelion is now looking to secure the sustainability certification for both its fuel and production process, according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/solar-jet-fuel-used-for-the-first-time-in-civil-aviation-255043_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:56:09.746066

This includes producers, airlines, airports, and investors from across the globe.

In this Q&A, we speak to Michael Nau, Director of Sales and Sustainability at Lufthansa, who is leading the cost reduction programme for Lufthansa worldwide for sales.

Is it fair to say that aviation’s right to grow is predicated on its ability to grow sustainably?

It's a good question. It depends on the geographical region. In Europe, I would agree with that, because of the mandated programme by the EU, also by the UK, and because some European countries are supporting it with incentives.

In Europe, sustainability is important. Crucially, customers want it, otherwise flight shaming is a risk. And corporate travellers especially want it. B2B travellers need greener tickets with less CO2 emissions because their companies have CO2 reduction targets.

For other parts of the globe, I have my doubts. I mean when you see what's going on in the US right now, it's one step back. Drill, baby, drill. The airlines will grow because kerosene will be cheaper. We’ll see lower ticket prices and increased demand. But is it sustainable growth? No.

In Asia Pacific, sustainability is picking up. Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese companies are buying SAF from us. So Asia Pacific is slightly lagging Europe, but they're on track.

Across the MENA region, I’m seeing a big change. I can see the commitment now from local players. They’re taking it seriously. They’ve realised they have to do something for their reputation to show it matters – and that this is the future.

So, it varies. And it makes sense that Europe would be leading the way. But if European Airlines are having to pay more and ticket prices go up, then passengers will just choose to travel with other airlines who aren't subject to those mandates.

What is the boardroom appetite to embrace SAF?

For the past two years, we’ve had an executive board member responsible for sustainability. And it shows. Sustainability is now in our DNA. All our higher management have it linked to their bonus. And all our key account managers – 720 worldwide – must discuss sustainability in every single customer meeting.

We have five strategic priories. One of those is sustainability. And one pillar of that is increasing the SAF share. In five years, by 2030, we want to be down by 50 percent on CO2 emissions compared to 2019. Every year we must lower it. And that is linked to our bonus – for me as well. Sustainability has well and truly arrived. It’s not only talk.

And to achieve this reduction, [among other focus areas] 23 percent is with new airplanes, nine percent with ops/efficiency; and 19 percent with SAF. So SAF is a major pillar. It has a big focus.

Does Lufthansa have a focus on a specific SAF technology or pathway?

We’re focusing mainly on HEFA, SAF made from used cooking oil. Why? Because of the price – around 2.5x higher than fossil kerosene. We know that HEFA is not the best or the cleanest SAF, but it’s the only that is currently payable for our customers.

From 2030 on, we will look to switch to power-to-liquid (PtL) and sun-to-liquid (StL), but at the moment these are around 50 times more expensive than fossil kerosene. We’ve discussed [adopting it sooner] with some strategic global customers, and it’s interesting because it's a one hundred percent clean hydrogen, but it's too expensive. So, we have spoken to the PtL and StL companies and told them by 2030 we need this price range. If they can do it, we’ll be in the game.

What have been the other major strategic decisions to make with regards to SAF?

We had to decide whether we wanted to be a PtL/StL producer, and whether we invest in such companies. In the end, we said ‘no’ to producing.

Why? Two reasons. First, we are not experts here. Others do it better. They have the facilities. Second, their financial power is much bigger. We would need a billion-euro level investment; that’s too risky for an airline. We can’t afford to have that level of investment if it turns out to be a mistake. Our expertise is flying from A to B, and it’s better to be focused on that.

What are the major barriers to scaling SAF?

Cost is the number one. In central Europe, the willingness to pay more for a flight with SAF is there if the ticket, compared to a normal ticket without SAF, isn’t higher than ten percent – to a maximum of 15 percent, which is already a challenge.

The second challenge is sourcing SAF. Demand and supply are not in balance. One year ago we were short of SAF. We struggled to get SAF at a reasonable price on the spot market. And this is a bit of a showstopper, because there is no hedging. So you cannot plan the price.

What services or offerings are you seeing drive uptake in SAF?

We’ve developed a capability where a corporate customer can decide precisely how much SAF they want. If they want to see an 18 percent reduction in their CO2 emissions from their corporate flights in 2025, and a 21 percent reduction in 2026, we can do this in the system. Our offering is flexible to their own CO2 reduction path. It’s tailor made to each company. This product will launch in September this year. It’s really cool.

What message would you have to other airline leaders looking at SAF?

Of course, other airlines are competitors, but not on this topic. I’m happy if competitors go in the same direction. It helps the industry. We all benefit. And if they have a high demand for SAF, then producers will produce more. We don’t compete on sustainability. Our competitor Is climate change, and the time we have.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68872d525995170f17494a29/1753716836057/5.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-07-28 11:56:53.907695

In a moment marking the end of an era in aerospace testing, Rolls-Royce has officially retired its legendary Boeing 747-200 engine testbed, N787RR..

Stationed at Tucson International Airport, the aircraft concluded nearly two decades of ground-breaking flight trials, leaving behind a legacy that has shaped the evolution of modern jet propulsion.

From testing cutting-edge business jet engines to flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel, N787RR became a workhorse of engineering advancement and a symbol of ingenuity in aviation research.

Spotter Magazine reported that the Rolls-Royce Boeing 747-200 retired on 9 June, operating one final flight before being sent to Pinal Airpark, just down the road from its home in Tucson.

N787RR: A brief history of the Rolls-Royce Boeing 747-200

Originally delivered to Cathay Pacific in 1980 as VR-HIA, the aircraft went on to serve with Air Atlanta Icelandic before its transformation by Rolls-Royce began in June 2005.

Re-registered as N787RR, the Boeing 747-200 was meticulously refitted into a state-of-the-art flying laboratory.

Stripped of passenger seating, the aircraft was equipped with high-tech instrumentation, recording systems, and a distinctive five-engine mounting configuration, allowing it to safely carry and test experimental engines in real-time flight conditions.

Its robust four-engine design made it the ideal platform, enabling engineers to evaluate new powerplants without compromising safety.

“Our FTB is a great asset to us; it is part of a wide range of test capabilities that help us ensure our engines do everything we say they will,” says Deborah Robinson, Director Test and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce.

“Computers and rig tests can achieve a lot; however, in the air, we can take it a step further and perform a wide range of tests to further confirm the results of our extensive ground and rig test programmes. We can take the opportunity to test the corners of the flight envelope and feed back into our extensive models.”

Despite these impressive achievements, age eventually caught up with the aircraft. Approaching 45 years of service, N787RR faced mounting maintenance and operational costs. With an average of 25 test flights per year, each sortie required increasing logistical support to maintain airworthiness.

Plans for a new Rolls-Royce Boeing 747 were scrapped

Rolls-Royce had once planned to replace the 747-200 with a newer 747-400 variant, registered as N747RR and acquired from Qantas in 2019. But that project was ultimately shelved in 2022 due to the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rolls-Royce invested £56 million ($94 million) in the acquisition and refurbishment of the aircraft. This is in addition to a £90 million investment in Testbed 80 in Derby, described by the company as “the largest and most intelligent testbed in the world.”

The 747-400 in question, once known as VH-OJU “Lord Howe Island,” had served Qantas for two decades, carrying 2.5 million passengers across more than 70 million kilometres. Upon retirement from commercial service, it was flown to AeroTEC’s flight test centre in Moses Lake, Washington, to begin a two-year conversion into a next-generation flying testbed.

“This is a significant investment that will expand our world-leading test capabilities,” Gareth Hedicker, Director of Development and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce, said at the time.

However, as Rolls-Royce struggled to navigate the COVID downturn, the new testbed was deemed surplus to requirements.

Rolls-Royce moves to ground-based testing

In the wake of N787RR’s retirement, Rolls-Royce is pivoting towards ground-based testing and new aviation frontiers.

With the ongoing development of its UltraFan demonstrator, ALECSys lean-burn engine, and research into hydrogen-compatible propulsion systems, the future of engine testing may increasingly rely on digital modelling and advanced ground rigs like Testbed 80 in Derby.

Nonetheless, the gap left by N787RR will not be easily filled. It provided unmatched flexibility, accommodating everything from widebody Trent engines to business jet powerplants on a single adaptable platform.

The 747-200 bridged generations of engine technology, offering critical insights from Trent to Pearl and laying the groundwork for what comes next. It showed the aviation world that with the right vision and platform, even a decades-old airframe could remain at the cutting edge of aerospace advancement.

With its retirement, Rolls-Royce bids farewell to a “magnificent multi-tasker of the skies”, an aircraft that redefined what flying laboratories could achieve. Its legacy now fuels the next wave of cleaner, more efficient engines poised to power the aircraft of tomorrow.

UK names SAF and e-SAF projects to share £63mn funding

London, 22 July (Argus) — The UK government has named 17 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels projects to share £63mn ($85mn) grant funding in the third round of its advanced fuels fund (AFF). The projects range in size from trials to commercial scale, and propose to use technologies incuding alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) or synthesis of CO2 and renewable hydrogen to make e-SAF ( see table ). The UK gave the largest sum, £10mn, to US firm LanzaJet for its 80,000 t/yr SAF plant targeting 2028 start, which will exclusively supply to British Airways. London granted £8mn to Riyadh-headquartered Alfanar for its Lighthouse Green Fuels project that aims to make more than 125,000 t/yr of SAF. Alfanar won £11mn and £8.7mn in the first and second rounds, respectively. Its start date has slipped to 2029 and costs have risen to £2bn from £1.5bn, the firm said last month. Some projects could make SAF and e-SAF, such as Essar's project at Stanlow, which aims to use a combined 550,000 t/yr of e-methanol and biomethanol to make 200,000 t/yr of SAF products. It will use the funds for a pre-front-end engineering design (Feed) study and it plans a final investment decision in 2027, it said. Nine grant winners will make at least some proportion of e-SAF, either directly from hydrogen or by converting e-methanol. This route is sometimes called power-to-liquid in the UK. Of the e-SAF projects, the largest award went to UK start-up Carbon Neutral Fuels, which won £6mn for a project that aims to make 25,000 t/yr of e-SAF starting from 2031. The firm is starting Feed for the plant, it said. The UK has now granted nearly £200mn to projects through the AFF scheme, with the third round building on the £80mn first round and £53mn second round . The third-round grants can go towards engineering, procurement and construction, Feed studies, and pre-feed studies, but not to feasibility studies. The UK is separately developing a revenue certainty subsidy scheme for novel SAF and e-SAF production. At least one UK-focused SAF project could stall having missed out on funding. The Gramm Consortium is considering ""last-minute options"" to keep a proposed 250,000 t/yr SAF plant in the UK and may re-locate to the US, the project's lead Alexander Peschkoff said. With an increasing number of world governments setting SAF quotas, pressure is mounting to add more production pathways to avoid shortages. The UK and EU have gone furthest in this respect by adding separate e-SAF quotas to spur novel production routes. But there is much uncertainty about the best technologies to use. The UK is fast approaching the 2028 start for its e-SAF quota, while the EU's is due to start in 2030.

Vivergo outlines hopes for UK bioethanol plant rescue

London, 21 July (Argus) — UK bioethanol producer Vivergo is proceeding with plans to close its 416mn litres/yr Saltend plant in eastern England, but has outlined ways the government could prevent this. Vivergo has said deliveries of wheat will cease at the end of July, and redundancies will begin in August, ahead of closure in September . It already said it had stopped buying wheat in June . The decision to close was made by Vivergo's parent company, food and ingredients group Associated British Foods (ABF), after a US-UK trade deal agreed in May that allowed duty-free imports of up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol. ABF confirmed at the end of June that it was in talks with the government, but no timeline has been put on the process. The first stage of the talks was for UK producers, like Vivergo and Ensus, operator of the 400mn l/yr Wilton bioethanol refinery in northeast England, to submit their strategic business cases. Ensus has said it could close Wilton. Covering costs Vivergo told Argus it wants the government to cover losses of £3mn/month, or £35mn/yr, which it said have been incurred as a result of government decisions. Previously, ABF proposed a support package of £75mn/yr , for up to two years, for the entire UK sector. In the longer-term, Vivergo said there is appetite from private investors to finance future projects. It pointed to a recent initial agreement to supply ethanol for a prospective alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant planned by hydrogen developer Meld Energy at Saltend. Meld told Argus that while the project will be ""underpinned by government support mechanisms"", the ""longer term plan is to eventually eliminate reliance on subsidy through reducing cost of production which will likely be through scale, efficiency and technology advancement"". Meld chief executive Chris Smith also told Argus that sourcing bioethanol directly from Vivergo helped ""risk management"". He said locally-produced bioethanol brings ""greater certainty of supply"" and ""reduces local infrastructure requirements."" Vivergo said failure to support the bioethanol sector would be ""shortsighted"", because in order to meet projected increases in UK SAF demand by 2035 the country would need ""seven more Vivergos"", or a more than 3.5 times increase in domestic bioethanol production. Regulation frustration Vivergo said another key way for the government to help is to tackle the eligibility of unrefined liquid dextrose ultrafiltration retentate (Uldur) for double counting under the UK's renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). Uldur, which is classfied in the UK as a waste ethanol feedstock, makes up a significant share of the total import pool from the US. Biofuels made from certain raw materials classed as ""wastes"" and ""residues"" under the RTFO receive double the amount of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) for every litre of fuel produced. RTFCs are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet the RTFO mandate. Vivergo says Uldur-derived ethanol is a co-product of the wet milling process rather than waste, and its eligibility for double counting is inconsistent with the RTFO's decarbonisation aims. It said producers using Uldur are able to make double-counting bioethanol using a more carbon-intensive production process than the fermentation of wheat, yet crop-based ethanol produced by Vivergo is ineligible for double counting. Vivergo said producers of double counting product get an additional certificate worth around £260/t, meaning it is unable compete with the low prices of Uldur-based bioethanol importers from the US. And these will now be able to enter the UK duty free under the new US-UK trade deal. The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting. Other changes proposed by Vivergo include increasing the ethanol mandate in road fuel, from E10 to E15 or E20. Vivergo previously said an E15 mandate could boost demand in the UK by 660mn l/yr. It also highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors. Capturing the moment Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said. The company said it is 6-9 months away from having carbon capture facilities ready, at which point it would be capable of meeting around a third of the UK's 600,000 t/yr CO2 demand. Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England. Vivergo said losing this would mean increased CO2 imports, and noted its output of high-protein animal feed as a co-product of wheat-to-ethanol production, which agricultural firms would otherwise have to import at a higher environmental cost. The National Farmers Union has previously said that losing the UK bioethanol industry would be a ""huge blow"", as it currently has the ""capacity to purchase around 2mn t of wheat each year"", so without it ""farmers would lose a reliable market for their feed wheat.""

ICJ opinion could open door for more climate litigation

ICJ opinion could open door for more climate litigation

London, 28 July (Argus) — A landmark outcome from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 23 July found that countries have an obligation to contribute to cutting emissions, and wealthy, industrialised nations should take the lead on tackling climate change. The court left the door open for further climate litigation, finding that breaching these obligations constitutes a ""wrongful act"" for which ""injured states"" could claim restitution and compensation. The ICJ's advisory opinions are not legally binding but carry significant weight and may contribute to the development of international law, non-profit the Centre for International Environmental Law says. International climate treaties — such as the 2015 Paris Agreement — ""establish stringent obligations upon states to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions"", the ICJ said. Countries ""must fulfil their duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence"", the ICJ said. It noted the discretion built into UN climate body the UNFCCC for nations to determine the means by which they cut emissions. But it was clear that ""this discretion cannot serve as an excuse for states to refrain from co-operating with the required level of due diligence or to present their effort as an entirely voluntary contribution which cannot be subjected to scrutiny"". The court found that countries party to the Paris Agreement have an obligation to present national climate plans that align with its primary temperature goal of limiting the global rise to 1.5°C from a pre-industrial baseline. The ICJ also focused on the primary cause of GHG emissions — burning fossil fuels. ""Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act... attributable to that state"", it found. ""Where several states are responsible for the same internationally wrongful act, the responsibility of each state may be invoked,"" it said. Definitive legal guidance The ICJ's opinion ""will equip judges with definitive guidance that will likely shape climate cases for decades to come"", environmental organisation ClientEarth lawyer Lea Main-Klingst previously told Argus . Existing pathways could allow countries to take legal action against other nations, ""and no changes to international law are needed for it to happen"", CIEL climate and energy programme director Nikki Reisch tells Argus . Individual states could vary in how they interpret the court's findings, but the opinion was comprehensive and punctured arguments often used to push back on more stringent climate action. The ICJ noted that ""it is scientifically possible to determine each state's total contribution to global emissions, taking into account both historical and current emissions"", and that states could be found responsible if they do not regulate emissions caused by ""private actors"" under their jurisdictions. Climate litigation has risen steadily in recent years and cases including those challenging fossil fuel projects are ""more often reaching the highest courts around the world"", researchers at the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute say. And the damage caused by climate change is growing, increasing the pressure to define legal parameters and responsibilities. The ICJ proceedings hit several milestones. The issue drew the highest level of participation in a proceeding seen by the ICJ or its predecessor. And the court adopted the advisory opinion unanimously — just the fifth time in its 80-year history that this has happened. But it made the point that international law is just one tool in the fight against climate change. The proceedings ""concern an existential problem of planetary proportions"", the ICJ said. ""International law… has an important but ultimately limited role in resolving this problem"".

As the global energy transition accelerates, Plug Power is positioning itself as a key player in the hydrogen value chain with a combination of strategic partnerships, operational progress, and strong insider confidence. This article will analyze how insider sentiment and operational momentum are creating compelling investment opportunities in the green hydrogen space.

Insider Confidence as a Leading Indicator

Plug Power's CFO, Paul Middleton, has demonstrated extraordinary confidence in the company's future by purchasing a total of 1 million shares in Q2 2025. His most recent purchase of 650,000 shares at an average price of $1.0339 represents a 34.07% increase in his position. This level of insider buying is not merely a financial transaction - it's a strong signal of conviction in the company's long-term strategy and value creation potential.

Middleton's purchases are particularly significant given the current market environment. Plug Power's stock price has surged nearly 25% in Q2 2025, but the company still trades at a substantial discount to its intrinsic value. The insider's actions suggest that key stakeholders believe the market is underestimating the company's potential in the green hydrogen revolution.

Operational Momentum in the Green Hydrogen Value Chain

Plug Power is executing a bold strategy to vertically integrate its green hydrogen operations. The company's Woodbine, Georgia plant set a new benchmark in April 2025 by producing 300 metric tons of liquid hydrogen - a significant achievement that demonstrates the scalability of its production capabilities. With total internal production capacity now at 40 tons per day across three active plants in Louisiana, Georgia, and Tennessee, Plug Power is making progress toward its goal of reducing reliance on third-party hydrogen suppliers.

The company's strategic partnerships are further reinforcing this momentum. The landmark $5.5 billion project with Allied Green Ammonia in Uzbekistan, involving 2 gigawatts of PEM electrolyzers, represents a major expansion of Plug Power's global footprint. This follows an earlier partnership with Allied Green Ammonia for 3 gigawatts of electrolyzers in Australia. These projects position Plug Power as a key supplier of clean hydrogen for the production of sustainable aviation fuel, green urea, and green diesel.

Policy Tailwinds and Financial Strength

Plug Power is benefiting from a favorable policy environment. The passage of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (OBBB) Act has extended critical tax incentives through 2032, including the 30% fuel cell tax credit and green hydrogen tax credit. These incentives remove restrictive conditions that previously limited the company's flexibility.

Financially, Plug Power has secured a $1.66 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy, which underwrites its production network and mitigates investment risk. The company has also implemented ""Project Quantum Leap,"" a $200 million annualized cost-cutting initiative that has reduced cash burn by nearly 50% year-over-year. With $300 million in unrestricted cash on hand, Plug Power has the financial flexibility to continue its growth trajectory.

Strategic Partnerships Validating the Business Model

One of the most significant developments in Q2 2025 was the expanded partnership with Uline, a major North American logistics company. This multi-year agreement through 2030 includes a guaranteed offtake of up to 15 tons per day of liquid green hydrogen and the deployment of Plug Power's complete fuel cell ecosystem at up to 10 additional Uline distribution centers. This partnership not only provides long-term revenue visibility but also validates Plug Power's vertical integration strategy.

Investment Considerations

While Plug Power still faces challenges, including the need to achieve break-even gross margins by the end of 2025, the company's recent progress suggests it is on a path to profitability. The combination of insider confidence, operational execution, and strategic partnerships creates a compelling investment case.

Analysts remain divided, with 23 analysts covering the stock, including five ""Strong Buy"" ratings, 13 ""Hold"" ratings, and five ""Strong Sell"" ratings. The average 12-month price target of $1.32 implies approximately 26% downside from the current price of $1.79, but this appears to be a conservative estimate given the company's recent momentum.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-28 09:56:20.369113

The £5m purchase of the Hythe occurred during the first quarter of this financial year, according to a report to the Wirral Council’s policy and resources committee.

Peel L&P, now known as Peel Waters, and Wirral Council had entered into an agreement in September 2020 to help derisk the delivery of the 33,500 sq ft office block – viewed as a key part of the Wirral Waters regeneration plan. Peel had told the council it was worried the project would be unviable without this risk assurance – even with a £3m grant from Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

Under the terms of the deal, the council was obligated to spend £5m to purchase a 250-year lease on the property should the value of the scheme be below £5m three years after it was constructed. Conversely, if the value of Hythe ever exceeded £5m during that time frame, the council could force Peel to sell it the office block for that same price.

Wirral Council had flagged that the lease option may be triggered by Peel in a report to its economy and regeneration committee last year. At the time, it noted that the past two evaluations of the building – which completed in 2021 – had come in at £3.9m in 2022 and £3.45m in 2023. The report noted that the value of the property, which has two of its three floors fully let, had diminished more than expected because of rising interest rates, economic pressures, and the war in Ukraine.

According to that 2024 council report, the £5m purchase was to be funded through borrowing at 5% over 50 years of £250,000 a year.

Regarding the deal, a Wirral Council spokesperson said: “Wirral Waters is one of the largest and most significant regeneration schemes not just in this region but nationally and its success is a vital element of the wider efforts to deliver new homes and promote growth and prosperity for our borough, and the development of the Hythe offices is integral to that.

“The council will do all it can to support progress across the Wirral Waters site and this agreement with Peel is another illustration of the commitment to attracting new inward investment and jobs to Wirral.”

Richard Mawdsley, director of development for Wirral Waters, pointed out the positives of the building – noting that is more than 70% let.

“Following the option agreement, Wirral Council have gained control of the BREEAM Excellent Grade A office building that cost over £7m to build and is income producing,” he said. “Rental and property values will undoubtedly grow over time as markets improve and the regeneration of the area continues. This will be accelerated if surrounding connectivity infrastructure comes forward in a timely fashion.”",https://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Hythe-internal-Wirral-Waters-p.Lindsay-Colback-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:56:58.014992

For additional information: Hitachi Energy","The deal is part of a new procurement initiative by E.ON for core grid expansion components. Hitchai Energy will utilise its footprint, investments and partnerships to reserve capacity and lead industry efforts to address the global shortage in transformers, a critical component of power grid infrastructure.

The project follows the recent German government elections, in which energy prices and reliability were a key concern among voters. More than 70 percent of Germans cited rising living costs as their main concern, with energy prices at the forefront of this worry. Electricity demand in Germany is forecast to grow rapidly from 96 TWh in 2024 to 236 TWh by 2035, driven by AI, data centres and the electrification of key industries including vehicles, heat pumps and hydrogen.

Transformers are crucial to enable the efficient transmission and distribution of electricity. There is currently a major global shortage and Hitachi Energy is executing the largest investment plan in the global industry with $9 billion to scale up manufacturing capacity across the world. Germany is integral to the programme, having recently announced the expansion of its transformer factory in Bad Honnef. The company holds deep roots in Germany, employing over 2,000 people across eight locations, including three key manufacturing sites in Bad Honnef, Brilon and Roigheim.

The Bundesnetzagentur, and other German utilities and grid operators, urgently need transformers to prevent a delay in grid connections, blocks to new routing, and threats to ambitious expansion plans designed to support clean power and electrification. As part of the framework agreement with E.ON Hitachi Energy will deliver a considerable part of the transformers by reserving manufacturing capacity to support the accelerated expansion and modernisation of the German power grid.

“The growing importance of power grids demands bold investments and breakthrough innovations to shape the energy systems of the future” said Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy. “Our expansion goes beyond business - it reflects our responsibility as a global leader to accelerate capacity and deliver the critical equipment our customers urgently need. Strategic partnerships like this one empower TSOs, utilities, and industry to build a more sustainable, secure, resilient, and affordable energy system for Germany.”

Hitachi Energy is the world leader in transformers, with over two million distribution transformers and tens of thousands of other transformers deployed worldwide. In high-voltage technology, one in every four high-voltage switchgear units in operation is from Hitachi Energy.

As the inventor and market leader in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology, Hitachi Energy has integrated more than 150 GW of capacity - enough to power two-thirds of Europe’s households. The company is also the top supplier for offshore wind grid systems, connecting over 54 GW to the grid through our centers of excellence in Germany and Sweden. Its grid automation solutions support 50 percent of the world’s top 250 utilities.

Eni's project involves the construction of new plants to produce hydrogenated biofuels at the Livorno refinery site, including a biogenic pre-treatment unit and a plant with the capacity to produce 500 000 metric tons per year of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), the company said in a news release.

Enilive, Eni’s company focused on sustainable mobility, will use its proprietary Ecofining technology to produce HVO, a biofuel made from renewable raw materials such as used cooking oil and agrifood waste, according to the release.

The Livorno biorefinery will be able to treat different types of biogenic charges, mainly waste and residues of plant origin, to produce HVO diesel, HVO naphtha and bio-LPG, Eni said, adding that it will be its third biorefinery in the region.

The conversion of the Livorno site is in line with Enilive's strategy to increase the production of biofuels in response to growing demand in Europe and Italy, in order to meet both emission reduction targets under RED III (Renewable Energy Directive) and the obligations to release pure biofuels for use as defined by Italian legislation. HVO biofuels aim to reduce transport sector emissions generated not only on roads, but also by air traffic, maritime and rail transport calculated along the entire value chain, according to the release.

Eni said there is a possibility in the future to modify the layout of the plant and have the flexibility to also produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a key element of efforts to decarbonize aviation. This gives flexibility to the investment and brings it up to speed with the environmental priorities of the European Union, broadening its potential impact, the company stated.

EIB Vice-President Gelsomina Vigliotti said, “The EIB financing is key to delivering a project of high environmental, technological and strategic value, helping to promote the decarbonization of the transport sector. This is a concrete example of how industrial innovation can accelerate the path towards climate neutrality, while generating sustainable value for regions”.

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said, “The agreement with the EIB confirms Eni’s concrete and high-quality commitment in the transition towards increasingly decarbonized energy. It also underscores the validity of our approach, which is to invest and leverage all available and effective initiatives and technologies for reducing emissions. This virtuous approach is now leading us to convert a third refinery into a biorefinery in Italy, following the examples of Venice and Gela”.

This operation is part of the energy transition at the national and European level, contributing substantially to decarbonization of the transport sector and the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. It also supports the achievement of Italy’s targets for the production of pure biofuels, which under current legislation provides for a gradual increase in use from 300,000 metric tons per year in 2023 to 1 million metric tons by 2030, according to the release.

In the most dynamic area of Riga port, Kundziņsala, construction will begin on the Baltic States' first renewable fuel production plant producing hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Trend reports citing the Ministry of Transport of Latvia.

The company Amber Flow Fuels, investing 120 million euros and creating 120 highly qualified jobs, will start innovative, high value-added production within the next few years, supporting Latvia's climate neutrality and Green Deal goals.

The transformation of Kundziņsala into the new center of Riga port involves several large industrial projects, specifically in the green energy production sector. Producing renewable energy-related products with high added value and strong demand is one of the cornerstones of Riga port's future development. At the same time, it will significantly strengthen Latvia's export capacity and energy independence.

The project is developed in cooperation with investors from Ukraine and Riga port company SIA PARS TERMINĀLS, and it is included in the list of priority investment projects by the Latvian Investment and Development Agency (LIAA). Currently, the new plant's construction plan is under approval by the Riga city municipality's Urban Development Department. Construction will start immediately after approval.

“The new plant is a step in modernizing our existing business. Together with Ukrainian partners, we will create economic independence from foreign supplies, thereby shortening logistics chains and obtaining high value-added products that are currently only imported in the Baltics. Such a factory will directly benefit both fuel traders and the aviation sector. The plant will also ensure growth for other environmental sector companies with which we plan to cooperate to provide raw materials that meet biofuel production standards,” explains Armands Sadauskis, co-owner of SIA PARS TERMINĀLS, outlining the main benefits of the new plant.

The planned factory capacity is about 236,000 tons of base raw material per year, from which 93,000 tons of HVO and 87,000 tons of SAF are expected to be produced. It is estimated that the plant in Riga port will be able to supply 100% of the SAF needed for the Baltic market. Seventy percent of the produced SAF will be exported, increasing Latvia's exports by at least 150 million euros.

Innovative technologies will be used to produce renewable fuels, allowing the creation of ecological and competitive fuel alternatives from various natural production residues, mainly recycled vegetable oils. The planned plant is the first of its kind and unique at the Baltic level.

The renewable fuel production project is also an important step to promote Latvia's energy independence and local production development, based on locally available resources. It will contribute both directly and indirectly to the local economy, improving the competitiveness of Latvian companies, considering that biofuels will be needed not only by airlines. At the same time, cooperation with Ukrainian investors will develop economically important partnerships in today's geopolitical situation, which is especially important for both Latvia and Europe.",https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-07/28/TNA_cf9a3image_story.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:56:44.687578

Why did Protix choose to focus on the black soldier fly as the feed ingredient? What are the advantages of the BSF over other novel ingredients?

At Protix, we invested a lot of time and effort into researching the best insect, and the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) emerged as our insect of choice. Insects have one big advantage over other novel proteins and alternatives such as soy: they devour waste, which is a huge problem across the world.

Other reasons to choose the black soldier fly include:

Efficient conversion: This creature excels at efficiently converting organic waste into valuable nutrients.

Highly nutritious: Black soldier flies are rich in the protein and other nutrients that are essential for animals.

Reliable yield: The black soldier fly has a very short lifecycle compared to other insects, growing from egg to adult larvae in just two weeks, which allows for a fast and stable production cycle and reliable yields.

Proven low footprint: Black soldier flies can be grown in a vertical farm and can realise a massive reduction in CO2 emissions and land and water use.

Local production: The flies can be grown close to where they are needed.

What potential do novel ingredients have to transform agriculture?

Insect ingredients have significant transformational power. They are functional ingredients, which customers can use to create feed that supports healthier and high-performing animals and plants. The agricultural markets we serve span poultry, pigs, aquafeed, and plant care. Across these sectors, our aim is to restore the natural order by bringing insects back into the food chain. This process adds nutrients that would not be available through direct consumption of the waste by livestock.

Insect ingredients also help reduce environmental impact. There is strong appetite among farmers, whether intrinsically motivated, responding to consumer demand, or meeting legislative requirements, to make products and processes more environmentally friendly. Insect ingredients have a low footprint. Research by the German Institute of Food Technologies (DIL) has shown that, compared to traditional protein sources like soy protein concentrate, Protix’s insect meal can reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 89% and significantly lower land and water use.

Finally, insect ingredients can create circular food chains with, for example, the major supermarket chains. The concept is that Protix accepts organic waste from retailers which is then fed to our flies. The insects convert this waste into valuable nutrients that are used in animal and plant feed. As fish, meat, and vegetables produced with these feeds are consumed, new organic waste is created, continuing the cycle.

What does the landscape of the insect sector look like at present and what are the key changes that need to be made?

Interest in insect ingredients is growing. We see more and more farms starting trials and reaping the benefits of insect ingredients for their animals and the planet. Increasingly, consumers are embracing insect ingredients as a tasty, nutritious option for animal feed that also shrinks the footprint. While some people are still learning about the benefits of insect ingredients, the growing scientific evidence for health claims speaks for itself.

Step by step, Protix is unlocking the full potential of insect ingredients through scientific research and further upscaling. Looking ahead, we actively welcome the opportunity to partner with forward-thinking livestock and aquaculture farmers for new on-farm trials. These trials offer farmers a chance to experience first-hand how premium insect ingredients can enhance their animals’ health and performance. Throughout each trial, the Protix scientists work closely together with the farmers, providing expert guidance and support. By collaborating in trials, new value can be unlocked for businesses, animals, and the environment.

How can government and regulatory bodies support change in the insect sector?

Government and regulatory bodies play a crucial role in accelerating progress within the insect sector. One of the most impactful ways to support growth is by permitting the use of lower-grade waste (e.g. supermarket waste streams) as feed for black soldier flies. This change would enable the sector to contribute even more effectively to sustainable waste management and circular economy goals. Another way to support the sustainable insect sector is to implement sustainability norms for feed products, in a similar manner as was done to make kerosine/air transport more sustainable (since 2025, a mandatory inclusion of 2% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Kerosine applies pursuant to the ReFuel Aviation Regulation, increasing to 70% in 2050). The same approach could be applied for feed products – making the inclusion of sustainable protein (such as insect protein) mandatory in feed products, gradually replacing unsustainable commodities such as soy protein.

Additionally, providing access to public funds (such as the Common Agricultural Policy) and other incentives, similar to those available in other farming sectors, would drive further adoption of insect-based feed and help foster innovation and upscaling to get the right volumes in the market for livestock, aquaculture, and plant feed.

Finally, governments and regulatory bodies can also play an important role in educating the public about the benefits of insect ingredients. While the use of insect ingredients is becoming increasingly mainstream, there is still work to be done to raise awareness and build trust. Government support in promoting the industry, in line with the efforts of organisations such as the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed (IPIFF), would be highly valuable.

By taking these steps, policymakers can help unlock the full potential of the insect sector, benefiting agriculture, the environment, and society as a whole.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PROT01-29782-shutterstock_Ingo-Bartussek_1599451777.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:56:51.470462

The 45Z tax credit and Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) are central to shaping the US biomass-based diesel (BBD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) markets, with significant changes impacting production economics and feedstock strategies.

New policies prioritize domestic production and feedstocks, creating challenges for foreign producers and intensifying competition for limited resources like soybean oil and used cooking oil.

The reduction of SAF tax credits and restrictions on imported feedstocks risk slowing SAF adoption and investment, particularly for alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) producers reliant on imported low-CI ethanol.

Trade policies, including tariffs and import restrictions, disrupt global supply chains, raising costs and complicating access to competitively priced feedstocks and biofuels.

Despite challenges, domestic-focused incentives and infrastructure investments offer opportunities for economic growth, energy security, and long-term renewable fuel development.

Executive summary

Biomass-based diesel (BBD), encompassing biodiesel (BD) and renewable diesel (RD), has become a crucial element of the US strategy to enhance domestic energy supply within the transportation sector. Alongside BBD, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) continues its emergence, planned as a key part of the decarbonization of transportation fuels. The federal policy landscape shapes the BBD and SAF markets, including key programs such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the Clean Fuel Producers Credit (45Z).

New legislation and rule changes will add complexity to BBD profitability adoption, specifically regarding SAF. SAF producers currently face fragmented guidance on these intertwined policies, complicating investment decisions. However, these combined federal measures will largely determine the trajectory of the US SAF market through 2030.

Federal incentives have spurred significant growth in renewable transportation fuel production. Yet, these gains come with rising competition for limited feedstocks, such as soybean oil, used cooking oil (UCO), and tallow, specifically considering the expanding SAF industry. This competition intensifies supply chain challenges and raises concerns about feedstock sustainability, energy security, and market stability.

International trade plays a critical role in this dynamic, with the US importing substantial volumes of finished renewable fuels and feedstock to meet demand. Cross-border flows influence incentive availability, feedstock accessibility, and biofuel price volatility, all driven by the pursuit of profitability.

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) legislation and the EPA RFS rule changes collide, complicating SAF adoption in the US. BBD and SAF producers navigate overlapping incentives and regulatory shifts impacting production economics and market access. Viewed separately, SAF and BBD producers receive only partial guidance needed for informed investment decisions. However, Fastmarkets believes the combination of these policies will collectively shape the US market for both SAF and BBD through the end of the decade.

Challenges surrounding low-carbon fuel alternatives

Biomass-based diesel (BBD) along with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), have emerged as viable, low-carbon alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. However, ongoing policy uncertainty combined with evolving feedstock constraints pose significant challenges to the long-term sustainability and scalability of these fuels. Additionally, rising domestic and global demand for biofuels intersects with volatile international trade markets, complicating supply chains and pricing stability.

Shifting federal policy

45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit:

The 45Z tax credit incentivizes BBD and SAF production and consumption within the US., However, the implementation of the 45Z credit in 2025 excluded imported BBD and SAF and domestic production from imported feedstocks, with exceptions for Canadian canola oil, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, and tallow. These eligible feedstocks and their pathways are detailed in the 45ZCF-GREET model released in January 2025. The OBBB changes the 45Z tax credit beginning in 2026, with three key changes to investment and production.

The first key change requires feedstocks to be sourced from the US, Canada, or Mexico in order to qualify for the 45Z credit. Limiting the feedstock to be domestic-based, producers will struggle to acquire the needed amount of low-cost and low-carbon intensity (CI) feedstock to meet profitability levels. As a result, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol has been excluded from SAF, even though announced alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) capacity is expected to reach nearly one billion gallons by 2030, with many companies indicating plans to use this feedstock. Currently, no large-scale sugarcane ethanol plants operate in the US, requiring the feedstock to be imported. Unless the policy is adjusted, feedstock for the 45Z tax credit will be limited, placing specifically planned renewable diesel (RD) and SAF at risk.

The second key change is the reduction of the maximum 45Z tax credit for SAF production from $1.75 per gallon to $1.00 per gallon. While the CI score already limits the credit producers can claim, lowering the maximum cap further decreases the available incentive. This adjustment aligns the SAF tax credit with those for biodiesel (BD) and RD. As a result, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) producers now have little financial incentive to prioritize SAF production over RD. Reduced incentives typically lead to increased caution among investors when evaluating projects, suggesting a slower pace of SAF adoption in the US.

One bright spot in the OBBB changes is the removal of the indirect land-use change (ILUC) penalty from CI calculations under the 45Z credit. Previously used to account for the environmental impact of land conversion, ILUC penalizes crop-based feedstocks like soybean oil (SBO) and canola oil. Eliminating this factor increases the credit value for fuels made from these domestic oils. This supports US farmers and allows these feedstocks to compete more directly with lower-CI feedstocks, such as used cooking oil (UCO). The updated policy makes crop-based oils financially viable, expanding the feedstock pool, reducing supply risk, and strengthening domestic supply chains, ultimately encouraging scaled production and long-term investment.

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS):

The EPA proposed new rules in June regarding the Renewable Fuel Obligation (RVO) and RIN generation. The proposed increase in volume requirements is expected to drive up D4 RIN prices due to the interplay of supply and demand dynamics within the RIN market. As the EPA raises the RVOs for BBD, obligated parties such as refiners must acquire more D4 RINs to comply with federal mandates. This heightened demand for D4 RINs creates upward pressure on prices. Higher D4 RIN prices improve the economics for producers of D4-qualifying fuels.

However, the new rules also introduce significant changes in how RINs are generated, specifically for imported fuels and feedstocks. Under the proposed regulations, the EPA aims to tighten the criteria and reduce the number of RINs awarded for renewable fuels produced from foreign-sourced feedstocks or imported fuels. This shift is intended to prioritize and incentivize domestic production of renewable fuels, by limiting the RIN benefits available to imports.

Significant changes to the 45Z tax credit and the RFS have the highest impact on SAF. In 2025, the maximum SAF credit stands at $1.75/gallon, with imported Canadian canola and Brazilian sugarcane ethanol qualifying. By 2026, the credit drops to $1.00/gallon, with imports only from Canada and Mexico eligible. The removal of the ILUC penalty improves CI scores for domestic feedstocks, all requiring recalibration of investment decisions. Lower SAF credits and restricted eligibility for imported feedstocks place expansion plans at risk, particularly for AtJ producers reliant on high-CI ethanol. The Foreign Entity of Concern rules may further deter foreign investment, narrowing the field for joint ventures and global partnerships.

SAF: multiple policy changes challenge 2026 producers

Imported BBD and SAF movement

The expiration of the Blender’s Tax Credit (BTC) has had a significant impact on biofuel markets, particularly for imported fuels. Until 2025, the BTC provided a $1.00 per gallon tax credit for blended BD and RD, which served as a major financial incentive for both domestic producers and foreign exporters to the US market. Under the previous framework, imports were eligible to claim this credit, making the US a highly attractive destination.

However, with the transition to the 45Z, effective January 1, 2025, eligibility criteria have shifted to prioritize domestically produced fuels. Imported fuels are no longer able to claim the 45Z credit, removing a key economic advantage for foreign suppliers. According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this policy change has already manifested in a sharp decline in BBD import volumes, with 2025 figures showing a significant drop compared to the previous five-year average.

This reduction underscores how tax policy changes can rapidly alter market dynamics, reshaping trade flows and affecting price competitiveness. Without the support of the BTC, many foreign producers find the US market less viable, leading to tighter domestic supply and upward pressure on prices. While domestic production will eventually scale to meet demand, an increased reliance on imported feedstocks is expected, creating additional supply chain and cost challenges.

Feedstock trade dependence and strategic risks

Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), signed into law in 1977, the President can declare a national emergency and impose import tariffs without requiring congressional approval. The approach bypasses traditional trade statutes (like Section 301/232) and relies entirely on emergency executive authority. However, the courts rejected the sweeping tariff authority, with the US Court of International Trade ruling that IEEPA does not authorize broad tariffs. The court issued a permanent injunction, legally prohibiting enforcement of those tariffs nationwide, although an appeal suspended the order while the case proceeds.

In the meantime, beginning August 1, 2025, many countries will be subject to an increase in tariffs under the IEEPA. For example, BBD feedstocks imported from China are subject to a flat 20 percent IEEPA tariff, applied in addition to any existing duties, creating a steep surcharge intended to discourage Chinese energy-related imports. For Brazil, feedstocks face a much higher penalty, country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs announced at 50 percent, with no energy carve-out exceptions.

In the case of North American-origin feedstocks, Canada and Mexico face a layered import structure. All energy feedstocks must meet USMCA rules of origin to qualify for zero percent tariff treatment. When origin-compliant, these feedstocks continue to enter duty-free. However, if the imports do not meet origin requirements, they are subject to additional duties under IEEPA: Canadian-origin non-originating energy feedstocks incur a reduced ten percent tariff, while non-origin feedstocks from Mexico are assessed at 25 percent. Importers must closely document origin to benefit from preferential treatment; otherwise, they face the full surcharge.

Strategic outlook: policy challenges and opportunities

Challenges

BBD and SAF producers face significant uncertainty due to the absence of clear regulatory guidance. As legislation and policy proposals are developed, the critical question remains how these measures will be effectively implemented.

The 45Z and RFS restrict eligibility primarily to domestically produced fuels. This shift complicates the economic incentives for foreign producers, which in turn narrows supply sources. As a result, domestic producers face increased pressure to expand capacity quickly, straining feedstock availability and infrastructure. Global feedstock providers and foreign investors encounter new barriers, potentially stalling joint ventures and cross-border collaborations.

Trade policies further compound these challenges. Tariffs, import restrictions, and evolving international agreements disrupt established trade flows, limiting access to competitively priced feedstocks and biofuels from global markets.

Opportunities

Despite the challenges posed by recent policy shifts, several positive developments offer promising opportunities for the BBD sector.

By focusing incentives on domestically produced fuels, the US encourages significant investment in biofuel production infrastructure. The local emphasis on production is expected to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and strengthen domestic energy security by reducing dependence on imported fuels.

In parallel, evolving trade policies offer the change to reinforce and optimize supply chains, promoting market stability and encouraging investment. By prioritizing domestic production and strategic international partnerships, the industry can support long-term investment in renewable fuels.

Conclusion: a global market with local consequences

The renewable transportation fuels transition has moved beyond its domestic focus. Trade plays a vital role in supplying the US with supply of both fuels and feedstocks to meet policy obligations. US policy approach requires a balance of domestic production with domestic and imported feedstock development, while maintaining decarbonization targets.

The evolving US policy environment demands foresight from SAF stakeholders. As RFS and OBBB reshape the incentive structure, producers must reassess feedstock strategies, investment plans, and technology pathways.

In this dynamic landscape, thought leadership and strategic clarity are more critical than ever. By understanding the nuances of policy changes and aligning operations accordingly, BBD and SAF stakeholders can not only navigate the headwinds but also harness the upsides to drive sustainable growth.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/10/Ag_Biofuels_GreenOilDrums_Getty-1442366863_Med.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:56:23.877633

Overall, deal activity in both venture capital and private equity declined compared to previous quarters.

However, late in the quarter, signs of recovery emerged, particularly in private equity, indicating a more optimistic outlook for the second half of the year.

Additionally, public equity markets demonstrated resilience, and deal-making in certain sectors continued to remain active.

The latest data from PitchBook’s Q2 2025 Netherlands Market Snapshot provides an in-depth view of these shifting dynamics.

Here are the key takeaways:

Maintained a steady economic growth

In Q2 2025, the Dutch economy maintained a steady growth pace, with GDP expanding by 1 per cent QoQ.

This performance was driven by exports, which saw a boost from increased manufacturing activity.

Inflation decelerated in June to 3.1 per cent, with tobacco having a negative effect on inflation due to the excise duty hike implemented in April 2024.

This increase was part of the Dutch government’s broader “National Prevention Agreement,” which aims to create a tobacco-free generation by 2040. On the contrary, flight tickets exerted downward pressure on inflation due to a year-over-year price drop.

Unemployment in the Netherlands stood at 3.8 per cent, making it one of the lowest in the EU. The euro experienced an appreciation against the US dollar, driven by a weakening dollar amid tariff negotiations.

The European Central Bank cut rates twice in Q2, while the US Federal Reserve kept its interest rates unchanged.

AEX recovers after tariff shock

Q2 was an unusual quarter for public markets, starting with global tariff announcements on “Liberation Day,” April 2.

Markets around the world fell sharply, with the AEX index dropping by as much as 13 per cent after the US announced a 20 per cent tariff on the European Union.

However, a 90-day pause in implementing the tariffs later eased market concerns, suggesting the announcement was mainly a negotiation tactic by the US.

By the end of Q2, the AEX had recovered to its Q1 levels. The impact of the potential US tariffs varied among Dutch companies.

While consumer staples like Unilever struggled to recover, tech and financial stocks such as ING, Adyen, and ASML saw their share prices increase. For more details, check out our analyst note, “The Impact of Tariffs on European PE.”

In Q2, there was only one public listing in the Netherlands: Triodos Bank, which listed on Euronext Amsterdam with a market cap of €434M.

VC investment grows but lags at exit activity

Venture capital deal value rebounded in Q2, although deal count remained slightly subdued. Expectations for improved activity in H2 remain high as market conditions stabilise.

More than half of Q2’s deal value stemmed from nontraditional investors participating in VC rounds.

For example, Toloka AI raised €64M from Jeff Bezos’s family office and Spotify’s CTO, Mikhail Parakhin. Notably, more than 50 per cent of Q2 VC deal value came from late-stage rounds.

VC exits in the Netherlands remained sparse, with just eight exits totalling under half a billion euros. Seven of those exits came from the IT sector.

On the fundraising front, VC activity stayed notably low year-to-date, with only three new funds closing. Nonetheless, venture capital AUM in the Netherlands continued to grow, expanding the dry powder available in the country.

PE deals slow but pick up late in the Quarter

Dutch private equity deal activity declined significantly in Q2, raising €6B across only 131 deals, one of the lowest quarterly counts in the last five years.

Dealmaking stalled at the start of the quarter in response to the US tariff announcement, which created considerable uncertainty.

However, according to PitchBook, the latter part of Q2 showed a clear ramp-up in activity, as documented in their Q2 2025 European PE Breakdown report.

The largest PE deal during Q2 was a €300M investment in SkyNRG by APG. Founded in 2009 by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, SkyNRG is active in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. This capital injection will support SkyNRG’s expansion into new SAF production facilities in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the US.

PE exit activity rebounded in Q2 from a deal count perspective, though the overall exit environment remained constrained due to macroeconomic challenges and valuation mismatches.

The largest exit year-to-date involved the sale of LBC Tank Terminals to Mitsui O.S.K. Lines for €1.6B, allowing French PE firm Ardian to exit its investment after holding its stake since 2017.

Fundraising stays low

On the fundraising front, private equity saw five new funds raise under a combined €2B in the first half of 2025.

Notably, 90 per cent of the capital raised came from buyout strategies. The standout in this category was Egeria, which raised €1.3B for its sixth fund, accounting for the bulk of capital raised in the Netherlands this year.

Despite a dip in new fundraising, the Netherlands’ PE asset under management remains healthy, with total AUM just shy of €50B. This sustained capital base provides dry powder that could help reaccelerate dealmaking as macroeconomic headwinds ease.

Amsterdam maintains dominance

The city comparison heatmap in the report highlights Amsterdam’s leading position in the Dutch private capital ecosystem.

Since 2015, Amsterdam has recorded €12.1B in venture capital (VC) deal value and €67.2B in private equity (PE) deal value, substantially surpassing other cities like Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Eindhoven.

While hubs such as Delft, Leiden, and Groningen have contributed to deal activity at lower levels, they have demonstrated significant involvement in specific sectors, especially in academia and health tech.",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Dutch-startup-report.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 06:56:11.341372

In PwC’s sample, not a single set of climate targets was reversed after a leadership change.
Scope 3: The supply chain challenge Where things get complicated is Scope 3: the emissions outside a company’s direct control.","Companies across sectors are moving sustainability into the heart of their operations—and supply chains are where much of the change is playing out.

PwC’s 2025 State of Decarbonisation report reveals how firms are not only sticking with climate commitments but using them to unlock long-term value.

Drawing on more than 4,000 corporate disclosures, the report shows rising climate ambition, with the shift to Scope 3 emissions marking a clear path to climate leadership.

From solar and wind energy expansion to rethinking supplier relationships, organisations are recognising that cutting carbon also cuts inefficiency. What’s emerging is a clearer sense that sustainability can fuel growth, not just reputation.

Smaller firms, bigger commitments

One of the clearest trends is the growing number of companies making climate-related pledges.

In 2024 alone, more than 4,000 businesses disclosed emissions targets to CDP—up nine-fold compared to five years ago. These pledges aren’t limited to the corporate giants.

The median revenue of committed companies has dropped from US$3.6bn in 2020 to US$1.3bn in 2024, a shift driven by supply chain pressure from larger organisations pushing Scope 3 responsibility down the line.

That means smaller suppliers are now on the hook for emissions reduction—and many are rising to the challenge.

According to the report, 37% of companies are raising their ambitions, compared with only 16% who have scaled them back. Climate targets, once seen as corporate window dressing, are now embedded enough to survive even CEO transitions.

In PwC’s sample, not a single set of climate targets was reversed after a leadership change.

""Sustainability is an untapped frontier of competitive advantage,"" says Pragya Jain, Partner at PwC UK. Pragya adds that reframing climate action from a threat response to a growth strategy is key to long-term success.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions, those from direct operations and purchased energy, are seeing steady progress.

In 2024, 67% of companies are on track to meet targets, up from 64% the year before. That said, the report also notes that most progress is being made through Scope 2 changes, especially the shift to renewable energy. With solar energy growth at 24.4% and wind at 13.1%, renewables have never expanded faster.

Still, this creates its own challenge. As demand for clean energy rises, supply may struggle to keep up, pushing costs higher and testing companies’ willingness to invest in deeper operational changes. That includes electrifying machinery, upgrading facilities for energy efficiency and backing alternative fuels like hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

""Technology alone can't solve the climate crisis, but it remains one of the most critical drivers of progress,"" says James Pincus, Corporate Finance Partner at PwC UK.

He calls for broader investment in climate technology and increased government support—especially in industries where emissions are harder to cut.

Scope 3: The supply chain challenge

Where things get complicated is Scope 3: the emissions outside a company’s direct control. That includes everything from raw materials to how products are used and disposed of. These emissions are, on average, 11 times higher than Scope 1 and 2 combined.

Yet, only 54% of companies are on track to meet their Scope 3 targets—an improvement, but still lagging.

Supply chains are both the problem and the opportunity. Reductions are currently most common in “Use of Sold Products,” especially in sectors like automotive and industrial goods. But supply chain engagement is still lacking. Only 22% of companies have mature programmes in place to manage emissions from suppliers.

That’s where deeper supplier partnerships could change the game. PwC points to the importance of smarter, more strategic engagement that looks beyond immediate Tier 1 suppliers and incorporates Scope 3 metrics into procurement decisions.

""By uncovering hidden vulnerabilities across supply chains and operations, businesses can proactively shape resilience strategies that protect value at risk, whether financial, operational or reputational,"" says Lynne Baber, Global Deputy Sustainability Leader at PwC.

Her message is clear: climate action is not just risk mitigation—it’s operational resilience.

Governance, investment and design

PwC’s report identifies four areas separating leaders from laggards. First is governance. Companies with clear responsibility frameworks and board-level involvement are more likely to hit emissions goals, particularly on Scope 1 and 2.

Second is capital. Firms plan to raise capital expenditure and operational spending on climate by 18% and 21% respectively by 2030. PwC encourages using internal carbon pricing and cost curves to guide investment decisions.

Third is stakeholder engagement. While 72% of companies involve suppliers and 67% engage customers, fewer have advanced strategies tailored to sector-specific needs. In energy and automotive, this might mean closer work with consumers. In manufacturing, it's the supply base that needs support.

Finally, product sustainability is emerging as a major area of value. Companies that build circularity, energy efficiency and low-impact materials into products can see revenue increases of between 6% and 25%.

By 2030, PwC estimates more than one-third of company revenues will be linked to climate transition.

Key growth sectors such as construction, chemicals, automotive and agri-food are expected to see more than 40% of revenue tied to decarbonisation—whether that’s electric vehicles, low-carbon cement or plant-based food products.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0eedc1f8d7b8cec91acbe1d73708d060:92dc3b0fa6ed3a6d805046526f7cae9b/pwc.jfif.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:57:01.324873

The increased use of ethanol, primarily derived from crops like sugarcane, has already shown positive impacts on the economy and environment.

The future of ethanol in India is intrinsically linked to the country's broader goals of energy security, environmental sustainability, and economic development. Achieving the E20 target by 2025 will require concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including the government, industry, and farmers.

To ensure the long-term viability of ethanol as a key component of India's energy mix, it is essential to address the challenges related to feedstock availability, infrastructure development, and technological innovation. Additionally, the exploration of alternative feedstocks and the adoption of advanced production technologies will be crucial in making ethanol a sustainable solution for India's growing energy needs.

As India continues on its path of rapid economic growth, the adoption of ethanol and other biofuels can play a significant role in meeting the country's energy demands while mitigating environmental impact. The future of ethanol in India is not just about reducing dependence on fossil fuels; it's about creating a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future for generations to come.

Ethanol blending in gasoline is a global trend aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions. Several countries have implemented policies to promote ethanol blending, with varying degrees of success.

The Indian government has begun discussions to develop a post-2025 roadmap to further raise the ethanol blend in gasoline from 20%.

This increased ethanol production could also boost the domestic sugar industry, which is a key source of feedstock for ethanol thereby boosting the agricultural sector.

The minister shared notable results from the ethanol program, revealing that from 2014 to August 2024, it has led to foreign exchange savings of 1,060 billion rupees with a reduction of CO2 emissions by 54.4 million metric tons, and a crude oil substitution of 18.1 MMt.

India’s robust economic growth will account for 25% of global energy demand over the next two decades. Bioenergy will play a vital role in meeting this demand while also supporting climate goals and rural development. The country has over 750 MMt of available biomass, with about two-thirds used for domestic purposes like cattle feed and compost.

International Energy Agency forecast predicting a growth potential of 3.5-5 times for biofuels by 2050 due to net-zero targets, represents a substantial opportunity for India.

The Indian government's ambitious SAF targets, aiming for 1% blending by 2027 and 2% by 2028 have already been highlighted.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is crucial for reducing the environmental impact of air travel and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. SAF offers significant reductions in lifecycle carbon emissions (up to 80%) compared to conventional jet fuel, and can also improve air quality by reducing harmful emissions. While SAF is more expensive and currently faces production and infrastructure limitations, its adoption is essential for a more sustainable aviation industry.

SAF is produced with a blend of conventional kerosene (fossil-based) and renewable hydrocarbons and can be produced from a variety of different renewable feedstocks. These include virgin oils, waste oils and fats, solid biomass, CO2, and water and renewable energy via green hydrogen.

The International Aviation Transport Association (IATA) estimates that we will need an annual of amount of 120 billion gallons of SAF by this year.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/07/28/1971709-ethanol-blending-program-and-methanol-blending-program-for-transport-sector-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 08:56:43.399458

Conclusion: A Model for Capital-Efficient Leisure Travel Jet2's dual focus on buybacks and growth investments offers a blueprint for capital-efficient value creation in the leisure travel sector.","The leisure travel sector, historically cyclical and sensitive to macroeconomic shifts, has seen a renaissance in post-pandemic demand. Against this backdrop, Jet2 plc (LSE: JET2) has emerged as a standout performer, leveraging its robust balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation to drive shareholder value. The recent announcement of a £250 million share buyback program—split into two tranches—has reignited investor interest in the UK-based leisure travel group. For capital-efficient investors, the move raises critical questions: Is Jet2's buyback strategy a prudent use of cash, or a distraction from its long-term growth ambitions?

The Buyback: A Signal of Confidence and Capital Prudence

Jet2's second tranche of its buyback program, launched on July 28, 2025, underscores its commitment to returning value to shareholders. With a maximum allocation of £125 million, the program is executed through Jefferies International Limited, operating as a “riskless principal” to ensure independence and compliance with UK market regulations. This structure minimizes governance risks and aligns with the company's broader capital management framework.

The rationale is clear: Jet2's management views its shares as attractively valued, given its strong cash-generative business model and low debt profile. As of July 2025, the company had already repurchased 7,092,805 shares for £125 million under the first tranche, averaging £16.72 per share. By canceling these shares, Jet2 reduces its equity base, thereby increasing earnings per share (EPS) and enhancing returns for remaining shareholders.

Balancing Buybacks and Growth: A Dual-Pronged Strategy

Critics may argue that large-scale buybacks divert capital from growth opportunities. However, Jet2's capital allocation strategy is a masterclass in balance. While the company is returning £250 million to shareholders, it is simultaneously investing heavily in its fleet. The order of 146 Airbus A321neo aircraft, valued at £6–7 billion at list prices, is a bet on the long-term demand for leisure travel and the need to modernize its operations.

This duality is where Jet2's strength lies. By financing growth through a mix of operating leases and internal cash flow—rather than diluting shareholders—management ensures that both short-term returns and long-term scalability are prioritized. The company's £3.6 billion cash balance (as of September 2024) provides ample liquidity to fund these initiatives without compromising its investment-grade credit profile.

Capital Efficiency in Action: Metrics That Matter

To evaluate Jet2's capital efficiency, investors must look beyond headline figures. Key metrics tell a compelling story:

- Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): Jet2's ROIC has consistently outperformed the leisure travel sector average, reflecting its disciplined reinvestment of cash flows into high-margin package holidays and flight-only services.

- Free Cash Flow Yield: At 12% as of Q2 2025, Jet2's free cash flow yield (free cash flow divided by market cap) suggests the company is generating value that could be distributed to shareholders without jeopardizing growth.

- Dividend Payout Ratio: The resumption of dividends at 14.7p per share in 2024—despite retaining a conservative 6% payout ratio—demonstrates a measured approach to shareholder returns.

Risk Mitigation and Strategic Hedging

Jet2's capital-efficient approach extends to risk management. A hedging program covering 80% of its 2025 fuel costs and 50% of 2026 expenses insulates the company from volatile oil prices. Additionally, its early adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) positions it to meet tightening environmental regulations without incurring significant retrofit costs. These proactive measures ensure that capital is deployed not just for growth, but for resilience.

The Investor Case: Buybacks as a Value-Creation Catalyst

For shareholders, Jet2's buyback program is more than a cash return—it's a strategic tool to enhance equity value. By reducing the share count, the company amplifies the impact of its earnings and free cash flow. With 14.3 million shares remaining available for repurchase, the second tranche could further boost EPS, making the stock even more attractive in a sector where margin pressures are persistent.

However, the success of this strategy hinges on execution. If the buyback is completed at prices significantly above the current £16.72 average, the cost-benefit analysis could shift. Investors should monitor quarterly disclosures for transparency on repurchase prices and volumes.

Conclusion: A Model for Capital-Efficient Leisure Travel

Jet2's dual focus on buybacks and growth investments offers a blueprint for capital-efficient value creation in the leisure travel sector. By leveraging its strong balance sheet, strategic hedging, and disciplined reinvestment, the company is positioning itself to capitalize on a rebound in demand while rewarding shareholders. For investors seeking a blend of income and capital appreciation, Jet2 presents a compelling case—provided the buyback is executed at favorable valuations and growth projects deliver on their promise.

In a market where many leisure travel firms are still recovering from pandemic-era losses, Jet2's proactive approach to capital allocation sets it apart. As the second tranche of its buyback program unfolds, the company's ability to balance shareholder returns with strategic growth will be a key determinant of its long-term success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-28 04:56:29.022816

JFK Terminal 4 is the largest terminal at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and is also the only privately operated terminal in the United States. The terminal houses 22 airlines, 12,000 employees and serves more than 28 million passengers and 18 million checked bags per year.

At the helm of the gateway to the Big Apple is Roel Huinink, President and CEO. Roel, who has a mechanical engineering background, felt early-on in his career that transportation, whether ports, rail or aviation, was his true interest.

Before JFKIAT, Roel spent 15 years at Royal Schiphol Group where he had many opportunities to see different sides of the business, including as Managing Director of Arlanda Schiphol Development Company, a retail management enterprise in Sweden, and as Director of Parking & Mobility Services at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands. It is at Royal Schiphol that he homed in on his love for aviation, or “plane cocaine” as he jokingly calls it.

“When we hire staff, we tell them that either you won’t like it at all and you’ll run away, or if you’re still here after a year, you’ll probably be here forever!”

Bringing a customer-centric approach

Having pioneered the public private partnership (PPP) model in the United States, Roel believes that they are bringing a different approach at JFKIAT.

“PPP’s advantages are increased funding, faster project completion, and improved management flexibility. They have a customer-centric approach focused on streamlined decision-making processes, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and enabling quicker responses to operational needs.. We are also backed by Schiphol, so there’s a lot of knowledge exchange and collaboration, which we benefit from.”

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is currently in the midst of a historic $19 billion transformation of JFK Airport, with the goal of transforming it into a world-class airport, including the building of two new terminals – the New Terminal One and Terminal 6.

Terminal 4 itself recently saw the completion of its expansion, adding 10 gates in the space of 14 months. Work included extending the reclaim area, renovating restrooms, upgrading the quality and feel of areas such as gate holds. In addition, JFKIAT invested heavily in technology focusing on operational excellence, including passenger flow management, turnaround management systems, and passenger facing technology, including self-service bag-drop, and a near fully-biometric passenger journey.

A T4 state of mind: A new vision

Central to Roel’s vision as JFK T4’s CEO is the new north star vision for the terminal

For those who are unfamiliar, a north star vision is a long-term guiding principle for a company that is designed to provide direction, a sense of purpose and inspiration towards a common goal. The next phase of Terminal 4’s transformation is the launch of its north star vision and experience strategy, which Roel says is crucial “because even though we are infrastructure providers, we are in a people and hospitality business.” The work consisted of aligning that vision with the stakeholders, partners and employees – all of whom are part of the T4 community, to reveal the true soul of the terminal and shape the future of our terminal experience through experience pillars (employee experience, passenger experience, airline experience, commercial experience, terminal ambiance).

JKFIAT has enlisted the help of Designit, subsidiary of WIPRO Ltd, that has been a strategic partner for JFK Terminal 4 on sustainability, digital strategy and innovation, including JFKIAT’s AI roadmap ,. This is part of an existing project which includes creating an AI-enabled data approach and supporting the business with a roadmap for carbon reduction, to meet its sustainability targets.

But why are they doing this?

“We created the north star for our teams in partnership with the T4 community to stand behind, to ensure that they feel included and aligned. Our north star says that we design customer experiences to represent the T4 state of mind through pride, community and innovation. Secondly, we empower people to come forward with good ideas and think out of the box. We want to improve our communication with the community, to really collaborate, because in aviation, if you want to get things done, you need to work together, which people say, but not a lot of people do. Thirdly, is pride. We wish for the T4 employees to take pride in working at T 4, serving our customers.”

So, why now?

“All the terminals at JFK Airport are competing with one another, and we have to make sure that our passengers and airlines actually choose us,” is Roel’s candid response.

“I believe that people make the difference. Yes, infrastructure is important, but if you don’t have the right culture, you can’t make a difference. Putting that into a vision that is tangible to people, that they can rally behind and become involved with, whether you are a direct employee, an airline, a business or commercial partner – that is what will really help to drive things forward.”

A new commercial and technology offering

Incorporating a sense of place is nothing new in airports, but New York is a special place.

The New York borough of Queens is widely recognised as the most ethnically diverse urban area on the planet, with over 47% of its residents born outside of the United States. Therefore, the passengers that travel through JFK are also very diverse, and this is what Roel wishes to reflect in their new concessions programme in the terminal.

“We want to create that sense of place, but evolve this further, translating it into several elements. For instance, if you open a Starbucks, you could open a standard Starbucks, or you could ask, how can we make this Starbucks represent Brooklyn and the people that live there?”

Those who have visited New York will know that every borough, such as Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Bronx, each have a distinct vibe.

“We’ve divided the terminal into different boroughs, allowing passengers to feel those different vibes in the different areas of the terminal. We hope this innovative angle will cause passengers to say, ‘hey, this is something really new’.”

Roel acknowledges that every traveller is different and has different expectations: “Some want fast and efficient experiences, so you need high technology solutions like Hudson and Amazon Go. Yet other travellers want to sit down.” On the T4 website, it helpfully lists your food options depending on how much time you have.

“We are developing concepts that are either from New York, or represent the history of New York. We’ve also incorporated local businesses through our redevelopment programme, with more than 40% of the work allocated to minorities and women business enterprises (MWBEs). We also have the airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise programme (ACDBE), which we’ve upped from 20% to over 30%.”

Passenger experience initiatives

Being a large international hub, T4 describes itself as ‘the terminal that never sleeps in the city that never sleeps’. This means passengers who have a lot of time to spend in an airport must be entertained. Would you expect to see life-size colouring book experience, pop-up selfie stations and automated retail concepts in an airport? These are all examples of passenger experience initiatives that have appeared at the terminal, which create those unexpected ‘wow’ moments for passengers.

These elements were all realised as part of the T4 arts and culture programme. Current installations include a holographic Bronx Zoo exhibition, a one-of-a-kind Queens-centric mural and a series of photographs captured by T4 employees who share their passion for aviation.

Sustainability progress

Roel says that being co-owned by Schiphol Group, and the topic of sustainability being hotter in Europe than the United States, has contributed to the air terminal operator’s energetic pursuit of sustainability. The operator is committed to reaching net zero carbon by 2050. Despite President Trump withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement for the second time, JFKIAT’s comprehensive sustainability programme follows, guided by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, the Paris Climate Agreement guidelines.

In 2017, T4 became the first air terminal to earn the LEED Gold certification for existing buildings: operations and maintenance in the U.S., an achievement Roel is hugely proud of. In 2022 JFKIAT achieved T4’sLEED Platinum certification for Existing Buildings: Operations & Maintenance, making it the first and only existing airport terminal in the US to achieve that honour from the U.S. Green Building Council.

In 2024, JFKIAT invested in Green-e® certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), reducing their scope 2 electricity emissions to net zero and enabling a 16% reduction in the terminal facility’s carbon footprint when compared to its baseline.

RECs are one of many initiatives that JFK Airport as a whole is running. As part of the $19 billion transformation, the Port Authority is investing in electric ground service equipment and solar power projects on top of the new terminals and over a long-term parking garage at JFK. The agency currently operates the largest electric bus fleet serving any airport in the United States.

T4 has also been the recipient of the 2023 Greenest Airport Terminal Award by the Green Restaurant Association, an award which highlights how the terminal has more Certified Green Restaurants® than any other airport terminal in North America. The company also recently purchased 8,736 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in collaboration with Delta Airlines to offset scope 3 business travel emissions and encourage other companies to use environmentally friendly jet fuel.

The above initiatives show a forward-looking approach that seeks to care for T4’s & JFK Airport employees and the wider Queens community, as well as the future of the aviation industry.

Challenges

With an uncertain time ahead for all airports, it is no wonder that Roel cites economic uncertainty as one of the challenges for the year ahead. However, he goes on to say that JKIAT is still in ‘transformation mode’. The terminal handled 27.7 million passengers in 2024, the highest number of passengers ever recorded, and they are expecting to handle even higher numbers this year – all while embarking on the north star programme and new mission statement, which means that this year will be crucial for Roel as an airport leader.

“I want to include our T4 staff more in the culture and really drive innovation – that will be the challenge with sustainability and technology implementation. The task is keeping your team focused on so many things simultaneously. The time when airports could focus on one thing is over. Airports, indeed most businesses nowadays, must focus on all the different facets of the business to be truly successful. For me as a leader, it is very important that we focus on data, facts and implementing. As a leader in aviation, you need to stand firm on these elements and really drive them in your organisation.”

With a distinguished track record in shaping strategy, driving innovation and spearheading business growth, Roel Huinink brings strong and capable stewardship to JFK T4.

Under his direction, T4 is well positioned to thrive in one of the world’s most dynamic and demanding markets. Fortunately for Roel, New York offers no shortage of inspiration and talent – a city defined by ambition, resilience, and an unrivalled work ethic and which has been the subject of many movies, novels and song lyrics – and there’s no better stage for bold leadership than the Empire State.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Feature-interview.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 04:56:33.792894

За рубежом ""ЛУКОЙЛ"" поставляет клиентам биотопливо собственного производства первого поколения: автомобильный бензин с добавлением биоэтанола (до 10% объема) и биодизель, а также биотопливо сторонних производителей. Биотопливные смеси производятся на НПЗ и нефтебазах в Румынии, Болгарии и Нидерландах. ""Спрос на продукты остается стабильным с незначительными колебаниями год к году"", - отмечает компания.

Две структуры группы ""ЛУКОЙЛ"" в прошлом году получили сертификаты глобальной системы сертификации устойчивости продукции, которая подтверждает отсутствие ущерба окружающей среде (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification scheme, ISCC), признаваемые Международной организацией гражданской авиации (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO1). Так, LUKOIL Aviation Bulgaria EOOD оформил сертификат ISCC EU2, подтверждающий соответствие требованиям Евросоюза к поставщикам устойчивого авиационного топлива (SAF). Нефтеперерабатывающему заводу в Болгарии выдан сертификат ISCC CORSIA3 (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), удостоверяющий, что производство SAF путем смешения закупаемого биокомпонента с минеральным авиационным топливом соответствует установленным критериям устойчивого топлива. Первую партию SAF планируется произвести в 2025 году. Сертификация авиатоплива является обязательным условием поставки продукта на регулируемые рынки по выбросам парниковых газов от авиатранспорта, напоминает компания.

Помимо этого, НПЗ в Болгарии в 2024 году получил еще один сертификат международной системы ISCC-EU1. Он подтверждает, что процесс переработки натурального сырья, в частности POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent) и UCO (Used Cooking Oil), через ко-процессинг в биотопливо второго поколения (биодизель) соответствует критериям устойчивого развития. Продукт частично заменит биодизель первого поколения (FAME), поставляемый на АЗС в настоящее время. Выпуск тестовой партии также планируется в 2025 году.

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) - это биотопливо, которое может смешиваться с обычным авиационным топливом в пропорциях до 50%. Оно на 100% производится из возобновляемого сырья, отходов и остатков, например, из кулинарных масел, животных жиров и побочных продуктов переработки растительных масел. Благодаря тому, что в основе SAF не ископаемое топливо, а биогенное сырье, его использование позволяет сократить выбросы парниковых газов по всей цепочке создания стоимости. SAF не требует модификации воздушных судов или существующей инфраструктуры распределения топлива в аэропортах.

Регламент Евросоюза 2023/2405 устанавливает, что поставщики авиационного топлива должны гарантировать наличие доли биотоплива в любом реактивном топливе, предоставляемом операторам авиакомпаний в каждом аэропорту ЕС. Кроме того, доля биотоплива должна увеличиваться каждые пять лет с минимальных 2% на 1 января 2025 года до 6% к 2030 году и 70% к 2050 году.",https://www.aviaport.ru/favicon.svg,N,,2025-07-28 04:56:43.482127

The signing ceremony between Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, ATR CEO, and Lin Chi-Chung, UNI Air Chairman, also brought together senior leaders from ATR, UNI Air, EVA Air and Taiwan’s transport authorities.

The aircraft order is ATR’s largest from an airline since 2017 and underscores ATR and UNI Air’s shared vision for more accessible, efficient and sustainable air connectivity across Taiwan. This next-generation fleet will enable UNI Air to modernise and expand its domestic services, particularly to the outlying islands, including: Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu.

Lin Chi-Chung, Chairman of Uni Air, said: “UNI Air has a market share of nearly 60% on domestic routes. In addition to business and tourism travellers, UNI Air is an important means of transport for people living on the outlying islands needing to visit their families and seek medical treatment.”

UNI Air was the first airline in Taiwan to introduce ATR aircraft, and has accumulated 13 years of experience since 2012. In order to maintain a young fleet and a high dispatch rate – and to further enhance overall operational efficiency and market competitiveness – the new aircraft are scheduled to be delivered from 2027.

The new fleet of ATRs will be fully integrated by 2032, increasing UNI Air’s total fleet to 19 from 14 currently. Having five additional ATR 72-600 aircraft increases overall service capacity by more than 20%. In addition to meeting the expectations of the ‘visiting family and friends’ traffic to have convenient access and frequencies, additional flights can also be added in the event of adverse weather conditions or large-scale events in various cities in the future to meet the demand for passenger transport.

Nathalie Tarnaud-Laude, Chief Executive Officer at ATR, thanked UNI Air for its continued trust, and added: “UNI Air makes a meaningful difference for the communities it serves, providing them with the frequency, reliability and connectivity they need. We are delighted to renew our strategic partnership, supporting UNI Air with its expansion plans. UNI Air’s confidence in ATR is the strongest testament to the essential role our aircraft play in shaping efficient and sustainable regional aviation networks. This new order is a powerful affirmation of our mission: building aircraft that bring communities closer together.”

ATR 72-600 is the world’s best-selling turboprop aircraft, with more than 1,900 units sold to 200 airlines, and 1,300 airports served. The ATR 72-600 offers low maintenance costs and high operational efficiency to match the volume and frequency of domestic routes. The new aircraft is equipped with the new PW127XT engines, which improves fuel efficiency by at least 3% compared to its predecessor and reduces maintenance costs by as much as 20%, demonstrating excellent energy saving and operational efficiency. In terms of cabin design, the ATR 72-600 has been upgraded with a new air-conditioning and purification system and an ergonomic seat design, providing a more comfortable flying experience for passengers. The seating capacity has also been changed to 72 seats. The new 72-seat configuration not only maintains a spacious and comfortable travelling space, but also increases service capacity by 3% per flight.

With 16 domestic routes and more than 900 weekly flights, UNI Air is the most densely-flown domestic airline, serving as the most important bridging routes between the outlying islands and the eastern part of Taiwan. UNI Air has become a leading brand for domestic routes, providing a number of industry-first services, and has been recognised 10 times by the Civil Aviation Administration as the first-place winner of the ‘Domestic Scheduled Route Category’. In the future, UNI Air will continue to uphold the core values of ‘safety’ and ‘service’, improve the quality of flights and strive to create a more comfortable, convenient and trustworthy flying experience for passengers.

The ATR 72-600 is uniquely suited for airports with short runways, such as Matsu Nangan, where the 1,579-metre runway poses operational challenges for most conventional jets. Its ability to handle steep approaches and operate efficiently in geographically dispersed and topographically diverse regions makes it ideal for Taiwan’s regional network.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/2000px_A7403784-編輯.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 06:56:36.795815

Jason Gabelman has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors that reflect both positive and challenging aspects of Neste’s current market position. The company has shown improvement in its Renewable Products segment, with a significant reduction in fixed costs and an increase in margins. These operational enhancements are expected to be more sustainable, providing a stable foundation for future performance. However, the market for renewable products remains oversupplied, which Neste itself acknowledges, creating uncertainty about future margin stability.

Despite strong quarterly results and outperforming its largest US peer, Neste’s stock has exhibited volatility, with gains often retracting shortly after earnings announcements. This pattern of volatility makes it challenging to predict future stock performance reliably. Additionally, while the company has made strides in cost reduction and operational efficiency, the oversupply in the global biofuels market and uncertain demand dynamics, particularly in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel segment, contribute to the cautious outlook. As a result, Gabelman maintains a Hold rating while adjusting the price target to reflect the improvements in cost structure.

Padahal di dalamnya tersimpan potensi perbaikan kesehatan tanah, penguatan efisiensi pupuk, bahan bakar energi, dan bahkan jejak karbon untuk keberlanjutan sawit dan pertanian di masa depan.","Jakarta, mediaperkebunan.id – Tandan kosong kelapa sawit (TKKS) merupakan salah satu limbah biomassa terbesar dari industri kelapa sawit Indonesia yang sangat melimpah volumenya. Untuk setiap ton TBS (Tandan Buah Segar) yang diolah di pabrik kelapa sawit (PKS), dihasilkan sekitar 22–25% TKKS, atau setara dengan 0,22–0,25 ton. Berdasarkan data FAO (2024), produksi TBS Indonesia mencapai sekitar 256 juta ton per tahun, sehingga potensi TKKS nasional diperkirakan mencapai 56–64 juta ton per tahun.

Selama ini, sebagian besar TKKS segar oleh pekebun hanya dimanfaatkan secara langsung sebagai mulsa atau penutup tanah dengan cara disebarkan di bawah tanaman belum menghasilkan (TBM) dan Tanaman menghasilkan (TM), dengan dosis sekitar 20–45 ton per hektar per tahun. Praktik ini bermanfaat, tetapi dekomposisinya lambat dan unsur haranya tidak langsung tersedia bagi tanaman, serta memerlukan logistik yang tidak efisien. Di samping itu, tersimpan bahaya tersembunyi, potensi tumpukan TKKS dapat menjadi site breeding kumbang tanduk (Oryctes rhinoceros), salah satu hama berbahaya bagi tanaman kelapa sawit.

Potensi Pemanfaatan Biochar

Kini, dengan kemajuan teknologi termal, TKKS dapat diolah menjadi biochar melalui proses pirolisis — pemanasan bahan organik pada suhu 350–600°C dalam kondisi minim oksigen. Proses ini akan menghasilkan tiga fraksi utama: padatan (biochar), cairan (bio-oil), dan gas (syngas). Dari setiap ton TKKS kering, dapat dihasilkan sekitar 200–300 kg biochar, tergantung pada kadar air dan efisiensi proses.

Teknologi ini kini tersedia dalam berbagai skala dan dapat diterapkan di sentra produksi kelapa sawit baik oleh koperasi petani, PKS, maupun pelaku industri hilir. Dengan nilai kalor sekitar 20–25 MJ/kg, biochar juga berpotensi digunakan sebagai bahan bakar padat atau briket pengganti batu bara kelas rendah.

Dalam bidang pertanian, biochar dari TKKS memiliki keunggulan yang jauh lebih efektif dibandingkan dengan TKKS segar. Struktur pori biochar mampu meningkatkan kapasitas tukar kation tanah, memperbaiki retensi air, dan mendukung aktivitas mikroba menguntungkan.

Aplikasi biochar di lahan sawit dengan dosis 5–10 ton/ha/tahun dapat memberikan manfaat agronomis setara atau bahkan lebih tinggi daripada 40 ton/ha TKKS mentah, dengan volume dan beban logistik yang jauh lebih rendah. Selain itu, biochar dapat dikombinasikan dengan kompos atau pupuk organik lain untuk meningkatkan efisiensi serapan unsur hara dan mengurangi ketergantungan pada pupuk kimia.

Pemanfaatan Lainnya

Dari TKKS yang dikonversi menjadi biochar, pemanfaatan dapat diperluas ke sektor energi dan lingkungan. Di sektor energi, biochar dapat dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan bakar biomassa padat atau pencampur bahan bakar untuk boiler (co-firing) pada industri semen, pembangkit listrik berbasis biomassa dan industri lainnya.

Di sektor lingkungan, sifat adsorptif biochar menjadikannya bahan penyaring yang efektif untuk pengolahan air limbah, remediasi logam berat, hingga penjernihan air. Dari sisi mitigasi iklim, setiap ton biochar yang dimasukkan ke tanah menyimpan sekitar 2,5–3 ton CO₂ ekuivalen, yang dapat diklaim sebagai kredit karbon dalam pasar karbon sukarela (voluntary carbon market), dengan potensi nilai ekonomi antara USD 5–30 per ton CO₂.

Jika dibandingkan dengan praktik konvensional aplikasi TKKS segar, yang nilai ekonominya terbatas pada penghematan pupuk sekitar Rp 300.000–600.000 per hektare (USD 19 – 38 per hektare), konversi TKKS menjadi biochar membuka peluang ekonomi jauh lebih besar.

Selain potensi pendapatan dari produk biochar dan efisiensi pertanian, terdapat juga potensi bisnis dari penjualan energi, penjualan produk adsorben, hingga jual-beli kredit karbon. Transformasi ini mengubah paradigma: dari sekadar limbah organik menjadi komoditas strategis yang menopang pertanian berkelanjutan, transisi energi terbarukan, dan kontribusi konkret terhadap dekarbonisasi nasional.

Selain itu, masih ada potensi lain dari pemanfaatan TKKS, yakni dikonversi menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) menggunakan teknologi Fischer-Tropsch (FT) salah satu jalur teknokogi yang diakui ASTM, yakni dengan mengubah TKKS menjadi gas sintesis dan selanjutnya bahan bakar jet (Bioavtur/SAF). Pendekatan ini akan mendukung pengurangan emisi sektor aviasi sekaligus meningkatkan nilai tambah limbah sawit.

Selama ratusan tahun, TKKS hanya dianggap sebagai limbah—ditinggalkan membusuk di bawah pohon, tak pernah benar-benar dilihat sebagai sumber kehidupan baru. Padahal di dalamnya tersimpan potensi perbaikan kesehatan tanah, penguatan efisiensi pupuk, bahan bakar energi, dan bahkan jejak karbon untuk keberlanjutan sawit dan pertanian di masa depan.

Mungkin kini saatnya kita berhenti memperlakukan limbah sebagai beban, dan mulai menjadikannya sebagai produk bernilai. Karena di balik warna biochar yang abu menghitam, ada harapan yang menyala—untuk bumi yang lebih lestari, untuk petani yang lebih sejahtera, dan untuk sawit Indonesia yang lebih bermartabat.",http://mediaperkebunan.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Biochar-dari-TKKS.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 02:56:55.376054

GC's plan is being considered after the company started commercial production of 6 million litres of SAF a year at its biorefinery at Map Ta Phut in Rayong earlier this year, using used cooking oil as a raw material.

SAF, which produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuel, can be blended with jet fuel to support the aviation industry's campaign against global warming.

""We plan to increase SAF production to 24 million litres a year in the second phase to meet customer demand,"" said Toasaporn Boonyapipat, president of GC.

A final decision on the investment will be determined once the Thai government announces the proportion of SAF required to be combined with jet fuel for aircraft flying in Thailand, he said.

""We expect mandatory SAF proportions to be enforced in many countries, which will drive demand for SAF,"" said Mr Toasaporn.

The biorefinery valued at 160 million baht supplies SAF to Bangkok Airways, which is piloting the use of the clean fuel on its flights.

GC is also considering whether to continue using used cooking oil as a feedstock for SAF, or change to another raw material such as ethanol or wastewater, he said.

Wastewater has potential for SAF because its organic waste matter, particularly from food scraps, can be broken down by special bacteria to produce volatile fatty acids.

Scientists use chemical processing to transform volatile fatty acids into hydrocarbons, which are then refined into jet fuel.

“The crash not only represents an immense human tragedy but also marks one of the largest single claims events in the recent Russian aviation insurance market.
Insurers will cover liability claims related to passenger fatalities, governed by Russian law and the internationally binding Montreal Convention.
As the company ceded only 56.2% of the total aviation liability GWP, this incident will push the company’s aviation business into losses.
However, the Russian aviation insurance market has been historically highly profitable, with the loss ratio remaining well below 30% in the last three years.","Following the news that, on July 24, 2025, Angara Airlines Flight 2311, an Antonov An-24RV turboprop, crashed near Tynda in Amur Oblast in eastern Russia, resulting in the tragic loss of all 48 people on board, including 42 passengers and six crew:

Chandini Sharma, Insurance Analyst at GlobalData, a data and analytics company, comments: “This catastrophic accident will cost around $20 to $25 million to the Russian aviation insurance market. Claims paid by Russian insurers for the AZAL plane crash in December 2024, and this accident will not only reduce the profitability of the Russian aviation insurance market in 2025 but also increase the reinsurance rate for Russian insurers. It signals a growing pattern of severe and frequent losses that will reshape the risk environment for both the Russian and international aviation insurance and reinsurance markets, which are already reeling under pressure from the costly Air India plane crash in June 2025.

“The crash not only represents an immense human tragedy but also marks one of the largest single claims events in the recent Russian aviation insurance market. The total loss will comprise around $10 million of aviation hull and the rest as liability claims. Insurers will cover liability claims related to passenger fatalities, governed by Russian law and the internationally binding Montreal Convention. Initial estimation of liability claims, based on applicable regulations, could go up to $9 million. However, this could further escalate based on the investigation report.

“Russian insurers will bear a major portion of the loss, as aviation insurers retain most of the risk and cede less than 60% of the gross written premiums (GWP) to reinsurers during 2020-24. In 2024, insurers ceded 32.6% of the GWP to reinsurers.

“SOGAZ JSC, the leading Russian insurer, confirmed that it holds the civil liability policy for Angara Airlines. As the company ceded only 56.2% of the total aviation liability GWP, this incident will push the company’s aviation business into losses. However, as aviation contributes only 0.6% of the company’s general insurance GWP, this will not have a significant impact on its overall performance.

“This disaster comes amid ongoing turbulence in Russia’s aviation insurance landscape, destabilised by elevated claims severity, inflation in repair costs, and disruptions linked to the Russia-Ukraine aircraft leasing dispute. However, the Russian aviation insurance market has been historically highly profitable, with the loss ratio remaining well below 30% in the last three years. The recent AZAL (based on earlier industry estimates of around $30 million) and Angara Airlines crash-related claims could go up to $50 million compared to the estimated aviation GWP of $298 million in 2025.

“With recent major aviation losses, insurance premiums and reinsurance rates are expected to increase. International reinsurers are expected to revisit their terms and conditions. Also, the ongoing investigations into the crash could result in regulatory action and trigger additional business interruption claims.”",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/Angara_Airlines_Antonov_An-24RV_RA-47315_20220309.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 22:56:45.689044
