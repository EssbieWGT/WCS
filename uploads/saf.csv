It is hardly possible to electrify all types of vehicles, especially large-sized buses, trucks and ships which usually travel on long-haul routes.
Widely known as ""e-fuel"", electrofuel is a type of synthetic fuel created by using electricity from renewable sources to combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce synthetic hydrocarbon fuel.
It is a promising carbon-neutral fuel because, though synthetic oil-powered cars emit carbon dioxide, the process to make this fuel requires the need to capture carbon dioxide to blend with hydrogen.
One result is there is no additional carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere.","Shuttle buses carrying people to Yumeshima Island in Japan to join the Expo 2025 provided their last services on Oct 13, but their potential as new energy-powered vehicles is just beginning to gain momentum.

The vehicles were run by electrofuel, a type of eco-friendly fuel which could compete with batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs).

These are dominating automotive markets as campaigns against global warming intensify.

Thailand is heavily promoting EVs and batteries, but as production of electrofuel on a commercial scale is not so far off, the government should pay more heed to this fuel, including it in plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector.

EV sales, which are doing well here, are not a complete solution to air pollution. It is hardly possible to electrify all types of vehicles, especially large-sized buses, trucks and ships which usually travel on long-haul routes. These bus and trucks are often fueled by diesel.

Electrofuel might solve this problem.

Widely known as ""e-fuel"", electrofuel is a type of synthetic fuel created by using electricity from renewable sources to combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce synthetic hydrocarbon fuel.

In other words, we are making oil that can fit internal combustion engine-powered cars without the need to make changes to car engines.

The recent Expo in Osaka was the first time in Japan that e-fuel was tested in commercial vehicles.

The shuttle buses took people between the Umekita Green Place Bus Terminal in Osaka and Yumeshima Island, offering a direct service to the Expo site for six months after the event started on April 13.

E-fuel producer ENEOS Corporation collected data from fuel usage, with an aim to produce it on a commercial scale at its factory in Yokohama.

It is a promising carbon-neutral fuel because, though synthetic oil-powered cars emit carbon dioxide, the process to make this fuel requires the need to capture carbon dioxide to blend with hydrogen. One result is there is no additional carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere.

Thailand set a new target to strike a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and absorption by 2050, 15 years sooner than its original goal. To cut carbon dioxide emissions, authorities support the use of various biofuels, including gasohol, a mix of gasoline and sugar cane-derived ethanol; biodiesel, which is made by blending diesel with palm-based methyl ester; and lately sustainable aviation fuel, a biofuel for aircraft made from used cooking oil.

But they have yet to introduce e-fuel to truck and bus operators.

The National Electric Vehicle Policy Committee wants to convert some trucks and buses in the country to EVs. Under its ""30@30"" policy, the panel expects EVs to represent at least 30% of total auto production by 2030, comprising 34,000 electric buses and trucks, 725,000 zero-emission cars and 675,000 electric motorcycles.

During the first eight months of this year, newly registered electric trucks increased by 67% year-on-year to 265 units, up from 158 units, while electric buses fell by 62% to 89 units, down from 237 units, says the Department of Land Transport.

This shows electric mobility technology is less popular among buses and trucks than battery EVs in the passenger car category, with new registrations soaring by 55% to 77,036 units, up from 49,641 units, during the same period.

The figures appear to pave the way for the government to start considering making e-fuel another alternative fuel for buses and trucks, though some pain points of synthetic hydrocarbon production must be addressed.

According to experts, e-fuel is more expensive than battery EVs.

The former has estimated cost of between US$0.30 and 0.50 per kilometre, compared with a range from $0.05-0.10/km for the latter. It is evident e-fuel has low efficiency and high production cost.

One reason behind these obstacles is e-fuel involves a complex production process. Manufacturers first need to use electricity made from renewable energy to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen.

They must use technology to capture carbon dioxide.

A last step is to combine hydrogen and carbon to make synthetic hydrocarbon by using the electrolysis technology.

Chaiwat Kovavisarach, chief executive and president of energy conglomerate Bangchak Corporation, is aware e-fuel is pricey, about four times as costly as fossil-derived fuels.

Yet he believes the synthetic hydrocarbon business has a potential to grow in the future.

Bangchak earlier announced it is seeking partners to conduct e-fuel research and development in a move to replace fossil-derived fuels.

The company does not want to do R&D from scratch but prefers to join hands with energy firms to speed up work in this field, said Mr Chaiwat.

Bangchak is planning to have its own research centre to facilitate the development of e-fuel projects.

The company will spend part of its US$30-milion budget, allocated for new businesses and innovation, to fund the construction, said Mr Chaiwat.

It also plans to ask for financial support from the Office of National Higher Education, Science Research and Innovation to help translate its research facility project into action.

Bangchak has decided to make a crucial move in the fuel business. Will the government follow suit, at least by taking e-fuel development into more serious consideration?",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/10/27/5828237_700.png,N,,2025-10-26 19:56:24.104576

With sporting bodies riding a wave of record-breaking media rights revenues, urgent investment is needed in high-quality, durable carbon removal solutions, finds Stockholm-based impact firm Milkywire’s The Climate Cost of Growth in Sport report, which outlines how expansion strategies – like increasing the number of games and hosting tournaments across multiple continents – are driving significant rises in Scope 3 emissions, particularly from team and fan travel.

FIFA’s upcoming 2026 World Cup, for instance, is projected to generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, a staggering 400% increase over previous editions due to its 48-team format and sprawling North American footprint.

Despite public sustainability commitments, most governing bodies fall short on actual delivery. FIFA for example, which claims to aim for net zero by 2040, failed to meet its carbon neutrality pledge for Qatar 2022.

Only durable carbon removal can credibly offset fossil fuel emissions, the report stresses, yet most offsetting programmes rely on low-quality or short-lived credits, undermining public trust and actual climate impact.

Formula One and E, both popular across Asia, are also spotlighted. Formula One has made progress in cutting emissions through remote operations and sustainable aviation fuel, the report notes, but it omits fan travel from its carbon accounting. Formula E, despite including spectator emissions, still relies on offsets misaligned with the scale and duration of its fossil fuel emissions.

Asian sports markets, particularly cricket in India, football in Japan and South Korea, and growing Olympic aspirations across Southeast Asia, the report points out, are likely to replicate the expansionary trends observed in Western sports events and venues.

As a timely blueprint, the report suggests, the industry should dedicate a portion of its growing revenues ( 1% to 2% ) to verified, long-duration carbon removal, publish transparent Scope 3 emissions inventories ( including fan travel ) and restructure scheduling to minimize travel intensity.

While “big games have led to big emissions”, the report concludes, there is still time on the clock for the sports industry to win on climate. Asia’s sporting authorities and owners also have the opportunity to break away from the same high-emission playbook and set a new standard for sustainable competition.

The analysis, which has been established as setting the baseline for EU SAF monitoring, provides the first comprehensive review of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) activity across the bloc. Initial data on Sustainable Aviation Fuel supply, emissions savings and investment trends across European Union States are comprehensively provided within the new EASA analysis, signalling a crucial step toward meeting upcoming blending mandates.

Baseline Established and Leaders Identified

The report, which covers data from 2024, has established that year as the definitive baseline for tracking progress toward the mandatory ReFuelEU Aviation blending targets. Crucially, it was noted that only about 0.6% of the aviation fuel supplied throughout 2024 was represented by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The feasibility of meeting the subsequent 2030 target of 6% was assessed and it was indicated that this goal could be reached under optimistic production scenarios.

Significantly, five Member States were identified as the current leaders in SAF production, with commercial-scale output already being undertaken. These nations—Finland, France, Germany, Spain and Italy—are shouldering the majority of the European Union’s initial capacity for low-carbon aviation. Much of the current European Union Sustainable Aviation Fuel supply is accounted for by specific, large-scale facilities across these leading countries. These production hubs include Neste’s Porvoo refinery in Finland, TotalEnergies’ facilities at La Mède and Grandpuits in France, BP’s Lingen refinery in Germany, Repsol’s refineries in Spain and Eni’s new 400 kt-per-year Gela biorefinery in Italy.

Continued Development Across the European Bloc

While a large share of the current supply is concentrated in Finland, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, development continues to be recorded across other Member States. For example, a joint EU-funded study on regional production potential is currently being conducted by Estonia and Latvia. Furthermore, their first large-scale SAF plants are actively being built by Poland’s Orlen and Romania’s OMV, showing a commitment to future capacity. Policy initiatives are also being advanced; Ireland’s first national policy roadmap, for instance, was published in August 2025. In terms of offtake, agreements have been secured by Luxembourg’s Cargolux and Lux-Airport with Norsk e-Fuel. However, the report also noted a lack of current domestic capacity, as Malta, Lithuania and Slovenia currently report having none.

Market Shifts and Production Projections

The market outlook for Sustainable Aviation Fuel capacity growth was also detailed. EASA projects that the total European Union output could reach between 1.4 and 5.9 million tonnes by 2030, a range which is dependent on various factors such as overall buildout rates and the progress of investment. However, a significant area of concern was also identified: synthetic fuel projects. These initiatives were reported to remain behind schedule, with no facilities having yet reached the final investment decision stage.

The status of global investment was highlighted as an active and dynamic issue. In one example since the close of the summer, a $150 million investment fund for Sustainable Aviation Fuel was announced through a major airline partnership. Conversely, a major European project was recently scrapped when Shell closed a planned facility that would have been one of the continent’s largest processing centres. This decision was attributed to the necessity of balancing affordability with customer demands in the volatile fuels market.

Commission’s Confident Outlook on Future Targets

In light of the recent plant closure, confidence was expressed by the European Commission regarding the bloc’s ability to reach its mandated 2034 SAF targets. European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen told AVweb that the Commission remained confident in achieving the goals.

The spokesperson stated that, based on announced investments, projections showed that Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in the European Union was expected to reach the mandated SAF targets until 2034. Furthermore, it was noted that SAF producers and airlines were being encouraged by the Commission to produce and purchase SAF over and above the targets, respectively. Several measures were stated to be available for bridging the price gap between SAF and conventional aviation fuel. It was announced that the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, which is slated for adoption in the Autumn, would aim to further facilitate long-term SAF offtake agreements.

Itkonen also conveyed that the Commission was keeping a close watch on the fuels market as its development is attempted in accordance with ReFuelEU plans. Crucially, it was stressed that transparency for airlines on the price of SAF and the establishment of a competitive liquid SAF market would be key to incentivising airlines to buy SAF above the targets. The foundational contributions from Finland, France, Germany, Spain and Italy are seen as central to establishing the necessary industrial base for the European Union to meet these critical future Sustainable Aviation Fuel objectives.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and captured carbon combined with green hydrogen.
Kenya Airways’ experiment is therefore less about symbolism and more about testing feasibility within the constraints of African energy markets and infrastructure.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still prohibitively expensive, costing between two and four times more than conventional jet fuel.
Experts argue that regional alliances, such as between Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, could generate economies of scale to justify local refining and research investment.","Kenya Airways has operated its first intra-African flight using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a milestone that places the national carrier among the continent’s early adopters of renewable jet fuel technology. The Nairobi–Cape Town flight, completed under the SkyTeam Aviation Challenge 2025, used a 50 per cent blend of SAF attributes verified through global certification schemes. It marks a significant move by the airline to reduce its carbon footprint and aligns with international efforts to achieve net zero emissions in aviation by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and captured carbon combined with green hydrogen. When produced through Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, it can reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 85 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

The flight, operated under a mass balance system, represents not only a technical demonstration but a signal that Africa’s aviation industry is beginning to confront its share of the global climate challenge.

According to industry analysts, aviation accounts for around 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions but remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that Sustainable Aviation Fuel will deliver up to 65 per cent of the total emissions reduction needed for the industry to reach net zero by mid-century. Kenya Airways’ experiment is therefore less about symbolism and more about testing feasibility within the constraints of African energy markets and infrastructure.

The flight carried a blend of optimism and pragmatism. Kenya Airways said the SAF attributes were verified under globally recognized certification frameworks to ensure traceability and transparency.

Onboard, the airline introduced a series of low-waste initiatives, including upcycled blanket bags, reusable cutlery, and locally sourced Kenyan coffee and tea served in reusable cups. Cabin crew also engaged passengers in discussions on responsible travel practices, an approach that turns sustainability from a back-office metric into a visible in-flight experience.

Hellen Mwariri, Kenya Airways’ Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, described the initiative as evidence of what can be achieved when innovation is paired with collaboration. “This flight shows what can be achieved through partnership and creativity,” she said. “It’s a step towards practical solutions that reduce our impact while keeping operations efficient.”

Behind this optimism lies a set of economic and policy questions. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still prohibitively expensive, costing between two and four times more than conventional jet fuel. In an industry already constrained by thin profit margins and high operational costs, this price gap poses a serious challenge to adoption.

Analysts note that while airlines in Europe and North America benefit from government incentives and clear blending mandates, African carriers face fragmented policy environments, limited refining capacity and weak investment pipelines for renewable fuel production.

Kenya Airways’ move could, however, catalyze regional interest in domestic production. The airline has confirmed ongoing work with government agencies, local innovators and international partners, including IATA, SkyTeam and the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), to establish a local SAF production plant in Kenya by 2026. If successful, such a facility would position Kenya as an East African hub for low-carbon aviation fuel and potentially lower costs through local supply chains.

The global race toward SAF production capacity underscores this ambition. By 2024, the United States and the European Union had jointly accounted for nearly 90 per cent of global SAF output, thanks to a combination of blending mandates and fiscal incentives. Africa, despite being rich in bio-feedstock such as jatropha, camelina and waste oils, contributes less than 1 per cent.

Establishing local production in Kenya could therefore have multiplier effects: stimulating green manufacturing, supporting circular economy models through waste valorization, and reducing dependence on imported petroleum products that strain foreign exchange reserves.

From a sustainability standpoint, the broader challenge lies in scalability. Even at 50 per cent blending, a full network transition would require millions of litres annually. Kenya Airways alone consumed about 700 million litres of jet fuel before the pandemic, meaning that sustained decarbonisation will depend on both fuel availability and supportive regulation. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which mandates airlines to offset emissions on international routes, provides a framework but relies heavily on the development of alternative fuels to meet its long-term goals.

The symbolic value of Kenya Airways’ flight extends beyond corporate sustainability. It demonstrates how African airlines can use sustainability as a competitive asset, attracting environmentally conscious travellers and international partners. It also aligns with Kenya’s national climate agenda, which targets a 32 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero by 2050. In a continent where aviation supports millions of jobs, from tourism and horticulture to logistics, decarbonizing flight operations is both an environmental and economic imperative.

Practical sustainability will depend on continued collaboration between airlines, refineries, policymakers and financiers. Experts argue that regional alliances, such as between Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, could generate economies of scale to justify local refining and research investment.

Beyond environmental benefits, the emergence of a regional SAF supply chain could anchor new industries in waste processing, biofuel refining and logistics sectors with clear employment potential.

Kenya Airways’ milestone is a pragmatic demonstration of what transition can look like when driven by domestic initiative rather than external pressure. The flight does not resolve the cost problem, nor does it eliminate emissions overnight. But it offers a credible test case, one that moves the conversation from ambition to practice, and from pledges to proof.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1760686694733.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 17:00:01.696659

Repsol leads the €1.5 billion project, backed by EU funding, to deliver 200,000 tonnes of SAF yearly and cut aviation emissions by up to 90 per cent. Located in Axarquía, near Malaga’s airport, the facilities fall in line with Spain’s hydrogen strategy and promise economic growth and job creation.

Project details and timeline

Repsol, together with partners like Enagas, plans to build two 100 MW electrolysis plants in Malaga’s Axarquia region. Construction starts in 2026, with operations planned for 2029. The €1.5 billion investment, which includes €300 million from the EU Innovation Fund, supports Spain’s goal of 4 GW electrolysis capacity by 2030, as outlined in the PERTE plan.

What is SAF and how is it produced?

The plants will use electrolysis powered by renewable energy, primarily solar, to produce green hydrogen. The hydrogen is combined with captured CO₂ to create a kind of synthetic kerosene, a near-zero-emission fuel. The process achieves 85 per cent lifecycle greenhouse gas savings, according to IATA standards. Malaga’s 2,500 annual sunshine hours are hoped to cut power costs by 50 per cent, making the location ideal.

Environmental and economic benefits

Green hydrogen SAF could reduce aviation’s carbon footprint by 80 to 90 per cent, supporting the EU’s 6 per cent SAF mix demanded for 2030. Locally, it is said that the project will create 1,500 construction jobs and 300 permanent roles, increasing Malaga’s GDP by €200 million annually, according to an Andalusian impact study. This revitalises the region east of Malaga, hit by agricultural decline due to a series of severe droughts.

Challenges in scaling production

However, high costs and supply chain bottlenecks pose risks. Electrolysis equipment costs €1,200 per kW, with 20 per cent of components facing shortages. Grid upgrades are needed to handle renewable energy fluctuations and abrupt changes in power flow, which are said to have been behind the great power outage in Spain in April 2025. Yet, EU policies, like the €40 billion Hydrogen Bank, offset 40 per cent of costs, which will reduce private investment burdens.

Global context and airline impact

Malaga’s project follows other global precedents like California’s H2@Scale, with 15 SAF plants worldwide by 2024, per the IEA. Lower SAF prices, potentially €1.5 per litre by 2030, could drive airline adoption and meet rising demand projected at 17 billion litres.

Tewodros Getachew, CEO of EMC, and Richard Bennett, CEO of Sunbird Bioenergy Africa, emphasized the crucial role of government support in attracting private investment vital to Africa’s sustainable energy transition. Speaking at the event, Tewodros framed challenges such as climate change and sustainable development not as crises, but as calls to leadership and action. “Our vision is clear and unwavering: to transform Ethiopia into a beacon of green prosperity powered by clean energy, driven by a circular bioeconomy and innovation,” he said.

Drawing on EMC’s 18 years of experience, Tewodros noted that the corporation has been instrumental in the country’s wealth creation and is now aligning national goals with global sustainability objectives. The partnership with Sunbird Bioenergy Africa marks a significant step toward leveraging Ethiopia’s rich agricultural resources to produce clean energy.

Sunbird Bioenergy Africa brings extensive expertise in developing large-scale bioethanol and biofuel projects across the continent. Richard Bennett expressed strong confidence in Ethiopia’s market, attributing it to favorable policy frameworks. He thanked the Ethiopian government, ministries, and partners including the World Bank for fostering a conducive environment, highlighting key policies related to biofuels, blending obligations, and private sector participation.

“The existence of a raw material policy, biofuel blending mandates, and authorization of private investment has made it much easier for us to enter the market,” Bennett noted.

Sunbird’s business model integrates three core elements: an agricultural unit partnering with both large farms and small producers to ensure sustainable feedstock supply; a biorefinery converting agricultural raw materials into renewable fuels; and a fuel business focused on distribution.

The company is already the largest agricultural employer in Sierra Leone, operating a plant that produces 60 million liters of renewable fuel annually. In Zambia, Sunbird is developing a cassava-based biofuel project aimed at meeting 20% of the country’s petroleum demand. This initiative supports 500 direct jobs and 20,000 small-scale farmers.

Bennett explained that the model centers on replacing imported fuel paid for in foreign currency with locally produced alternatives: “Stop spending money in other countries. Buy from your local farmers.”

With EMC’s backing, bioenergy development in Ethiopia is gathering pace. The initial project phase will focus on converting cassava into ethanol. Cassava is favored due to its sustainability, suitability for smallholder farmers, and ability to maximize community involvement while minimizing carbon footprint.

The first phase aims to produce 60 million liters of ethanol annually, utilizing approximately 10,000 hectares of farmland and providing income for 10,000 farmers. This ethanol will meet E10 transportation fuel standards and growing demand for clean cooking fuel.

Highlighting the urgency of advancing the clean cooking sector, Bennett noted that despite established cookware factories backed by partners like Project Gaia, a shortage of local biofuels continues to constrain the market.

Bioethanol cooking fuel offers a sustainable alternative to charcoal, which remains a major contributor to urban air pollution and deforestation. Looking ahead, the partnership plans to conduct a feasibility study for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project designed to produce 40 million liters annually, supporting the aviation industry’s increasing need for renewable fuel blending.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Emc-Web.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:56:17.211456

Unlike prior models, it was also the first to feature only four cockpit windows.
Though there are only four cockpit windows, Boeing's design made each of them larger, which gives pilots ample visibility during operation.
Boeing had another reason to switch to four windows on the 787: These windows are heavy, and having fewer can cut back on weight.
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also contains a tucked away compartment in its design that includes basic sleeping accommodations for pilots on lengthier flights.","Since the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was revealed back in 2007, it has represented a few firsts in the aviation industry. It was the plane that Virgin Atlantic used for the first flight fully powered on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike prior models, it was also the first to feature only four cockpit windows.

This change was made possible because the Dreamliner uses composite carbon fiber-reinforced polymers in half of its construction, as opposed to relying mainly on aluminum like previous models. This material is more elastic and is also why the Boeing 787's wings can bend a lot further than you might think. While other commercial aircraft have incorporated this material in the past, the 787 included more of it than ever before.

Though there are only four cockpit windows, Boeing's design made each of them larger, which gives pilots ample visibility during operation. These windows on the flight deck feature several layers, including a gold film which defogs the glass and is similar to the system used in fighter jet canopies. Boeing had another reason to switch to four windows on the 787: These windows are heavy, and having fewer can cut back on weight.

The lack of additional cockpit windows on the Dreamliner is directly related to Boeing's desire to produce a more efficient passenger aircraft by reducing weight. This is also why the Boeing 787 doesn't have winglets. Jet fuel can comprise as much as 30% of an airlines operating budget. By designing an aircraft that is lighter, airline carriers can potentially use less fuel and reduce the costs of flights. Boeing was largely successful on this front, as the company claims that the 787 offers 20% greater fuel efficiency than comparable models.

Some iterations of the 787 can also fly farther than its 777 predecessors, although the latter can hold more passengers. According to Boeing, the Dreamliner has opened up an additional 425 nonstop routes across the globe that were previously unavailable. Instead of having larger planes that went to capitals or other central locations, the 787 allowed the company to instead travel to smaller airports with more direct flights and fewer passengers.

Pilots who have flown the 787 have noted that the aircraft does climb well due to the weight reduction measures. Others have commented that the 787's cockpit is exceptionally ergonomic, with fewer windows not being an issue at all. As retired British Airways Captain Michael Napier said via Key.Aero, ""The Dreamliner flight deck is a very comfortable working environment — it is quiet, and the large display screens make it feel uncluttered and very roomy.""

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also contains a tucked away compartment in its design that includes basic sleeping accommodations for pilots on lengthier flights. One Dreamliner variant, the 787-9, is being used by Qantas to fly from Perth, Australia to London, England, which is a trip that lasts for 17 hours. Fortunately, the aircraft is equipped with a crew rest area, which provides a dedicated space for recuperation. It's even sometimes furnished with bedding from first-class.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/why-the-boeing-787-has-four-cockpit-windows-instead-of-six/l-intro-1761173206.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 08:56:23.321613

Achieving this goal will require the construction of thousands of clean-fuel plants, placing long-term financial pressure on both the aviation industry and travellers.
Sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF, is viewed as the most viable short-term solution, though global production remains low.
Only two million tonnes are produced annually compared to the 500 million tonnes needed.
The overall cost of reaching net zero in global aviation is projected to hit $7.2 trillion, which breaks down to $268 billion each year.","Airlines are targeting carbon neutrality by 2050, but the path to sustainability involves high costs that may be passed on to passengers. Industry estimates indicate the average plane ticket could rise by as much as $1,350 by mid-century, adding approximately $54 per passenger each year. Achieving this goal will require the construction of thousands of clean-fuel plants, placing long-term financial pressure on both the aviation industry and travellers.

There is currently a large gap between what is required and what is available. Sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF, is viewed as the most viable short-term solution, though global production remains low. Only two million tonnes are produced annually compared to the 500 million tonnes needed. Airlines are urging governments to subsidise SAF as they did for wind and solar energy.

The overall cost of reaching net zero in global aviation is projected to hit $7.2 trillion, which breaks down to $268 billion each year. Next-generation aircraft powered by electric or hydrogen energy face major challenges, especially for long-haul routes. Many in the industry now believe that aircraft in 2050 will resemble current models, but will instead run on cleaner fuels. Some airlines and manufacturers are prioritising enhancements to existing designs, particularly with longer, thinner wings to improve fuel efficiency.

The broader consequences are significant. Fare increases will vary across regions depending on factors like government support and how quickly technology is adopted. Although the transition will be complex, industry leaders agree it is necessary and ultimately positive, expanding travel opportunities and boosting economies, though likely at a higher cost to passengers.

Instacart

Founded: 2012

Founder: Apoorva Mehta

Amazon Role: Supply Chain Engineer

Apoorva Mehta founded Instacart in 2012 after working as a supply chain engineer at Amazon. His experience with Amazon’s fulfillment operations proved invaluable when he identified a gap in the online grocery market. The inspiration struck when Mehta, staring at his empty refrigerator in his San Francisco apartment, realized that while consumers could order almost anything online, groceries remained stubbornly offline.

Before Instacart succeeded, Mehta had attempted 20 different startup ideas after leaving Amazon in 2010. His persistence finally paid off when he built the first version of the Instacart app in just three weeks. The company’s breakthrough came when Mehta missed the Y Combinator application deadline but managed to secure a meeting by using his own app to deliver a six-pack of beer to a Y Combinator partner—a creative move that earned him admission to the accelerator’s 2012 batch.

Instacart went public in September 2023 at a $9.9 billion valuation, transforming Mehta into a billionaire with a net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. The company now serves more than 14,000 U.S. cities and has delivered over 900 million orders since its founding.

Amazon Role: Software engineers

Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal had both graduated from IIT Delhi, and had found themselves working at Amazon in Bangalore. At that point, they had an idea — Amazon didn’t yet operate in India, and the duo felt that they could build a similar service in the country. They quit their Amazon jobs and founded Flipkart in 2008. The followed Amazon’s playbook exactly — they started off with books, and slowly added other products. In 2014, Amazon finally began its operations in India, but it was too late — Flipkart by then was already a major player. The two companies slugged it out in India’s bruising e-commerce wars, and just as it seemed that Amazon was gaining the upper hand, Walmart swooped in and acquired Flipkart at a valuation of $21 billion. Both Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal exited Flipkart as billionaires, and Amazon continues to compete with Walmart-owned Flipkart in India’s e-commerce space to this day.

Jeff Lawson co-founded Twilio in 2008 after spending time as one of the first product managers for Amazon Web Services (AWS). At Amazon, Lawson witnessed firsthand how offering infrastructure as a service could be transformative. “This whole idea that you can offer infrastructure as a service was kind of mind-blowing,” he told Forbes in a 2016 interview.

Lawson’s experience at Amazon profoundly shaped Twilio’s culture and operations. He imported critical practices from Amazon, including the focus on customer-first principles and the practice of writing long-form memos instead of relying on PowerPoint presentations for decision-making. These “write it down” practices became core to Twilio’s operational DNA.

Twilio went public in June 2016 in one of the year’s most successful tech IPOs, with shares surging 92% on the first day of trading. The company provides cloud-based communications infrastructure, enabling developers to embed voice, text, video, and other communications features into their applications through simple API calls. Lawson served as CEO until January 2024, building the company into a multi-billion dollar enterprise.

Quora

Founded: 2009

Founders: Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever

Amazon Role (Cheever): Software Engineer

Charlie Cheever co-founded Quora in June 2009 with fellow Facebook engineer Adam D’Angelo. Before Facebook, Cheever worked at Amazon after graduating from Harvard, where he had developed a database for fellow students to locate their classmates’ dormitories—a project that partially inspired Mark Zuckerberg’s FaceMash.

Quora was created to address a fundamental question: Why isn’t there a place on the internet where questions can be answered by people who actually know the answers? The platform distinguished itself through its commitment to quality, implementing strong moderation policies and attracting high-profile users who provided authoritative responses.

The platform officially launched in June 2010 and quickly became popular among the tech community, eventually achieving mainstream adoption. Quora reached unicorn status and continues to operate as a leading question-and-answer platform, with D’Angelo remaining as CEO. Cheever stepped back from day-to-day operations in 2012 to pursue other ventures, including co-founding Expo, a platform for mobile app development.

ThoughtSpot

Founded: 2012

Founder: Shashank Gupta (co-founder)

Amazon Role: Principal Engineer

Shashank Gupta co-founded ThoughtSpot in 2012 alongside six other co-founders, including Ajeet Singh (CEO). Gupta brought his search experience from both Amazon and Yahoo to help develop ThoughtSpot’s innovative natural language search over data feature, which allows users to query business data using simple search terms rather than complex SQL queries.

At Amazon, Gupta gained deep expertise in building large-scale systems and search infrastructure. He later used his automated data quality experience from Meta (Facebook) to inform ThoughtSpot’s approach to data observability and quality.

ThoughtSpot achieved unicorn status in 2018 when it raised $145 million in Series D funding at a valuation exceeding $1 billion. The company has since raised additional funding, reaching a $4.2 billion valuation. ThoughtSpot’s AI-powered analytics platform enables non-technical users to conduct self-service data analysis, democratizing access to business intelligence across organizations.

PagerDuty

Founded: 2009

Founders: Alex Solomon, Andrew Miklas, and Baskar Puvanathasan

Amazon Role: All three co-founders worked as software engineers at Amazon

PagerDuty was born from the founders’ direct experience with Amazon’s on-call culture. When Amazon shifted from a monolithic code base to a microservices architecture, engineers became responsible not just for writing code, but for deploying, managing, and fixing their systems in production. This meant carrying a pager and being on “pager duty” when issues arose—a practice that inspired the company’s name.

The three University of Waterloo graduates founded PagerDuty in Toronto in February 2009 after recognizing that other companies would need similar on-call management tools as they adopted DevOps practices. They initially bootstrapped the company with modest goals, joking that their dream was to reach $20,000 in monthly recurring revenue and retire to drink champagne on a beach.

After being accepted into Y Combinator on their fourth attempt, PagerDuty raised $1.9 million in seed funding in 2010. The company went public in April 2019 and now serves over 10,000 customers globally, including major enterprises. The platform has become essential infrastructure for IT operations teams managing digital services.

Notably, founder Alex Solomon demonstrated exceptional self-awareness by stepping down as CEO in 2016 to bring in Jennifer Tejada, recognizing that the company needed different leadership skills to scale to the next level.

Convoy

Founded: 2015

Founders: Dan Lewis and Grant Goodale

Amazon Role: Lewis was General Manager of New Shopping Experiences; Goodale was a software development manager

Dan Lewis and Grant Goodale left Amazon in 2015 to found Convoy, a digital freight brokerage startup aimed at disrupting the analog, fragmented trucking industry. Lewis had been responsible for Amazon’s shopping experience innovations, while Goodale managed software development teams.

The co-founders applied insights from Amazon’s logistics operations to create a platform that matched truck drivers with shippers through a mobile app, eliminating the need for phone calls and faxes. The vision was to reduce waste, increase capacity utilization, and improve earnings for truck drivers while lowering costs for shippers.

Convoy attracted heavyweight investors including Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Marc Benioff, and Al Gore, reaching a peak valuation of $3.8 billion in 2022. However, despite raising over $900 million in funding, the company faced challenges from a freight recession and the capital-intensive nature of the business. Convoy ceased operations in October 2023, with its assets acquired by Flexport for $16 million. The company’s story serves as a cautionary tale about timing and the challenges of achieving profitability in low-margin industries.

Workato

Founded: 2013

Founder: Dimitris Kogias (co-founder)

Dimitris Kogias co-founded Workato in December 2013 alongside Vijay Tella (CEO), Gautham Viswanathan, Harish Shetty, and Alexey Timanovskiy. The founding team had previously worked together at TIBCO Software, where they developed BusinessWorks, an integration platform that became the foundation for Workato.

Workato provides an enterprise automation platform that enables companies to integrate applications and automate business workflows. The platform combines integration platform as a service (iPaaS), robotic process automation, and business process automation capabilities, all wrapped in a low-code/no-code interface accessible to both IT and business teams.

The company achieved unicorn status and raised $200 million in January 2021 at a $5.7 billion valuation. Workato supports integration with over 1,000 applications and has become a leader in the enterprise automation space, serving businesses that need to connect their increasingly complex technology stacks.

Upwork: The Freelance Marketplace

Founded: 1998 (as Elance)

Founder: Srini Anumolu (co-founder)

Srini Anumolu co-founded Elance in 1998 with Beerud Sheth and Sanjay Noronha in a Jersey City apartment. While Anumolu’s specific role at Amazon is not well-documented, the company he helped create would eventually become one of the world’s largest freelance marketplaces.

Elance initially focused on fixed-price project work before merging with oDesk (founded in 2003) in 2013 to form Elance-oDesk. The combined entity was rebranded as Upwork in 2015. The platform connects businesses with freelancers across more than 5,000 skill categories, from software development to graphic design to writing.

Upwork went public in October 2018, raising $187 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. By 2017, the platform reported 14 million users across 180 countries with $1 billion in annual freelancer billings. The company has played a significant role in the growth of the gig economy, providing infrastructure that makes remote work more accessible and efficient.

BOOM Supersonic

Founded: 2014

Founder: Blake Scholl

Amazon Role: Software Engineer

Blake Scholl founded Boom Supersonic in 2014 with the goal of making high-speed travel mainstream and enabling a new world of human connection, starting his career at Amazon as a software engineer where he developed software for personalized and automated merchandising. By age 24, he was responsible for initiatives that generated $300 million in revenue.

After leaving Amazon, Scholl co-founded mobile technology startup Kima Labs, which was acquired by Groupon in 2012. His love of aviation and frustration at never having the chance to fly on the Concorde led him to pursue an ambitious dream: reviving supersonic commercial flight.

In 2025, Boom Technology became the first private American company to build a crewed plane that flies at supersonic speeds. The company is developing the Overture airliner, designed to fly at Mach 1.7 and carry passengers across oceans in half the time of conventional aircraft. With orders from United, American, and Japan Airlines, Scholl aims to make sustainable supersonic travel mainstream using 100% sustainable aviation fuel, targeting passenger flights by 2030.

Chronosphere

Founded: 2019

Founders: Martin Mao and Rob Skillington

Martin Mao, co-founder and CEO of Chronosphere, previously held roles at leading tech companies including Uber, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. He and co-founder Rob Skillington first met at Microsoft and later worked together at Uber, where they built M3, an open-source metrics engine that became the foundation for Chronosphere’s platform.

Chronosphere reached unicorn status in less than three years, announcing a $200 million Series C round in 2021 that propelled its valuation past $1 billion. The company later raised an additional $115 million in growth funding at a valuation of $1.6 billion.

Chronosphere provides cloud-native data observability software that helps companies using cloud-native architecture monitor their data. Reaching unicorn level with a team of only 80 people in just 2.3 years placed Chronosphere in the top 10 fastest B2B SaaS unicorns ever, according to Pitchbook.

Function of Beauty

Founded: 2015

Co-Founder: Joshua Maciejewski

Amazon Role: Operations Manager

Joshua Maciejewski worked as an Operations Manager at Amazon from August 2015 to April 2016. He co-founded Function of Beauty in 2014 (launched 2015) alongside MIT grad Zahir Dossa and cosmetic chemist Hien Nguyen.

The company created a revolutionary approach to beauty products: allowing customers to customize their own shampoo, conditioner, and other hair and skin care products based on their individual needs and preferences. Instead of choosing from pre-made formulas, customers fill out a questionnaire about their hair or skin, and Function of Beauty creates a unique formula just for them.

Function of Beauty has raised over $247 million in six rounds of funding, with the last one in January 2022. The company has expanded from its direct-to-consumer website to retail partnerships with Target and Sephora, demonstrating the mainstream appeal of personalized beauty products.

Gupshup: Conversational Messaging Platform

Founded: 2004

Co-Founder: Rakesh Mathur

Rakesh Mathur is a serial entrepreneur who had sold his startup Junglee to Amazon. He co-founded Gupshup (originally called Webaroo) in 2004 with Beerud Sheth and others to address the fragmented state of mobile communication.

Gupshup raised $100 million in a Series F round from Tiger Global Management in 2021, taking its total valuation to $1.4 billion. The company helps over 100,000 businesses and developers build messaging platforms and delivers over 6 billion messages per month across more than 30 messaging channels.

The company initially focused on SMS messaging before pivoting to become a comprehensive conversational AI platform. Gupshup provides tools for businesses to create AI-powered conversational experiences across WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and other messaging channels.

Jet.com: E-Commerce Innovator

Founded: 2014

Founder: Marc Lore

Amazon Role: CEO of Quidsi (acquired by Amazon)

Marc Lore was the CEO and co-founder of Quidsi, the parent company of Diapers.com, which was sold to Amazon in 2011 for $545 million, and Lore then worked for Amazon for over two years.

In 2014, Lore founded the eCommerce company Jet, and Walmart bought Jet.com less than a year after launch in a deal valued at $3.3 billion. Jet distinguished itself through dynamic pricing that adjusted based on shopping cart contents and customer choices, offering lower prices when customers opted for slower shipping or waived return rights.

Though Jet.com itself was eventually discontinued as a standalone site, the acquisition proved transformative for Walmart’s e-commerce capabilities. Lore became president and CEO of Walmart U.S. eCommerce from 2016 to 2021, helping accelerate the retailer’s digital transformation.

Outreach started as GroupTalent, a recruiting platform that was struggling financially. The co-founders were about two months away from being out of cash when they decided to pivot, building an AI engine that could send out emails with personalised messages and follow up on responses.

In just five years, the company got a billion-dollar valuation and became a unicorn, doubling revenue every year for four years. Outreach reached a $4.4 billion valuation after raising $200 million in 2021. The platform now provides sales engagement tools that help companies optimize every interaction throughout the customer lifecycle.

光催化SAF生产 研究人员系统评估了系列WOx/ZrOx功能化催化剂在无溶剂条件下催化糠醛（FAL）与环戊酮（CPO）醛醇交叉缩合的性能。结果表明，所有WOx/ZrOx催化剂在紫外光（365 nm）和可见光下均表现出活性，而缺乏表面酸性位点的纯SBA-15和PMO硅胶则转化率极低（<3%）。在紫外光照射下，所有催化剂的质均一化活性均显著提升，其中WOx/ZrOx/PMO(50%)的提升幅度最大（3-4倍）。催化活性不仅取决于表面酸密度，更与PMO骨架中苯基基团调控的表面极性和电子效应密切相关。 通过能带结构分析发现，PMO的引入调节了WOx/ZrOx异质结处的电子环境。随着PMO含量增加，催化剂的带隙（Eg）从SBA-15负载催化剂的4.69 eV减小至PMO(50-100%)的4.25 eV，导致导带底（CBM）从-2.18 eV上移至-1.66 eV，而价带顶（VBM）保持强氧化性（约2.5 eV）。这种能带结构的优化有利于光生电荷的分离和迁移，特别是空穴参与的环戊酮光活化形成烯醇盐（FCp-OH）这一决速步反应。PMO骨架中π-共轭苯基团与WOx/ZrOx异质结的紧密邻近，充当了导电通路，显著增强了从光活化异质结向反应物的电荷分离与转移。 产物分布分析证实了反应遵循级联机制：先由环戊酮光活化形成FCp-OH，再经Br?nsted和Lewis酸位点协同催化脱水生成FCp，最后进行第二次醛醇缩合生成F2Cp。研究还发现，催化剂的疏水性扮演了关键角色。当向反应体系中故意添加水（5 mmol）时，高BTSB含量的催化剂（50%和100%）反而表现出活性提升（分别提高1.6和3.0倍），这归因于疏水微环境将水排出，推动了脱水平衡向产物方向移动。 CPO与FAL的摩尔比强烈影响催化性能和产物分布。当比例≤3:1时，质量平衡高（>95%），表明C-C偶联高效进行，副产物少。当比例>3:1时，质量平衡下降（<85%），同时催化活性和FAL转化率降低，这与胡敏素沉积和活性位点暂时性堵塞有关，可能源于过量的酮发生了自缩合或与中间体的副反应。 催化剂稳定性评估显示，性能最优的WOx/ZrOx/PMO(50%)在三次循环使用后（每次循环后仅用乙酸乙酯洗涤再生），其FAL转化率、初始速率和产物选择性均保持稳定。对使用后的催化剂进行元素分析发现表面有碳积累（一次循环后约36%），但经溶剂洗涤后可轻易去除（残留碳约2%），表明失活主要源于可逆的物理吸附有机物堵塞位点。而未经过再生直接使用的催化剂则活性显著下降（~35%），表面碳含量高达~61%。 3.
结论 本研究成功展示了一种克服生物质转化催化中水致失活难题的新策略。通过将WOx/ZrOx活性位点与具有可调疏水性和电子特性的苯基功能化PMO载体相结合，制备出了高性能的光催化剂。该催化剂不仅通过异质结结构和苯基介导的电荷转移增强了光催化效率，还利用其疏水表面有效排斥水分子，维持了酸性位点的活性。在优化条件下（CPO:FAL = 3:1, 365 nm UV, 80°C, 6 h），WOx/ZrOx/PMO(50%)实现了92.9%的FAL转化率和49.9%的F2Cp收率，其质均一化活性是SBA-15负载类比物的两倍，且催化剂稳定性好，易于再生。这项工作为设计用于规模化、高能效生物质转化为SAF过程的稳定、高选择性光催化剂提供了新的设计范式，直接支持了航空业的脱碳目标。未来通过进一步优化介孔疏水性、孔径和酸密度，有望在更广泛的生物质转化反应中取得突破。","《Applied Catalysis O: Open》：Light or acid?

航空业是全球经济与科技发展的关键推动力，但同时也是严峻的环境挑战者。它贡献了约2.5%的全球能源相关CO2排放，若考虑巡航高度产生的非CO2效应（如氮氧化物、水蒸气和烟尘排放导致的凝结尾迹和云层形成），其对气候变暖的实际影响更为显著。因此，发展可持续航空燃料（Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF）已成为航空业脱碳战略的核心。利用来源丰富、成本低廉的非食用木质纤维素生物质（第二代生物质原料）生产SAF，是符合循环经济理念的理想路径。其中，由富含木糖的半纤维素脱水得到的平台分子糠醛（Furfural, FAL）因其 versatile 的化学反应性，成为升级制取SAF的关键中间体。

然而，在将FAL等C5-C6中间体通过醛醇缩合等C-C偶联反应转化为符合航空燃油C8-C16烃范围的过程中，一个主要的挑战是反应过程中持续产生的水。这些水（无论是原料固有还是原位生成）会引发糠醛水解生成高粘度聚合物（如胡敏素），导致催化剂表面结垢、快速失活和产物收率下降。传统的固体酸催化剂（如沸石、混合氧化物、酸性树脂）由于其微孔和/或亲水特性，对水致失活尤为敏感。因此，开发兼具介孔结构（利于质量传输）和定制化表面疏水性（以排斥水分子）的催化剂至关重要。

光催化策略为缓解失活过程（如胡敏素形成）提供了额外途径，因其可在更温和的条件下进行。近年来，周期性介孔有机硅（Periodic Mesoporous Organosilicas, PMOs）作为多功能催化剂载体受到关注，其通过将有机桥联硅氧烷基团（如双(三乙氧基硅基)苯，BTSB）作为骨架组成部分，能够精确调控表面特性（如疏水性/亲水性），并促进与活性相的协同相互作用，从而增强水相耐受催化。

在此背景下，由Vannia C. dos Santos-Durndell、Mark A. Isaacs、Jinesh C. Manayil和Lee J. Durndell共同完成的研究，在《Applied Catalysis O: Open》上发表题为“Light or acid?

Sustainable fuel production and policy Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels comprising nearly 80% of this figure.
Under these conditions, sustainable fuel use could nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and increase to 28 exajoules by 2035.
Cost challenges and investment needs A major hurdle is that sustainable fuels are currently more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts.
Technology diversification and regional focus The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve.","An influential report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) provides a detailed analysis of the global landscape for sustainable fuels.

The assessment prepared to support COP30 suggests that the utilisation of sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels could quadruple by 2035.

This growth is contingent on the complete implementation of existing and newly announced policies alongside substantial investment and innovation.

According to the IEA's analysis under the leadership of Executive Director Fatih Birol, the IEA is advocating for sustainable fuels to become a critical component of the future global energy mix.

The report examines the necessary pathways to accelerate the production and use of biofuels, biogas and hydrogen-based fuels across key sectors like transport, heavy industry and power generation.

Sustainable fuel production and policy

Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels comprising nearly 80% of this figure.

In 2024, these fuels contributed to a reduction in global oil demand by approximately 2.5 million barrels per day and decreased the reliance on imported transport fuels for some nations by 5-15%.

The report notes that ""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled"".

However, the current trajectory points towards gradual progress rather than the rapid acceleration needed to meet climate targets.

The IEA presents an accelerated case scenario where planned policies are fully legislated, market barriers are dismantled and production capacity is expanded. Under these conditions, sustainable fuel use could nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and increase to 28 exajoules by 2035.

The transport sector would continue to be the main source of demand, making up half of sustainable fuel consumption in 2035.

This would cover 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation and 35% of shipping needs.

The private sector also recognises the importance of government backing.

Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of RegenRate, says: ""We need policy on our side.

""We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality"".

Cost challenges and investment needs

A major hurdle is that sustainable fuels are currently more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts.

For instance, electrolytic hydrogen is about 3.8 times more costly and biomethanol is 3.7 times the price of conventional fuels.

Despite these higher costs, the impact on consumer prices is expected to be modest. A 15% blend of sustainable aviation fuel could raise ticket prices by 5-7% while steel produced with low-emissions hydrogen would add less than 1% to the price of an electric vehicle.

The report stresses that ""policies that address only one dimension risk leaving critical gaps,"" calling for integrated frameworks that combine long-term demand signals and support for new technologies.

To achieve this accelerated deployment, cumulative investments from 2024 to 2035 could reach US$1.5tn. This investment would also fuel job growth, with direct employment projected to almost triple to around two million jobs by 2035.

Liquid and gaseous biofuels would account for two-thirds of this increase. Data shows investment in sustainable fuels grew by 20% between 2023 and 2024, spurred by policies in the United States and Brazil for liquid biofuels and the European Union's REPowerEU Plan for biogas.

Technology diversification and regional focus

The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve. While liquid and gaseous biofuels are expected to retain a two-thirds share in 2035, low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives are projected to grow from just 1% today to one-third of total use.

This change highlights a substantial increase in funding for hydrogen-based solutions.

""With US$1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035 and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping chemicals and beyond,"" explains Antonio Villaluenga, Vice President of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International.

It is important to recognise that investment strategies will differ based on geography and resource availability. The report suggests that ""National shares, mixes and volumes would still vary widely depending on regional conditions"".

The IEA concludes that no single fuel or feedstock can satisfy global demand alone. Instead, a unified effort is required to drive progress across multiple fronts, including expanding established markets, developing new ones and commercialising emerging technologies.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 05:56:09.648643

Diketahui, ajang Penghargaan Soebroto merupakan bentuk penghargaan tertinggi dari Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM). Penghargaan ini ditujukan bagi perusahaan dan lembaga yang berkontribusi besar terhadap kemajuan sektor energi dan sumber daya mineral di Indonesia.

“Atas nama jajaran Direksi, saya mengapresiasi sumbangsih seluruh Perwira Pertamina yang telah memberikan kontribusi terbaik bagi industri energi nasional. Kami juga berterima kasih kepada Kementerian ESDM atas penghargaan yang diberikan kepada Pertamina,” ujar Simon dalam acara penganugerahan Penghargaan Soebroto 2025 di Jakarta, dikutip dari keterangan resmi Minggu 26 Oktober 2025.

“Sejalan dengan arahan Menteri ESDM, Pertamina berkomitmen untuk bersinergi dengan berbagai pihak agar mampu mendukung tercapainya ketahanan energi nasional, sebagaimana diamanatkan Presiden Prabowo Subianto,” tegas Simon.

Pada kesempatan yang sama, Kementerian ESDM juga meluncurkan logo baru yang mengusung filosofi Pancar Dipa.

Dengan 11 penghargaan ini, Pertamina semakin menegaskan posisinya sebagai perusahaan penggerak transisi dan kemandirian energi nasional, sejalan dengan komitmen perusahaan untuk terus menghadirkan energi bersih, berkelanjutan, dan berdaulat bagi Indonesia.

Pertamina Dorong Swasembada Energi dan Ekonomi Hijau Lewat Ekosistem Sustainable Aviation Fuel

PT Pertamina (Persero) mempertegas langkahnya dalam transisi energi nasional dengan mengembangkan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

SAF yang dikembangkan Pertamina merupakan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan yang diperuntukkan untuk pesawat terbang.

Langkah ini sekaligus menandai ambisi Pertamina demi menjadikan Indonesia sebagai pusat pasokan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan di Asia Tenggara.

Komitmen tersebut disampaikan Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis Pertamina, Agung Wicaksono dalam ajang 15th International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) Regional Stakeholder Meeting Southeast Asia di Jakarta, Kamis 23 Oktober 2025.

“Peluang pengembangan SAF ini berawal dari visi Presiden kita, Presiden Prabowo Subianto, yang tertuang dalam ASTA CITA, delapan prinsip dasar pembangunan nasional,” ujar Agung lewat keterangan resmi, Jumat 24 Oktober 2025.

Dalam paparannya berjudul Advancing Indonesia’s Sustainability Commitment through Pertamina’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Ecosystem, Agung menegaskan bahwa pengembangan SAF bukan sekadar proyek bisnis, melainkan kontribusi Pertamina terhadap visi nasional menuju ekonomi hijau dan swasembada energi.

Ia menjelaskan, arah kebijakan itu sejalan dengan Strategi Pertumbuhan Ganda Pertamina, yang menyeimbangkan bisnis energi konvensional seperti hulu migas, kilang, dan ritel bahan bakar dengan pengembangan bisnis rendah karbon di masa depan.

“Pada satu sisi, Pertamina tetap mengembangkan bisnis warisan seperti sektor hulu migas, kilang, dan ritel bahan bakar sebagai sumber bisnis utama. Sedangkan pada sisi lain, kami membangun bisnis rendah karbon untuk memastikan keberlanjutan energi di masa depan,” jelas Agung.

Ekosistem SAF: Dari Jelantah Jadi Energi Penerbangan

Pertamina kini memusatkan perhatian pada pembangunan ekosistem biofuel terintegrasi, mencakup produksi SAF, pengembangan energi panas bumi (geothermal), serta penerapan teknologi Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) untuk mendukung target nasional Net Zero Emission (NZE).

Indonesia disebut memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan SAF karena ketersediaan bahan baku melimpah, khususnya dari minyak jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO). Pertamina telah membangun rantai ekosistem lengkap mulai dari pengumpulan UCO hingga pengolahan dan pemanfaatannya sebagai bahan bakar pesawat.

Dalam ekosistem ini, Subholding Kilang Pertamina International (KPI) berperan mengolah minyak jelantah menjadi SAF melalui fasilitas co-processing. Pertamina Patra Niaga menangani distribusi bahan bakar, sementara Pelita Air Service, maskapai milik Pertamina, menjadi pengguna langsung SAF dalam operasional penerbangan.

“Dengan demikian, kami memiliki rantai ekosistem lengkap. Mulai dari pengumpulan minyak jelantah hingga produksi SAF, lalu penggunaannya dalam penerbangan. Suplai UCO berpotensi meningkat seiring dengan meningkatnya permintaan dari kawasan, Eropa, dan Amerika Serikat,” papar Agung.

Kilang Cilacap dan Plaju Jadi Basis Produksi SAF

Pertamina juga memperluas kapasitas produksi SAF di dua lokasi strategis, yaitu Kilang Cilacap dan Kilang Plaju. Kilang Cilacap saat ini mampu memproduksi sekitar 238 ribu kiloliter SAF per tahun dengan teknologi co-processing yang memanfaatkan 2,4% bahan baku UCO. Produksi ini akan terus meningkat seiring penambahan fasilitas baru.

Langkah ini memperkuat posisi Pertamina sebagai pemain utama dalam energi berkelanjutan kawasan. SAF disebut mampu mengurangi hingga 84 persen emisi karbon dari aktivitas penerbangan internasional.

Dengan kemampuan tersebut, SAF menjadi inovasi kunci dalam upaya dekarbonisasi sektor transportasi udara.

“Keberhasilan pengembangan SAF merupakan bukti nyata bahwa ekonomi sirkular dapat berjalan di Indonesia dan Asia Tenggara,” tegas Agung.

Sebagai perusahaan energi nasional, Pertamina menegaskan komitmennya mendukung target Net Zero Emission 2060 dengan memperkuat inisiatif yang sejalan dengan Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) dan prinsip Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis.

“Dampaknya, SAF dapat mengurangi hingga 84 persen emisi karbon dari penerbangan internasional. Kami berharap dapat terus bekerja sama untuk mengembangkan SAF bagi Indonesia dan dunia,” tutup Agung.

The stock has continued a steady upward trend over the past week and month. Investors are taking stock of this momentum as they consider the company’s recent annual growth numbers.

Calumet’s recent momentum comes after a stretch of volatility earlier this year. The 19% share price return over the past 90 days shows sentiment is improving even as the one-year total return remains mildly negative. This pattern hints at building optimism around the company’s growth story.

If you’re weighing your next investment move, now’s a smart time to broaden your search and discover

With shares now hovering close to analyst targets after months of gains, the key question remains: does Calumet still offer room for upside, or has the recent rally fully captured its future potential?

Most Popular Narrative: 4.4% Overvalued

Calumet is trading just above the most popular narrative’s estimate of fair value, with its last close almost matching the newly lifted target. Behind this close gap are bold expectations about cash flows and future margins, setting the tone for an ambitious outlook.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026. This will enable Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs, capturing premiums of $1-$2 per gallon over renewable diesel and tapping into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally. This is likely to drive a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

Wondering what’s powering this fair value call? The real surprise comes from a combination of sudden profit turnaround, accelerated revenue growth, and a future valuation multiple that breaks the industry mold. What financial leaps and risks are hidden in their math? Find out where expectations collide with reality in the deep dive.

Result: Fair Value of $19.25 (OVERVALUED)

However, persistent regulatory uncertainty and Calumet's high debt load could quickly change sentiment, making future gains less certain than recent momentum suggests.

Another View: Sales Multiple Signals Value

Looking at Calumet’s valuation through the lens of its price-to-sales ratio, the story changes. Calumet trades at 0.4x sales, not only far lower than the US Oil and Gas industry average of 1.5x, but also below its fair ratio of 0.5x. This suggests room for the market to re-rate the stock, or a caution flag if industry enthusiasm fades. Which metric will prove more reliable as the company evolves?

ATR Calls on EU to protect regional airlines: As Europe faces the dual challenge of reducing emissions while preserving the mobility of its communities and businesses, ATR urges EU policymakers to adopt a proportionate, inclusive, and performance-based approach to regulation – one that reflects the realities of regional operators and supports their vital role in Europe’s mobility network. Regional airlines are the backbone of European connectivity. They serve communities that larger carriers won’t reach, fly where rail won’t go, where ferries are seasonal, and where roads are impractical. They connect students to universities, patients to hospitals, and families to each other. Yet, despite their efficiency and essential role, regional operators are facing increasing regulatory pressure. The ongoing implementation of the Fit for 55 package risks undermining the very operators who are already doing the most with the least. “Regional airlines are more than just carriers, they’re lifelines,” says Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, Chief Executive Officer of ATR. “They serve the most essential routes and are already leading the way in low-emission aviation. We must protect them, not penalise them.”

The new agreement makes United the first commercial airline to purchase SAF for use on flights from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington D.C. As part of the agreement, Neste will supply neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ to United Airlines. The sustainable aviation fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel before use to meet jet fuel specifications. Neste began the SAF deliveries to United at George Bush Airport in July and they will continue until the end of October 2025. Deliveries of SAF to Newark Airport and Dulles Airport started in September 2025 and are set to continue until the end of 2025. The fuel is delivered to each airport via existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Houston. This new agreement builds on the long-term partnership between Neste and United. Neste has been supplying SAF to United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport since August 2024, after the SAF purchase credit was enacted in Illinois, making United the first airline to use SAF at the airport. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel has also been used by the airline at San Francisco International Airport in California, where the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is supporting the use of renewable fuels.

Embraer celebrates Fort Worth MRO groundbreaking: Embraer held a groundbreaking ceremony recently to mark the start of construction on its new Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility for commercial jets at Perot Field Alliance Airport in Fort Worth.

Three per cent of flights generate 80% of the warming effect from contrails, and three-quarters of flights generate no warming (or even some cooling).","Discussion of this and other aspects of aviation and environment at the Workers' Ecology Reading Group Sunday, 26 October 2025 ⋅20:00 – 22:00 • Zoomlink bit.ly/eco-rg • Eventbrite

A recent article by Hannah Ritchie on ""Sustainability by Numbers"" tells us that nearly half the current global-warming impact of aviation comes not from its CO2 emissions but from ""contrails"" - ""condensation trails"", wispy clouds formed by water droplets condensing round particles emitted from the back of jet engines. To cut that half is technically easy, but blocked by airline bosses' greed for extra profit.

Those contrails have a cooling effect when sunlight reflects off them, but a warming effect when radiation reflected back from the earth's surface bounces back from them. Generally the warming effect exceeds the cooling effect.

In any one year the warming effect from that year's contrails is almost as big as the warming effect from all the CO2 emitted from aviation (since it began) and remaining in the upper atmosphere.

The warming effect from old CO2 emissions will abate only slowly whatever we do now, and cutting new CO2 emissions from aviation is difficult without cutting aviation: Sustainable Aviation Fuel is, for now anyway, only a token gesture.

But contrails are formed only in particular conditions, mostly in colder and more humid parts of the atmosphere. Three per cent of flights generate 80% of the warming effect from contrails, and three-quarters of flights generate no warming (or even some cooling).

So, says Ritchie, the contrail warming can be largely abolished by re-routing a minority of flights for small parts of their journeys to avoid the areas where warming-contrails form. We have the technology to do that.

Ritchie offers calculations to show that the extra flight time, and extra cost per passenger, would be small - a few minutes, a few pounds.

But it is hassle for the airline bosses. So they don't do it. Ritchie comments: ""the United States could have led this effort domestically, mandating that internal flights eliminate their contrails...

""The European Union... has already been making some progress... Earlier this year, its trading system regulations were updated to require airlines to monitor and report non-CO2 impacts... Unsurprisingly, it has received pushback from the aviation industry, with them asking for these reports to be voluntary"".

The aviation unions, and the labour movement, could win this one.",https://www.workersliberty.org/files/styles/large/public/pictures/1127588194-1280x720.jpg?itok=_5OJeWdV,N,,2025-10-25 21:16:36.773588

With improved passenger experience and operational reliability, this upgrade supports Switzerland’s tourism and trade sectors, reinforcing Zurich Airport’s ambition to rank among Europe’s most modern hubs.

In Palma de Mallorca, the A350’s inaugural landing also held symbolic meaning: Mallorca remains a leading leisure route for Swiss travelers seeking Mediterranean getaways. The debut highlights the aircraft’s versatility, balancing short-haul tourism traffic and long-haul premium travel.

Next Chapter: Fleet Synergy

The debut of the A350 complements parallel developments across the Lufthansa Group, including A350 integration at Lufthansa’s Munich hub and eco-design upgrades at Austrian Airlines. The rollout symbolizes a unified commitment to modern, sustainable aviation that combines environmental responsibility with luxury service.

At SWISS, the A350 is envisioned as the “flagbearer” of the company’s evolution toward responsible premium travel. CEO Jens Fehlinger described the milestone as a once-in-a-lifetime event for the airline, citing the precision, design, and teamwork that went into creating this next-generation flagship. ​

Looking Ahead: Expanding Horizons with Elegance

SWISS’s Airbus A350 debut not only signifies a fleet expansion milestone but also a forward-looking investment in sustainability and passenger comfort. Its combination of efficiency and indulgence underscores Switzerland’s position as both a global business hub and a luxury tourism destination.

This dramatic surge reflects growing market confidence in the hydrogen company's strategic repositioning and recent corporate developments that have captured analyst attention.

The investment case for Plug Power received significant validation from financial institutions, with HSBC substantially raising its price target from $2.50 to $4.40. The banking firm cited the beginning of a new cycle in the U.S. cleantech sector, supported by declining interest rates, more sustainable growth assumptions, and increasingly rational government policy. Concurrently, the stock's fair value assessment climbed from $2.42 to $2.78, indicating growing optimism among market researchers.

Further positive sentiment emerged from HC Wainwright, which revised its loss-per-share projections to less negative territory. Investors are now looking toward the upcoming third-quarter report scheduled for November 11 for additional confirmation of this improving trend.

Strategic Leadership Transition

A pivotal factor behind the share price explosion centers on a significant leadership announcement. The company revealed that Jose Luis Crespo will assume the CEO position in March 2026 following the filing of the 2025 annual report. Current chief executive Andy Marsh will transition to a role on the supervisory board, ensuring continuity during a critical period for the hydrogen economy.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Plug Power?

Crespo brings substantial credentials to the position, having managed a global sales pipeline exceeding $8 billion as Chief Revenue Officer while maintaining key relationships with industry giants including Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot. Market experts view this promotion as a strategic move aimed at enhancing operational excellence and financial discipline.

Expanding Partnerships Drive Growth Prospects

Complementing the leadership news, a series of strategic partnerships has generated additional momentum. The most recent highlight involves collaboration with Edgewood Renewables to develop an advanced sustainable fuel production facility in Las Vegas. This project will focus on converting waste biomass into sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, and biomethanol.

Operational achievements further demonstrate the company's expanding market presence. Successful installation of hydrogen fuel cell systems at the Floor & Decor logistics center in Washington showcases practical implementation, while timely hydrogen deliveries to Europe's H2CAST project evidence the scalability of Plug Power's production capabilities across international markets.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2369757_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 13:01:16.601400

""This (T2) reopening also allows for more balanced airline operations across terminals, further enhancing efficiency and convenience for millions of travellers,"" DIAL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said.

Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), a consortium led by the GMR Group, operates the IGIA, which is also the country's largest airport.

At the inaugural, Naidu said India can become one of the world's largest civil aviation ecosystems.

The whole transfer ecosystem should be made more efficient for making the airport an international hub, he said and added that the airport can have an annual passenger handling capacity of around 130 million with efficient use of space.

The minister also said the Delhi airport is focusing on sustainability, including concentrating on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

According to DIAL, the future-ready T2 will play a pivotal role in strengthening the airport's position as India's foremost aviation hub, equipped to handle the next phase of passenger growth efficiently and sustainably.

The revamped T2 will feature a Self Baggage Drop (SBD) facility, enabling passengers to check in bags independently and reducing queues and waiting time.

Among others, there will be six new Passenger Boarding Bridges (PBBs).

In terms of infrastructure and safety, T2 has undergone comprehensive mechanical and electrical upgrades, and the refurbished airside and apron areas are designed to support efficient aircraft movement and accommodate future traffic growth, DIAL said.

The partnership represents the first time that any airline has operated to the three hubs, flying on SAF.

The new locations build on the successful SAF operations at Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and San Francisco International Airport (SFO) where Neste has been supplying UA since last year. The term of the SAF contract at IAH is until the end of this month, while EWR and IAD are scheduled for SAF flights until next year.

United & Neste: Growing Together

Neste has been supplying SAF to United at O’Hare since August 2024 and provided the alternative fuel to UA’s fleet at SFO over the past as well. At SFO, the California state government’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is supporting the use of renewable fuels, which both incentivizes carriers and helps offset development costs for suppliers.

United has been happy with the results and takes the top spot for SAF operators in America. The airline burned 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) of SAF last year, when only two major hubs were using the alternative fuel. The contribution of major carriers like UA toward emissions reduction is key to lowering the 2-3% of greenhouse gases that air transport accounts for worldwide.

The global commercial aviation industry uses about 4.3 billion gallons of fuel per year, according to the World Economic Forum. As small as 13 million gallons may be by comparison, it is still a huge leap forward in progress compared to previous years. United Chief Sustainability Officer, Lauren Riley, was quoted in a Neste press release regarding the expanded SAF supply agreement:

“United remains the leading SAF user in the US… we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments.”

Cleaning Skies By Burning Trash

Neste’s MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel before use and is currently certified for use at up to a 50% ratio. Neste uses 100% renewable raw materials to make its SAF product, including used cooking oil and animal fat waste. The alternative jet fuel has been shown to reduce carbon emissions by as much as 80%, when used unblended. The cost is much higher than conventional jet fuel, which is why government incentives are key to increasing adoption.

Currently, SAF can cost anywhere from 2–5 times the price of conventional jet fuel. Despite that high price tag, United has been saying since at least 2021 that it is pursuing emissions reduction of 100% by 2050. The airline has publicly stated on numerous occasions that it believes SAF is a better option for the environment than buying offsets, which are “emissions credits,” and it believes that the industry would have a strong appetite for the product if made readily available.

Neste Is Ramping Up

United’s “Good Leads The Way” brand campaign specifically focuses on promoting SAF use as part of a drive to do the right thing for customers, employees, communities and the planet. The low global supply is a significant roadblock to widespread adoption, and partnerships like UA and Neste are helping to bring down prices and increase supply through joint development.

Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons (515 million gallons) per year, and the company projects it will grow to 2.2 million tons (750 million gallons) by the end of 2027. Using waste is the ideal source of raw material to create SAF, but it is also in demand by other industry sectors.

On top of the existing financial barrier, should it be necessary to generate the base material for SAF refinement, costs will go up again. United is pushing to raise the visibility of how beneficial SAF is in the near and long-term goal of reducing aviation emissions, with the goal of encouraging the government and wider industry to help facilitate faster mass production and widespread SAF usage.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/014-united-airlines-boeing-737-800-phuong-d-nguyen-_-shutterstock.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-25 12:01:11.876265

The aerospace industry is a highly globalised, supplier-driven, and concentrated sector, dominated by Boeing and Airbus in large civil aircraft, with emerging competitors in regional aircraft markets.

Malaysia has advanced in manufacturing components and in Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) through several policy interventions, institutional and infrastructural support. Of these, Industry Collaboration Programmes have helped to promote local content, technology transfer, and domestic supplier development.

The sector has over 240 firms, concentrated in MRO and manufacturing, but weak in design and development.

Exports are important; manufactured aerospace products are meant for exports, as part of the global supply chain. In 2024, Malaysia exported RM5.74 billion in aerospace products but imported RM14.9 billion, reflecting a continued trade deficit. US is important both as export destination and import source. Foreign investment has recently overtaken domestic investment in this sector.

While Malaysia faces several challenges in the future development of this sector, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance, technology and talent gaps, as well as external headwinds under Trump’s tariffs, there is potential for developing Sustainable Aviation Fuel from the available feedstocks to reduce the carbon footprint and competitiveness of this sector.

INTRODUCTION

Aerospace is a globalised industry; it relies on global collaboration across the value chain to stay competitive. International partnerships enable prime contractors to cut costs, leverage supplier expertise, and concentrate on high-value activities such as design, assembly, and marketing. However, the aerospace value chain is supplier driven, as it relies on costly advanced technologies controlled by a few firms that decide who get to participate in the value chain. Low production volumes and high regulatory costs further restrict entry into manufacturing, leaving location decisions in the hands of a small group of companies. Thus, the industry remains highly concentrated. Globally, only Boeing and Airbus can design and produce large civil passenger aircraft in both single and twin-aisle segments, dominating the market through their supply chains.[1] While Boeing and Airbus also supply defence aircraft, other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for defence include BAESystems, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. Competition in the commercial aircraft market is growing; a few other firms, such as Bombardier (Canada), Embraer (Brazil), Comac (China), Sukhoi/Irkut (Russia), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Japan), are seeking entry into the large aircraft segment, although they are more focussed on smaller regional aircraft.

Developing countries participate in the global value chain of the aerospace industry by joining some segments of the global value chain, such as the manufacture of aeroplane parts, Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO), or comprehensive servicing of aircraft. MRO processes are vital for ensuring equipment safety, efficiency, and longevity, preventing costly breakdowns, and supporting overall business operations. Key participants now include China, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea.

This essay traces the development of the aerospace sector in Malaysia, which is driven by policies and policy intervention. It outlines the performance of the sector and the key challenges it faces going forward.

DEVELOPMENT OF AEROSPACE IN MALAYSIA

The value chain for this sector is illustrated in Figure 1. There are recognisably five stages involved: design and development; component production; sub-assembly; final assembly; and post-production services, which include maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), technical training, and customer support.

Figure 1. Value Chain in Aerospace

POLICIES DRIVING SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT

The aerospace sector was identified as strategic in the National Aerospace Blueprint (NAB) 1997, which targeted world-class standards by 2015 in four areas: parts and components manufacturing, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), avionics and systems integration, and aerospace training.

This vision was expanded in the Malaysian Aerospace Industry Blueprint (MAIB) 2030, launched in 2015.[3] MAIB aims to position Malaysia as Southeast Asia’s leading aerospace nation and a key regional hub by 2030, with projected revenue of RM55.2 billion and over 32,000 high-income jobs. It aims to achieve this through upgrading the competitiveness of local players, changing from being a technology user to technology supplier by investing in R&D, increasing local content, moving to the upstream market, prioritising local design and engineering, and staying ahead of regional competitors for parts and components sourcing.

An important complementary policy for increasing local content is the Industrial Collaboration Program (ICP) introduced in 2014 as an offset policy requiring foreign firms in government tenders to support local development.[4] In aerospace, the ICP promotes local content, technology transfer, and supplier growth through partnerships, local operations, and training programmes. Linked to major procurements (e.g., Rolls-Royce Trent engines, BAE Hawk aircraft), it has enhanced Malaysia’s capabilities in component manufacturing, MRO, and advanced technologies such as 3D printing.

The importance of the aerospace sector is reiterated in subsequent policy documents such as NIMP2030, and the 12th and 13th Malaysia Plans. The targets set out in MAIB 2030 were reiterated in NIMP 2030 (Table 1), while the 12th and 13th Malaysia Plans continued to support these goals. The 2025 targets were set by NIMP2030, while MAIB 2030 set targets for only 2030. The 13th Malaysia Plan expanded the scope of this sector; it identifies unmanned aircraft system and advanced air mobility (AAM) as high impact strategic sectors within the aerospace sector. It further includes a new aspiration, which is to establish Malaysia as the ASEAN hub for sustainable aviation, focussing on the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low-carbon aviation fuels.

Table 1. Targets of the Aerospace Industry by sub-sectors

Source: NIMP2030: Aerospace Industry

Other than the sub-sectoral targets, Malaysia also aims to earn RM55.2 billion in revenue from this sector by 2030. It also aims to produce 32,000 relevant highly skilled workers by 2030.

These policies are accompanied by financial support, infrastructure, and institutional support. Unfortunately, there is practically no data on the financial support for aerospace development. It was reported that RM100 million had been allocated for aerospace industry development programmes during the 12th Malaysia Plan.[5]

Infrastructure support came in the form of the development of the Subang Aerotech Park, which was built out of the old Subang airport. The park is a dedicated industrial aviation park built by two GLCs, Malaysia Airports and Boustead, to develop an aerospace ecosystem.[6] Likewise, KLIA Aeropolis was being developed to support MRO, aeronautical development and to be a hub for aerospace manufacturing.[7]

Several institutions were established to oversee the development of the sector. The Malaysian Aerospace Council (MAC) was established in 2001. It is chaired by the Minister of International Trade & Industry (MITI) and provides the vision and direction for the overall development plan of the national aerospace industry. This comes in the form of policy guidelines and priority areas of aerospace activities. Members of the Council consists of Government and industry players.

To further support the aerospace industry, a National Aerospace Industry Coordinating Office (NAICO) was established in August 2015 as a Unit under MITI. The main role of NAICO is to ensure that the Blueprint’s strategies and initiatives are implemented. It also acts as a central hub connecting industry players, government bodies, and academia to jointly enhance the strength and capacity of Malaysia’s aerospace sector.

The organisation was established as a corporation on October 18, 2022, by MITI to spearhead the development of Malaysia’s aerospace industry by leading in the implementation of the MAIB 2030. It also fosters collaborations with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to enhance Malaysia’s aerospace supply chain. Through the newly established Malaysia Aerospace Centre of Excellence (MyAERO Centre), NAICO further supports the development of local SMEs with global potential, while reinforcing the nation’s position in the international aerospace supply chain.[8]

There is also industry support in the form of Malaysia Aerospace Industry Association (MAIA), which was established in 2016. MAIA comprises of top management of member companies who are entrusted to draw the guidelines for the group, and with an emphasis on capacity development and international market penetration. Companies can leverage MAIA for assistance for growth and access into new markets, networking within industry and championing the industry’s interest on public policy development.

Besides these, MITI’s agencies, MATRADE and MIDA, also lends support for the export and investment goals of the sector by facilitating export and investment promotion. The former promotes Malaysia’s industry players through dedicated road shows, business networking events, and establishing Malaysian pavilions in foreign airshows. Investment promotion is aided by investment incentives such as income tax exemption for pioneer status, reinvestment allowance, and import duty exemptions.[9] There are conditions such as qualifying activities, employment of Malaysians, investment level and qualifying expenditures as well as a managerial, technical and supervisory staff index of above 25 percent.[10] There is also a biannual Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition held in Langkawi to showcase aerospace firms in Malaysia.

STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE

There are over 240 key players involved in Malaysia’s aerospace industry. Of these, 54.0 per cent participate in MRO activities; and 20.0 per cent engage in aerospace manufacturing and engineering, and design services (based on survey data).[11] The latest census of the manufacturing sector in Malaysia shows that there are 51 establishments in this sector, providing 0.31%, and 0.32% of total manufacturing valued added and employment in 2022.

The presence of firms is highest for aerospace manufacturing, MRO, education, and training, and weakest at the design and development stage of the value chain (Chart 1). Tier 1 firms in aerospace manufacturing include foreign companies such as Spirit Aerosystems,[12] Honeywell Aerospace, Safran and UMW, a government-linked company that manufactures Rolls-Royce fan cases.[13] For Tier 2 companies, there are Composites Technology Research Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. which belongs to DRB-Hicom, and SAM Malaysia, which is a subsidiary of Singapore Aerospace Manufacturing (SAM) Pte Ltd. Foreign MRO companies include Airbus SE, GKN Aerospace, and Leonardo Helicopters, while local companies include Airod Sdn. Bhd., and Sapura Tehcnics. There are also a large number of higher education training institutions providing training at the university and TVET level for workers along the value chain.

Chart 1. Firms’ Presence along the Value Chain of Aerospace Industry, 2023

The manufacturing segment is export-oriented as Malaysia is part of the global supply chain for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), due in part to the offset programmes. Companies that are able to meet the global standards set by global OEMs become certified suppliers and contract manufacturers. Thus, manufactured exports grew steadily from 2011 to 2020 due to increasing demand for air travel with the rapid expansion of low-cost carriers, especially Air Asia in Malaysia (Chart 2). However, the emergence of the Covid-pandemic in 2020 reduced air travel significantly, leading to a sharp fall in exports.

Although travel has since recovered, and with it, exports of aerospace products, it has not reached the pre-pandemic level of 2019. Part of this is attributed to the slow recovery in airfare trends. Chart 3 shows a sharp fall in air passengers from 2019 to 2021, before recovering in 2022-2024. Nevertheless, it is still lower than the pre-pandemic 2019 data. Domestic fares have recovered but for international economy class flights, the average airfares for these countries have increased drastically and have remained above 2019 levels.[14] Thus the recovery in international travel is slower than for domestic travel.

It should also be noted that exports are facilitated greatly by imports, with the sector registering a deficit before and after the pandemic. It is this deficit that is driving the policy to increase local content in aero manufacturing.

In 2024, Malaysia exported RM5.74 billion worth of aircraft and spacecraft, ranking as its 25th largest export out of 97 products.[15] Key export destinations were China (RM1.21 billion), the United States (RM1.15 billion), Indonesia (RM684 million), Singapore (RM525 million), and India (RM277 million). The fastest-growing markets from 2023 to 2024 were China, Singapore, and France.

On the import side, Malaysia purchased RM14.9 billion of aircraft and spacecraft in 2024, making these the country’s 17th largest import. Major sources included the United States (RM7.94 billion), France (RM1.57 billion), China (RM1.21 billion), Germany (RM803 million), and Singapore (RM561 million). The fastest-growing import origins between 2023 and 2024 were Germany, Indonesia, and Singapore.

In terms of investments, the sector is dominated by domestic investments throughout the IMP3 period. However, after IMP3 ended in 2025, foreign investments exceeded domestic investments from 2021 to 2024, except for 2022 (Table 2). There were nine projects approved, of which seven were new while two were expansion/diversification/extensions from existing projects.[16]

MAIB 2030 identified Malaysia to be number two in Southeast Asia for MRO and Aero manufacturing, behind Singapore but ahead of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines in 2014.[18] Since then, there are no published metrics on the achievements for the targets in Table 1. In 2024, it was announced that the aerospace sector generated RM25.1 billion in revenue and supported 30,000 skilled workers,[19] which is less than that targeted for 2030, but there is still five more years to go to meet the targets.

More importantly, the sector has changed since MAIB was formulated in 2015, with increased concerns over carbon emissions and higher demand for green manufacturing practices. Likewise, changes in technology have exacerbated the talent shortage, while the Trump 2.0 tariffs have created uncertainties for global value chains, including in aerospace.

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

Adopting Green Manufacturing Practices

Aerospace manufacturing is energy-intensive, making carbon compliance a key challenge. This affects Malaysia’s ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), as investors increasingly demand adherence to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. With stricter ESG enforcement ahead, contract manufacturers must also ensure that their suppliers also comply. While developed-country suppliers are well-placed to meet these requirements, domestic SMEs may struggle.

To stay competitive, the industry must accelerate ESG adoption, supported by green infrastructure. In this regard, Malaysia can leverage its feedstock resources to expand green electricity and bio-gas infrastructure, and promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF, produced from renewable or waste-derived sources, reduces life-cycle emissions by up to 80 percent and is fully compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. Feedstocks include non-edible crops, agricultural and forestry residues, municipal waste, and industrial off-gassing. Engines currently can operate on a 50:50 SAF–conventional fuel blend, with progress toward 100 percent SAF underway.[20]

As part of the National Energy Transition Roadmap, the government has set a target of achieving a 47 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending mandate by 2050. In line with this goal, Petronas announced in September 2025 the successful delivery of Malaysia’s first locally blended SAF to Malaysia Aviation Group Bhd (MAG), the parent company of Malaysia Airlines.[21] The SAF, processed and blended at Petronas facilities, was supplied to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for deployment on Malaysia Airlines’ daily flights to London. Therefore, expanding into the production of SAF, the availability of feedstock can help to offset carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Technology and Talent Development

MAIB2030 emphasised increasing Malaysia’s capacity for R&D, and fostering collaboration between industry players, research institutions, and academia. For this purpose, Malaysia has established the Aerospace Malaysia Innovation Centre (AMIC). This is an industry-led body focusing on collaborative research in sustainable aviation and the factory of the future; it is located at Universiti Malaya and the Mechanical and Aerospace Technology Division within the Science & Technology Research Institute for Defence for defence-related aerospace research.

Yet Chart 1 shows that the presence of design and development is low in the aerospace ecosystem. This indicates that Malaysia finds it difficult to attract domestic and foreign investment for this segment.

Talent shortages continue to hinder the development of research capabilities. The Critical Occupations List (MYCOL) 2022/2023 identifies a shortage of engineers nationwide. In the aerospace sector (p.45), industry stakeholders report that many fresh graduates lack the technical skills required, due partly to outdated curricula at local universities and training institutions. Graduates also often lack practical, hands-on experience when entering the workforce. Employers further note weak collaboration between universities and industry in designing internship and apprenticeship programmes, leaving many of these initiatives ineffective. Malaysia’s brain drain, especially in skilled labour has compounded the talent shortage.[22] Developing and retaining talent, especially for R&D, therefore remains an outstanding challenge.

Uncertainty over Trump’s Tariff’s

The US is an important export destination, as well as import source. To date, Trump’s reciprocal tariffs stand at 19 percent for Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, while Singapore scores the lowest at 10 percent. Vietnam’s tariffs are slightly higher, at 20 percent. Brunei, Laos and Myanmar suffer higher tariffs, but they are not competitors in developing aerospace hubs in Southeast Asia. Singapore thus has a tariff advantage over the rest of Southeast Asia, and will continue to maintain its ranking among the top ten globally, for aerospace manufacturing attractiveness, in the comparison conducted by PwC.[23]

The tariffs will however increase the costs of production for aerospace manufacturing for the US, including the tariffs for steel and aluminium. This will lead to higher costs for travel. Global trade and FDI climate in 2025 and 2026 are dampened, with a sharp slowdown in trade growth, and a significant decline in global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows (especially for large-scale projects).[24] This will affect travel and the demand for aircraft, thereby increasing the external headwinds for the continued development of this sector. Moreover, it is unclear whether the reciprocal tariffs will change in the future.

CONCLUSION

Malaysia’s aerospace industry has grown steadily through strong policy support, including financial, institutional backing, infrastructure support, and integration into global value chains, particularly in manufacturing and MRO. However, to move up the value chain and remain competitive, the sector must address structural weaknesses in design and development, close talent gaps, and adapt rapidly to ESG standards, especially for the SMEs in the supply chain. Leveraging the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from available feedstocks presents an opportunity for Malaysia to strengthen its position as a regional aerospace hub while meeting future sustainability demands.

With Deutsche Aircraft setting its sights on the vast potential of India’s burgeoning aviation market, the German startup is positioning itself as a leader in regional connectivity with its D328eco.

Founded on the legacy of the Dornier 328, Deutsche Aircraft is positioning itself as a revitalised original equipment manufacturer (OEM) building next-generation regional turboprops in Europe.

At the heart of this revival is the OEM’s flagship aircraft, the D328eco. Anchored in German engineering and sustainability, the 40-seat turboprop builds on the DNA of the Dornier 328, modernising it with more efficient engines and avionics.

“The D328eco will be capable of flying faster than any other turboprop in production,” according to Deutsche Aircraft. “Its ability to operate on shorter runways enables access to remote communities, fostering economic growth and boosting tourism in underserved areas,” added the OEM.

Key features of the D328eco:

Maximum range of 655nm at full capacity and maximum cruising speed of 324kts

Short take-off and landing (STOL) capabilities

Optimised fuel consumption

High-altitude and hot-weather performance

100% Power to Liquid – sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatibility

Quiet, ergonomic cabin

Deutsche Aircraft’s year of milestones

This year (2025) has been a landmark year for Deutsche Aircraft with a steady stream of announcements. On 30 April, two years after construction began, Deutsche Aircraft laid the cornerstone for its Final Assembly Line at Leipzig/ Halle Airport. The CO2-neutral manufacturing facility, scheduled for completion by the end of 2025, will feature a commissioning hangar, logistics centre and administrative building.

“We are making a clear statement: We are bringing the development of a regional aircraft, based on the DNA of Dornier, entirely back to Germany, ” said Nico Neumann, Co-CEO of Deutsche Aircraft, during the ceremony in April.

Just a month later, Deutsche Aircraft unveiled its first D328eco test aircraft at its Airtech Campus headquarters in Oberpfaffenhofen. The unveiling marked a shift from design to practical flight-test preparation, which in turn triggered a further wave of announcements in the months that followed.

During this year’s Paris Airshow in June, Deutsche Aircraft revealed a series of developments, including the integration of a new Garmin G5000 PRIME flight deck into the turboprop.

Speaking to Aerospace Global News during the airshow, Neumann described the partnership with Garmin as a “crucial next step” in making the D328eco “more flexible and intuitive for pilots and crew.”

“It’s like using an iPhone,” he added. “The weather awareness and system integration are incredible. Pilots love the simplicity and situational clarity it brings.”

Additional highlights from Paris Airshow include:

A leadership transition with Nico Neumann appointed as CEO of Deutsche Aircraft and Dave Jackson assuming the role of CEO of Deutsche Aircraft Group.

A Memorandum of Understanding with Aerodata to develop a German-made D328eco Special Mission Aircraft, designed to improve Europe’s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

A strengthened partnership with Pratt & Whitney Canada to integrate the PW127XT-S engine, enabling cleaner and more efficient regional air travel.

The appointment of Aernnova as the empennage supplier, completing the primary structure lineup.

Momentum has continued to gather pace beyond Paris

Since the Paris Airshow, Deutsche Aircraft has shown no signs of slowing:

In July, the OEM signed an agreement with TEST-FUCHS to begin testing the aircraft’s advanced fuel system, including trials with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Rasakti was selected to supply precision tooling and ground support equipment for the D328eco and its Pratt & Whitney PW127XT-S engine.

At the end of September, Akkodis agreed to become a first-tier supplier, overseeing system integration, ground and flight testing and final certification.

In the first half of October, two more strategic partnerships were signed. Expleo agreed an engineering services deal, while Jungheinrich was appointed to automate Deutsche Aircraft’s logistics centre at Leipzig/ Halle Airport.

Why India is the next frontier for Deutsche Aircraft

Looking east, Deutsche Aircraft is eyeing rapid growth in India’s aviation market. The OEM will host its ‘Wings of Opportunity’ event in New Delhi in November. The event will be held in collaboration with key Indian organisations, including Aerospace India Association, Cyient (developer of the D328eco’s cabin management system), Dynamatic Technologies (the turboprop’s rear fuselage manufacturer in Bangalore) and SASMOS HET.

Recognising India as the third-largest domestic aviation market with over 220 million passengers in 2024 an annual growth rate of 6.2%, Deutsche Aircraft sees vast potential for the D328eco in the region. The aircraft is well-suited to leverage the Indian government’s UDAN regional connectivity scheme, which aims to link Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, via regional airports (of which there are currently 157), many of which have short runways. Plans are afoot for 50 more airports.

According to Deutsche Aircraft, the D328eco is purpose-built to support India’s regional aviation goals, combining performance, sustainability and efficiency.

Challenges ahead for Deutsche Aircraft

Despite strong progress, several hurdles remain. Certification and first delivery are still pending milestones. Meanwhile, the global supply chain continues to pose challenges around timely supply and the ability to manage cost pressures.

In addition, Deutsche Aircraft continues to face competition from other regional aircraft manufacturers as new turboprops, regional jets and emerging hybrid technologies continue to vie for market share.

However, if Deutsche Aircraft successfully delivers its D328eco programme on time and progresses with its anticipated entry into service in the final quarter of 2027, it could re-establish Germany as a leader in regional aircraft manufacturing.

From infrastructure developments and partnerships to design and rollout, Deutsche Aircraft continues to build momentum. And, while the path from prototype to passenger service remains the critical next phase, the company’s current trajectory points to a comeback for German regional aircraft manufacturing.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Deutsche-Aircraft-D328eco-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:01:39.914895

El reglamento ReFuelEU Aviation busca fomentar un transporte aéreo más sostenible a través de la adopción de combustibles de aviación sostenibles en todos los Estados miembros. Con este objetivo, la iniciativa determina que los suministradores de combustible incluyan un mínimo del 2% en los aeropuertos de la Unión Europea en 2025.

Se trata de un componente especialmente relevante, ya que, en sectores como la aviación, la electrificación del transporte no es una alternativa viable. Así, según los cálculos de la UE, los combustibles de aviación sostenibles pueden reducir sus emisiones de CO2, durante todo su ciclo de vida, entre un 65% y un 100%. En este marco se engloban los conocidos como Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), la alternativa más generalizada entre los diversos agentes del sector, ya que puede utilizarse sin modificar los motores de los aviones ni las infraestructuras de los aeropuertos.

El potencial sostenible de los SAF es evidente. Según los cálculos de IATA, este tipo de combustibles pueden reducir hasta en un 80% sus emisiones de CO2. Además, en su ciclo de vida completo, representa una contribución cercana al 65% dentro de todas las herramientas con las que cuenta el sector para cumplir con la estrategia Net Zero Carbon en 2050.

Grandes empresas por una aviación sostenible

En este contexto de lograr un transporte aéreo más sostenible, Iberia ha lanzado Círculo SAF, un programa corporativo con el objetivo de unir a grandes empresas para impulsar el uso de estos combustibles SAF. Como miembros fundadores, cuenta con Amadeus, BBVA, Repsol y Telefónica.

Círculo SAF permite a los clientes de la compañía aérea contribuir a la reducción de parte de las emisiones de alcance 3 generadas en viajes corporativos y transporte de carga, fomentando el uso y desarrollo del combustible sostenible de aviación. Para ello, dichos clientes compran una cantidad equivalente a un determinado porcentaje de la huella de carbono de este tipo de trayectos y transportes.

La reducción de emisiones estimada por el programa es de entre un 10% y un 30%. Actualmente, Iberia está en proceso de recopilación de otras grandes compañías que se unan al Círculo SAF, impulsando, de este modo, la utilización de combustible sostenible de aviación para mitigar el impacto medioambiental de su actividad.","https://images.ecestaticos.com/W8J6E8ENRBzIJZR7ihJlpMjxlKw=/0x0:1200x900/600x315/filters:fill(white):format(jpg):quality(99):watermark(f.elconfidencial.com/file/bae/eea/fde/baeeeafde1b3229287b0c008f7602058.png,0,275,1)/f.elconfidencial.com/original/4b7/6ec/899/4b76ec8990b5f211cc4ddabeb20523f8.jpg",N,,2025-10-25 12:01:44.617716

European Union airports’ use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in 2024 avoided roughly 714,000 tonnes of CO₂ – the equivalent of about 10,000 return flights between Madrid and Paris – according to a new report from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The first ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report, published on 22 October, provides an initial snapshot of SAF production, supply, and uptake across EU airports.

SAF accounts for 0.6% of aviation fuel at EU airports

The headline figure: in 2024, just 0.6% of all aviation fuel supplied at EU airports came from sustainable sources.

That’s a modest start compared with the 2% SAF blending mandate coming into force this year.

EASA data shows that 0.6% of all aviation fuel supplied in 2024 – around 193 kilotonnes – was SAF, mostly biofuel derived from used cooking oil (81%) and waste animal fats (17%).

Synthetic SAF was absent from the mix, underscoring the nascent state of advanced fuels in the EU, EASA said.

The report also highlights market concentration: five member states – France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Germany – accounted for 99% of supply, while 69% of feedstock came from outside the EU, predominantly China (38%) and Malaysia (12%), with Finland as the largest European contributor (10%).

‘Important first steps’

“The first Annual Technical Report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps,” said Maria Rueda, EASA’s Safety Management, Strategy and Global Outreach Director.

“A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states.”

While 2024 established a baseline, the report notes the road ahead remains long.

ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates a 2% SAF share in 2025 for around 150 EU airports, rising to a 6% overall blending target by 2030.

Airlines play their part

On the operator side, 74% of airlines subject to ReFuelEU submitted reports, covering 38.8 million tonnes of fuel uplifted at EU airports.

Some 357,000 tonnes of SAF were purchased, slightly more than suppliers reported delivering, suggesting confusion over whether global or EU-only purchases should be declared.

Most of that fuel was claimed under emissions-trading schemes such as the EU ETS (39%) and UK ETS (42%), though none was reported under CORSIA, the UN’s global carbon-offset system.

At an airport level, the pattern of fuel uplift varied widely.

Only 61% of EU airports met the rule requiring operators to refuel at least 90% of the fuel needed for flights, a safeguard against “tankering” cheaper fuel from outside the EU.

Smaller and non-EU operators were the most likely to miss reporting deadlines.

Production expands, but slowly

EASA found 17 EU member states now host SAF production or announced projects, up from 12 in 2023 – clear evidence that investment momentum is building. Yet synthetic aviation fuels, seen as the long-term replacement for fossil kerosene, remain well behind schedule.

Not a single e-fuel project in the EU has yet reached a final investment decision, raising doubts over the bloc’s ability to meet the 2030 sub-target for synthetic fuels unless several projects break ground by 2026.

Depending on the scenario, EASA projects 1.4 to 5.2 million tonnes of SAF production capacity (plus 0.7 Mt of synthetic fuels) could be available by 2030 – potentially enough to meet near-term quotas but not the 20% SAF target for 2035.

What are the barriers to SAF use?

According to the EASA report, SAF costs remain elevated, averaging €2,085 per tonne compared with €734 for conventional jet fuel, which, combined with limited feedstock and production bottlenecks, continues to challenge widespread uptake.

Despite these hurdles, EASA concludes that the EU is on track to scale SAF gradually, with reporting compliance and delivery systems improving – setting the stage for a more sustainable aviation sector over the coming decade.

What is the situation in the UK?

In the UK, the demands placed on airlines and airports to use SAF are even more rigorous.

The SAF Mandate starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.

From 2040, the obligation will remain at 22% of total UK jet fuel demand until there is greater certainty regarding SAF supply.

The UK’s SAF Mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

We all have a responsibility to our planet and some of the smallest steps, if done collectively, can have a positive impact.
Rocking out on Earth means dancing in tune with our planet’s rhythms too.","From Sting’s buzzing jazz and reggae-infused tracks to Chappell Roan’s theatrical dance-pop, music pulses through the backdrop of our daily lives. The music streaming industry’s revenue sits at a whopping $17.5 billion, with over 600 million people subscribed to a music streaming service. And with Taylor Swift’s latest album playing in the grocery store, Doechii dropping stunning verses during her tiny desk concert, and sound bites from a wide array of underground artists capturing millions on platforms like TikTok, it’s no wonder people can’t get enough of their favorite musicians and groups.

The highlight of a listener’s music experience is often seeing their favorite artist in concert. Music festivals draw millions of fun-loving fans and artists every year, bursting with a wide array of colorful cultural experiences, exclusive merchandise, and head banging music.

How do Music Festivals Impact the Environment?

With so many music-lovers and fans crowding in to catch a glimpse of their idols, festivals have their work cut out for them balancing the energy consumption and waste production they incur. From single-wear, themed concert outfits to leftover plastic tents and tossed out merchandise, concerts and festivals generate solid and chemical waste in excess.

For one, all that lovely glitter adorning festival-goer faces and outfits often ends up washing out into bodies of water like rivers and lakes. As a kind of microplastic, glitter does not break down and winds up polluting our natural water ways and being consumed by fish, birds and other animals.

Flimsy plastic festival tents are another issue. They are often made with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a toxic chemical pollutant resistant to breakdown. In 2022 in the UK, on average nearly 80% of festival goers left tents behind, and these tents are almost impossible to recycle.

Emissions from transportation add to these issues. Besides the hoards of fans driving or flying out to concerts, private aviation and long-haul trucking rack up CO2 emissions in the blink of an eye. A Greener Festival report notes that transportation emissions account for between 35% and 94% of festival goers’ total carbon emissions.

To tackle these problems, many festivals and artists around the world are fighting for change, collaborating with waste management companies, updating stadium policies, and promoting educational outreach to inform attendees of their environmental impacts and recommended best practices. Let’s take a moment to shout-out some of these festivals striving towards change.

Calling all Shambhalans

The Canadian EDM festival Shambhala advocates for a “leave no trace” approach. Weaving their various stages into the landscape, Shambhala fuses nature with music, aiming to capture audiences not only with their impressive artist line-ups but also with the stunning wilderness vistas. They hope to follow in the footsteps of the Sylix, Sinixt, and Ktunaxa nations, honoring the land and water and protecting it for years to come.

In 2024, Shambhala raised £147,758 for community and environmental initiatives. With their eco-travel plan, they helped over a third of attendees arrive on low-impact transportation including coach and rail. In terms of food, the festival composted 10 tonnes of waste, pioneered crew food with 47% organic produce — the majority of which was sourced within 200 miles of the venue, and offered meals with an average of 0.45 kg CO2 per plate. For reference, the average carbon emissions of a concert meal in the UK is 2 kg CO2 per plate.

Lightning in a Bottle

The U.S.-based Lightning in a Bottle festival takes “leave no trace” a step further. Adopting the slogan “leave a positive trace,” they encourage attendees to take care of their own waste, respect the land, and avoid littering. They opt for sustainable energy, including LED and solar lights for stage lighting. They avoid single-use plastic water bottles by providing free water. Attendees are asked to avoid trampling plants off the beaten path and not to disturb wildlife as a part of their push to honor the land.

DGTL Festival

The Netherlands boast one of the most sustainable music festivals in the world: DGTL Festival. Since 2022, DGTL has managed to be 100% fossil fuel free, committed to retackling the energy problem each year and avoiding harmful emissions. They explored solar, hydro, hydrogen, and even sound waves as potential sources of renewable energy.

In addition to energy, DGTL offers no-waste, safe water, and entirely plant-based food. Artists flying in have their planes’ fuel replaced with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a kind of biofuel made up of plant and animal materials. Machinery used on-site is all low emission or zero emission. Hard cups have been introduced to replace single-use and one-time-physical-tokens have been swapped for cashless card payments.

Fans for Change

There are plenty of things fans can do to mitigate environmental impacts. If possible, consider taking public transportation, carpooling, riding a bike, or walking to your festival or concert venue. Explore your local thrift store for your next niche concert outfit rather than buying from fast-fashion brands. Consider using biodegradable glitter or bringing a reusable water bottle to avoid microplastic pollution. We all have a responsibility to our planet and some of the smallest steps, if done collectively, can have a positive impact.

So, the next time you’re reloading Ticket Master eight times in a minute for that golden ticket to your favorite artist, remember to tread lightly on the land and respect the water. Rocking out on Earth means dancing in tune with our planet’s rhythms too.

According to InvestingPro data, analyst targets range from $34 to $60, with the stock currently showing signs of being undervalued based on Fair Value analysis.

The firm expects Darling’s core ingredients business, excluding the Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) joint venture, to generate EBITDA of $875-900 million in fiscal year 2025. This forecast represents potential growth from the current EBITDA of $814 million over the last twelve months.

UBS noted that uncertainty and delays in obtaining a final Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) ruling have negatively impacted the U.S. biofuel environment, while export protein demand is showing signs of recovery with slightly firmer pricing trends.

The analysis highlighted that tariff implications affecting China and Asia-Pacific markets have impacted Darling’s poultry protein products, creating headwinds for that segment of the business.

UBS also pointed out operational challenges, including a scheduled turnaround at the DGD 3 facility that reduced renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel volumes, while DGD 1 remains idled and will only restart when soybean oil margins become profitable under policy changes.

In other recent news, Darling Ingredients Inc. announced its third-quarter 2025 financial results, revealing an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.12, which fell short of the anticipated $0.25. However, the company surpassed revenue expectations, reporting $1.56 billion compared to the projected $1.51 billion. This revenue beat has contributed to positive sentiment around the company’s future growth prospects. Analysts have noted the revenue performance as a significant factor in the company’s recent developments. Despite the EPS miss, the revenue achievement suggests underlying business strength. The company’s financial results have drawn attention from various market analysts, although no specific upgrades or downgrades were mentioned. Investors are closely watching Darling Ingredients as it navigates the current market landscape. These developments come amid a backdrop of broader industry trends and economic conditions.

While the project envisions the production of clean household cooking fuel to replace charcoal and kerosene, its primary objective is sustainable aviation fuel, which the Corporation plans to sell to the Ethiopian Airlines Group.
A World Economic Forum report from 2023 indicated that SAF accounted for less than 0.1 percent of global consumption.
The report also highlighted issues such as SAF’s high price point (four times more expensive than jet fuel) and relatively low energy density.
Still, carriers around the globe, including Qantas Airways, are investing heavily in hopes of accelerating the production of SAF, according to the report.","The Ethiopian Mineral Corporation and Sunbird Bioenergy Africa signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) this week that would see vast tracts of farmland dedicated to growing sugarcane and cassava to be used as inputs for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), clean household cooking fuel, and transport ethanol blends.

The agreement, signed by Corporation CEO Tewodros Getachew and Sunbird chief executive Richard Bennett, outlines plans to develop a 20,000 hectare biorefinery where locally produced feedstocks such as sugarcane and cassava will be processed into renewable fuel.

Sunbird will be in charge of production, slated to begin in 2030, while the Corporation will provide industrial expertise and infrastructural support, according to the MoU.

Corporation executives and government officials say the move is part of Ethiopia’s wider transition towards green energy, which has thus far seen a series of measures designed to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.

While the project envisions the production of clean household cooking fuel to replace charcoal and kerosene, its primary objective is sustainable aviation fuel, which the Corporation plans to sell to the Ethiopian Airlines Group.

Temesgen Getaye, Group treasurer, hailed the MoU as a historic milestone.

“As we grow our network, modernize our fleet, open new routes, and reach more customers than ever, we simultaneously face urgent environmental and climate challenges,” he said, highlighting SAF as a potential avenue towards reducing Ethiopian Airlines’ environmental impact.

As a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Ethiopian has committed to the ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

However, SAF remains largely untested.

A World Economic Forum report from 2023 indicated that SAF accounted for less than 0.1 percent of global consumption. The report also highlighted issues such as SAF’s high price point (four times more expensive than jet fuel) and relatively low energy density.

“Planes would therefore need to carry high volumes of SAF to make long-haul flights—such high volumes that it could become impractical,” it reads.

Still, carriers around the globe, including Qantas Airways, are investing heavily in hopes of accelerating the production of SAF, according to the report.

The MoU also raises questions about the efficacy and commitment of Sunbird, whose website claims it has successfully implemented similar projects in Sierra Leone and Zambia.

However, a 2024 report by a Zambian news outlet indicated that large tracts of farmland dedicated to growing cassava for a strategic biofuel project under Sunbird had never been harvested, more than six years after local farmers agreed to grow the cash crop.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MINERAL-CORP-SUNBIRD-BIOENERGY-PARTNER.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:02:02.289882

Bahlil said the memorandum of understanding for the partnership was signed in the presence of President Prabowo Subianto and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta on Thursday. “This cooperation aims to promote the development of new renewable energy, particularly in transitioning away from gasoline,” Bahlil said, as quoted by Antara on Friday, October 24, 2025.

He noted that Brazil has successfully implemented a nationwide E30 ethanol-gasoline blend, and in some states, the blend has reached E100, pure ethanol with no gasoline content.

Indonesia, he added, plans to follow Brazil’s example by introducing an E10 ethanol blend by 2027–2028 and gradually advancing to E20 in the future. The initiative is intended not only to produce cleaner energy but also to reduce the country’s reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Bahlil, who also chairs the Golkar Party, said Indonesia’s achievements in the palm oil–based biodiesel program, from B10 to B40, have inspired similar efforts in the gasoline sector using ethanol. “For biodiesel, we use CPO; for gasoline, we’ll use ethanol derived from corn, cassava, and sugarcane,” he explained.

The minister further emphasized that ethanol development would help raise farmers’ incomes and strengthen downstream industries in the agricultural sector. The program, he said, is also expected to spur new economic growth in regions producing raw materials.

“This initiative will take place in the regions, not in Jakarta. It will help reduce imports, increase people’s incomes, and lower pollution through better fuel quality,” Bahlil said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ethanol-pump.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 12:02:11.004089

Where Do We Stand?

Swanson said farmers and many of those outside the industry have a very different view of the current farm economy.

USDA's September farm income forecast showed expected income 25% higher than last year. ""For folks outside of agriculture or people in our D.C. offices, if they see that headline or umber, then the perception is that the farm economy is really strong,"" she said.

On the other side of the coin, last month's NCGA survey of more than 1,000 corn growers showed 76% of respondents are very or moderately concerned about the farm economy, 85% feel we are on the brink of or heading toward a farm crisis, and 65% are more concerned about their farm's finances than they were a year ago.

One reason for this disconnect, she said, is USDA's forecast includes the livestock sector and ad hoc support in the form of disaster aid, farm program payments, and crop insurance. ""All of those things added together paints a very different picture than just looking at costs and returns in the crop sector,"" Swanson said.

Those ad hoc payments skew the perception of income. ""That money is generally not staying in farmers' pockets. They're going to use it to pay their input bills or pay down an operating loan so they can turn around and pay whatever bills that they have,"" she said. ""That is going to continue to also help some of those agricultural retailers, shops and rural economies. There is a flow-through effect that happens as opposed to just going to the farmers.""

Is It the 1980s All Over Again?

The current financial climate has some parallels with another difficult chapter for farmers. ""No one in agriculture likes to make a comparison to the 1980s, but we're in a really high-cost environment right now, which was also true to that period from the mid '70s to the mid '80s, and in fact, when you adjust from a nominal perspective, we've been at record high production costs by a long shot since 2022,"" Swanson said.

She said farmers find themselves in a Catch-22 because inputs and other expenses are correlated with inflation over long periods of time, but the prices farmers receive for their crops is not. ""Inflation is driving all of those types of inputs higher,"" she said, ""but for a commodity like corn especially, it's primarily driven on supply and demand.""

Swanson said she's noticing red flags including weakening in terms of loan repayments, farmer debt levels relative to assets, and a cumulative drop in negative net returns between 2023 and 2025 that is the sharpest relative drop back to when that data set began in 1975. ""It costs a lot more to do business today — the amount of money that it takes to put in a crop on an average farm,"" she said. ""So when you think bout the risk potential that's out there and the sharpness of that drop, I think those are two things that are definitely concerning.""

What's the Answer?

Still, Swanson said, there are bright spots. ""We don't have interest rates that are comparable to the '80s,"" she said. ""The global market continues to have a lot of potential and we're much more globalized and connected as a world than we were [in the 1980s]. There has been evolution in a lot of places and there are market opportunities out there.""

Swanson said NCGA's message to Congress and the administration is that what most farmers really want is a competitive market for their product. ""We need to break down some policy barriers with some real changes. It's nice to get a trade agreement that has some purchase commitments in it, but there are some nations where there's a lot of market potential and there's other types of barriers such as they won't use corn-based ethanol in their fuel; they'll only use it for industrial uses or they won't take it. There are biotech-based products we know scientifically are proven to be safe, there's phytosanitary, and there's a whole slew of different types of what we call non-tariff barriers, and so what we really want or need is is breaking through some of those.""

There's room for domestic demand growth as well, Swanson said, citing policy barriers preventing year-round or higher blends of ethanol and the affordable use of renewable aviation fuel. ""None of these are a one-and-done answer. It's going to be a collective approach that takes time, but I think there are opportunities out there,"" she said.

What Can Farmers Do?

""Challenging times can cause us to be distracted and anxious and can keep us from staying focused on our goals,"" Swanson said. She offered three tips for farmers:

Know your numbers and focus on controllables. ""Keep good records. If you really want to hone in on your controllables or figure out where you could make adjustments to your business in a challenging time, you have to keep good track of things to start with.""

Be consistent. ""Sometimes it's easy to get discouraged and feel like in tough, challenging times, it's hard to make a big move, but remember that small steps can be easier in a tough environment and small steps compound over time,"" she said. ""Agriculture is an industry that's going to keep progressing, so as a farmer, you need to keep up with that, too. I think it's more important than ever not to be stagnant."" For example, she said, if you're saving for a piece of land, you may not be able to set aside as much as you would've liked, but maybe you can do smaller amounts. Or if you have technology goals, just add one thing this year.

Have courage. Swanson encouraged farmers to have the courage to make hard decisions, and to get involved with NCGA or other organizations and have the courage to act and share ideas. She also advised farmers to have conversations with others. ""You can communicate and have the opportunity to talk with people who sometimes don't understand agriculture because they're removed from it, so have the courage to have coffee with a neighbor and share about that too,"" she said.

Swanson reiterated that while times are certainly tough, there are bright spots and opportunities. She said, ""We have to really come together as an industry and support each other and work together to try to get the right people in the right places to make things happen.""

Episode Highlights

Swanson said farm income headlines mask crop-sector stress once ad hoc aid and livestock are stripped out.

An NCGA grower survey showed widespread concern and rising financial anxiety versus last year.

Swanson contrasted today with the 1980s, pointing to lower interest rates but sharper recent margin compression.

Swanson stressed that commodity prices don’t track inflation, while inputs do over time.

Swanson urged farmers to focus on controllables: accurate records, consistency in small steps, and courage in hard calls.

She noted domestic opportunities in higher ethanol blends and sustainable aviation fuel, but said we must remove non-tariff barriers in international markets.

Yet after each wave of excitement, enthusiasm faded as commercialization hurdles proved tougher than many anticipated.

In my 17 years covering this industry, I’ve done much reporting on the topic. For example, more than a decade ago, the 550-MW Boardman Coal Plant in Boardman, Oregon, sought to repower with torrefied biomass. The utility performed a series of test trials and the effort lasted several years beginning in 2013, but it was ultimately deemed unfeasible due to technical challenges with the torrefaction process and difficulties in securing a reliable, sustainable biomass fuel supply, among other reasons. The plant permanently closed several years ago and was demolished, despite having many years of potential life left.

Today, however, the tide appears to be turning. New projects, improved technologies and fresh investment are bringing the concept back into focus—and this time, progress feels more tangible than ever. The market for torrefied and steam-treated pellets may finally be taking shape, as reflected by the increasing coverage in Pellet Mill Magazine, including this issue.

In our page-10 article, “Bringing Black Pellets to Belledune,” contributing writer Keith Loria explores the Belledune Clean Fuel Project in New Brunswick, Canada, which is seeking an alternative fuel source and examining the long-term viability of 100% advanced pellets after completing two test burns. The plan is to be off coal by 2030—still four years away, but that will come quickly.

All of the above said, white pellets aren’t going anywhere. Their global production base, proven reliability and established supply chains continue to anchor the biomass sector—and will for years to come. As black pellet ventures gain traction, it’s not a story of replacement, but one of expansion and diversification within a maturing industry.

New markets for white pellets are also emerging. In our page-16 feature article, “Forest Waste to Flight Fuel,” Associate Editor Katie Schroeder covers a panel at the North American Sustainable Aviation Fuel Conference & Expo, during which industry experts made the case for wood pellets and other wood residuals as potential feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel production. I was shocked to learn that a storm in Bemidji, Minnesota, this summer took down an estimated 9 million trees. Instances like this raise the question: What can be done with this waste—and why not use it for SAF or other bioenergy initiatives, if no other higher-value use?

Of course, project developers can’t rely on storms to provide the consistent feedstock streams they need. In the article, Schroeder reports on the remarks of the U.S. Industrial Pellet Association’s Darrell Smith, who focused on the abundant and increasing forestry resources in the Southeast and why it makes sense for landowners and pellet producers to participate in biofuel and bioenergy markets. While industrial wood pellet producers have historically served overseas markets, he noted, they would like to develop domestic outlets as well. Smith also pointed to the downturn of the pulp and paper industry as a catalyst for finding new uses for wood waste and residuals. “We need to build more pellet mills because we really need more of them—it’s one of the only solutions to this declining paper market,” he said.

Finally, I’d like to mention that the abstract portal for speaking opportunities at the International Biomass Conference & Expo is now open. We have a dedicated track for wood pellets and biocarbon and fully expect all spots to be filled. Join us in Nashville in 2026—apply to speak, register or learn more at biomassconference.com.

The company’s stock declined 2.58% following the presentation, closing at $61.50, as investors reacted to the company’s cautious outlook for the fourth quarter.

The materials company reported record third-quarter earnings per share while maintaining consistent performance compared to the previous quarter, but signaled a seasonal slowdown ahead. Market conditions remained mixed across MTX’s diverse portfolio, with particular weakness in construction-related markets and renewed uncertainty around tariff policies.

""We delivered record third-quarter earnings per share with strong execution amid mixed market conditions,"" said Douglas T. Dietrich, Chairman and CEO, highlighting the company’s performance in the challenging environment.

Quarterly Performance Highlights

Minerals Technologies reported Q3 2025 sales of $532 million, representing a modest 1% increase both sequentially and year-over-year. Operating income was $78 million, down 1% from both the prior quarter and the same period last year. The company maintained earnings per share of $1.55, flat compared to Q2 but up 3% year-over-year.

As shown in the following financial overview:

Operating margin contracted slightly to 14.7%, representing a 20 basis point decline from the previous quarter and a 40 basis point reduction year-over-year. Despite these margin pressures, the company generated strong free cash flow of $44 million in the quarter, a 24% improvement from the same period in 2024.

The company returned $20 million to shareholders during the quarter and announced a 9% increase to its quarterly dividend, demonstrating confidence in its financial position despite the mixed operating environment.

Segment Performance Analysis

Minerals Technologies operates through two main segments: Consumer & Specialties and Engineered Solutions, each showing different performance trajectories during the quarter.

The Consumer & Specialties segment reported sales of $277 million in Q3, relatively flat compared to $278 million in the previous quarter. Operating income for this segment remained stable at $37 million, unchanged from Q2 but down from $42 million in Q3 2024. The company noted that pet litter sales were gaining momentum, while growth continued in natural oil purification and fabric care products.

The segment performance is detailed in the following chart:

The Engineered Solutions segment showed more positive momentum, with sales increasing to $255 million in Q3 from $251 million in Q2. Operating income improved to $45 million from $44 million in the previous quarter. This segment achieved a record operating margin of 17.6%, demonstrating strong execution despite tariff impacts.

As illustrated in the segment breakdown:

""We achieved record operating margin at 17.6% of sales in our Engineered Solutions segment through strong execution while mitigating tariff impacts,"" noted Erik C. Aldag, Senior Vice President, Finance and Treasury and Chief Financial Officer during the presentation.

Strategic Growth Initiatives

Despite near-term market challenges, Minerals Technologies continues to invest in organic growth opportunities across its business segments. The company highlighted several key investment areas aligned with high-growth markets, including cat litter, global bleaching earth, and paper and packaging in Asia.

The following chart details the company’s recent organic growth investments:

Notable initiatives include upgrading cat litter production facilities in the US and Canada while expanding capacity in rapidly growing Asian markets. The company is also increasing capacity for sustainable aviation fuel production and other renewable fuels, reflecting its commitment to sustainability-driven growth opportunities.

In the technology space, Minerals Technologies continues to deploy its Minscan® units for steel customers, with 12 units already installed and plans to add six more over the next 12 months. This technology provides significant value to customers while creating a recurring revenue stream for the company.

Balance Sheet and Capital Allocation

Minerals Technologies maintained a strong financial position, with total liquidity of $706 million as of Q3 2025, a significant improvement from $556 million in the same period last year. The company reduced its net debt slightly to $649 million from $658 million in Q3 2024, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 1.7x EBITDA.

The following chart illustrates the company’s balance sheet strength and capital deployment:

Free cash flow generation was particularly strong at $44 million for the quarter, representing a 24% increase from $35 million in Q3 2024. This improvement came despite slightly higher capital expenditures of $27 million compared to $25 million in the prior year period.

The company’s balanced approach to capital allocation was evident in its decision to return $20 million to shareholders during the quarter while continuing to invest in growth initiatives and maintaining financial flexibility.

Forward Outlook and Guidance

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Minerals Technologies provided a more cautious outlook, projecting sales between $510 million and $525 million and operating income between $65 million and $70 million. This guidance implies a sequential decline from Q3 results, with earnings per share expected to range from $1.20 to $1.30.

The company’s Q4 outlook is summarized in the following projection:

Several factors are driving this more conservative outlook, including seasonally slower construction activity, softer residential construction markets, and foundry customers signaling longer downtime at year-end. The company also cited renewed uncertainty around tariff policies as a potential headwind.

For the Consumer & Specialties segment, management expects similar performance in Household & Personal Care products but anticipates soft market conditions and a seasonally slow period in residential construction. The Engineered Solutions segment is projected to see modestly lower sales in High-Temperature Technologies due to foundry outages and a typical seasonal reduction in Environmental & Infrastructure activities.

Despite these near-term challenges, the company remains focused on its long-term growth initiatives, particularly in high-growth markets such as sustainable aviation fuel, pet care products, and specialized technology solutions.

Neste’s commitment to scaling SAF production is emphasized by Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, who stated: “We are thrilled to enable United Airlines to expand SAF use to new markets in the U.S.
As demand for SAF grows, Neste and United are working to encourage supportive policies that foster production and adoption.","Neste and United Airlines have strengthened their partnership to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to three major U.S. airports: George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Texas; Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey; and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington, D.C. This agreement marks United as the first commercial airline to introduce SAF for flights from these key hubs, advancing sustainable practices in aviation.

Under the agreement, Neste provides its Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ in its pure form, which is then blended with conventional jet fuel to meet industry standards. Deliveries to George Bush Airport began in July 2025 and will continue through October 2025. Supplies to Newark and Dulles airports started in September 2025 and are scheduled to run until the end of 2025. The SAF is transported through existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s terminal facilities in Houston, ensuring efficient delivery to each airport.

“Introducing SAF for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley. “While United remains one of the leading SAF users in the U.S., using over 4,300 tons last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with stakeholders, like Neste, across the aviation value chain to encourage policymakers to implement sensible market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

The partnership supports the aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Neste’s commitment to scaling SAF production is emphasized by Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, who stated: “We are thrilled to enable United Airlines to expand SAF use to new markets in the U.S. It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its bold net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050. We remain fully committed to supporting our customers in reducing emissions by scaling our SAF production and supply capabilities.”

This initiative builds on United’s leadership in SAF adoption, having utilized significant volumes in prior years. The expansion to these airports enhances access to lower-carbon fuel, reducing the environmental impact of flights. By leveraging existing infrastructure, the partnership ensures seamless integration of SAF into operations, supporting both economic and environmental objectives.

The collaboration highlights the importance of industry partnerships in advancing sustainable aviation. As demand for SAF grows, Neste and United are working to encourage supportive policies that foster production and adoption. This effort positions the U.S. aviation sector as a leader in sustainable fuel use, contributing to global efforts to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining operational efficiency.",,N,,2025-10-25 06:56:15.009117

Each represents a distinct philosophy in engineering and design. GE’s GE9X, developed exclusively for Boeing’s upcoming 777X, is a testament to size and raw power, the largest jet engine ever built. Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB, meanwhile, powers Airbus’ A350 and has earned a reputation as one of the most efficient and reliable engines in commercial service. Both engines showcase the pinnacle of aerospace innovation, yet they embody very different approaches to achieving performance, efficiency, and sustainability.

As the global aviation industry faces growing pressure to cut emissions and operating costs, the rivalry between these two engine makers has never been more relevant. Airlines now scrutinize every kilogram of thrust and every fraction of fuel burn in pursuit of lower carbon footprints and higher profitability. In comparing the GE9X and Trent XWB, it becomes clear that while both engines share common goals of efficiency, reliability, and sustainability, the paths they take to achieve them couldn’t be more different.

Engineering Philosophy: Two Paths To Power

At the heart of the GE9X is a philosophy of power through simplicity. GE has long favored the twin-spool engine configuration, one low-pressure and one high-pressure spool, which reduces complexity, weight, and maintenance demands. In the GE9X, this simplicity is paired with enormous scale. It’s the largest turbofan engine ever produced, with a fan diameter of 134 inches (3.4 meters), allowing vast volumes of air to move through the engine for exceptional efficiency. The result is a design that pushes traditional boundaries without complicating the core mechanics.

Rolls-Royce’s approach with the Trent XWB reflects its faith in the three-shaft configuration that defines the entire Trent family. Instead of two rotating assemblies, it uses three: low, intermediate, and high-pressure systems, each spinning at its optimal speed. This architecture offers improved aerodynamic performance across various flight regimes and more stable operation under varying loads and altitudes. It also gives Rolls-Royce engineers greater flexibility in fine-tuning the engine for specific aircraft variants, such as the Airbus A350-900 and Airbus A350-1000.

Both philosophies have proven effective, yet they embody contrasting traditions. GE’s approach favours manufacturing scalability and fewer moving parts, while Rolls-Royce prioritizes refined mechanical harmony and in-flight adaptability. These differences shape everything from maintenance intervals to fuel consumption curves, making the GE9X and Trent XWB as much a reflection of their companies’ cultures as their engineering choices.

Size And Performance: The Numbers That Matter

The GE9X’s sheer dimensions are staggering. Its 134 inch (3.4 meter) fan, roughly the width of a Boeing 737 fuselage, makes it the largest jet engine ever certified for commercial use. Capable of producing up to 105,000 pounds of thrust, it is designed to meet the demands of the 777X, set to be the world's largest twin jet. The engine’s bypass ratio of around 10:1 ensures that most of the air it moves bypasses the core, resulting in both quieter operation and improved fuel efficiency compared to its predecessor, the GE90.

By contrast, the Trent XWB’s fan measures a smaller but still impressive 118 inches (3 meters) and delivers thrust levels ranging from 84,000 to 97,000 pounds, depending on the model. Its bypass ratio sits just below GE’s at roughly 9.6:1, optimized for the Airbus A350’s aerodynamic profile. While not the most powerful engine in raw terms, it offers a balance of thrust and efficiency that perfectly suits the A350’s long-haul and ultra-long-haul mission profile, enabling flights of up to 9,700 nautical miles ( Airbus A350-900ULR).

The difference in thrust reflects the distinct aircraft they power. The Boeing 777X requires higher thrust to accommodate its greater takeoff weight and payload capacity, while the A350 prioritizes range and fuel economy. In practice, both engines deliver near-identical gains in specific fuel consumption compared to previous generations, a testament to how far propulsion technology has advanced, even as design philosophies diverge.

Materials And Innovation: Composites Vs Traditional

GE’s GE9X marks a breakthrough in materials engineering. It features carbon-fibre composite fan blades and cases, reducing overall engine weight by hundreds of kilograms. More critically, it incorporates ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) in high-temperature turbine components. These advanced ceramics can withstand temperatures hundreds of degrees hotter than metal alloys while remaining lighter and more durable, contributing directly to higher efficiency and longer component life.

Rolls-Royce takes a different approach, emphasizing incremental improvement over radical change. The Trent XWB uses single-crystal turbine blades, advanced nickel alloys, and sophisticated cooling technologies to manage extreme heat within its high-pressure core. The manufacturer's expertise in thermal control allows the engine to maintain optimal performance over long service intervals, reducing wear and extending the time between overhauls. This design philosophy has given the Trent XWB one of the highest dispatch reliability rates in the industry.

Both engines also reflect sustainability-focused innovation. Their advanced materials allow for higher combustion efficiency and lower emissions, and both are certified to operate on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). While GE has made headlines for its aggressive use of composites, Rolls-Royce’s steady evolution underscores that innovation can come as much from refinement as reinvention.

Fuel Efficiency And Environmental Goals

Fuel efficiency has become the defining metric of modern engine success, and both manufacturers tout impressive numbers. GE claims the GE9X offers a 10% improvement in specific fuel consumption over the GE90, achieved through its larger fan, lean-burn combustor, and advanced turbine materials. This translates into significant fuel savings for airlines, a crucial advantage as fuel costs remain the single largest operating expense for most carriers.

The Trent XWB, meanwhile, has already established itself as a benchmark for efficiency in real-world operations. Since entering service in 2014, it has powered the A350 fleet through millions of flight hours, consistently delivering the lowest fuel burn per seat among widebody aircraft. Rolls-Royce’s continuous software updates and engine health monitoring systems have further optimized performance, ensuring that each engine operates as close as possible to its theoretical efficiency limits throughout its lifespan.

Both companies are deeply invested in sustainability initiatives. The GE9X and Trent XWB are fully compatible with sustainable aviation fuels and form part of broader efforts to reduce lifecycle emissions. As the industry shifts toward net-zero carbon targets by 2050, these engines represent transitional technologies bridging today’s fossil-fuel era with a cleaner future built on hydrogen, hybrid-electric, or next-generation SAF propulsion systems.

Reliability, Maintenance, In-Service Record

Reliability remains a cornerstone of any successful commercial engine program. Here, the Trent XWB enjoys the advantage of time. With more than a decade of service, it boasts dispatch reliability rates exceeding 99.9%, and operators consistently report stable performance across varying climates and cycles. Rolls-Royce’s long experience with the Trent family provides a robust foundation for predictive maintenance and global support infrastructure.

The GE9X, though newer, benefits from the lessons learned across decades of GE engine development. Having completed over 5,000 hours of testing, including extreme temperature, crosswind, and endurance trials, it has proven capable of withstanding punishing conditions. GE’s use of digital twin technology, real-time virtual replicas of each engine in service, promises to revolutionize maintenance scheduling and reduce unscheduled downtime once the 777X enters airline fleets.

That said, reliability is only proven in service, and GE will need to demonstrate consistency across thousands of operational hours before airlines can fully trust its long-term performance. Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB, while largely trouble-free, has not been without challenges; regulatory inspections in recent years remind the industry that even mature engines can face component fatigue issues. Ultimately, both engines underline that reliability is not just about design; it’s about continuous monitoring, data, and global support.

Market Impact, Future Of Widebody Power

The GE9X and Trent XWB represent more than just engineering triumphs; they embody the strategic alignment of engine manufacturers with aircraft makers. GE’s exclusive partnership with Boeing on the 777X ensures complete integration and optimization, a move that consolidates GE’s dominance in the large twin-engine market. Rolls-Royce, in turn, enjoys exclusivity on the A350, giving it a stable, long-term platform to refine and expand its Trent family.

In market terms, both engines are vital to the recovery and modernization of the long-haul segment. The Trent XWB’s proven efficiency makes it a favorite for airlines rebuilding international routes post-pandemic, while the GE9X’s upcoming entry into service with the 777X will reintroduce new performance benchmarks for payload and range. Each engine anchors its manufacturer’s future competitiveness and signals a long-term bet on sustained demand for large twin jets.

Looking ahead, both companies are investing heavily in next-generation propulsion concepts, from Rolls-Royce’s UltraFan program to GE’s open-fan architecture under the CFM RISE initiative. These efforts will likely redefine what efficiency and sustainability mean in aviation. But for now, the GE9X and Trent XWB remain the crown jewels of widebody propulsion, proof that while the race toward greener skies is far from over, the competition at 40,000 feet has never been more compelling.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rollsroyce.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-24 22:56:11.820010

While committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the aviation sector argues that policy must reflect current production realities.
“Instead of increasing SAF production as regulators intended, the mandate has caused prices to rise without meeting production targets,” he said.
A report from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) showed SAF accounted for only 0.6% of total aviation fuel at EU airports in 2024.
The mandate requires 2% SAF blending in 2025 and 6% by 2030—levels Walsh said cannot be met under current production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned that the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate is raising operating costs for airlines without sufficiently increasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Speaking at IATA’s World Sustainability Symposium, Director General Willie Walsh called the regulation “not fit for purpose.”

Walsh noted that airlines are absorbing most of the mandate’s cost impact. While committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the aviation sector argues that policy must reflect current production realities. “Instead of increasing SAF production as regulators intended, the mandate has caused prices to rise without meeting production targets,” he said.

IATA estimates the transition to net-zero emissions will cost around US$174 billion per year, or nearly US$35 per passenger annually, far exceeding the current average profit of US$7 per passenger, increasing financial pressure on airlines.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Chief Economist and SVP of Sustainability, emphasized that decarbonization remains essential but must be backed by policies that expand supply instead of raising costs. Walsh called for a redesign of ReFuelEU, stating: “If levies do not lead to a significant increase in SAF production, they are not meeting their purpose.”

He cited the United States as a model, where incentives have accelerated SAF development. EASA data shows SAF prices averaged US$2,400 per ton in 2024, compared with US$852 per ton for conventional jet fuel. Walsh criticized fuel producers, saying SAF prices “are set far above conventional fuel without justification tied to production capacity.”

Paris, October 24, 2025 – TotalEnergies SE acknowledges the decision of the Paris Judicial Court, which dismissed the majority of the claims brought against it, notably those targeting the Company’s corporate communications. The Court ordered the removal from its French affiliate’s website, aimed at its customers, of three paragraphs concerning the carbon neutrality ambition. Contrary to what certain media reported, the claims relating to the communication campaign associated with its name change in 2021, as well as those targeting its institutional communication on the role of natural gas and biofuels in the energy transition, were all rejected. No “advertising” by TotalEnergies’ affiliates in France was condemned by the Court.

In light of this ruling, which actually pertains to the fact that the scenario on which TotalEnergies’ multi-energy (oil, gas, power) transition strategy is based is not mentioned in these three paragraphs, TotalEnergies SE and its affiliate TotalEnergies Électricité et Gaz France have decided not to appeal the decision. The three paragraphs concerned will be replaced by a factual description of TotalEnergies’ achievements to date in the implementation of its multi-energy strategy, to dispel any doubts among its customers.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most practical near-term solution, offering significant emission reductions without requiring major aircraft or infrastructure changes.

Globally, SAF development is gaining momentum, supported by national mandates, corporate commitments, and rapid advancements in renewable energy and conversion technologies.

Demand Growth Insights

Rising SAF demand is projected to reach 500 million tons (Mt) by 2050, aligning with the global Net Zero emission target.

The expansion of SAF production will rely heavily on the availability of biomass feedstock, which is essential for scaling up capacity.

Policy mandates and corporate decarbonization commitments are the main drivers of market adoption, while continuous innovation in conversion efficiency and logistics remains crucial to meet future demand sustainably.

Four Leading SAF Pathways: Process and Key Feedstocks

The development of SAF relies on several certified technological routes. Each pathway uses different types of feedstock and production processes, resulting in unique cost structures and scalability potential.

The HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway remains the most commercially mature. It converts feedstock using hydrogen to remove oxygen and produce hydrocarbon fuel components. Typical feedstocks include vegetable oil, animal fat, and used cooking oil.

The ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) route transforms lignocellulosic materials, sugar, or starch-based feedstock into alcohols such as ethanol and butanol, which are then further processed into jet-range hydrocarbons.

The BG-FT (Biomass Gasification – Fischer Tropsch) process converts carbon-containing biomass, such as wood residues or agricultural waste, into synthesis gas (syngas) and then into SAF through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

Lastly, PtL or e-fuels (Power-to-Liquids) use a similar process to FT, but the synthesis gas is generated from green hydrogen and captured CO₂. This method is still in the early stages of commercialization and is highly dependent on renewable electricity costs and availability.

Global Policy and Emission Targets

Under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), several initiatives are driving the sector’s decarbonization journey. The CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) program, implemented from 2021 to 2035, requires airlines to offset any emissions that exceed their 2020 baseline. ICAO has also set the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while the Third Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) focuses on advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF), and other clean aviation energy technologies.

Meanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) aligns the commercial aviation sector through its Fly Net Zero initiative, a collective commitment among member airlines to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Supporting organizations like ATAG, ACI, and CANSO further contribute by promoting sustainable airport operations, efficient air navigation, and cross-industry collaboration.

Together, these global frameworks represent a unified roadmap that connects regulation, technology, and market action in the aviation industry’s transition toward sustainability.

SAF Production Cost Breakdown by Pathway

SAF production cost generally consists of three major components: Feedstock, Capital and Operational Costs (Capex/Opex), and Energy & Utilities.

HEFA: Dominated by feedstock cost (≈50%), making it sensitive to fluctuations in vegetable oil or fat prices.

AtJ and FT: Have the highest Capex/Opex shares (50% and 55.56%), heavily dependent on scale-up to achieve cost efficiency.

PtL/eSAF: Dominated by Energy & Utilities (57.89%), mainly renewable electricity and hydrogen production.

Each pathway has unique cost drivers: HEFA depends on feedstock prices, PtL on clean energy costs, and AtJ/FT on capital investment and operational scale.

Indonesia’s Position in the Global SAF Market

Indonesia holds a unique position in the global SAF landscape due to its abundant and diverse feedstock resources.

Rice straw, sugarcane, corn, and cassava are widely available across Java and Sumatra; palm residues and wood waste dominate Kalimantan and Papua; while coconut and sugarcane play key roles in Sulawesi and Bali.

Indonesia holds a remarkable position in Southeast Asia’s SAF development, accounting for around 38% of the region’s total feedstock potential. This advantage is supported by ongoing refinery expansion, with facilities in Cilacap (0.42 Mt per year), Plaju (0.93 Mt per year), and Cilegon (0.30 Mt per year). Altogether, these projects bring Indonesia’s planned SAF refining capacity to over 1.6 million tons annually, underscoring the country’s growing readiness to supply sustainable aviation fuel at a regional scale.

Indonesia’s Comparative Advantage

Indonesia’s comparative advantage in SAF production lies in its strong bioeconomy foundation, feedstock diversity, and geographical positioning within Asia-Pacific routes.

Why Indonesia is advantaged:

Diversified bioeconomy and proven biofuel expertise (HEFA-ready)

Large domestic jet-fuel base with rising APAC traffic — strong anchor for offtake agreements

Upgradable refineries (Cilacap, Plaju) and skilled labor

Access to CORSIA and regional cooperation mechanisms

Abundant feedstock base (rice straw, palm residues, UCO)

Strategic refinery and port locations enabling efficient logistics

Policy support and potential SAF roadmap providing strong institutional backing

Short term: Scale up HEFA production using existing assets

Medium term: Add ATJ and FT production lines as residue collection systems mature

Logistics, Policy, and Support Opportunities

Indonesia’s SAF development benefits from its geographic advantage and integrated logistics infrastructure:

Refineries located near major ports and flight routes in the Asia-Pacific region.

Proximity to biomass supply areas across key islands.

Opportunities for carbon credit markets, green financing, and blending mandates.

Collaboration potential with global aviation and energy companies through offtake agreements and joint R&D.

Existing refinery networks (Cilacap, Plaju, Cilegon) capable of co-processing bio-feedstock.

The global Sustainable Aviation Fuel market is evolving rapidly, with HEFA leading commercialization while ATJ, FT, and PtL pathways continue to mature. Strong policy frameworks and long-term net-zero targets from ICAO and IATA are accelerating investments across regions.",https://ecadin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Landscape-SAF.webp,N,,2025-10-24 18:00:45.179847

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable jet fuel made from sustainable resources or waste materials that meet strict sustainability criteria.
In terms of characteristics, SAF is chemically and physically identical to conventional jet fuel, making it fully compatible with the current aviation infrastructure.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a vital milestone in the clean-energy transition of the aviation sector.","The world is racing toward the Net Zero Emission 2050 target. Many industries are gradually shifting away from fossil fuels and adopting cleaner energy sources. Aviation, however, remains one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize because of its reliance on high-energy liquid fuels such as jet fuel. To address this challenge, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a practical solution that allows aircraft to fly cleaner without changing engines or airport infrastructure.

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable jet fuel made from sustainable resources or waste materials that meet strict sustainability criteria. It’s known as a drop-in fuel, meaning it can be used directly in existing aircraft without any modification to engines or fuel systems.

In terms of characteristics, SAF is chemically and physically identical to conventional jet fuel, making it fully compatible with the current aviation infrastructure. More importantly, using SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80% over its full life cycle — a major step toward decarbonizing global aviation.

Fuel Standards and Quality

Jet fuel used in Indonesia, including SAF, follows the ASTM D1655 international standard and also refers to the Directorate General of Oil and Gas Regulation (No. 32.K/10/DJM/2020) with Jet A-1 as the main type. Conventional jet fuel is a mixture of hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 150–300°C, a minimum flash point of 38°C, and a maximum freezing point of –47°C.

In the international certification system, two key standards are interconnected:

ASTM D7566 – regulates jet fuels containing synthetic blending components.

ASTM D1655 – serves as the final standard for Jet A and Jet A-1 used in commercial operations.

SAF produced under ASTM D7566 can be used widely after blending and meeting the D1655 quality requirements. This dual-standard approach ensures safety, performance, and full compatibility with modern jet engines.

SAF Production Technologies

SAF can be produced through several certified pathways depending on the feedstock and conversion process. The main ASTM-approved pathways include:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids): made from vegetable oils, animal fats, or used cooking oil. This is the most commercially mature route today.

FT-SPK (Fischer–Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene): produced from biomass converted into syngas and then refined into liquid fuel.

ATJ-SPK (Alcohol-to-Jet): derived from alcohols such as ethanol or butanol converted into paraffinic kerosene.

Other emerging technologies such as SIP, CHJ, and HC-HEFA are still under research and pilot-scale development.

Global Biofuel Trends

As of 2023, bioethanol and biodiesel (FAME) still dominate global renewable fuel production. However, the HVO/HEFA segment is growing rapidly, marking a global shift from conventional biofuels to synthetic hydrocarbon fuels that are more compatible with aviation. This trend strengthens SAF’s role as a key part of the global energy transition in the air transport sector.

SAF Development in Indonesia

Indonesia is among the countries actively developing bio-jet fuel. Pilot projects in Pertamina’s refineries (Dumai and Cilacap) have successfully tested the co-processing of renewable feedstocks with fossil fuels.

The Dumai Refinery produced hydrocarbon biodiesel (Dxx).

The Cilacap Refinery produced J2.4, a blend containing 2.4% bio-jet fuel that has already been tested in commercial flights.

The government targets gradual implementation, starting with 1% SAF in 2027 and increasing to 50% by 2060, with an estimated production capacity of 7.88 million kiloliters per year. The first phase will rely on Green Refinery Cilacap, using used cooking oil (UCO) as the main feedstock.

Global Sustainability and the CORSIA Framework

To ensure that renewable aviation fuels truly deliver environmental and social benefits, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has established strict criteria under the CORSIA program (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). Only fuels that meet comprehensive sustainability requirements are recognized as CORSIA-eligible.

Key Criteria for CORSIA-Eligible Fuels

Greenhouse Gas Emissions: at least 10% lower than fossil jet fuel based on full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Land Use: must not come from primary forests, peatlands, or high-carbon-stock areas.

Environmental Protection: should preserve water, soil, air quality, biodiversity, and local ecosystems.

Social and Economic Aspects: must respect human rights, land and water access, and contribute to food security and community welfare.

Certification: must be verified by ICAO-approved schemes such as ISCC or RSB.

Commonly Accepted Feedstocks

Wastes and residues: used cooking oil (UCO), animal fat, agricultural and forestry residues, municipal solid waste (MSW).

Non-food crops: camelina, jatropha, pongamia, algae oil.

Certain food crops: sugarcane, corn, wheat — only if verified as non-disruptive to food supply.

Gaseous and e-fuels: industrial gases and combinations of CO₂ and hydrogen (power-to-liquid).

These criteria ensure SAF is not just “green on paper” but genuinely contributes to reducing global emissions while promoting social equity and environmental sustainability.

Economic Challenges and Market Outlook

Production cost remains a major barrier. Today, SAF costs 2-4 times higher than conventional Jet A-1, around US $1,200–2,000 per ton, compared with US $600–800 per ton for fossil jet fuel. This gap is mainly due to feedstock prices, hydrogen requirements, and refinery investments.

Even so, the market outlook is promising. HEFA continues to dominate production, while FT-SPK and ATJ-SPK are moving into commercial stages. Policies such as subsidies, carbon credits, blending mandates, and long-term offtake contracts are essential to make SAF financially viable and accelerate deployment globally, including in Indonesia.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a vital milestone in the clean-energy transition of the aviation sector.

It allows aircraft to maintain optimal performance while significantly reducing carbon emissions.

Indonesia has already taken its first steps through technology development, pilot projects, and a long-term implementation roadmap. While cost and supply challenges remain, consistent regulations, green investments, and strong partnerships across sectors can help SAF become a key driver for sustainable air travel. The journey toward cleaner skies has already begun and SAF is the fuel that will take us there.",https://ecadin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SAF-Illustration-2.webp,N,,2025-10-24 16:56:19.228880

But despite this momentum, one major challenge continues to hold back large-scale deployment: bankability.

Many SAF projects still struggle to secure low-cost debt, even when offtakers are willing to commit. This playbook lays out five practical insights to help buyers, developers, and financiers design offtake structures and supporting infrastructure that make SAF projects more investable:

Corporate clients enable risk-sharing and unlock scale. Thanks to book and claim systems, new buyers are beginning to step up with firm, multi-year commitments. Continued collaboration on commercial contract innovation can further improve project bankability.

Contracts should give lenders what they need. Policy risk buffers, standardized product requirements, and long-term, take-or-pay offtake structures with creditworthy counterparties all play a role in attracting project financing.

Book and Claim transfer can power SAF deals. Robust, transparent EAC tracking is essential for investors to count on cash flows. Existing platforms like RSB and the SAFc registry are a starting point, and continuing initiatives to standardize transfers will build market confidence.

Tradability is the goal, not commoditization. SAF projects that provide greater carbon intensity reductions or provide additional sustainability outcomes should be able to both reap and distribute the benefits of their innovation.

Contracted cashflow stability for both EACs and physical fuel is critical. Savvy commercial agreements can create cashflow stability for two of the biggest revenue streams available to SAF projects, and there are blue skies for contract innovation in the sector.

This document provides design principles that stakeholders can use to build a SAF contracting ecosystem that supports real long-term investment. With better alignment across the value chain, we can mobilize capital faster and accelerate the transition to low-carbon aviation.

The company’s Controlled Microbial Upcycling (CMU) process aims to tackle some of the biggest barriers to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Using AI-driven synthetic biology, the method converts multiple waste streams into low-cost, drop-in jet fuel, leveraging existing biogas and refinery infrastructure.

“Aviation is the most emissions-intensive mode of transport. SAFs offer a drop-in solution to decarbonise the sector, yet they currently account for less than 1% of jet fuel usage,” said Dr Deepanshu Singh, researcher in sustainable aviation and Business Development Lead at the Aviation Impact Accelerator (AIA).

“Our CMU process tackles scale-up challenges by using diverse feedstocks, replacing energy-intensive steps with low-cost microbial action, and utilising existing infrastructure. This makes our pathway both scalable and cost-effective.”

Unlike traditional SAF methods, which often rely on crops grown on arable land, CMU avoids competition for food, land, and water while reducing production costs.

Collaboration with University of Cambridge to Accelerate SAF

The funding will support a five-month feasibility study in collaboration with the Aviation Impact Accelerator at the Whittle Laboratory, University of Cambridge. The project will focus on producing carbon-negative fatty acids through the CMU process and includes technoeconomic analysis and lifecycle emissions assessments to evaluate its viability for sustainable aviation fuel production.

“Our modelling capability at the AIA not only informs policy but also guides smarter investment decisions,” said Dr Singh. “By linking this with cutting-edge companies like Neela Biotech, we are helping accelerate the industries of the future.”

AI and Microbial Engineering Driving Innovation

Co-founder Friederike Nintzel, a Marie Curie PhD fellow in synthetic biology, explained:

“Our approach has only recently become feasible thanks to advances in microbiome engineering and AI-driven bio-process design. With airlines setting net zero targets and SAF mandates increasing globally, the demand for sustainable aviation fuel has never been higher.”

With news like this and other developments in SAF investment, that climate is changing fast.
Lessons From the Past Both Airbus and Cathay have invested in SAF before, through funds, partnerships, and offtake agreements.
Investing in Long-Term Strategy The Airbus–Cathay partnership represents a strategic investment in the technologies and partnerships that will define Asia’s next phase of aviation decarbonization.
This Airbus–Cathay partnership reflects a big change in SAF’s global reach.","Asia has already shown immense promise with several developments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Now, that spotlight is growing even brighter.

Airbus and the Cathay Group have announced a joint investment of up to $70 million to accelerate the development of SAF production across the region.

Signed at the International Air Transport Association (IATA) World Sustainability Symposium in Hong Kong, this collaboration represents more than capital. It’s a direct statement of intent.

The partners are positioning themselves to help shape several elements:

Which technologies mature first

Which markets scale fastest

How Asia closes its gap with North America and Europe in SAF supply

Establishing a New SAF Hotspot

Europe and the US have primarily led the charge with large-scale SAF mandates and production. This has left Asia somewhat behind in terms of commercialization. With news like this and other developments in SAF investment, that climate is changing fast.

Singapore’s SAF mandate begins in 2026, and South Korea will follow in 2025. In these two countries alone, this already will create immediate demand for sustainable fuel pathways.

Related: South Korea Charts Its SAF Future with Promising New Mandate Roadmap

Airbus and Cathay’s investment comes at a crucial moment. Regulatory frameworks are just starting to form and early-stage technologies seek funding to move from lab to plant. Their partnership could play a critical role in ensuring Asia develops its own regional SAF supply chain rather than relying on imports.

Building Policy and Partnerships

Another critical piece of this partnership lies in policy advocacy. Airbus and Cathay intend to use their collective influence to push for regulatory clarity, incentives, and regional collaboration. Each one of these factors is essential to making SAF commercially viable.

Despite Asia’s abundant feedstock potential, including waste oils and residues to agricultural byproducts, production remains fragmented. Without consistent frameworks, investment can stall. Coordinated advocacy could change that, helping align governments, refiners, and airlines toward a shared decarbonization pathway.

Lessons From the Past

Both Airbus and Cathay have invested in SAF before, through funds, partnerships, and offtake agreements. However, these initiatives have yielded limited tangible output thus far. The challenge has primarily come in way of logistics like scalability and economics.

This new initiative could mark a shift in approach. The way ahead comes through targeted, early-stage funding focused on technology validation and paired with policy collaboration. By backing credible innovators and pressing for cohesive regional policy, the two firms could help unlock a more robust SAF ecosystem across Asia.

Investing in Long-Term Strategy

The Airbus–Cathay partnership represents a strategic investment in the technologies and partnerships that will define Asia’s next phase of aviation decarbonization. Rather than a short-term play for output, it’s a deliberate move to accelerate innovation and de-risk emerging SAF pathways with the greatest potential to scale.

By supporting early-stage projects with credible technology and strong fundamentals, the two companies are positioning themselves to shape the direction of SAF development. This includes steps from technology selection all the way to supply chain integration.

These collaborations open the door to future offtake agreements and long-term production partnerships once technologies mature.

The investment isn’t just about today’s capacity, either. It’s about securing a leadership role in the evolving sustainable aviation ecosystem and ensuring Asia has a strong foundation for the decades of SAF growth ahead.

A Turning Point for Asia’s Aviation Future

The aviation industry’s net-zero by 2050 goal hinges on SAF’s success. The IATA estimates that 65% of aviation’s emissions reduction will come from SAF adoption alone—a monumental target requiring trillions in cumulative investment.

Asia cannot afford to be a bystander in that race. This Airbus–Cathay partnership reflects a big change in SAF’s global reach. It signals Asia’s further shift from market observer to active participant in the global SAF transformation.

US ethanol production remains steady through 2026. Rising profits and new marine fuel demand could boost corn usage and benefit rural plants. Trade tensions with Brazil and slowed biofuel projects highlight sector uncertainties despite oil majors’ continued investments.

EIA Projects Stable US Ethanol Production

According to the October 7 Short-Term Energy Outlook from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), forecasts for 2025 and 2026 fuel ethanol blending and exports were unchanged from the previous report. Fuel ethanol production also remained unchanged.

The EIA said fuel ethanol production is expected to average 1.06 million barrels per day this year and next year, unchanged from the September report. Production also averaged 1.06 million barrels per day in 2024.

On a quarterly basis, the EIA currently expects fuel ethanol production to average 1.05 million barrels per day during the fourth quarter of 2025. In 2026, production is forecast to average 1.05 million barrels per day in the first quarter, 1.07 million barrels per day in the second quarter, 1.05 million barrels per day in the third quarter, and 1.08 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter.

Net imports of fuel ethanol are expected to average 130,000 barrels per day in both 2025 and 2026, unchanged from 2024 and from the September outlook.

Ethanol Gains from Rising Margins and Marine Fuel Demand

Profit margins are seeing a slight uptick, giving the US ethanol industry a modest boost. A Kansas State University agricultural economist says the sector remains a major corn consumer, using about 35% of the nation’s crop each year.

Global shipping is also eyeing lower-carbon fuels, and the International Maritime Organization’s proposed Net-Zero Framework could open a significant new outlet for US ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel.

Geoff Cooper of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) noted that oceangoing vessels burn roughly 70–80 billion gallons of fuel annually. Capturing just 5% of that market with US biofuels could create demand for 4–5 billion gallons, translating to more than 1.5 billion bushels of additional corn use — a potential economic boost for rural plants and farms.

The Department of Energy estimates that corn ethanol can cut marine GHG emissions by about 61%, soy biodiesel by 66%, and soy renewable diesel by 60% compared with bunker fuel, enabling ships to earn compliance credits if the rule is implemented as proposed in 2027.

US Ethanol Production Rises as Maintenance Ends

US ethanol production moved slightly higher over the past week as more facilities concluded seasonal maintenance. The EIA reported production at 1.074 million barrels per day, the highest average in more than a month — up 3,000 barrels from the previous week and 32,000 barrels from a year earlier.

Iowa State University’s Center for Agricultural and Rural Development said estimated operating margins for the typical Iowa plant remained solidly positive. Demand signals were mixed, with ethanol stocks at 22.628 million barrels, down 92,000 barrels from the previous week but up 353,000 barrels year over year.

The Renewable Fuels Association noted that net ethanol inputs purchased by refiners and blenders rose even as gasoline supplied to the market declined. Ethanol exports averaged 108,000 barrels per day, down 30,000 barrels from the prior week and 32,000 barrels from a year ago.

The Brazilian president has established a roadmap that could lead to a reduction in tariffs on US ethanol amid an ongoing trade dispute, according to local media reports. Brazilian and US officials were scheduled to meet on October 16, with Brazil expected to consider US requests to reinstate an ethanol quota system or create new incentives for US imports, Brazilagro reported.

Since 2020, Brazil has maintained an 18% tariff on US ethanol, a policy that has frustrated US producers, given that Brazilian ethanol can enter the US with a 2.5% de minimis tariff. Previously, US producers could ship up to 600 million litres of ethanol duty-free under a tariff-rate quota system, above which the tariff rose to 20%.

The Office of the US Trade Representative launched a trade investigation into Brazil in July, citing high tariffs on US ethanol exports, digital payments restrictions, unfair trade practices, corruption and deforestation concerns.

Biofuel Project Rollouts Stall

Just last year, several oil majors appeared to be betting heavily on biofuels, but momentum seems to have slowed in project development in recent months. Despite strong demand for biofuels — as hard-to-abate industries seek to decarbonise — increased uncertainty and other logistical challenges have caused new project rollouts to stall in several regions.

By the end of 2024, several oil majors had increased investments in biofuel development, with a focus on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

At that time, 43 projects were expected to be operational by 2030, according to Rystad Energy. Oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell and TotalEnergies had all committed to biofuel production, representing a combined capacity pipeline of 286,000 barrels per day.",https://www.czapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/47153e17-a0e0-4262-9f1a-7185788e1231.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:57:17.976425

Australia is rapidly emerging as a key market for renewable fuels. A Deloitte report commissioned by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation identifies a AUD$36 billion opportunity to develop a world-leading low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry. This sector could reduce emissions by 230 million tons by 2050 while strengthening Australia’s energy independence.

Currently, Australia imports approximately 80% of its liquid fuels, spending over AUD$50 billion in 2023, while exporting AUD$3.9 billion worth of potential LCLF feedstocks. With onshore fuel reserves of less than 50 days—well below the International Energy Agency’s recommended 90 days—the nation remains highly dependent on imports, leaving it vulnerable to global supply disruptions.

To address this imbalance, the Australian federal government has prioritized low-carbon liquid fuels through its Future Made in Australia initiative. The AUD$1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund is available to support the growth of a domestic LCLF industry, including SAF and renewable diesel.

Growing airline commitments to net-zero emissions, led by Qantas and Virgin Australia, are expected to drive strong demand for locally produced SAF, creating significant investment and development momentum in the region.

This partnership marks a key milestone in XCF’s global expansion strategy, which focuses on capital-efficient, regionally tailored collaborations to accelerate worldwide SAF adoption. It builds on the June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding with Continual Renewable Ventures Pty. Ltd., which laid the groundwork for today’s binding agreement.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global said, “Our partnership with New Rise AU accelerates XCF’s global growth strategy and highlights the scalability of our modular renewable fuel platform. Australia’s favorable policy environment, growing aviation sector, and abundant feedstock resources make it an ideal market for renewable fuel production. Through New Rise AU, we are bringing our platform to a new market, enabling rapid expansion, efficient capital use, and supporting Australia’s clean energy transition. This collaboration demonstrates how XCF transforms opportunities into real-world impact, opening markets and driving sustainable growth.”

Renzo Petersen, CEO of New Rise AU said that New Rise Australia represents a true collaboration between XCF Global and Continual Renewables, united by a shared vision to decarbonize aviation. By combining XCF’s modular site design with Continual Renewable’s local expertise, we aim to establish a self-sustaining renewable fuel industry in Australia that attracts investment, creates jobs, and advances energy independence. This partnership demonstrates how collaboration can translate into capability, and how that capability can power Australia’s clean energy future.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation marks a pivotal step toward transforming Europe’s aviation landscape. The first Annual Technical Report by EASA, released in 2025, captures the progress made by fuel suppliers, airports, and aircraft operators as they prepare to meet sustainability goals. This initial report establishes the all-important baseline from 2024, offering a clear picture of where the industry stands as it begins this crucial transition.

Key Insights from the Report

The data paints a story of progress mixed with opportunity. About two-thirds of fuel suppliers and three-quarters of operators submitted their reports, revealing that 193 kilotonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) were supplied, representing 0.6% of total aviation fuel. SAF helped reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 91%, avoiding over 700 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.

Most SAF currently comes from biofuels, primarily derived from used cooking oil, with a majority of feedstocks imported from Asia. Encouragingly, 25 suppliers are already providing SAF to 33 airports across 12 EU member states, proving that market foundations are steadily strengthening.

Looking Ahead

EASA’s projections suggest that by 2030, EU production of SAF could reach between 1.4 and 5.9 million tonnes, depending on investment momentum and technology adoption. Meeting the 6% SAF target appears achievable, though synthetic fuel development remains a challenge.

Conclusion

The Annual Technical Report is more than a compliance document; it is a mirror reflecting Europe’s readiness for cleaner skies. As momentum builds, collaboration among regulators, producers, and operators will be vital to translate ambition into measurable climate impact.

Seen as the most viable near-term solution for decarbonizing civil aviation, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) now faces a critical challenge: despite broad industry consensus and high expectations, widespread replacement of conventional fossil fuel remains distant, hindered by scaling difficulties and cost barriers.

According to statistics, there are currently 16 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects in Chinese mainland, with eight already operational. Global SAF production capacity should reach 1 million tons in 2025 and 2 million tons in 2026, Xie Xingquan, regional vice president for North Asia with the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

""Although the capacity is doubling, it can only meet a very small portion of the airlines' demand,"" Xie warned.

The remarks were made at the World Safety & Operations Conference held in Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province earlier this month.

SAF is a liquid aviation fuel alternative to traditional jet fuel. Made from renewable materials, it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent over the fuel's life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel.

A study released by IATA, in partnership with Worley Consulting in September, demonstrating that sufficient SAF feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

While, the study identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, including the slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources.

Airlines will need 500 million tons of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps.

To maximize SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology roll-out, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

""Currently, HEFA-SAF (Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids-based SAF), which relies on oils and waste fats, accounts for the majority of the market share, with costs approximately 3-4 times that of conventional jet fuel, according to news outlet China Times, citing IATA's Director of Energy Transition.

The IATA believes that utilizing existing feedstocks for SAF production faces a series of obstacles. One of the biggest issues is the slow progress in technology promotion, which restricts the development of producing SAF through multiple feedstock pathways.

As decarbonization becomes a core agenda across various industries, the demand for SAF is not solely coming from the aviation transport sector. Available biomass feedstocks also face competition from other industries.

On Tuesday, the Cathay Group and Airbus announced a joint investment agreement of up to $70 million to accelerate the development of SAF production in Asia and globally.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production toward 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

From IATA's perspective, policies must prioritize allocating feedstocks to hard-to-abate sectors like aviation. As outlined in IATA's Net Zero Carbon Emissions Roadmap, airlines will need 500 million tons of SAF to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

One direct consequence of production capacity constraints is the persistently high cost of usage. For the aviation transportation industry, which generally operates on low profit margins, this is one of the main reasons why airlines are not very proactive in scaling up the use of SAF.

To break the ""deadlock"" the aviation industry faces regarding SAF, international industry organizations like IATA have been actively engaging with various stakeholders, including regulatory bodies, the aviation and energy sectors, and research institutions.

In IATA's latest report, North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN have been identified as the key regions for global SAF production.

""We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry's path to decarbonization. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry's growth. We need shovels in the ground now,"" said Willie Walsh, IATA's Director General.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2024/2024-11-11/a4fc5236-d191-49f2-a4e1-97c5c57d13e1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 09:01:31.451141

With the China Fusion Energy deal, the total disclosed amount raised in rounds was more than triple the number of venture capital dollars spent in the third quarter of last year. Without that one outlier, however, we see one of the lowest amounts of disclosed dollars invested in the past few years.

Fusion has been a big theme for investors over recent months, especially in the APAC region, where Japan’s Helical Fusion raised a $15.6m series A round and Linea Innovation, also in Japan, raised $12.2m. In the US, Commonwealth Fusion raised a $863m round from investors including Jera, Japan’s largest power company, Kansai Electric Power, and Mitsui OSK Lines, the transport company.

While these recent fusion funding rounds did not include investors from oil and gas companies, earlier in the year Chevron Technology Ventures backed the $150m funding round for fusion startup TAE Technologies, and Chevron and Shell Ventures both backed fusion company Zap Energy at the end of last year.

Overall, cleantech is, as ever, the biggest single segment drawing venture investment from oil majors, with IT still holding its usual second-place spot. Some of the bigger cleantech deals include a $47m Equinor-backed series B for Lithium de France which is developing environmentally-friendly lithium extraction and a $28m series B round for sustainable aviation fuel company OXCCU that was backed by Saudi Aramco and Eni Group.

Transport and mobility, which usually gets several investments every quarter from the big oil companies, has fallen off in 2025, with no quarter seeing more than three rounds in the sector.

So far this year, most subsectors are down from the year before in terms of number of oil and gas company-backed rounds, with the exception of advanced materials and chemicals.

Startups like Radical AI, the AI-aided advanced materials developer that raised a $55m round, backed by Eni Group along with corporates like Nvidia and Raytheon Technologies, showcases AI’s continued inroads into every subsector. Meanwhile India’s deep tech materials developer Chakr Innovation also got an investment from the likes of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation.

Cleantech and IT are both on track to potentially surpass last year’s numbers if the fourth quarter continues current trends.

The average size of a funding round involving oil and gas investors has been falling since 2022. The China Fusion Energy deal somewhat misleadingly pushed the averages up for 2025, to $68.35m. However, taking out the outliers, the median round size is similar to the previous two years.

Over the past decade, cleantech has been the single biggest investment sector for many of the oil and gas majors. One notable exception has been Saudi Aramco, which has invested in twice as many rounds in IT than in cleantech as it has worked to digitise and modernise its systems.

Shell and BP, both of which have made big bets on electric vehicle charging infrastructure, have transport and mobility as their second biggest investment target since 2014, though BPs investment is the smallest of these major players at it has slowed down its activity over the past year or so.

Within the cleantech space, oil and gas corporates seem to have rediscovered their interest in hydrogen, with Q3 2025 seeing as many hydrogen investments by the peer group as there had been up to the same point last year.

Investment in startups such as hydrogen and natural gas recovery systems developer Sapphire Technologies’ Equinor-backed $18m series C, as well as the Woodside Energy-backed $7m seed round for electrolyser manufacturer Stargate Technologies, have pushed up the numbers. Energy sector investments in hydrogen are on track to surpass any year since at least 2020 if this trend continues.

On the other hand, carbon capture and energy storage, which both saw a lot of activity over the past two years, have seen their deal numbers go down in 2025.

Transport startups seem to have had the biggest fall from favour among oil and gas corporates. Despite having three times as many rounds as in the first or second quarters of 2025, Q3 still has as few transport rounds as any quarter since Q4 2021.

Transport may have seen weak investment numbers, but it had one of the biggest exits of the quarter, when public mobility platform provider Via went public in a $493m IPO, providing exits for Shell, alongside other corporates including Bank Hapaolim, Hearst, Koch Industries and Daimler.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/10/CVC-in-numbers-2.png,N,,2025-10-24 09:01:41.275878

Its report, ‘Airport expansion and climate and nature targets,’ concludes that allowing airport growth under existing conditions will make achieving environmental goals significantly more difficult and more expensive.
The report calls on the government to clarify how it will meet its climate, environmental and biodiversity commitments while pursuing airport expansion.
But are they yet ready to be the basis for justifying this level of aviation expansion?
The Committee concluded that without a more coherent strategy, the government risks undermining both its climate targets and the credibility of its broader net zero commitments.","A new report from MPs has criticised the UK government’s approach to managing the environmental impact of aviation while supporting airport expansion. The report argues that it risks putting the UK’s net zero targets in “serious jeopardy.”

The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has warned that current policies are not sufficient to reduce emissions from aviation in line with the UK’s legally binding carbon budgets. Its report, ‘Airport expansion and climate and nature targets,’ concludes that allowing airport growth under existing conditions will make achieving environmental goals significantly more difficult and more expensive.

While ministers argue that expanding airport capacity can support economic growth, the Committee found that the government has not presented robust evidence to show that the economic benefits would outweigh the environmental costs. Approvals already granted for expansion at Stansted, Luton and Gatwick were cited as examples of decisions made without a sufficient evidence base.

The report also raises concerns that the government’s Jet Zero Strategy relies heavily on future technological developments, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), to deliver large carbon savings. The MPs note that these technologies have yet to be proven at commercial scale and that the projected costs of emission abatement are significantly higher than current levels.

Ministers have rejected measures to limit air travel demand, such as capping the number of flights, which the Climate Change Committee has previously identified as a potential tool to reduce emissions. The EAC said the government must explain what alternative measures it plans to use to stay within environmental limits.

MPs also criticised the government for proceeding with expansion before updating the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which dates back to 2018. The Committee said relying on an outdated framework means expansion plans are not being properly assessed against current climate and nature targets.

The report calls on the government to clarify how it will meet its climate, environmental and biodiversity commitments while pursuing airport expansion. It recommends setting this out alongside the forthcoming update to the ANPS, and before any further major expansion projects progress.

EAC Chair Toby Perkins MP said:

Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder. Under the government’s existing Jet Zero Strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.

Having ruled out the kind of demand management measures likely to seriously reduce emissions, ministers need to make clear what alternative tools they are willing to use to ensure targets are met. New technological developments are promising and may in time provide an alternative route forward. But are they yet ready to be the basis for justifying this level of aviation expansion?

The Committee concluded that without a more coherent strategy, the government risks undermining both its climate targets and the credibility of its broader net zero commitments.

Through its comprehensive approach to sustainability, China Airlines is setting a powerful example for others in the sector to follow.","China Airlines has set a new industry standard for sustainable aviation by successfully integrating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its operations, marking a significant achievement in SkyTeam’s ‘Aviation Challenge.’ This milestone positions China Airlines at the forefront of the aviation industry’s push toward reducing carbon emissions, particularly in Thailand, where the airline has been actively promoting environmentally friendly practices. By embracing SAF, a fuel produced from renewable resources that significantly cuts carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel, China Airlines is not only contributing to a greener future but also paving the way for other SkyTeam members and the global aviation sector to follow suit. This move reflects the airline’s commitment to sustainability and its proactive role in driving change within the industry, making it a key player in the fight against climate change.

China Airlines recently marked a major achievement in its ongoing commitment to sustainability with the operation of its next-generation, fuel-efficient A350-900 aircraft, demonstrating a significant leap forward in reducing aviation carbon emissions. The airline took a bold step towards its sustainability goals by fueling its outbound flight with a record 40% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), setting a new benchmark for its TAC (Technical and Commercial) demonstration flights. This milestone underscores the airline’s continued efforts to incorporate SAF into its operations, with the aim of significantly lowering carbon emissions associated with air travel.

The groundbreaking flight, operated between Taoyuan and Bangkok, was made possible through a strong collaboration with CPC Corporation, Taiwan. This partnership provided the 7.7 metric tons of SAF required for the flight, marking a significant development in Taiwan’s SAF production. The achievement represents a key milestone in the island nation’s efforts to enhance its sustainable aviation fuel capacity and contribute to global emissions reduction targets.

The use of 40% SAF on this flight marks a major step forward for China Airlines, as it continues to prioritize SAF as a critical element of its long-term sustainability strategy. By incorporating SAF, the airline is contributing to a future where air travel plays a much smaller role in global carbon emissions. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel, making it one of the most effective solutions for reducing aviation’s environmental footprint.

This move to use SAF is part of China Airlines’ broader strategy to demonstrate leadership in sustainable aviation. The airline has been a long-time promoter of SAF and has focused its efforts on encouraging both public and private sectors to invest in the development of sustainable fuel solutions for the aviation industry. As part of its ongoing commitment to sustainability, China Airlines has emphasized the importance of partnerships with other industry stakeholders, including government entities and academic institutions, to accelerate the widespread adoption of SAF.

The return flight of the same journey, flight CI832 from Bangkok to Taipei, also showcased China Airlines’ commitment to sustainability through international cooperation in the SAF supply chain. For this return leg, SAF was sourced from Thailand’s PTTOR, marking the first time that SAF produced outside Taiwan was utilized on a China Airlines flight. This international collaboration highlights the airline’s global approach to building a sustainable aviation ecosystem that transcends national borders and brings together resources from across the world.

China Airlines has indicated that this collaboration is just the beginning. The airline plans to expand its SAF partnerships and is actively engaging with both governmental and non-governmental organizations to create a more robust SAF supply chain, especially for long-haul flights. This expansion is expected to improve accessibility to SAF, making it easier for airlines around the world to integrate sustainable aviation fuel into their operations. The airline’s long-term objective is to normalize the use of SAF in daily operations and contribute to broader aviation industry goals of reducing carbon emissions.

Beyond fuel use, China Airlines has also taken steps to enhance the sustainability of its in-flight services. The airline introduced a range of environmentally friendly initiatives aimed at reducing waste and carbon footprint across its cabin and catering services. These initiatives include the introduction of electronic menus across all classes, which eliminates the need for paper-based materials, and the use of stainless steel cutlery in Economy Class to reduce single-use plastics. Additionally, the airline has adopted recycled PET (rPET) materials for items such as tray lids, cups, pillow covers, headrest covers, and lavatory containers. These actions reflect China Airlines’ commitment to sustainability across all aspects of its operations, from fuel to in-flight service.

In line with its broader environmental goals, China Airlines is also implementing carbon reduction measures on the ground. The airline has incorporated electric tractors into its ground operations to reduce emissions associated with airport logistics. Furthermore, it has introduced an electronic cargo-handling system designed to minimize paper consumption and improve overall efficiency. These initiatives reflect China Airlines’ understanding that sustainability is not limited to the skies but extends to every facet of its operations, including the ground services that support its flights.

China Airlines’ efforts to reduce its carbon footprint extend to its broader sustainability strategy. The airline continues to explore new ways to integrate environmental considerations into its daily operations. From reducing energy consumption in its airport facilities to introducing more efficient cargo handling methods, the airline is committed to pursuing a holistic approach to sustainability. Its environmental efforts are not only helping to mitigate the effects of climate change but are also setting a benchmark for other airlines to follow.

Looking forward, China Airlines plans to build on these efforts by continuing to invest in new technologies, fuel alternatives, and partnerships that promote environmental responsibility within the aviation industry. The airline recognizes that collaboration across sectors—government, business, and academia—is essential for accelerating the transition to a sustainable aviation industry. With these partnerships, China Airlines aims to lead the charge in driving meaningful change in the industry and ensuring that air travel can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future.

The state had roughly 50 refineries in 1980; today, there are 13 operating refineries as of January 1, 2025, according to federal data, reflecting a structural decline even as California’s unique fuel standards keep supply tight and imports complicated.
These moves were celebrated as climate wins, but they also reduced in-state gasoline production and increased dependence on gasoline imports tailored to California’s boutique blend.
Lawmakers advanced measures to expand oil production approvals in the San Joaquin Valley and bolster fuel supply resilience to counter planned refinery closures.
California’s energy system is evolving, and the EV mandate is gone.","California’s leaders spent years promising an expedited break from fossil fuels, but the state is discovering a hard truth: gasoline and diesel still underpin day-to-day life, and California will keep relying on oil even as it builds out alternatives. Thirteen refineries remain in operation today, with only a shrinking subset still making California-specific gasoline, and policymakers are now quietly adjusting to keep fuel flowing and prices from spiking further. The politics may be loud, but the math is louder. California cannot phase out refineries faster than it can replace their output without triggering volatility at the pump, supply risks, and serious economic fallout.

For decades, refinery capacity has consolidated while demand shocks and environmental requirements have intensified California’s vulnerability to price spikes. The state had roughly 50 refineries in 1980; today, there are 13 operating refineries as of January 1, 2025, according to federal data, reflecting a structural decline even as California’s unique fuel standards keep supply tight and imports complicated. This consolidation means outages or conversions at a few large facilities can ripple through the market immediately, and it’s a major reason regulators and lawmakers are recalibrating their approach in 2025.

A turning point came as several Bay Area and Southern California plants exited petroleum gasoline production to focus on renewable fuels, led by the full conversion of Phillips 66’s Rodeo complex and the Marathon Martinez transition to renewable diesel. These moves were celebrated as climate wins, but they also reduced in-state gasoline production and increased dependence on gasoline imports tailored to California’s boutique blend. The net effect is a tighter market with less buffer, especially during maintenance or unexpected outages, and that raised alarm inside Sacramento about supply security.

By mid-to-late 2025, the state’s own energy officials acknowledged the risk of rapid refinery exits. A joint legislative oversight analysis documented conversions and announced closures, warning of near-term supply constraints and likely price increases as California imports more finished fuel and stabilizes in-state production to bridge the transition. Policymakers began to favor measures that keep existing refineries operating and maintain minimum inventories, not because the state is abandoning climate goals, but because it needs a managed glide path rather than a cliff.

The most visible policy reversal was the pause on implementing a refinery “excess profit” penalty. Initially touted as a landmark accountability tool, regulators delayed enforcement until 2030 after two large facilities representing a substantial share of capacity signaled shutdown plans. The California Energy Commission explicitly linked the pause to fuel reliability and consumer protection, underlining that a rushed punitive regime could accelerate exits and worsen price shocks before alternatives are ready at scale. It was a victory for practical reliability over rhetoric—and a recognition of how sensitive the fuel market has become.

Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration has also shifted posture toward industry engagement as gasoline prices remain a political and economic pressure point. Internal guidance and public remarks emphasized stabilizing the state’s gasoline supply, increasing fuel imports to make up for refinery closures, and supporting in-state production in legacy basins like Kern County to reduce volatility. The message to refiners has been blunt: California believes they can profitably operate here because demand will persist for years, even as the state accelerates clean energy buildout. That practical stance is now informing legislation and regulatory guidance.

Legislative action has followed the same arc. Lawmakers advanced measures to expand oil production approvals in the San Joaquin Valley and bolster fuel supply resilience to counter planned refinery closures. This is not a U-turn on climate policy; it’s an admission that an orderly transition requires a reliable supply and an industrial base capable of meeting residual demand while alternative fuels and infrastructure scale. Without that bridge, California risks importing more fuel from jurisdictions with weaker standards and losing high-wage industrial jobs and local tax revenue before replacement industries are ready.

California must have base load energy and gas or risk continuous rolling brownouts and blackouts. They can’t rely on solar and wind, as they can only support 18% of the state’s needs. Let’s hope other states are watching and do not follow California’s lead.

Even as petroleum production declines, refiners are not exiting energy altogether. Rodeo’s renewable conversion is now producing around 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel capability, while being partially powered by solar and using waste-based recycling. Marathon Martinez’s conversion followed a similar path after navigating lawsuits and environmental approvals, illustrating the complex, costly, and time-consuming reality of repurposing production. These projects prove transition is possible—but they also underscore why the state cannot afford supply holes while conversions come online.

Analysts warn of broader economic stakes in refinery reduction transition. The Bay Area’s refinery belt impacts thousands of jobs, municipal tax bases, and supply chains, and closures trigger cascading problems —from worker displacement to cleanup liabilities. Those risks explain why policymakers are now threading a needle: encouraging conversions and emissions reductions while maintaining enough petroleum capacity to prevent costly disruptions for consumers and businesses. That is the shape of California’s “managed transition” in 2025, and it’s more cautious than activists expected. The result could be disastrous if they follow the original plan.

So where does that leave the state and the 13 refineries? Regulators are easing off financial penalties that could cause abrupt shutdowns, expanding fuel options like higher-ethanol blends to cut prices, and coordinating with industry to ensure minimum inventories and smoother maintenance schedules. At the same time, California is approving conversions, enabling renewable diesel and oil production, and moving ahead on clean energy buildout. The signal is clear: keep the fossil backbone steady while the next-generation system ramps.

The political narrative—“battling Big Oil”—has met the operational reality of keeping 40 million residents and the world’s fifth-largest economy moving. California is not abandoning its climate trajectory, but it is recognizing the cost of moving faster than infrastructure, supply chains, and consumer adoption can support. The result is a wake-up call: partner with refineries to ensure stability, support conversions where feasible, and avoid creating a supply crunch that forces more expensive imports and higher costs to drivers. That is why California will keep fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.

The bottom line is that Governor Gavin Newsom is on his way out, along with his bad ideas and policies that cripple Californians. California’s energy system is evolving, and the EV mandate is gone. Gasoline and diesel remain essential, and refineries—whether petroleum or renewable—are the industrial spine of that system across the USA. Managing that reality means fewer price shocks, stronger reliability, and lower gas prices.

Electrification is widely regarded as the foundation for achieving climate ambitions and unlocking economic growth, energy security and industrial competitiveness.

However, Europe’s path to electrification remains sluggish, with current rates plateaued at just 21% – a figure unchanged in the past decade and trailing China’s rapid 31% electrification pace.

The disparity extends beyond progress to price – European households now pay around €0.27 (US$0.31) per kWh for energy, compared to €0.15 (US$0.17) in the US and just €0.08 (US$0.09) in China.

Valero’s renewable diesel segment, which also includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reported a loss for the quarter.

The ethanol segment reported $183 million in operating income for the third quarter, up from $153 million reported for the same period of last year. Valero primarily attributed the increase to higher ethanol and corn-related coproduct prices and increased production volumes, partially offset by higher corn prices and an increase in operating expenses.

Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.6 million gallons per day during the third quarter, achieving record production. Production volumes were up approximately 51,000 gallons per day when compared to the third quarter of 2024, according to Valero.

Ethanol production volumes for the first nine months of 2025 also averaged approximately 4.6 million gallons per day, up 54,000 gallons per day when compared to the same period of 2024.

During a third quarter earnings call, Valero Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance Homer Bhullar said the company’s ethanol segment is expected to continue to produce 4.6 million gallons per day during the fourth quarter.

Valero’s renewable diesel segment, which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, reported an operating loss of $28 million for the third quarter, compared to operating income of $35 million reported for the same period of last year. The company primarily attributed the decrease to higher feedstock costs and a decrease in sales volumes, which were partially offset by higher product prices, particularly for renewable diesel.

The renewable diesel segment reported $719 million in revenues from external customers for the third quarter, including $623 million for renewable diesel, $29 million for renewable naphtha and $67 million for neat SAF. Revenues from external customers for the same period of last year were at $632 million, including $610 million for renewable diesel and $22 million for renewable naphtha. Valero did not report any revenues from external customers for SAF during the third quarter of 2024.

Renewable diesel segment sales volumes averaged 2.7 million gallons per day during the third quarter, down approximately 827,000 gallons per day when compared to the 3.5 million gallons per day of sales reported for the same period of last year.

Sales volumes for the first nine months of 2025 averaged 2.6 million gallons per day, down 959,000 gallons per day when compared to the 3.6 million gallons per day of sales reported for the same period of last year.

The MPs said ministers must set out how they are going to meet climate, environment and biodiversity targets while pursuing significant airport expansion and before any of the projects break ground.
Their report found that government policies were insufficient to cut carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with targets.
Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have approved airport expansion in a desperate search for economic growth.
“The government must listen to the experts, scrap this reckless agenda of airport expansion, and instead invest in the everyday journeys which really matter to millions of us.”","Airport expansion plans backed by the government are putting the UK’s net zero target in “serious jeopardy”, MPs have warned.

Without new safeguards, proposals to enlarge airports including Heathrow and Gatwick could push the UK over its carbon budgets, according to a report from the cross-party Commons environmental audit committee.

The MPs said ministers must set out how they are going to meet climate, environment and biodiversity targets while pursuing significant airport expansion and before any of the projects break ground.

Their report found that government policies were insufficient to cut carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with targets. It said demand for air travel was expected to rise, further putting the reduction plans in “serious jeopardy”.

Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have approved airport expansion in a desperate search for economic growth.

However, the committee said: “The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to.”

The report also said ministers had ruled out measures to manage demand for aviation, such as limiting the number of flights. The MPs also warned that uptake of sustainable aviation fuel might not help cut emissions because it was not yet being used or produced on a commercial scale. Last year, Air New Zealand scrapped its 2030 decarbonisation target, blaming difficulties in securing sustainable fuel.

The expansion schemes are expected to start before the government updates its national policy statement on airports, released in 2018. The MPs said this meant the government was avoiding scrutiny and relying on “an outdated policy framework which is inconsistent with its objectives”.

Toby Perkins, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “Meeting our decarbonisation targets is already a major challenge. Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder. Under the government’s existing ‘jet zero’ strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.

“Having ruled out the kind of demand management measures likely to seriously reduce emissions, ministers need to make clear what alternative tools they are willing to use to ensure targets are met.”

Alethea Warrington, the head of aviation at the climate charity Possible, said: “This is the final nail in the coffin for the government’s case for airport expansion. The government’s scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn’t have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.

“The government must listen to the experts, scrap this reckless agenda of airport expansion, and instead invest in the everyday journeys which really matter to millions of us.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fca8b65a13573d89ad157c7c58e75cac620fed/322_0_4329_3463/master/4329.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f900c38201c7d72883d7e69741e1b63e",N,,2025-10-23 21:16:30.496643
