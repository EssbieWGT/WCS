Smithfield Foods, the largest U.S. pork processor, said Tuesday that its fiscal third quarter sales and profits rose while lifting its annual outlook.

The meatpacker reported net sales of $3.7 billion, up 12.4% from the third quarter of 2024. Operating profit was $310 million, up 25% from the same period last year. It also raised the midpoint of its annual outlook. Shares rose 4.8%.

Donovan Owens, head of Smithfield’s U.S. fresh pork business, said on a conference call with analysts that the company expects product markets to remain robust well into 2026.

“We’re very poised to see elevated pork markets, especially when you look at how the protein sector is sitting right now with beef being so high,” he said.

Biofuels capacity growth slowed last year

Capacity growth for U.S. biofuel production slowed in 2024, the Energy Information Administration said in a report this week. It found that production capacity rose by a modest 3% from the start of 2024 to the start of 2025, based on the agency’s latest biofuels production capacity reports.

Most of the slowdown was due to a deceleration in production capacity in renewable diesel and other biofuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane make virtually all other biofuels, the EIA said.

Production capacity for renewable diesel and other biofuels increased just 391 million gallons a year in 2024, less than a third of the growth seen in 2022 and 2023, the report said. Only two capacity additions came online in 2024, both in California: Phillips 66’s conversion of its Rodeo refinery to exclusively produce biofuels and a new Renewable Fuels LLC plant in Bakersfield. The conversion gave the Rodeo plant a capacity of 767 million gallons a year, up from 180 million the previous year, and makes it the second-largest renewable diesel plant in the U.S. after Diamond Green Diesel’s 982 million gallon-a-year plant in Norco, Louisiana.

Growth from the Rodeo expansion and the 138 million gallon-a-year Bakersfield plant was partially offset by the loss of capacity at four facilities, the EIA noted: Monroe Energy and Chevron stopped co-processing renewable diesel at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries, respectively; Vertex Energy closed its Mobile, Alabama, plant and Jaxon Energy closed its Jackson, Mississippi facility.

The pace of capacity additions for U.S. biofuel production slowed sharply in 2024. According to the latest Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports, production capacity increased by only 3% from the start of 2024 to early 2025. The report covers every category of renewable diesel, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the country.

EIA analysts said the slowdown was most noticeable in the renewable diesel and other biofuels category. Those two segments accounted for most of the reduced expansion seen last year. The “other biofuels” category includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable naphtha, and renewable propane, which together make up virtually all additional biofuel types currently produced in the United States.

Renewable Diesel and Other Biofuels See Limited Growth

California Projects Dominate 2024 Capacity Additions

The EIA reported that renewable diesel and other biofuels production capacity rose by 391 million gallons per year (gal/y) in 2024. That increase was less than one-third of the growth recorded in 2022 and 2023. Only two projects came online during the year, both located in California: the Phillips 66 Rodeo refinery conversion and a new Renewable Fuels LLC facility in Bakersfield.

The Rodeo refinery underwent a complete conversion to produce only biofuels. Following the conversion, the plant’s capacity grew from 180 million gal/y to 767 million gal/y. This change elevated it to the second-largest renewable diesel facility in the United States, surpassed only by Diamond Green Diesel’s 982-million-gal/y plant in Norco, Louisiana.

However, those gains were partly offset by the loss of production capacity at four facilities nationwide. Monroe Energy and Chevron discontinued renewable diesel co-processing at their Trainer, Pennsylvania, and El Segundo, California, refineries. In addition, Vertex Energy closed its plant in Mobile, Alabama, and Jaxon Energy shut down operations in Jackson, Mississippi.

EIA Data Sources and Market Forces Behind the Shift

Economic Margins and Refining Trends Drive Decisions

According to the EIA’s 2025 Fuel Ethanol Plant Production Capacity Report, 2025 Biodiesel Plant Production Capacity Report, and 2025 Renewable Diesel Fuel and Other Biofuels Plant Production Capacity Report, these changes reflect broader market forces that have evolved since 2020.

The loss of renewable diesel capacity at several facilities corresponds to fluctuating biofuel and petroleum refining margins. During 2020 and 2021, low refinery margins combined with high biofuel credit values spurred a wave of renewable diesel announcements. Companies rushed to convert or expand refineries to take advantage of the favorable economics.

As new plants entered production, the balance shifted. Biofuel output began to exceed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) target volumes, and both biofuel credit values and profit margins declined throughout 2023. Meanwhile, petroleum refinery margins strengthened from their 2020 lows. Those conditions prompted many refiners to slow or postpone investment in new renewable diesel projects in 2024 and beyond.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Emerges as a Priority

Refineries Shift Output Toward SAF

A notable trend in 2024 was the increased focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a renewable jet fuel alternative included in the “other biofuels” category. SAF, along with renewable heating oil, renewable gasoline, renewable naphtha, and renewable propane, represents the next phase of biofuel diversification.

The EIA groups SAF with renewable diesel because both are typically produced in the same facilities, either as byproducts or as replacement outputs when production lines shift from renewable diesel to SAF.

Following completion of the conversion projects in 2024, Phillips 66’s Rodeo plant gained the flexibility to shift about 150 million gal/y of renewable diesel capacity to SAF production. Likewise, Diamond Green Diesel’s Louisiana plant can divert approximately 235 million gal/y to SAF.

These capacity adjustments reflect the growing recognition that SAF offers significant growth potential as the aviation industry faces rising carbon reduction mandates and seeks scalable low-emission fuel options.

Biodiesel Capacity Contracts While Ethanol Expands

Biodiesel Declines Due to Tight Margins

Alongside renewable diesel’s slowdown, the U.S. biodiesel industry also contracted in 2024. EIA data showed that eight biodiesel plants closed during the year because of poor margins, eliminating about 100 million gal/y of capacity. This marks one of the largest single-year declines in biodiesel history and underscores how volatile feedstock prices and weaker Renewable Identification Number (RIN) values have pressured profitability.

Fuel Ethanol Growth Outpaces Other Biofuels

In contrast, fuel ethanol capacity expanded more in 2024 than in the prior two years combined. Ethanol now accounts for 73% of total U.S. biofuels capacity, reaching nearly 18.5 billion gal/y. Most ethanol plants remain concentrated in Midwestern states, particularly Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, and Minnesota, where corn serves as the dominant feedstock.

Although domestic ethanol consumption has stayed relatively stable, the EIA said the new capacity primarily supports export growth. Foreign demand—especially from Canada, Brazil, and Asia—continues to drive shipments of U.S. ethanol as global markets seek lower-carbon fuel blending components.

Biofuel Industry Outlook for 2025

EIA analysts expect modest capacity growth to continue in 2025, particularly for SAF and renewable diesel projects already under construction. Future expansion will depend heavily on policy support, including federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and on global demand for low-carbon transportation fuels.

While the sector’s 2024 slowdown reflects near-term market corrections, the long-term outlook for biofuels in the U.S. energy transition remains positive, driven by ongoing technology advances and federal decarbonization targets.",,N,,2025-10-28 19:00:21.812625

This entity is a globally recognised, vertically integrated, leader in refining, petrochemicals and logistics.

Under the terms of the MOU, the Group will supply up to 80,000 tonnes per annum (""tpa"") of renewable feedstocks to the Ferrandina plant beginning 1 November 2025. These will include Palm Oil Methyl Ester (""POME""), both crude and refined, as well as Repurposed Used Cooking Oil (""RUCO""), delivered to the port of Taranto, approximately 70 kilometres (""km"") from the facility.

This guaranteed supply strengthens Ferrandina's commercial model, ensuring reliable input for the production of biodiesel and SAF while positioning Greenswitch as a cornerstone in Europe's transition to low-carbon energy.

Tolling MOU with Ludoil Energia - 50% of Plant Capacity Secured:

Greenswitch has signed an MOU with Ludoil Energia S.r.l. (""Ludoil""), based in Civitavecchia, Italy.

The agreement sets the framework for a biodiesel tolling arrangement, under which Ludoil will provide feedstock and HV will generate revenue solely from processing.

No upfront feedstock purchases are required, eliminating working capital risk.

The tolling structure is estimated to generate approximately €8 million net profit per year for HV. The other 50% of the capacity is estimated to be double that for total of €24 million net (assuming full production)

The MOU provides for:

Plant restart planned for December 2025 with full production in January 2026

Annual quantities: 80,000 tpa of biodiesel in the short term, and 40,000 tpa of SAF longer term

With 80,000 tpa already secured under this tolling framework, Ludoil alone covers 50% of the Ferrandina plant's permitted 150,000 tpa capacity, giving the Company clear revenue visibility and validating the site's strategic importance.

About 80 Mile Plc:

80 Mile Plc, listed on the London AIM market under the ticker 80M, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and the U.S. OTC Market under the ticker BLLYF, is an exploration and development company focused on high-grade critical metals in Tier 1 jurisdictions. With multiple projects in Greenland, as well as a developing industrial gas and biofuels business in Italy, 80 Mile offers both portfolio and commodity diversification focused on base metals, precious metals, and industrial gas while expanding into sustainable fuels and clean energy solutions in Tier 1 jurisdictions. 80 Mile's strategy is centred on advancing key projects while creating value through partnerships and strategic acquisitions.

80 Mile's acquisition of White Flame Energy and the Jameson licenses in East Greenland has positioned the Company in one of the world's most compelling undrilled hydrocarbon basins. Under its agreement with March GL, drilling of two fully funded wells is set to commence, with Pelican Acquisition Corporation's merger with Greenland Exploration valuing 80 Mile's retained 30% interest in Jameson at approximately US$92 million. This acquisition and partnership significantly expand 80 Mile's exposure to the energy sector while advancing its strategy of developing both conventional and sustainable energy opportunities.

The Disko-Nuussuaq nickel-copper-cobalt-PGE project in Greenland is a primary focus for 80 Mile, 100% owned by 80 Mile PLC. Seven priority targets exhibiting spatial characteristics indicative of potential deposits on a scale comparable to renowned mining operations such as Norilsk, Voisey's Bay, and Jinchuan, will be advanced by the Company.

The Dundas Ilmenite Project, 80 Mile's most advanced asset in northwest Greenland, is fully with a JORC-compliant Mineral Resource of 117 Mt at 6.1% ilmenite and an offshore Exploration Target of up to 530 Mt. Dundas is poised to become a major supplier of high-quality ilmenite. Recent discoveries of hard rock titanium mineralisation, with bedrock samples showing nearly double the ilmenite content of previous estimates, further enhance the project's world-class potential. 80 Mile owns 100% of the Dundas Ilmenite Project under its subsidiary Dundas Titanium A/S in Greenland.

80 Mile PLC has executed an asset purchase agreement with Amaroq Minerals Ltd. (AIM, TSXV, NASDAQ Iceland: AMRQ) to divest its 100% interest in the Kangerluarsuk zinc-lead-silver project in Greenland. Under the terms of the agreement, 80 Mile will receive US$500,000 in Amaroq shares upon completion, with a further US$1,500,000 payable in cash or shares upon the discovery of an economic deposit, defined by a JORC or NI 43-101 compliant resource that supports development.

“Showing that the [business aviation] industry is serious about decarbonisation will make business aviation operators more appealing to lenders, allowing banks and financiers to be able to point to a reduction in emissions from the sector,” Thomas Conlon, professor of Finance from UCD Smurfit School told CJI.
Reduce contrails Business aviation operators could commit to purchasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and to demanding more fuel-efficient aircraft from OEMs, said Colon.
Meanwhile, earlier this month the global warming contribution from business aviation contrails was revealed in new report published by charter broker Victor and sustainability specialist 4AIR.
The inaugural Contrails Analysis Report urges business aviation to modify flight plans to minimise contrails and airlines to publish similar studies.","Ensuring a cleaner, more sustainable business aviation industry means taking greater investment risks with technologies and new enterprises to lower emissions, according to research from University College Dublin Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School.

“Showing that the [business aviation] industry is serious about decarbonisation will make business aviation operators more appealing to lenders, allowing banks and financiers to be able to point to a reduction in emissions from the sector,” Thomas Conlon, professor of Finance from UCD Smurfit School told CJI. “In turn this allows financiers to continue to support the industry. This may help an industry which is prone to market cycles.”

While developing and adopting greener solutions in aviation is risky and expensive, the research reveals that smarter ways of managing investment risk could speed up the shift towards cleaner air travel and other hard-to-decarbonise sectors.

“The technology to support clean aviation exists, but it requires a new way of framing the relationship between risk, return and sustainability,” said Conlon. “Capital needs to flow towards risky innovations that will really move the dial in terms of deep decarbonisation.”

Help investors

To help achieve that progress, Conlon and colleagues have devised a new tool called an Aviation Sustainability Index (ASI), This is a quantitative method to assess how different technologies or investments could help decouple emissions from growth in air travel. The approach is designed to help investors distinguish between projects that only modestly improve efficiency and those that could significantly transform the sector’s climate impact.

Colon said: “The proposed ASI provides a greenwashing resistant way to underpin sustainability linked financing to the sector, allowing investors to identify innovations will truly move the dial.”

It’s a tool that could prove particularly useful for business aviation as scrutiny of its emissions record intensifies. “Regulators may, in future, see this as a low hanging fruit to reduce the overall contribution of emissions to climate change,” Colon told us. “By adopting the approach outlined in this paper, the business aviation sector can quantify and point to success in decarbonisation while also allowing them to obtain capital to support the carbon-neutral growth of the industry.

About $1trn is expected to be invested in aviation over the next decade, with most of that money targetted at making aircraft slightly more efficient, according to the report’s authors Few investors have clear incentives to back the kind of breakthrough technologies, such as hydrogen propulsion, advanced aircraft designs, or large-scale sustainable fuel systems, that could substantially reduce emissions, they claim.

Reduce contrails

Business aviation operators could commit to purchasing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and to demanding more fuel-efficient aircraft from OEMs, said Colon. Another, potentially easy, lever available to business operators is to understand and reduce the contrails associated with these aircraft, which may be a low-cost way to reduce climate impact.

The research report’s co-author, David G Victor, professor of Innovation and Public Policy from the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy said: “Cleaner flight is possible, but it requires changing how we think about both risk and return. We need new institutions, incentives, and partnerships that reward innovation, not just incrementalism.”

Developing better tools to test climate-friendly investments and rewarding companies to take calculated risks on breakthrough technologies, governments, investors and industry leaders can accelerate real progress toward decarbonisation, conclude the researchers.

Developed in collaboration with Calumet Montana Refining, the new product is a nominal 50/50 blend of renewable jet fuel and traditional fossil jet fuel.

The blended fuel meets the rigorous aviation industry standards, certified under both ASTM D7566 (for the synthetic paraffinic kerosene component) and ASTM D1655 specifications, confirming its drop-in compatibility with all existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. This eliminates the need for modifications to aircraft engines or airport facilities, overcoming a major logistical hurdle for SAF adoption.

Montana Renewables and Calumet Montana Refining have commissioned dedicated onsite blending and shipping facilities at the Great Falls complex to manage the production and logistics of MaxSAF. The finished product will initially be distributed through the extensive network of AEG Fuels, targeting select aviation hubs in Montana, Washington, and Oregon.

""AEG Fuels is honored to collaborate with Montana Renewables on this landmark SAF inaugural blend,"" stated Landon Larson, Vice President, Supply NA at AEG Fuels. ""Together, we're demonstrating how strategic partnerships can accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation and deliver real value to operators across our fueling network.""

The distribution model focuses on providing a drop-in fuel solution that helps regional customers immediately begin working toward their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) targets and reduce both Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 3 (value chain) emissions.

MaxSAF is positioned as a triple-benefit product for the aviation sector.

• For Montana Renewables: Sales from the truck rack open up regional service opportunities and new customer segments in the sustainable aviation market, extending the reach of their Great Falls operations. MRL's feedstocks, which include agricultural byproducts like tallow, distiller’s corn oil, canola, used cooking oil, and camelina oil sourced from Pacific Northwest farms, contribute to the regional economic impact.

• For Customers: It provides an immediate, practical solution for airlines and operators to meet their carbon reduction goals and enhance their brand leadership in sustainability without incurring capital costs for infrastructure changes.

• For the Environment: SAF significantly reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional Jet A fuel and also offers improvements in local air quality. The use of agricultural byproducts and waste fats supports the concept of a circular economy—transforming waste into high-value, sustainable fuel.

The launch of MaxSAF Blended marks a significant step forward in making sustainable aviation fuel a commercial reality for a broader set of air travel operators across the Western United States.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-28 13:56:28.563675

The company said the technology enables cost-effective production of “drop-in” fuels that meet existing performance and infrastructure requirements.
Honeywell described the process as capable of producing SAF, renewable gasoline, and lower-carbon marine fuel more cheaply than most current biofuel production.
Honeywell said its approach produces “high-yield renewable fuels” while keeping transportation costs low by enabling distributed feedstock conversion and centralized refining.
Competition in a crowded field The announcement places Honeywell squarely in competition with a growing roster of renewable-fuel technology developers.","Honeywell has introduced a new process to convert agricultural and forestry waste into renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The US company describes it as a technological breakthrough and a major step toward lowering carbon emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries such as aviation and shipping.

Announced on October 28, 2025, the new Honeywell UOP (Universal Oil Products) Biocrude Upgrading process transforms inexpensive biomass feedstocks — such as wood chips, crop residues, and plant waste — into a renewable biocrude that can be refined into finished fuels. The company said the technology enables cost-effective production of “drop-in” fuels that meet existing performance and infrastructure requirements.

Honeywell described the process as capable of producing SAF, renewable gasoline, and lower-carbon marine fuel more cheaply than most current biofuel production. The resulting biocrude can be refined at standard petroleum facilities, potentially allowing refiners to adapt portions of existing operations to produce renewable fuel without major equipment overhauls.

“As demand for SAF continues to grow, the aviation industry is challenged by limited supplies of traditional SAF feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats and waste oils,” said Ken West, President & CEO of Honeywell Energy & Sustainability Solutions. “When combined with the existing Fischer-Tropsch process, our new technology will expand the feedstock options available in the industry to sources that are more plentiful, ultimately helping improve our customers’ ability to produce SAF.”

The process begins with biomass waste — non-food organic matter such as forest trimmings, agricultural stalks, and sawmill residue. At or near collection sites, this feedstock is converted into a biocrude, a heavy renewable oil with similar handling properties to conventional crude. The biocrude is then shipped to major refineries or renewable fuel plants, where Honeywell’s upgrading modules convert it into finished products such as SAF, the company said.

The process turns waste that would otherwise be discarded into fuel, creating a new renewable source without relying on food crops. Honeywell said its approach produces “high-yield renewable fuels” while keeping transportation costs low by enabling distributed feedstock conversion and centralized refining.

Competition in a crowded field

The announcement places Honeywell squarely in competition with a growing roster of renewable-fuel technology developers. Neste, based in Finland, remains the world’s leading SAF producer, using waste oils and fats as feedstock. LanzaJet, backed by LanzaTech and major airlines, has pioneered ethanol-to-jet conversion at its Freedom Pines facility in Georgia. Other competitors include Fulcrum BioEnergy, which converts municipal solid waste into synthetic crude, and Alder Fuels, which relies on forest residues and agricultural by-products.

Honeywell’s claim of a lower-cost, modular process could differentiate it from these players, particularly if it enables refiners to add SAF capacity incrementally rather than through billion-dollar plant builds. The company emphasized that its UOP division — long a cornerstone of refining and petrochemical process technology — can deliver the new system as a prefabricated modular plant, reducing construction time and project risk.

Honeywell already markets several renewable-fuel technologies, including Ecofining, developed jointly with Eni S.p.A., which converts fats and oils into renewable diesel and SAF; Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) technology, which upgrades ethanol into synthetic paraffinic kerosene; and Fischer-Tropsch Unicracking, which refines synthetic gas into liquid fuels. The new Biocrude Upgrading process, the company said, complements these existing platforms by expanding the range of usable feedstocks to include low-cost lignocellulosic biomass.

While the company has not disclosed specific yields or lifecycle carbon data, analysts say the modular design and ability to use regional feedstocks could make the process a breakthrough for SAF scalability — a persistent challenge for the industry. Current global SAF production represents less than 1% of aviation fuel demand, hindered by high costs, limited feedstock supply, and the need for new refining capacity.

If Honeywell’s process performs as claimed, it could give refiners and energy companies a new pathway to produce certified SAF at lower cost and higher volume, supporting airline commitments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/06/Aircraft-fueling-process.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:56:31.322690

Donald Trump arrived in Tokyo on Monday and praised the “great friendship” between the US and Japan before his talks with the country’s prime minister. But all eyes will be on the US president’s summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping later this week as he is expected to discuss China’s export controls on rare earths that western companies have warned could lead to broken supply chains and higher prices for chips, cars and weapons.

Access to critical minerals has been a chief concern of the US. Trump on Sunday struck trade and mineral agreements with Malaysia and Cambodia.

Europe is also focusing on securing critical minerals as it aims to reduce its reliance on China for materials needed for defence and clean technology. My colleagues Alice Hancock and Camilla Hodgson reported that Brussels will launch a consultation on stockpiling minerals by the end of the year in order to diversify Europe’s supply chain away from foreign sources.

Honeywell tech could boost maritime decarbonisation drive

Honeywell is launching a new technology that can convert forest and agricultural waste to a lower carbon fuel that could directly replace the carbon-intensive fuel oil used by large ships, helping the maritime and other heavy industries decarbonise.

The US industrial group told Energy Source that the “biocrude upgrading technology” can use biomass, which includes agricultural waste, to create a range of renewable fuels including, sustainable aviation fuel, gasoline, diesel and marine fuel.

Honeywell’s new technology could be a game-changer for the maritime industry. It can produce a direct replacement to heavy fuel oil since it has a high enough energy density to power ships on long voyages around the world.

Ken West, president and chief executive of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, told Energy Source that the fuel is compatible with existing engines and can utilise a wide range of biomass feedstocks.

The announcement comes as the shipping industry faces growing pressure to decarbonise. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, shipping is responsible for 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and is reliant on one of the dirtiest fuels: heavy fuel oil.

The industry is working towards decarbonisation and the International Maritime Organization has said it aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050.

Danish shipping company Maersk, which operates in almost 130 countries, hopes to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. CMA CGM, a French shipping company, plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 and 80 per cent by 2040.

Honeywell Energy’s West added that the fuel can help ship owners meet guidelines for reducing carbon emissions because it does not require them to commit to major capital upgrades in order to decarbonise.

Shipping is a global business and fleets typically refuel at ports across the world, making acquiring sustainable fuels at ports in a variety of countries crucial.

“Biomass can be found in many different areas and we can use this technology particularly in countries that may not have access to fossil fuels or may not have access to other forms of renewable power,” West said. “I think we’re going to have customers that are truly going to be global.”

Still, cost remains a barrier for the maritime sector’s transition to renewable fuel. Pure biofuel is about $1,100 to $1,300 a ton, which is roughly 2 to 2.5 times the cost of fuel oil, according to Aparajit Pandey, a principal in the Rocky Mountain Institute’s climate-aligned industries group. He added that as biofuel becomes more popular, the jump in demand could also raise prices.

“Any fuel for maritime is going to be expensive. This is a fuel that is going to be pretty expensive to start off with and will get more expensive over time,” he said.

Biomass is also not abundantly available and some experts have warned that unsustainable management of this resource could lead to deforestation and biodiversity loss.

Still, West at Honeywell Energy said that renewable fuel would not necessarily replace other energy sources but would be simply an addition.

“We’re going to require biomass . . . and we’re going to require transition technologies like liquefied natural gas,” he said. “We know the world needs more energy tomorrow than it needs today. And that’s going to take a number of different technologies to get there.” (Alexandra White)

Zinc mine hosts the ‘world’s deepest marathon’

Dozens of runners from around the world descended 1,120 meters below sea level at the weekend to run what is expected to be confirmed as the world’s deepest marathon.

The race, held in Swedish mining group Boliden’s Garpenberg zinc mine, saw 55 people don high-vis T-shirts, helmets and head torches and run for hours around a 4km circuit in near darkness in the hope of raising more than $1mn for charity.

The runners — including Boliden chief executive Mikael Staffas, Rohitesh Dhawan, the chief executive of the International Council on Mining and Metals, and Jonathan Price, the boss of Canadian miner Teck Resources — endured subterranean temperatures in the mid 20s Celsius and high humidity.

“Without the head torch, you wouldn’t have seen anything,” said Staffas, who successfully completed the race alongside the other 54 runners.

The circuit was located in the lower part of the zinc mine, in an “exploration drift”, a tunnel built for underground drilling teams to explore the earth and rock further below them.

Getting there required taking a lift down 1km — an ear-popping two-minute journey — and then a 10-minute underground minibus to the race’s starting line.

The slowest runner completed the race in under eight hours, with regular marathon runners saying the challenging conditions added about an hour to their normal times.

“I’ve run 15 marathons and this was by far the hardest,” said Dhawan. “You go through every emotion. You go to a pretty dark place because you’re alone with your thoughts in a dark tunnel.” But he added that it had been a “once in a lifetime” experience.

About $570,000 has been raised so far for the BecomingX Foundation, an educational charity, and Wild at Heart Foundation, which aims to reduce the world’s stray dog population. (Camilla Hodgson)

I’m having minor surgery this week. After cataract surgery in both eyes more than 10 years ago, my left eye was sharp, bright, and clear — and still is. My right eye was blurry — and still is.

I’ve waited much too long to get this issue addressed. I thought, “It’s not that big a deal. My left eye is perfect!”

Poor vision inhibits confidence and erodes prompt, aligned action. So this week I’m having YAG laser surgery. It’s quick (literally a couple of minutes) and typical results are fantastic.

Business leaders face similar challenges with poor vision. If leaders don’t pay attention to how formal leaders treat employees each day, those business leaders won’t see the negative impact such treatment has on results and respect.

Here’s an example. A client had been coaching a middle manager who supervised a remote office. That manager wasn’t modeling the organization’s values and behaviors. He was rude, dismissive and abrupt with staff members. Complaints continued, including from customers, about this manager’s rude behavior.

The CEO told us, “We thought everything was doing fine. We didn’t keep an eye on this leader.” They realized that they had been hoping things were okay rather than consistently observing, monitoring and measuring the quality of interactions by this middle manager.

How can leaders stay “in tune” with how formal leaders treat others?

One client created an effective system to keep abreast of good things happening and of less-than-good things happening. Every email that goes out has a “tell us how we’re doing” link, which opens a simple contact form on their website. Customers and staff members can post feedback — and they do.

The administration team reviews all submissions. When positive recognition is posted, that team shares the good news with the staff member — or the team being praised — and their team leader. When missed deadlines or frustrations are shared, that team shares the issue with the staff member or team and their team lead.

This low-tech system works because it’s easy — customers and employees can post items from their phones — and because real humans respond promptly and effectively.

Every formal leader must champion your organization’s desired work culture every day, in every interaction. How can leaders know if respect and validation are communicated effectively? By keeping an eye on customer and employee perceptions.

BlueLight launches first humanitarian airline

BlueLight Humanitarian Airlines (BlueLight) has officially taken off as the world’s first non-profit airline devoted to humanitarian missions. Based in Geneva, the hub of global aid diplomacy, the airline aims to fill a long-standing gap in crisis response — rapid, neutral, and affordable air transport for relief operations.

Its fleet will unite cargo, passenger, and air ambulance functions under one system. Each aircraft can carry more than 50 tonnes of aid, transport 200 responders, and operate as a flying trauma unit. Co-founder Pierre Bernheim says the airline was built to end dangerous delays in crisis relief, stressing that speed and neutrality are vital when lives hang in the balance.

BlueLight’s initial fleet will include Airbus A340-300 and A321P2F aircraft. It also plans an uncrewed aerial system capable of flying 800 kilometres with 500 kg of supplies, designed for regions where runways are inaccessible.

Co-founder Waleed Rawat describes BlueLight as “a humanitarian infrastructure for the 21st century,” combining the efficiency of commercial aviation with the compassion of aid work.

The founders bring deep aviation and leadership expertise. Bernheim previously led Geneva Airport and advised at Vontobel Bank, while Rawat, head of WAIR Global and part of the HM Rawat Group, has wide experience in aviation and sustainable ventures. Together, they have assembled an international team of aviation, medical, and humanitarian professionals.

BlueLight plans full-scale operations by 2026, after raising US$55 million to acquire and convert three wide-body aircraft. Backed by the Swiss Federal Government and the Canton of Geneva, the project has also drawn partners such as Airbus, Geneva Airport, and JORAMCO.

Operating on a fixed-rate, transparent model, BlueLight promises fair access for all relief partners. The airline also integrates sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsets from the start, aligning with UN and Swiss sustainability goals.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report found that 0.6% of Europe’s supplied aviation fuel for 2024 was SAF. This percentage needs to increase rapidly, but nevertheless saved 714 kilotonnes of carbon emissions, the equivalent of around 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

Overall, EASA believes the EU is on track to achieve its 6% blending target in the next five years. Whether the bloc hits its interim target of 2% SAF in 2025 will be assessed at the close of this calendar year.

China is Europe’s biggest supplier of biofuel

EASA’s findings also highlight the ongoing cost obstacles to SAF adoption. Currently, the average price of SAF sits at €2,085/tonne, compared to €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. Until the cost becomes more competitive, it is difficult to see how SAF use can scale successfully. Earlier this year, Airlines for Europe (A4E) criticised the EU for imposing SAF mandates without taking action to create a viable SAF market. Nevertheless, EASA’s report affirms progress on the 6% target.

Europe’s biggest producer of SAF is currently Finland, responsible for 10% of supply. However, 69% of feedstock originates outside of the EU, with China the biggest supplier.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said:

This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states. This report sets an important benchmark for our sustainability efforts in the future.

The annual contest, presented by the California Manufacturing & Technology Association during Manufacturing Month, highlights innovation and manufacturing success across the state.

“Manufacturing continues to be foundational to California’s economic growth — creating good-paying jobs and shaping the industries of the future,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news release Monday. “This competition, and the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works X-59, is evidence that the country’s top talent and innovation is in California.”

The association announced the award Oct. 23.

NASA and Lockheed Martin’s Palmdale facility are teaming up to develop the X-59. The jet is designed to tackle one of supersonic flight’s long-standing challenges: the loud sonic boom. By separating shockwaves, the X-59 is capable of producing a much softer sonic “thump,” potentially paving the way for future commercial supersonic flights over populated areas.

NASA will collect data from communities about the acceptability of the jet’s noise. The results could help inform new regulations that might one day allow passengers to travel long distances much faster than current commercial aircraft permit.

“We’re honored that Californians chose the X-59 as the Coolest Thing Made in California,” Patrick LeBeau, X-59 program manager, said in a statement. “This recognition celebrates the groundbreaking technology and precision engineering behind the X-59, and the incredible dedication of our Palmdale team and partners. We thank CMTA and everyone who voted for helping shine a spotlight on California’s world-class manufacturing.”

With mounting pressure to decarbonize and a growing demand for sustainable supply chains, India’s logistics sector is undergoing a sideways shift. The sector aims to integrate sustainability into daily operations, while shaping the future of freight through strategic direction for green logistics in the country.

Green and digital corridors have been hailed as engines of economic growth, innovation, and sustainability as they accelerate the adoption of low-emission technologies, transform maritime operations, and strengthen digital tools. The India-Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor is an important leverage for India as it builds bilateral relationships and establishes global trade dynamics that are green and sustainable.

Promoting Sustainable Logistics Through Technology

Recognising the importance of sustainable logistics for India’s environmental well-being and economic growth, several initiatives have been taken by the Government. The Government is promoting a sustainable logistics industry by leveraging digitization and automation.

The PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan (PMGS- NMP) relies on the GIS-based platform that uses geospatial data for better infrastructure planning and creating multimodal connectivity across the lengths and breadths of the country.

Similarly, the National Logistics Plan (NLP) aims to modernize logistics through adoption of digital technology. Digital platforms like Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and Logistics Data Bank (LDB) are being increasingly used for digitalizing, tracking, and monitoring of logistics movement in the country.

The Freight Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Calculator is a digital intervention that has been created to promote sustainability in the freight transport planning process and shift to low-carbon modes of transport. It helps the user make an informed modal choice based on the environmental cost and total emissions estimates to advance sustainable and green logistics in India.

Use of Cleaner Fuels

Sustainability in the transport sector is largely driven by green fuel such as green hydrogen, methanol, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) , along with other blended fuel.

Under The National Green Hydrogen Mission, the government has initiated a pilot project to use hydrogen in buses, trucks and other commercially viable modes for utilizing hydrogen into transport sector and adding supporting infrastructure like hydrogen refuelling stations.

Initiatives like Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) promotes compressed biogas (CBG) as an alternative green transport fuel as it is based out of organic waste and also helps in efficient management of biomass.

India is also targeting 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as mandated by The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA. With more than 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residues, India has the capacity to meet its SAF demand as well as emerge as a global leader and exporter for carbon offsetting in the aviation industry.

M-15 fuel blending (15 % methanol and 85 % Gasoline) has also shown a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 5- 10% thereby improving air quality.

Building A Green Shipping & Maritime Sector

Sustainability in logistics cannot be achieved by focusing only on road or air transport. A green shipping and maritime sector forms an important part of India’s international decarbonisation goal and achieving IMO’s 2023 Revised GHG Strategy.

Sustainable maritime practices through initiatives like the Green Tug Transition Programme and Harid Nauka Initiative focus on adopting low-emission and alternative fuel-powered ships. The Alang Ship Recycling Programme is another global effort in sustainable ship recycling. With ₹25,000 crore in Maritime Development Fund, India is also catalysing green investments, positioning itself as a leader in sustainable shipping and maritime infrastructure.

Furthermore, the Maritime India Vision 2030 is a comprehensive framework for the holistic development of India’s maritime sector through focus on innovation, sustainability, and skill development. It aims to develop ports, shipping, and waterways aimed to propel India to global maritime leadership. This expansion aligns seamlessly with the broader aspiration of Viksit Bharat 2047, contributing to employment generation, global competitiveness, and economic resilience.

Propelling the Green Engine in Railways

Railways is another sector which has immense potential for transforming the sustainability and environmental landscape of India. Government initiatives like National Rail Plan and Rail Sagar Corridor aim to improve freight share from the current 35-36% to 45% by 2030. It also aims to improve modal shift for railways, contribute to cleaner ways of freight movement and accelerate growth of railways cargo traffic.

Addressing Key Barriers

As we transition to modes of transport that emit lower carbon and are less harmful to the environment, there are also some systemic and infrastructural barriers that have to be addressed collectively by the industry and the Government. One of the key barriers to this is infrastructure, especially for alternative fuels.

There is a need for LNG infrastructure and implementing green channelling initiatives that strengthen the entire logistics sector. Another key factor for the green freight landscape is driver training. With properly trained drivers, we can better fuel mileage and efficiency as these are newer vehicles and roads for the drivers.

As the transport sector moves towards EVs, there is also a need to use renewable energy for the purpose of charging these new vehicles for personal, commercial, and transport purposes.",https://ciiblog.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cover-25-Oct-The-Future-Of-Green-Freight-In-India-01.png,N,,2025-10-28 11:57:40.484580

The COP30 SAFc platform is available to all COP30 attendees, including those who are not currently SABA members, as part of a concentrated effort to raise the visibility of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and scale funding and adoption of this key climate technology. It empowers conference attendees to calculate and address their aviation-related emissions by supporting SAF meeting SABA’s world-leading sustainability criteria - directly engaging in real-world deployment of a crucial decarbonization technology.

SABA’s COP30 SAFc platform gives conference-goers all the resources they need to decarbonize their COP air travel. Attendees first estimate their flight emissions using one of two methods. For commercial flights, travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model, an industry-leading calculation tool, while travelers on private jets will use the Eurocontrol Small Emitters Tool. Next, attendees purchase a corresponding quantity of high-integrity SAF certificates pre-vetted by SABA; and later receive a retirement statement from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the transaction meets best-in-class chain of custody requirements. The platform supports those traveling via commercial and private aircraft – crucial flexibility given that as many as 65 private jets travel to COP in a given year.

The high-integrity SAF supported through the new platform is sourced from SkyNRG as the result of a streamlined, competitive procurement process initiated by SABA earlier this year.

The Asia-Pacific region has fundamentally shifted its approach to sustainable aviation fuel over the past year. Since 2024, multiple APAC governments have moved from tentative goals to concrete blending targets and mandates. Japan is finalising a 10% SAF mandate by 2030, India has set targets starting in 2027, and several Southeast Asian nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) have introduced SAF blending roadmaps beginning around 2027. Singapore stands out with a confirmed near-term goal of 1% SAF by 2026, potentially rising to 3-5% by 2030, making it an early adopter in the region. In short, 2025 is the year APAC moved from aspiration to action on SAF policy, laying the regulatory groundwork that was largely missing in 2024.

APAC's SAF production capacity has grown and diversified since last year. The region is now home to one of the world's largest SAF production hubs: Neste's expanded Singapore refinery, which began pumping out SAF in commercial volumes and supplying carriers and logistics companies in the region. New domestic production projects have been announced or advanced in multiple countries. Australia is pursuing its first commercial SAF plants (one project in Queensland aims to produce around 100 million litres per year from ethanol by 2026-2027, backed by Qantas, Airbus and government funding), and Japan's major energy firms have completed pilot facilities for synthetic e-fuels. In China, state-owned producers achieved initial SAF outputs and the government set a 50,000-tonne SAF production target by 2025. Regional supply chains are also maturing: airlines like All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines in late 2024 began using domestically-blended SAF on commercial flights for the first time, and Hong Kong saw its first large corporate SAF purchase (3,400 tonnes by HSBC/Cathay Pacific). Compared to a year ago, these developments mean APAC now has some SAF flowing into aircraft engines rather than SAF being purely theoretical.

Since 2024, there has been a notable rise in funding commitments and joint ventures to kickstart APAC's SAF industry. Government incentives have emerged where none existed before. Notably, in September 2025 Australia announced a A$1.1 billion (US$735 million) 'Cleaner Fuels' programme, a ten-year fund to support domestic production of biofuels and e-fuels with the aim of having projects producing fuel by 2029. This marks the first major APAC government subsidy programme for SAF. Private-sector investment alliances have grown. Qantas and Airbus's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA) had around US$200 million committed by mid-2024 to invest in SAF production projects globally. Through such alliances, APAC airlines are co-financing new SAF technologies and securing future supply. Airlines are also signing long-term offtake agreements: Japan Airlines, for instance, agreed to a 10-year SAF supply MOU with US-based Raven SR, starting with 50,000 tonnes in 2025 and scaling to 200,000 tonnes per year within a decade. The past 12 months saw APAC governments and companies putting real money on the table, a clear sign that the business case for SAF is being taken seriously in the region.

The global SAF landscape has also shifted in ways that affect APAC. Europe's SAF blending mandate kicked in on 1 January 2025 (starting at 2%), and the United States' tax credit incentives under the 2022 IRA are now spurring dozens of new SAF projects. Over the past year, SAF produced in Asia has tended to flow to Europe where mandates create a price premium, raising concerns that APAC might face local shortages or higher costs if it lags behind in policy. IATA reports that most SAF supply in 2025 is headed to Europe, and warns that Europe's approach has driven SAF prices to five times that of conventional jet fuel. This external pressure is a key reason APAC policymakers have hastened their own SAF agendas since 2024. APAC's response through mandates, partnerships, and capacity-building will determine whether it remains a net importer of SAF credits to meet climate goals, or becomes a competitive producer.

APAC's SAF landscape in 2025 is defined by emerging policy frameworks, initial production capacity, and mobilised financing, a notable evolution from 2024's landscape of voluntary airline pledges and theoretical potential. We now see the first concrete mandates on the horizon (most starting latest by 2027), significant capital being directed into SAF ventures, and early adoption mechanisms like book-and-claim gaining traction. Still, the region faces familiar hurdles: high SAF costs, limited near-term supply, feedstock logistics, and the need for broader infrastructure. This report will examine these developments in detail, outline the key challenges and opportunities as the region navigates the pivotal 2025-2027 period on its journey toward cleaner aviation fuel.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68ff5b2a03a33c3c44a429da/1761641576150/2.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-10-28 11:57:55.795794

Travelers around the world are becoming more conscious of their environmental impact, and the aviation industry is responding with bold moves. Europe and the UK are leading the global charge in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a key solution in the fight against climate change. With robust policies like ReFuelEU and the SAF Mandate, Europe is positioning itself as a hub for cleaner, greener skies. This transition isn’t just good for the planet; it’s also an exciting development for travelers seeking eco-friendly travel options.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a revolutionary fuel source that aims to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, plants, and even algae. SAF can significantly lower carbon emissions when used in place of conventional aviation fuel, making it a crucial component in global decarbonization efforts.

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation is a landmark regulation that mandates a growing percentage of aviation fuel supplied at EU airports to be SAF. Starting at just 2% in 2025, this requirement will rise to 70% by 2050. This commitment aligns with the EU’s ambitious climate goals and ensures that travelers can enjoy a cleaner flight experience as SAF becomes more widely adopted.

Europe and the UK’s Role in the SAF Revolution

Both the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have embraced the need for cleaner aviation fuel, creating frameworks and incentives that encourage SAF production. The EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) sets a target of 42.5% renewable energy across the bloc by 2030. With a focus on sustainable transportation fuels, including SAF, the EU is positioning itself as a global leader in the transition to cleaner energy.

In the UK, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) requires at least 14.6% of fuels used in road transport to be renewable by 2025. This has spurred demand for advanced biofuels, including SAF, made from waste products. Additionally, the UK’s SAF Mandate calls for 2% SAF to be blended into aviation fuel by 2025, gradually increasing to 22% by 2040. This policy reflects the UK’s commitment to reducing aviation-related carbon emissions and improving fuel sustainability.

Tourists and Travelers: What Does SAF Mean for You?

For global travelers, the shift towards SAF offers an exciting prospect: flying with a lighter environmental footprint. Airlines operating out of European airports are increasingly incorporating SAF into their fuel mix. As SAF production scales up, travelers can expect to board planes powered by cleaner fuels, helping to reduce the aviation sector’s contribution to global warming.

Tourists visiting Europe will see firsthand how the continent is embracing sustainable energy, not just in aviation but across all sectors. Many European airlines are expected to meet SAF mandates in the coming years, making flights more eco-friendly for everyone.

Aviation Decarbonization and Its Global Impact

The push for SAF is part of a broader strategy to decarbonize aviation—a sector that has long been difficult to electrify. In fact, aviation contributes significantly to global carbon emissions. The adoption of SAF will be a game-changer, offering a renewable alternative to fossil-based jet fuel. This will help achieve global climate goals, including those set by the Paris Agreement.

As SAF production grows, it will play a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions from air travel, which is one of the most carbon-intensive forms of transport. However, the production of SAF is still in its early stages, and Europe is expected to lead the way in scaling up its availability. In fact, eSAF (electro-fuel SAF), which is made using renewable electricity and captured carbon, is expected to become a cornerstone of Europe’s aviation decarbonization efforts.

The Challenges: Supply, Costs, and Investment

While the transition to SAF is promising, there are challenges ahead. One of the primary concerns is the availability of feedstocks. As countries like China increase their domestic use of waste oils, the supply of renewable materials for SAF production could become constrained. Additionally, scaling up SAF production requires significant investment in infrastructure and technology.

Despite these challenges, Europe remains committed to overcoming these barriers, and governments are working alongside private industry to create a more sustainable aviation sector. Investment in technologies like Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and synthetic fuels is expected to accelerate, paving the way for a future where SAF is the norm, not the exception.

Looking Ahead: SAF’s Role in Global Travel

As the world becomes more eco-conscious, travelers can expect to see more sustainable options on their flight bookings. The EU and UK are proving that a transition to renewable aviation fuels is not just possible, but necessary. For tourists visiting Europe, it’s an opportunity to experience first-hand how forward-thinking policies can shape a cleaner, greener future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Aircrft-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 04:56:08.529719

The company says it will operate as a fully scheduled carrier rather than a charter service, but with the space, service, and privacy typically associated with private jets and semi-private air travel.

At its launch, Magnifica plans to have a fleet of six Airbus aircraft, including four A220-300s and two A321neos. However, the planes will have far fewer seats than standard versions—roughly 45 to 54 instead of more than 120. The leather lie-flat seats will be arranged in two-by-two rows, and planes will have two to four enclosed “private suites,” complete with banquette seating and sliding doors, as well as a bar area at the tail end of the plane. The planes will have a sleek, minimalist look; the whole design concept evokes the aesthetic of luxury around-the-world charters, like those operated by Four Seasons and Aman.

The airline plans to offer a door-to-door experience that begins with chauffeured transfers and private-terminal check-ins and ends with expedited baggage handling upon arrival. Travelers will reportedly be able to check in 30 minutes before departure—an experience designed to seem frictionless compared to commercial air travel and the long security lines and crowded airport boarding gates that come with it. The company has also stated that sustainability is a core part of its brand. Magnifica has pledged to use a 50 percent blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from the start (with 100 percent SAF usage by 2030) and operate newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce emissions.

Initial routes are expected to link major U.S. business and leisure markets, including New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, and Houston, along with seasonal flights to Napa and the Caribbean. The company says it will operate as a fully scheduled airline rather than a charter service, targeting travelers who want the consistency and reliability of commercial aviation but the intimacy and speed of private flying. “We’re offering a fully private, seamless experience for a fraction of what you’d pay to charter a jet,” Magnifica wrote in a blog post.

New Green Fee Takes Off in 2026

Singapore introduced a fixed levy on all departing flights to support cleaner aviation practices starting in 2026. The levy will fund the purchase and management of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for airlines refueling in Singapore.

Authorities aim for SAF to make up 1% of all jet fuel by 2026 and 3–5% by 2030. This initiative strengthens Singapore’s leadership in sustainable aviation and long-term emissions reduction.

Funding Sustainable Air Travel

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will collect the levy from all departing flights. Funds will be used to manage bulk SAF procurement and ensure stable supply for airlines.

The levy will remain fixed to protect airlines and passengers from price fluctuations in the SAF market. Authorities believe this approach will drive demand for SAF and support global sustainability goals.

Impact on Airfares

Officials expect only a small fare increase shared by all travellers and operators.

A short-haul economy flight to Bangkok may rise by S$3 (US$2.30).

A long-haul flight to London could increase by S$16 (US$11.80).

Authorities emphasise that the contribution is minor compared to the environmental benefits achieved.

Industry Debate Over Green Costs

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned the levy could discourage air travel. IATA prefers government incentives or subsidies instead of direct passenger levies.

Singapore’s former Temasek CEO, Ho Ching, called IATA’s criticism “wrong headed” and short-sighted. She argued that shared financial responsibility is essential for aviation’s sustainable future.

A Step Toward Cleaner Skies

The levy reinforces Singapore’s position as a sustainability leader in Asian aviation. It balances environmental responsibility with long-term economic growth in the travel sector.

Rapidly Expanding SAF Market

In the past, the automotive industry rose to the challenge of reducing its carbon footprint, resulting in the widespread presence of eco-friendly vehicles on today’s roads. Today, the aviation industry accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon emissions and, much like the automotive sector in the past, is now grappling with the challenge of reducing them. It is no exaggeration to say that the aviation sector’s sustainability increasingly hinges on SAF. SAF is a fuel developed to replace conventional jet fuel, produced from raw materials such as used cooking oil; vegetable and animal oils/fats; biomass; animal manure; waste wood; municipal solid waste; and captured carbon dioxide (CO2). It delivers performance equivalent to conventional jet fuel while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions from the production process by up to about 80%.

The first use of SAF in the aviation industry took place in 2008, but usage was negligible at the time. A major shift began in 2021, when the International Air Transport Association (IATA) adopted a resolution at its 77th Annual General Meeting to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050. Following this decision, the share of SAF in global jet fuel consumption rose steadily: 0.1% in 2022, 0.2% in 2023, and 0.3% in 2024, increasing by approximately 0.1 percentage points each year.

The global SAF market is growing rapidly as countries around the world gradually increase mandatory SAF blending requirements. By 2030, the United States, Japan, and Singapore plan to require SAF to account for 10% of total jet fuel use. The European Union (EU) has set a target of 6%, and Indonesia aims for 2.5%. Korea is also aligning with these global efforts. In August 2024, the government announced a policy that will make a 1% SAF blend mandatory for all international departing flights starting in 2027. As a result of these policy shifts, the global SAF market is expected to grow to around USD 67 billion (approximately KRW 92.4 trillion) by 2030 — roughly 30 times its current size.

If the SAF market is formed, various raw materials including biomass will be required, and there is a high possibility that the global raw material supply chain will be reorganized. Therefore, countries that possess raw materials or have strengths in raw material development are paying close attention to SAF as a new growth industry. In the past, the aviation fuel market was a monopoly and oligopoly market based on crude oil as a single raw material. However, because SAF uses various raw materials such as oils and fats, herbaceous and lignocellulosic biomass*, and industrial off-gases (CO, CO2, H2), the market has shifted to an intensely competitive one.

*Herbaceous and lignocellulosic biomass refers to trees and herbaceous plants containing cellulose, as well as products and waste derived from them. It is mainly used as a raw material for the production of biofuels, bioplastics, and biochemical substances.

U.S. Eyes SAF as a New Growth Industry

The United States is emerging as an optimal location for SAF production, leveraging its competitive advantage in producing bioethanol, a next-generation SAF raw material, from agricultural crops such as soybeans, corn, and sugarcane, as well as from agricultural byproducts. The Trump administration has also expressed interest in fostering the domestic SAF industry, pledging to maintain support under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

In May 2025, the administration announced a restructuring plan to dramatically reduce or terminate clean energy tax credits. However, it maintained the Section 45Z Clean Transportation Fuel Credit for SAF, which provides up to USD 1.75 per gallon (approximately KRW 2,419) in incentives, and extended its expiration date by five years, from 2027 to 2032. In particular, while continuing to support fuels that achieve at least a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions, the U.S. framework, unlike global standardization efforts, excludes Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC)* CO2 emissions from its calculation boundary. This approach has enabled corn-based bioethanol to be included as an eligible fuel for federal support.

*Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) refers to land-use changes that occur when farmland or pasture previously used for food or feed crops is converted to biofuel crop production, and to meet the displaced demand, forests or grasslands that had been used for other purposes are cleared and converted into cropland.

In other words, when corn in the United States is used for bioethanol, the supply of corn for food decreases, leading other countries to convert forests into cropland to meet that demand. Because corn has high ILUC emissions, it is a crop with a low CO2 reduction rate. However, in the United States, because ILUC emissions are excluded from the CO2 calculation boundary, corn’s CO2 reduction rate rises to more than 50% compared with conventional jet fuel, and it has therefore been included as an eligible fuel for support programs.

Japan Takes an Active Role in Building the SAF Market

How is Japan responding? At the U.S.–Japan summit in February 2025, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that securing a stable supply of resources such as bioethanol, in addition to LNG, from the United States would bring great national benefit to Japan. President Trump also noted his close relationship with the farming community and expressed strong interest in building a bilateral supply chain based on bioethanol.

Japan, leveraging the resource development capabilities of its general trading companies, is establishing a supply network for SAF raw materials such as used cooking oil, vegetable oils, and bioethanol. To encourage investment in domestic SAF production, the government provides subsidies covering between one-third and one-half of capital costs. To meet its mandate requiring 10% SAF use by 2030, Japan will need about 1.3 million tons of SAF per year. Four major refiners are currently reviewing six SAF production projects, and the government plans to cover between one-third and one-half of the investment depending on the technology. Japanese trading companies are participating as reliable raw material suppliers for SAF production in Japan through two of these projects, importing bioethanol from the United States and Brazil. As Japan’s domestic SAF production increases, they are expected to expand their role from supplying the domestic market to exporting SAF.

China and India are Transitioning from Raw Material Exporters to SAF Producers

China is shifting toward producing and exporting SAF domestically as the United States has strengthened import tariffs on Chinese used cooking oil, making it more difficult to export raw materials, and as demand for SAF has expanded mainly in the European Union (EU). One of China’s SAF producers, Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, has received government approval to export up to 370,000 tons of SAF and has already exported 13,400 tons this year.

India also has abundant SAF raw materials, including used cooking oil and crop residues, and it is expected that the country will be able to produce up to 24 million tons of SAF by 2030. As the domestic aviation market continues to grow rapidly, up to 10 million tons are expected to be consumed domestically, and the remainder will be directed toward exports.

POSCO Group Secures Diverse Core Raw Materials for SAF Production

Korean companies are also actively pursuing the SAF market. POSCO possesses a range of raw materials that can serve as a foundation for expanding into the SAF business, making it possible to enter the market through collaboration with refiners.

POSCO International began developing plantations on Papua Island, Indonesia, in 2011 and started commercial palm oil production in 2016. In the palm oil refining process, various byproducts such as palm oil mill effluent and empty fruit bunches are generated, and since they are recognized as SAF raw materials, refiners’ interest is high. Sugarcane and corn, which are drawing attention as next-generation SAF raw materials, and bioethanol made by saccharifying them, can also be secured through POSCO International’s trading capabilities.

POSCO International has already laid the groundwork for growth in the eco-friendly business market, including SAF, by obtaining two international certifications in October 2024. The certifications obtained are ISCC EU*, a global certification that ensures the sustainability of biofuel production in accordance with the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, and ISCC CORSIA**, a certification that guarantees the sustainability of aviation fuels. Through the acquisition of these international certifications, POSCO International has secured both the qualification to export biofuels and raw materials to the European market and the eligibility to supply raw materials for SAF production. This achievement is anticipated to provide substantial opportunities for growth in the EU and the international aviation industry.

*ISCC EU (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification EU) is an international certification program that verifies the sustainability of biofuels in accordance with the European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive.

**ISCC CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) is a program that certifies Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) that meets the standards of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Various by-product gases are generated at POSCO’s steel mills. Among these, carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 are regarded as next-generation SAF raw materials due to the absence of supply limitations. This technology involves producing SAF by converting CO into bioethanol and refining it into aviation fuel, or by reforming* CO2 into CO and synthesizing it with clean hydrogen. The Future Technology Research Laboratories of POSCO Holdings, in collaboration with LG Chem, plans to initiate a large-scale carbon capture and utilization (CCU) mega project in 2026, aimed at capturing CO2 and converting it into SAF raw materials. Upon successful completion of the demonstration project, POSCO is expected to enter the next-generation SAF market.

*Reforming is a technology that uses a metal catalyst to react CO2 and hydrocarbons such as methane to produce synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and CO).

Preemptive Entry into the SAF Market to Seize Opportunities

So, is the transition of the aviation fuel market to SAF an opportunity or a threat for Korean companies? As Korea is the world’s leading exporter of aviation fuel, the global shift to SAF is seen more as a threat than an opportunity for Korean companies. For domestic aviation and refining industries, slowing down the speed of the transition to the SAF market may be advantageous in the short term.

However, since SAF is a strategic item that can change the structure of the multi-trillion-won aviation fuel market, it is important to note that major countries are recognizing it as a new industry and are actively participating in market creation. In particular, considering that the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and the Netherlands, which are actively participating in SAF market creation, are Korea’s major aviation fuel export destinations, the market should be reviewed from a comprehensive perspective of defending the existing aviation fuel market and creating new SAF industries.

POSCO Group needs to review ways to participate in the SAF market in advance by utilizing POSCO International’s resource development capabilities and POSCO’s CCU technology using carbon dioxide. It is especially important to review various business models, including preemptively participating in overseas markets, which are expanding relatively quickly, beyond the domestic model, where the pace is expected to be slower.",https://newsroom.posco.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251027_en_img_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 00:56:22.030794

This is because they are passing on the cost of compliance with EU and UK SAF mandates to their airline customers.

This adds even further to the cost of SAF, already much more expensive than jet fuel.

Moreover, through the law of unintended consequences, it acts as a disincentive to the development of the embryonic SAF market that the mandates are aimed at stimulating.

Mr Walsh argues that European regulators should eliminate SAF mandates.

He may have a point.

Summary

IATA’s Willie Walsh says SAF suppliers are extracting “additional profit from airlines” and “price gouging”.

The EU and UK place SAF mandates on fuel suppliers, who pass compliance costs on to airlines, slowing the development of an efficient SAF market.

The production of SAF, crucial to aviation’s 2050 net zero, is low but rising.

Biomass feedstocks for SAF are available, but will also be needed for other applications.

eSAF, or PtL (power-to-liquid technology, will be very important. PtL projects are mainly in the development phase, but numbers are growing.

IATA's Walsh: fuel suppliers are extracting ""additional profit from airlines"" and ""price gouging""

In an interview with Reuters (13-Oct-2025) IATA director general Willie Walsh argued that fuel suppliers were inflating the cost of SAF at EU and UK airports by charging airlines a compliance surcharge.

He argued that suppliers were extracting ""additional profit from airlines"".

Moreover, he reasoned, the SAF mandates ""...have, in effect, facilitated price gouging by fuel suppliers in the name of the environment, and that's completely unacceptable"".

Why did he make this claim?

The EU and UK place SAF mandates on fuel suppliers…

The EU and the UK require fuel suppliers to include a mandated percentage of SAF in their jet fuel mix, rising over time.

Both require 2% in 2025, with the UK mandate rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. Under the EU mandate, called 'ReFuelEU Aviation', the requirement rises to 6% in 2030, 34% in 2040, and 70% in 2050.

…who pass on the cost of compliance to airlines…

The mandate falls on fuel suppliers, rather than airlines, as does the cost of compliance with it.

However, according to IATA, most fuel suppliers pass on the cost of complying with the regulation through a compliance fee charged to airlines.

The market price of SAF varies significantly, but in 2024 it averaged USD2,350 per tonne, which is 3.1 times the price of jet fuel derived from fossil fuels (source: IATA).

With the addition of compliance fees in Europe, the effective price of SAF is nearly double its market price, according to IATA.

…working against the development of an efficient SAF market

In analysis published in May-2025, IATA observed that fuel suppliers' pricing behaviour ""works against the development of a global, liquid, and transparent SAF market, as suppliers avoid contracting for the supply of mandated SAF with airlines"".

The airline trade body estimated that airlines in the EU would face an additional cost of USD1.3 billion in 2025 as a result of excess compliance fees. IATA added that this sum could purchase an additional 1.2 million tonnes of SAF and cut an additional 2.7 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

It estimated that the UK mandate would lead to a missed opportunity to cut an additional 0.8 million tonnes of CO2.

IATA's May-2025 analysis concluded: ""Paying more to abate less is unacceptable"".

In his recent interview with Reuters, Mr Walsh's language was more forthcoming.

The production of SAF, crucial to aviation's 2050 net zero, is low but rising

SAF is crucial to achieving aviation's goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Production remains at low levels, at just 0.3% of jet fuel consumption in 2024 - but it is increasing.

In absolute terms, 2024 SAF production of 1Mt was twice the volume of 2023. IATA expects it to double again in 2025 to 2Mt, or 0.7% of world jet fuel use of 311Mt.

Moreover, the number of airlines entering into off-take agreements with SAF suppliers is growing.

According to IATA, from a standing start in 2013, 81 airlines had announced 170 deals by Jun-2025.

Almost 40% of those airlines had more than one agreement.

Biomass feedstocks for SAF are available, but will also be needed for other applications

There are a number of feedstocks (sources) of SAF under the broad heading of biomass, which refers to matter from recently living organisms.

Biomass feedstocks include agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, forestry residues and wood waste and crop-based feedstocks and waste oils.

A Sep-2025 study by IATA and Worley Consulting found that, while biomass availability is substantial, only a small proportion of it is likely to find its way into SAF production.

According to the study, unconstrained feedstock availability will exceed 12,000Mt by 2050 - but only 4,200Mt will be available for bioenergy and biofuels after allocations to other sectors.

Furthermore, after applying a large amount of this to power, heat and biochemicals, only 1,580Mt will be available for SAF production in 2050 (but this is estimated to be a 30% increase from 2030).

Potential availability of global biomass feedstocks for SAF production by 2050

Source: IATA Sustainability and Economics, Worley Consulting.

This feedstock volume converts into 300Mt of SAF in 2050, while 500Mt will be needed to meet the net zero target.

The gap can be closed, in part, if conversion efficiencies improve further - through technology, improved feedstock logistics and better infrastructure.

eSAF, or PtL (power-to-liquid technology) will be very important in reaching targets

A key factor in closing the gap will also be the use of eSAF, which is derived from power-to-liquid (PtL) technology.

PtL fuels are synthetic liquid hydrocarbon fuels produced from renewable electricity, water and carbon dioxide (CO2).

The hydrogen is produced by the electrolysis of water using renewable electricity ('green hydrogen'), and the CO2 needs to be captured from the atmosphere or come from sources that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere.

Synthetic fuels are regarded as more scalable, deriving from renewable electricity as their source of energy. They are less dependent on feedstocks than SAF derived from biomass, and lead to greater emissions reductions.

PtL projects are mainly in the development phase, but numbers are growing

PtL projects are mainly still in the development phase.

At the time of IATA's AGM in Jun-2025, 90% of the 60 PtL projects scheduled by 2030 were still at the announcement stage, and only one commercial scale project was under construction (in the US).

Both the EU and UK SAF mandates include targets for PtL, and these have helped to stimulate the growth of PtL projects.

Policies to incentivise SAF, rather than mandate it, could be more effective

Mr Walsh's call on EU and UK regulators to abandon their SAF mandates is not a call to abandon the net zero target.

Rather, it is a plea to remove market distortions that make this already very expensive fuel even more expensive, adding to the cost burden of airlines and dissuading them from purchasing more.

Policy aimed at facilitating and incentivising the supply of SAF, rather than mandating it, could be more effective.

For example, US policy in this area includes SAF production targets, but these are not mandatory. Rather, it features credits and funding opportunities to encourage and reward SAF production.

A supportive policy framework and financial incentives to encourage investors and producers at sufficient scale is vital in Europe.

Producers need support to overcome the technological challenges of SAF production and greater pricing certainty into the future through revenue guarantees.",https://static.routesonline.com/images/cached/newsarticle-299665324-cropped-200x200.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 21:16:30.452264

Jay Inslee on ideas to develop the state’s sustainable aviation fuel industry.","Washington regulators would like your thoughts on aviation fuel that could be made from things like oilseeds or greases.

Sustainable aviation fuels are blended with conventional jet fuel. Right now, most of the ways to make the fuel need more study. Only one type — traditionally using things like fatty acids — are used commercially. Hundreds of thousands of flights have used this type of fuel, according to the State Department of Ecology.

In the last legislative session in Olympia, lawmakers directed the department to study potential — or likely — environmental impacts of making and distributing sustainable aviation fuels. And ways to avoid those issues.

The department is in the very beginning stages of its review. But leaders would like help figuring out the scope of the study. The study won’t approve or deny any specific projects. It is eventually meant to be a resource for possible future biofuels projects in Washington.

The state’s goal is to lower greenhouse gas emissions from flying. However, at a recent public comment session, Longview resident Diane Dick called many proposals for this type of jet fuel in her area “boondoggles.”

“It will never be sustainable. The only way to reduce jet fuel emissions is for people to understand they need to fly less,” Dick said.

The plant is expected to produce 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel each year, starting in 2030.

“ (Sustainable aviation fuels) production in Washington state is also important because it contributes to energy independence, improves air quality for local communities near airports, and delivers significant economic benefits,” Morgan said.

According to the governor’s office, the Port of Seattle has set a goal to use 60 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year. That’s roughly 10% of the annual aviation fuel used at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

“Sustainable aviation fuels are central to the evolving global aerospace industry, and we’re proud to be leading the way here in Washington state,” said Gov. Bob Ferguson in a news release about the planned Walla Walla facility.

In 2020, a Washington State University workgroup sent recommendations to then-Gov. Jay Inslee on ideas to develop the state’s sustainable aviation fuel industry.

The new laws, SB 253 and SB 261, were approved by Governor Newsom in 2023, and signed into law in October 2024.
The new laws will introduce climate-related reporting requirements for most large companies in the U.S., even as other climate disclosure regulations, such as the SEC’s climate reporting rule, appear increasingly less likely to be implemented.
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently issued a preliminary list of more than 4,000 U.S. companies likely to be required to comply with the new climate reporting laws.
The suit asks the court to declare that each of the new laws violate the First Amendment, and that SB 261 is preempted by the NSMIA, and to enjoin California from enforcing the laws.","Energy giant ExxonMobil filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court challenging new California laws requiring large companies to disclose their value chain greenhouse gas emissions and report on climate-related risks.

According to the suit, ExxonMobil is asking the court to declare that California’s new climate-related reporting laws violate First Amendment free speech rights – claiming that their main goal is to “embarrass” large companies and compel speech in support of the state’s ideological goals – and to prevent the state from enforcing them.

Notably, the new laws have already survived a series of First Amendment-based court challenges brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, including a recent decision by the court denying a motion to block enforcement of the laws on free speech grounds, although that case is still proceeding to trial, currently scheduled for October 2026.

The new laws, SB 253 and SB 261, were approved by Governor Newsom in 2023, and signed into law in October 2024. SB 253 requires companies with revenues greater than $1 billion that do business in California to report annually on their direct Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 value chain emissions, including those associated with supply chains, business travel, employee commuting, procurement, waste, and water usage. SB 261 applies to U.S. companies that do business in California and with revenues greater than $500 million to prepare a report disclosing their climate-related financial risk, as well as measures to reduce and adapt to that risk.

Disclosures of Scope 1 and 2 emissions under the new law is scheduled to begin in 2026, covering the previous fiscal year, while Scope 3 emissions reporting will begin in 2027, while the first climate-related risk reports are to be published by January 1, 2026.

The new laws will introduce climate-related reporting requirements for most large companies in the U.S., even as other climate disclosure regulations, such as the SEC’s climate reporting rule, appear increasingly less likely to be implemented. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently issued a preliminary list of more than 4,000 U.S. companies likely to be required to comply with the new climate reporting laws.

In its lawsuit, ExxonMobil said that it already discloses its greenhouse gas emissions and its climate-related business risks, but the company argued that the reporting frameworks required to be used by companies under the new laws will force the company to “speak in service” of California’s “ideological premise,” that “that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services.”

The suit notes, for example, that SB 253 requires disclosure of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions based on the GHG Protocol standards and guidance, which the company argues focuses on absolute emissions rather than emissions intensity, which effectively makes large companies look worse than small companies. ExxonMobil also argues that the GHG Protocol framework fails to account for avoided emissions achieved by making a product more carbon efficient, and that by requiring reporting on all emissions scopes, overcounts emissions, with the lawsuit noting that “an energy producer’s Scope 2 emissions would be the same as its power company’s Scope 1 emissions, and its Scope 3 emissions would be the same as its customers’ Scope 1 emissions.”

SB 261 requires reporting on climate-related financial risk in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or an equivalent framework, which the suit argues goes beyond the SEC’s requirements to detail all material financial risks, and will require companies to “create and publicly disclose a detailed, speculative risk report.” The suit argues that the law “deprives ExxonMobil of the option not to speak on any of the speculative topics” from the framework, and requires the company to explain why it chooses not to publish climate targets.

Additionally, the lawsuit argues that the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) preempts SB 261 from requiring disclosure of more detailed information on risks than those already covered by SEC requirements.

The suit asks the court to declare that each of the new laws violate the First Amendment, and that SB 261 is preempted by the NSMIA, and to enjoin California from enforcing the laws.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Exxon2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 15:00:27.014262

Resolving the trade dispute with China was a key request in the letter from congressional delegates Monday.
Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in a statement related to the letter that agriculture “prospers” when America can lead in global trade.
Finally, lawmakers in the letter wrote that farmers need communication and a strategy from the administration in order to plan for the future.
“We’ve appreciated the openness of the Administration to meet with stakeholders and hear their concerns,” the letter reads.","Iowa lawmakers U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, along with U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisconsin, urged a “coordinated action” across the Trump administration to prioritize soybeans in a trade deal with China and to finalize renewable fuel guidelines.

The GOP lawmakers addressed a letter Monday on behalf of soybean producers and related industries who have been “priced out of the market” due to the impacts of the ongoing trade disputes with China.

China, a major soybean importer, has not placed an order with U.S. producers this year. Instead, the country has turned to Argentina for several shiploads of soybeans in a move similar to the country’s actions during the trade wars of the first Trump administration when China looked to Brazil for its soybeans.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping Thursday, though news reports from the weekend indicated the leaders have established a framework for a trade deal that includes purchases of agricultural materials.

Resolving the trade dispute with China was a key request in the letter from congressional delegates Monday.

“The United States should make soybean market access a central priority in trade discussions with China and work toward the suspension or removal of retaliatory duties that are distorting global competition,” the letter said.

Iowa Soybean Association President Tom Adam said in a statement related to the letter that agriculture “prospers” when America can lead in global trade.

“The longer trade tensions persist, the greater the damage of permanently weakening relationships with key markets—turning the U.S. into a secondary rather than preferred supplier of soybeans,” Adam said.

Nunn said producers are “flying blind” and asking what the administration’s plan is to fix the situation.

“Right now, bins are full, prices are underwater, and the ongoing government shutdown is adding even more uncertainty to an already tough situation,” Nunn said. “Iowa farmers deserve to compete on fair terms, and I look forward to hearing back from the administration.”

USDA announces plan to ‘strengthen’ beef industry

Calls for renewable fuels guidance

In addition to a trade deal with China, the letter asks for finalization on 45z tax credit guidelines and renewable volume obligations, or RVOs, that industry leaders say will grow the renewable fuel industry and domestic demand for soybeans.

“Agencies should work together to identify and expand alternative markets for soybeans and soybean meal, remove unnecessary barriers to trade, and deploy the full suite of tools to help U.S. farmers remain competitive,” the letter said.

The 45z tax credit, which was initiated during the Biden administration and extended under the Republican-led “one big beautiful” law, encourages the production of low-emission biofuels, like sustainable aviation fuel.

While the U.S. Department of the Treasury has released initial guidelines on the tax credit, the renewable fuel industry continues to call for finalized guidelines to produce fuels within the eligible emission ranges.

Devin Mogler, the National Oilseed Processors Association president and CEO, said the soybean processing industry has invested more than $6 billion to expand capacity by more than 25% by selling into the biofuels industry.

“But we need certainty on biofuels policy to ensure the industry can run at capacity, particularly coming off a record harvest,” Mogler said in a statement. “We greatly appreciate Congressman Nunn’s leadership in working with the administration to finalize strong RVOs and 45Z so these policies translate into value at the farmgate.”

Renewable volume obligations are part of the renewable fuel standards issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that establish standards for the quantities of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels.

In June, the agency proposed historic standards for the industry, including a substantial jump in the amounts of biomass-based diesel standards, of which soybeans are a feedstock.

The letter calls for these proposed rates to be finalized.

Finally, lawmakers in the letter wrote that farmers need communication and a strategy from the administration in order to plan for the future.

“We’ve appreciated the openness of the Administration to meet with stakeholders and hear their concerns,” the letter reads. “However, we’ve reached a point where our producers need clear signals, not continued uncertainty, to make informed marketing and planting decisions.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Iowa-cultivator-1181123755.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 15:00:35.404967

This is not a single-technology story; it includes biofuels, biogases, and low-emissions hydrogen — and it would reshape transport, shipping, aviation, and parts of industry over the next decade.

The Headline Numbers: What “Quadruple” Means in Practice

The IEA’s Delivering Sustainable Fuels analysis finds that global consumption of liquid and gaseous sustainable fuels could quadruple by 2035 compared with 2024 if policies already proposed or enacted are fully implemented. Under that pathway, sustainable fuels would supply roughly 10% of global road transport demand, 15% of aviation demand, and 35% of shipping fuel demand by 2035 — dramatic increases from today’s shares.

Those rises are driven by several components: scaling biofuels and biogases, rapid growth in low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels, and policy mandates (e.g., blending requirements and procurement rules) that push markets toward cleaner liquid and gaseous fuels.

Which Fuels and Sectors Will Grow Fastest?

Transport is the principal near-term driver of demand for sustainable fuels to 2035, with heavy industry and power-sector uses expanding after 2030 as low-emissions hydrogen becomes more available.

Aviation (SAF): Sustainable aviation fuel production is expanding quickly — IATA expected SAF production to double in 2025 to about 2 million tonnes, though that still represents a tiny fraction of total jet-fuel demand.

Shipping: The IEA projects sustainable fuels could cover an estimated 35% of shipping fuel demand by 2035 under the fully-implemented policy scenario.

Road transport: Sustainable fuels could supply around 10% of road transport demand by 2035 in the IEA pathway.

The IEA stresses that scaling requires investment, supply-chain diversification, and strong sustainability safeguards to avoid unintended consequences (land use change, biodiversity loss).

Investment, Industry Moves, and Policy Signals

Meeting a fourfold rise will demand large capital flows and industry commitments. IEA and related analyses point to increased investment in low-emissions fuels as part of a broader surge in clean energy spending: energy-sector capital flows are projected to be over USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, with substantial shares directed to clean technologies, including low-emissions fuels.

Oil majors are already placing big bets on biofuels and SAF: a 2024/25 industry survey reported 40+ major projects by 2030 and potential capacity additions equivalent to hundreds of thousands of barrels per day of biofuel feedstock processing. Meanwhile, several countries (Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, and others) have publicly pledged or signalled ambition to scale sustainable fuels in line with IEA recommendations.

Policy examples also matter: Indonesia is considering SAF blending requirements (starting at 1% in 2026 and rising to 5% by 2035) to spur domestic production, illustrating how national mandates can seed local industries.

Risks, Sustainability, Constraints, and Trade-Offs

A rapid push to quadruple sustainable fuel use is technically feasible but not risk-free. The main caveats the IEA highlights include supply-chain bottlenecks, feedstock competition with food and ecosystems, permitting and financing delays, and the current higher cost of many sustainable fuels relative to fossil equivalents.

Environmental safeguards are crucial: large-scale biofuel rollouts without protections can drive deforestation and biodiversity loss. Critics warn that ambitious pledges (e.g., rapid biofuel expansion) must include strict land-use, biodiversity, and social safeguards to avoid repeating past mistakes.

What the IEA Says Needs to Happen Now

The IEA frames the pathway toward quadrupling as policy-dependent. Key near-term actions include: stronger mandates and procurement targets for SAF and renewable fuels, incentives for low-emissions hydrogen production and electrolyser deployment, clearer sustainability criteria and certification systems, and public-private finance mechanisms to de-risk early projects.

The agency also underlines international cooperation; for technology transfer, harmonised standards and cross-border trade in sustainable fuels, and robust monitoring to ensure greenhouse-gas benefits are real across life cycles.

Why This Matters: Climate and Economic Implications

If sustainable fuels scale as the IEA projects, their uptake could be a critical bridging solution for hard-to-electrify sectors (aviation, shipping, some industrial processes), reducing lifecycle emissions where direct electrification is slow or impractical.

Economically, a growing sustainable-fuel industry could create value chains in feedstock collection (waste oils, residues), hydrogen production hubs, green ammonia, and e-fuel manufacturing — but those benefits depend on well-designed policies that steer investments toward low-emissions pathways and protect ecosystems.

Final Thoughts

“Sustainable fuel use by 2035” as a global objective is within sight under the IEA’s scenario — but it is conditional. The quadrupling outcome is not automatic; it requires coherent policy packages, substantial investment, and rigorous sustainability governance. If those pieces fall into place, sustainable fuels could be a major pillar of decarbonisation in the coming decade — especially where electrification alone cannot deliver deep emissions cuts.

FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

1. What exactly does “sustainable fuel” mean in the IEA analysis?

The IEA uses “sustainable fuels” to cover a range of low-emissions liquid and gaseous fuels, including advanced biofuels, biogases, and hydrogen-derived fuels produced with low lifecycle emissions — subject to sustainability criteria.

2. How realistic is a fourfold increase by 2035?

Technically feasible under the IEA’s modelling, but it depends on fully implementing current and announced policies, scaling investments, and resolving feedstock and sustainability constraints. The IEA explicitly describes the pathway as conditional on those policy actions.

3. Will sustainable fuels make a big dent in global emissions?

They can significantly reduce emissions in sectors that are hard to electrify (aviation, shipping, some industries), but their climate benefit hinges on lifecycle emissions — and on avoiding land-use and biodiversity harms. Proper lifecycle accounting and safeguards are essential.

4. Who is investing in this shift?

Governments and major energy companies are increasing commitments: clean energy investment is rising (IEA projects USD 3.3 trillion in energy flows in 2025 with large clean allocations), and oil majors have announced dozens of biofuel/SAF projects toward 2030.

5. What are the main policy levers to accelerate sustainable fuel uptake?

Key tools include blending mandates and procurement targets (e.g., SAF mandates), low-carbon fuel standards, investment incentives for hydrogen and electrolysers, feedstock sustainability rules, and international cooperative frameworks for standards and trade.",https://sigmaearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-79488-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 16:00:04.655814

United Airlines has committed to fully reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 without relying on carbon offsets. Investments in SAF are a key tool identified by the airline to reach its goal. Under the new agreement, United will become the first commercial airline to purchase SAF for use on flights from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington D.C.

Lauren Riley, United Chief Sustainability Officer, said:

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey. While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with stakeholders, like Neste, across the aviation value chain to encourage policymakers to implement sensible market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

Finland-based Neste provides renewable and circular solutions for sectors including road transport, aviation, and polymers and chemicals.

According to Neste, the company’s Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel.

United signed the first overseas SAF agreement for a U.S. commercial airline with Neste in 2022 to supply fuel for flights at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, and Neste has also been supplying SAF to United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport since August 2024.

Under the new agreement, Neste has already been delivering SAF to United at George Bush Airport since July, and will continue through October, while deliveries to Newark and Dulles started in September and are set to continue until the end of 2025. The fuel is delivered to each airport via existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, said:

“We are thrilled to enable United Airlines to expand SAF use to new markets in the United States. It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its bold net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050.

The regulation established the “blending mandate”, which sets the mandatory minimum percentage for the use of alternative aviation fuels by airlines.
“Our focus now is on supporting the industry and member states to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.""
But the agency noted that the alternative aviation fuel market “remains concentrated” with 25 suppliers providing SAF to 33 airports in 12 countries during 2024.
“A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states.","The European aviation industry is currently “on track” to achieve the target of using at least 6 per cent alternative aviation fuels to power aircraft by 2030, according to an EU report.

An annual report by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) into the uptake of alternative fuels, known as “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF) by the industry, said that the new ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation has “stimulated increased SAF production” within the EU.

The regulation established the “blending mandate”, which sets the mandatory minimum percentage for the use of alternative aviation fuels by airlines. This came into force at 2 per cent of all fuel used in 2025 and is due to increase to 6 per cent by 2030 before accelerating to 20 per cent in 2035 and 70 per cent by 2050.

Earlier this month, leading European airlines warned that without increased support for alternative aviation fuels from the EU there would be rising costs - leading to reduced air travel accessibility and connectivity across Europe.

But the EU is striking a more optimistic tone, with sustainable transport and tourism commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas emphasising that it was “making steady progress in adopting sustainable aviation fuels”.

“The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is already helping to increase SAF production and use across member states,” added Tzitzikostas. “Our focus now is on supporting the industry and member states to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.""

The EASA report found that nearly all SAF used in the EU during 2024 was biofuel, with 81 per cent produced from used cooking oil and another 17 per cent from waste animal fat.

But the agency noted that the alternative aviation fuel market “remains concentrated” with 25 suppliers providing SAF to 33 airports in 12 countries during 2024. Airports in just five member states - France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden – received 99 per cent of all supply.

Alternative fuel accounted for only 0.6 per cent of all aviation fuel supplied at EU airports last year, which reduced CO2 emissions by around 714 kilotonnes – equivalent to 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris. But the average price of SAF (€2,085 per tonne) was nearly three times higher than conventional jet fuel (€734 per tonne).

EASA’s next annual report will use 2025 data to assess whether the first blending mandate target of 2 per cent has been achieved.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said: “This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

By Victoria Heath

Earlier this week, plans to fast-track Heathrow’s third runway were announced. While there has been much conjecture on the increased emissions and air pollution that such an upgrade will bring, there’s another source of pollution that, for many, slips under the environmental protection radar: noise.

According to the Airports Commission, a third runway at Heathrow would expose 12,000 to 28,000 more people to noise impacts exceeding 70 decibels. As well as this, a third runway would lead to 300,000 people experiencing being flown over by aircraft for the first time.

Already, reports state Heathrow has noise levels classified as ‘significantly annoying’ that impact more people than any other airport in Europe.

Despite these vast numbers and clear implications, aircraft noise is not currently a statutory nuisance in the UK. That means that local authorities do not have the legal power to take action on matters of aircraft noise, and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) does not have the legal power to prevent aircraft flying over a particular location or at a particular time for environmental reasons.

Although maximum noise limits are set for occupational noise exposure, there is no defined limit for environmental noise, including aviation noise.

However, in order to assess the adverse impact of aircraft noise in the UK, government policy has established that the lowest observed adverse level effect is 51dB for an average summer day, and 45 dB for a summer night.

Crucially, this doesn’t mean that noise above these levels will not be allowed. But it does mean that noise will play an important role as a factor in planning decisions within that area (such as airport expansion). There may also be support available for residents for noise mitigation, such as double glazing.

What are the impacts of aircraft noise pollution?

Aircraft noise is a serious public health issue. In the UK, more than one million people are exposed to aircraft noise above levels recommended for the protection of health.

Around 460 schools around Heathrow are exposed to aircraft noise that ‘impede memory and learning’.

As well as this, one large-scale study around Heathrow found people living under the flight path were 10 to 20 per cent more at risk of stroke and heart disease than those not living under the flight path.

Another study by UCL found that those who lived in areas with higher than recommended aircraft noise levels had stiffer and thicker heart muscles that contracted and expanded less easily and were less efficient at pumping blood around the body, compared to those who lived in lower aircraft noise areas.

Emerging studies also link aircraft noise to poor mental health, such as increases in stress and anxiety.

How is noise pollution mitigated?

The UK Government have a framework used to ensure aviation noise remains at a limit. Its main aim is ‘to limit, and where possible, reduce the number of people in the UK significantly affected by aircraft noise’.

To do this, a range of measures is in place. Through planning decisions, governments aim to limit the impact of noise in any new development. As well as this, plans to work with the aviation industry to encourage the development of quieter aircraft are already in place.

As engines become sleeker, noise pollution reduces. For example, Airbus’s A320neo reduces noise with a new engine, lowering it by 50 per cent from the maximum 85dB of the previous A320 model.

While these measures may help to reduce some aviation noise, for the thousands of individuals living below flight paths, it may not be enough. Ultimately, they are still subjected to loud, disturbing and health-impacting noises.",https://geographical.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/heathrow-2.webp,N,,2025-10-27 16:00:13.041271

A global stage for climate entrepreneurs

Since its launch in 2014, ClimateLaunchpad has grown from a small European competition into a global programme supporting thousands of early-stage entrepreneurs. In 2025, ClimateLaunchpad welcomed nine new countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Japan, Singapore, Mexico, Peru, Hong Kong, and Vanuatu. With a record number of applications and its 500th Boot Camp delivered this year, the programme reinforced its position as the world’s most accessible green innovation pipeline.

The competition covered eight key themes that address today’s most urgent climate challenges: clean energy, food systems, circular economy, blue economy, sustainable mobility, urban solutions, adaptation and resilience, and emerging innovations captured under The Next Big Thing. From transforming waste into sustainable aviation fuel to powering communities with decentralised renewables, the finalists reflected a new wave of climate innovation that is practical, inclusive and globally connected.

David Watt, Programme Director, ClimateLaunchpad:

“Watching these teams pitch in Vienna reminded me why we do this. These aren’t just business ideas, they’re solutions shaped by people from diverse backgrounds and experiences of climate change, united by the determination to take action. From 2,700 applications to 40 finalists, the quality this year was extraordinary. As we expand to more countries, we’re not just running a competition, but building a truly global community where climate solutions can emerge anywhere.”

Brian O'Sullivan, Deputy Director - Climate Unit, Irish Aid:

""Through our continued partnership with ClimateLaunchpad, Irish Aid is proud to stand with entrepreneurs from the countries most affected by climate change, helping them build solutions that the world urgently needs.""

Held during Manufacturing Month in October, the contest celebrates California’s world-class manufacturing sector and its vital role in driving innovation and economic growth across the state.

A global leader in aerospace and defense

California is home to one-third of the nation’s space technology companies and employs more aerospace engineers and defense personnel than any other state. Global security and aerospace leader Lockheed Martin supports thousands of highly-skilled jobs across multiple facilities dedicated to advanced research, design, manufacturing, and flight testing – including its renowned Skunk Works site in Palmdale, where the X-59 is being developed.

For more than a decade, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works and NASA have collaborated to solve one of the most persistent challenges of supersonic flight – the sonic boom. Skunk Works is leading the design, build, and flight testing of the X-59 quiet supersonic technology aircraft, which will be used to collect community responses to its low-noise sonic “thump”. The findings will provide NASA with the critical data required to help approve new rules that will allow quiet commercial supersonic flight over land. This milestone could unlock a new global market for aircraft manufacturers and enable passengers to travel anywhere in the world in half the time it takes today.

California’s manufacturing strength

As underscored in the California Jobs First Blueprint, California’s manufacturing sector spans several industry verticals, including aerospace & defense, clean tech, high-tech, life sciences, and working lands & water.

A total of 170 prospective investors and representatives from various national government agencies, local government units, investment promotion agencies, and nongovernment organizations attended the event.

Finland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided support through the BOI-Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI)’s Green Transition Investment Program (GTIP).

The forum facilitated dialogue among government, industry, and development partners to boost the Philippine SAF ecosystem.

SAF is a low-carbon aviation fuel made from non-petroleum sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and captured carbon. It is called a “drop-in“ fuel — blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without major modifications.

It reduces the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of air travel compared to fossil fuels, in some cases able to achieve a net-negative carbon footprint.

Officials of some of its early proponents, such as SAFAsia’s Ditmar Gorges Alcom’s Prateek Tiwari, and Cavitoil Basura Power’s Bart Cassineli, joined a panel discussion on opportunities and challenges in local SAF production.

“For the Philippines, SAF offers an opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in the global effort to combat climate change, transforming a worldwide challenge into a national economic opportunity,” BOI Executive Director Ma. Corazon Halili-Dichosa said.

The BOI is encouraging SAF investments through the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (Create) Act and the Renewable Energy (RE) Law.

The Create Act lowers corporate income taxes to 25 percent, and those of small, medium and micro enterprises to 20 percent.

RE projects using solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass sources are granted a maximum of seven years’ income tax holiday, special corporate income tax rate or enhanced deductions, value added tax and duty perks, among other benefits.

Partnerships

In the second panel discussion, representatives from BOI, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Asian Development Bank, and Central Luzon State University provided insights on development pathways and partnership opportunities for SAF in the Philippines.

BOI Resource-Based Industries Service (RBIS) Acting Director Francis Peñaflor expounded on fiscal incentives for SAF investments.

The Department for Transport (DfT) proposes a variable levy on suppliers in the consultation published this month, with the costs passed “through the supply chain and on to consumers”.

It notes the extent to which costs are passed on will depend on “consumers’ sensitivity to price changes” and the level of competition, suggesting: “It will be a commercial decision for aviation fuel suppliers whether they pass on some or all costs to airlines.”

However, it assumes they “will pass on 100%” of the cost, calculating this will lead to “a small impact on ticket prices”.

An indicative table of levy payments based on 2024 data suggests the costs will amount to more than £55 million a year for large fuel suppliers, £22 million for medium-size producers and £5.5 million for small producers.

The government proposes an additional amount to cover unforeseen costs and to mitigate the risk of under-collection, noting a need for cash reserves and mutualisation of the costs of supplier failures or defaults.

It estimates the costs of a large supplier failure in a single year at £21 million.

These costs will be on top of the price of SAF itself, which Iata reported was more than three times the cost of jet fuel last year, adding $1.6 billion to carriers’ fuel bills.

Iata estimates the cost of SAF in Europe this year at $1.2 billion, with an additional $1.7 billion in ‘compliance fees’, for which it blames the UK and EU’s SAF mandates suggesting these “have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel”.

Airlines must purchase one million tonnes of SAF to meet the requirements of the mandates this year.

Iata notes the cost of SAF in Europe has doubled since the mandates were introduced in January owing to “the compliance fees SAF producers or suppliers are charging” to cover their potential costs.

The UK and EU mandates require SAF to comprise 2% of fuel on all departing flights over the course of this year, rising to 6% in the EU and 10% in the UK by 2030.

High level of compliance critical

The DfT Levy Design Consultation sets out the arrangements for and potential impact of the levy to fund its SAF Revenue Certainty Mechanism, with supplier contributions based on market share and fuel volumes.

It proposes a ‘forecast levy rate’ to provide a guide on future costs and options for mitigating financial risks, administering the levy and enforcing compliance.

The government notes: “It is critical the design of the levy promotes a high level of compliance and responds to non-compliance effectively.”

It proposes “regular public reporting on the extent of non-compliance and actions taken in response” arguing this will act as “a reputational deterrent” but also advocates “a suite of enforcement measures”.

The secretary of state would have the power to impose fines of up to £100,000 or 10% of annual turnover on companies in breach of the levy requirements.

The consultation is due to close on January 8. The DfT said it expects to publish a response next year and is committed to passing “all necessary legislation” for the mechanism to be in place by the end of 2026.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/074/Shutterstock-airline-fuel_Main.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 14:00:55.779948

The COP30 climate summit will be held between November 10 and 21 in Belem, Brazil, which is a global leader in biofuels production and use.

“I think there will be more focus on the social aspect of the transition and also on the sustainable use of biomass,” La Camera said at an energy conference in Singapore on Monday, as carried by Reuters.

The goal could be boosting biofuels production four times by 2035 or setting a target for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) share in the global energy mix, La Camera said.

Brazil last month launched the Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels—known as Belém 4x—an initiative aimed at building high-level political support for the global goal of quadrupling the production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035.

Last month, IRENA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) launched a financing initiative to support SAF and clean aviation energy projects globally.

The push toward increased biofuel production and use comes amid major oil firms ditching biofuel projects. Shell last month abandoned plans to proceed with the construction of a biofuels facility at its Shell Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam, amid challenging market conditions that makes the project uncompetitive.

BP also cancelled plans for a major biofuels facility at its Rotterdam refinery, scoring another setback for Europe’s drive to scale advanced biofuels.

Earlier this month, IRENA, the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) said in a report that the world is falling behind on its renewable energy and efficiency goals despite record progress last year.

The global progress report flagged bottlenecks in investment, grids, and supply chains, and urged governments for bolder renewable targets before COP30.

GGRs useful for preventing GHGs from entering atmosphere

Greenhouse gas removal technologies, also known as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), are being deployed in the UK to enable the continued burning of natural gas without releasing the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere, which would otherwise accelerate climate breakdown.

While there are plenty of technological solutions to replacing natural gas as a source of electricity generation, such as renewable energy and battery storage, CCUS is also used to mitigate the GHG emissions of hard-to-abate sectors such as cement production.

In September 2025, Heidelberg Materials UK’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to decarbonise a cement works achieved its final investment decision (FID).

Introducing the report, Whitehead said: “Do we need GGRs to get us to net zero? All the evidence points to a firm ‘yes’, unless we can contemplate a low-carbon future with no industry, little transport and difficult-to-swallow mass behaviour change.

“Estimates of the ‘gap’ left after all reasonable steps to decarbonise have been taken vary, but all conclude that the only way to overcome the ‘emissions gap’ is to deploy to varying degrees the sheaf of removal technologies now being developed.”

The review concluded that “without GGRs we cannot meet net zero, and the value of doing so in a way that achieves geological net zero”, however, it added “that there is no silver bullet” to decarbonising the economy.

It presented a series of recommendations to the government. It said the “government should develop a GGR Strategy to outline the contribution of GGR solutions required to meet carbon budgets and net zero”.

In addition, the review said the government should “establish an Office for Greenhouse Gas Removals to produce more coordinated action on GGRs, and to enable quicker and more efficient rollout of policy and project deployment”.

The government has recently said that it wants to reduce the number of quangos (quasi-autonomous non-government organisations). That didn’t stop it from recently creating the Office for Clean Energy Jobs (OCEJ) to help deliver the 400,000 new clean energy jobs by 2030 which it says are needed for the journey to net zero.

The review added that the government “should adopt a strategic aim to minimise the use of imported biomass feedstocks” and it should “amend and rename the SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] Mandate to become a Net Zero Aviation Mandate, with a trajectory that means that by 2045 all flights taking off from the UK are made climate neutral.

“The amended Mandate should drive procurement of both SAF and permanent GGRs, with competition between these solutions.”

The final recommendation was that the government should “exploit UK growth opportunities” by making the UK a leader in deploying and promoting GGR technologies.

CCUS industry welcomes review and pledges to promote the technology

CCSA (Carbon Capture and Storage Association) UK director Mark Sommerfeld said: “The Independent Review of Greenhouse Gas Removals marks a pivotal step in the UK’s net zero journey.

“Technologies such as Bioenergy with CCS, Direct Air Capture with Storage and Energy from Waste with CCS are essential to tackling residual emissions, addressing industrial decarbonisation and securing a reliable, low-carbon energy system.

“The Review outlines a clear path to scale these solutions, with success hinging on a credible business model, investment certainty and robust CO₂ transport and storage infrastructure.

“With vast CO₂ storage potential, established CCUS infrastructure and world-leading low-carbon expertise, the UK has a real opportunity to be a global leader in high-integrity carbon removals.

“We look forward to working with the government and industry to deliver 5 Mtpa of engineered removals by 2030, rising to 23 Mtpa by 2035 – boosting growth, energy security and addressing climate change as global demand for GGR credits surges.”

Review ‘blinkered by a silo mentality’ – anti-CCUS campaign

Scrap Carbon Capture campaign lead campaigner Andrew Boswell said: “Dr Whitehead’s review is blinkered by a silo mentality.

“It treats greenhouse-gas removals (GGRs) as a standalone fix while ignoring the huge externalities built into relying on the Government’s CCS network to deliver them.

“Every UK cluster is front-loaded with fossil-fuel anchor projects that lock in decades of methane-leaking LNG imports and billions in public subsidies ultimately paid by consumers.

“Whitehead calls for faster CCUS expansion but never counts the carbon or economic cost of that dependence.

“He also sidesteps the Drax issue — the UK’s biggest emitter being re-badged as our flagship BECCS [Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage] project, fuelled by imported forest biomass.

“And his proposal to use GGRs to offset aviation growth misuses scarce removal capacity: these technologies should be for cleaning the atmosphere, not for licensing airport expansion.

“Until we decouple GGR policy from fossil and aviation interests, we’re subsidising the problem, not the solution.”

Minister says government will continue to improve GGR deployment

Energy minister Michael Shanks said: “Greenhouse Gas Removal technologies have the potential to propel us towards our climate targets, as the UK continues to be a world leader on climate action, protecting current and future generations.

“The report recognises the important role GGR technologies can play in delivering clean power and net zero. Already, we are investing in first-of-a-kind carbon capture projects in the UK, – creating thousands of jobs in North Wales, the North West and Teesside.

“We will take the time to carefully consider these findings and consider how best to use these technologies to deliver climate action, good jobs and energy security for the country.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2009/05/carbon.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 12:02:59.704072

""We will abide by all sanctions imposed by the international community,"" he said.

He, however, refused to comment on the IOC's purchases of Russian oil.

Russian oil made up for 21 per cent of the crude oil IOC imports during April-September.

IOC's subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL) has halved Russian oil imports this month, coinciding with the fresh sanctions the US imposed on Russian oil.

US President Donald Trump, late October 22, imposed sanctions on Russia's Rosneft and Lukoil, in a bid to pressure Moscow into ending its war on Ukraine. A day later, the European Union imposed full transaction bans on Rosneft and Russian gas firm Gazprom Neft.

While the Indian government has not officially responded to the sanctions announced by the US, industry sources said Indian refiners' import strategy would largely depend on how banking systems respond to the latest restrictions.

Reliance Industries Ltd, which has a 25-year term contract with Rosneft to buy up to 5,00,000 barrels per day of crude and is India's largest importer of Russian oil, may be the first company to stop importing oil from Moscow.

Last week, Reliance pledged full compliance with the Western sanctions on Russian crude imports while expressing confidence that its diversified sourcing strategy will maintain operational stability.

The company, which operates the world's largest refining complex at Gujarat's Jamnagar with 1.24 million barrels per day capacity, said it will adapt its refinery operations to meet new compliance requirements following restrictions announced by the EU, UK and the US.

Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy, which is currently dependent solely on Russian oil after supplies from elsewhere dried up due to sanctions by the European Union, has very few options.

A potential disruption in discounted Russian Urals supplies could trim Indian refiners' gross margins, with the grade making up roughly 40 per cent of their crude slate.

Indian refiners have started diversifying their crude import baskets in the third quarter, importing larger volumes from Colombia, Canada and the Middle East as inflows from Russia dipped. India's Russian crude imports in July-September averaged 1.68 million bpd, a 13 per cent decline compared to Q2.

Long reliant on Middle Eastern oil, India began importing large volumes of steeply discounted Russian crude in 2022 after Western sanctions restricted Moscow's traditional markets. At one point, Russian oil made up about 40 per cent of crude that Indian refiners processed and turned into fuels like petrol and diesel.

Russia currently supplies about a third of India's crude imports, averaging around 1.75 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2025, of which approximately 1.2 mbd came directly from Rosneft and Lukoil. Most of these volumes were bought by private refiners, Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy, with smaller allocations to state-owned refiners.

Despite tightened sanctions and the US slapping a steep 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods, India's imports of Russian crude between January and September 2025 were only 4.6 per cent lower than 1.83 million bpd a year earlier.

Russian crude flows are expected to remain in the 1.6-1.8 mbd range until November 21, but direct volumes from Rosneft and Lukoil are likely to decline thereafter, as Indian refiners seek to avoid any risk of US sanctions, Sumit Ritolia, Lead Research Analyst (Refining and Modelling) at Kpler, said last week.

The move, announced by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and JTC Corporation on Monday, October 27, marks a new phase in the transformation of the country’s main industrial hub.

The government plans to allocate about 300 hectares of land on the western part of Jurong Island for renewable power generation and the production of low-carbon fuels. This area represents around 10 per cent of the island’s total 3,000-hectare space.

Jurong Island currently serves as the centre of Singapore’s energy and chemicals industry and is home to major refineries operated by ExxonMobil, Chevron, and PetroChina.

Officials said the island will serve as a global testing ground for low-carbon technologies and next-generation energy solutions. The new zone will support the scaling up of facilities focused on renewable energy sources such as solar power, sustainable aviation fuel, and ammonia-based solutions that can be used for power generation and maritime fuel. It will also include battery storage systems and hydrogen-ready power plants to support future energy needs.

In addition to the renewable energy projects, another 20 hectares of land will be developed into Singapore’s largest data centre park. The new facility is expected to provide up to 700 megawatts of power capacity. Operators will have access to Jurong Island’s established energy and utility network, including shared power storage systems and links to low-carbon energy sources.

Authorities said the expansion aligns with Singapore’s broader goal of balancing industrial growth with sustainability and innovation. Jurong Island will continue to attract investment in specialty chemicals and sustainable products while also building infrastructure to support the energy transition.

Demand for advanced chemical products is rising across the region, and Singapore aims to position itself as a key supplier of high-quality materials. The island’s existing ecosystem and power capacity are seen as strong foundations for companies looking to scale operations in Asia.

Meanwhile, local energy company Sembcorp Industries has introduced a vertical battery stacking solution at its Jurong Island energy storage facility. The upgrade increases the system’s storage capacity from 285 megawatt-hours to 326 megawatt-hours, boosting efficiency without expanding the site’s physical footprint.

Dive Brief:

Houston-based oil and convenience retailer Par Pacific Holdings has closed a $100 million deal to build the largest renewable fuels manufacturing facility in Hawai’i, the company announced last week.

The facility in Kapolei is expected to be built by the end of 2025 and will produce roughly 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable naphtha and low carbon liquified petroleum gases.

The deal marks new territory for Par Pacific, whose profitable retail arm has become one of the quieter success stories in the c-store industry.

Dive Insight:

Par Pacific’s latest initiative was revealed in July when the company, alongside Japanese trading and petroleum firms Mitsubishi Corp. and Eneos, agreed to establish a joint venture to produce renewable fuels at Par Pacific’s refinery in Kapolei. As part of the deal, Mitsubishi and Eneos would form Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, which would acquire a 36.5% equity stake in the venture for $100 million, while Par Pacific would retain the remaining interest and lead the project’s operations.

It’s unclear how the facility will impact Par Pacific’s convenience retailing network in Hawai’i, which includes about 89 locations under the company’s Hele banner. Back in July, Par Pacific said the facility “will contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while providing reliable transportation and utility fuels to Hawaii consumers.”

“We are thrilled to partner with Mitsubishi and ENEOS through the formation of this strategic joint venture,” Will Monteleone, president and CEO of Par Pacific, said in July. “Creating the Hawaii Renewables joint venture brings together the best of our three organizations and yields additional scale and expertise across feedstock origination, commercial optimization, and market access throughout the Pacific Basin.”

Besides its locations in Hawai’i, Par Pacific operates another roughly 30 c-stores across Idaho, and Washington under the Nomnom and 76 banners.

Redefining the Green Corridor Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.
The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”","Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to delay for one year the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which would have created the world’s first truly global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping. The decision, taken at the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2) held in London from 14–17 October 2025, marks a setback for international decarbonization efforts, in favor of a status quo that benefit oil and gas producers but not shipowners, investors and ports already under pressure to meet tightening emissions targets.

The postponement leaves the sector without a formal global market framework just as regional regulation is gathering pace, from Europe’s maritime carbon pricing to new clean-port standards in Asia and North America. NatPower Marine said the outcome underlines the growing gap between political negotiation and industry action, as ports and shipping lines continue to invest in clean-energy infrastructure despite the lack of a global mechanism.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine and NatPower UK, said: “While the IMO’s postponement is disappointing, it cannot be a pause button for the industry. Shore power and near-shore electrification are proven, scalable and capable of delivering deep emissions cuts today. Every corridor we electrify removes thousands of tons of CO2, NOx and SOx from the system while improving air quality for coastal communities. The opportunity to lead is now, not in a year’s time.”

He continued: “No sector has got regulation before innovation, it has always been the other way round. Airplanes, cars, radio, Internet, AI were invented and adopted before regulation, and regulation followed the path set by innovators.

It is clear that the larger players and most innovative shipping operators and owners have already decided to go green because it is a strategic advantage and a cost cutting option in the years to come. So innovators and initiators will progress during this regulatory postponement. We at NatPower are accelerating our plan to deliver near shore electric propulsion and cold ironing in 120 locations globally.”

The potential losers of this postponement are the emerging countries that were relying on IMO global carbon pricing to finance investments. The good news is that those investments can be made with private capital, provided that their locations are included in the green corridors and routes of the initiators.

New electric fuel for ships is already benefitting from the sheer convenience and it is a low hanging fruit for decarbonization, and it is happening right now. Without waiting to choose among different alternative cleaner molecules (e-methanol, ammonia and hydrogen), the immediate opportunity is near shore electric propulsions and cold ironing.

The existing regulations in EU and China, and their ambitions to become the powerhouses of Energy Transition, are more than sufficient to trigger adoption and change.

Across Europe, Asia and the Americas, a wave of electrification projects, from single-port upgrades to full Green Corridors, is building a global network of clean maritime routes. It shows what genuine international cooperation can achieve when backed by real infrastructure and investment.

Green Shipping Corridors: the model for immediate progress

Through its investment in true Green Shipping Corridors, NatPower Marine is connecting high-traffic maritime routes with clean electricity for propulsion and cold ironing, replacing fossil-fuel use both in port and on near-shore legs. The company is planning to invest more than £3 billion to deliver 120 clean-port locations by 2030, creating an integrated global network of zero-emission maritime energy hubs.

For example, the corridor between Heysham Port and Northern Ireland, developed in partnership with Peel Ports Group, has started construction. It will eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually from Irish Sea routes and forms part of a wider £250 million UK rollout of shore-power and e-ship-charging infrastructure.

Sommadossi said: “The IMO’s delay underlines the challenge of reaching consensus at a global level. But while negotiations stall, regional regulation is accelerating, and the landscape is becoming more fragmented. The EU Emissions Trading System now prices maritime emissions, and FuelEU Maritime sets carbon-intensity limits for vessels trading in Europe. The UK is preparing to bring shipping into its own ETS, Singapore is expanding its network of green corridors, and California is already enforcing at-berth emission rules. The message is clear: decarbonization is no longer waiting for a single global mechanism, it is happening route by route, region by region.”

This patchwork of regional measures is driving urgency for practical, scalable solutions that can operate across multiple regulatory systems. As global policy tightens, the infrastructure to deliver compliance and emissions reduction is struggling to keep pace, creating both challenge and opportunity for the industry.

That urgency is echoed in new research showing the accelerating pace of green-shipping regulation and innovation worldwide.

According to the World Maritime University (WMU) and the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI) in their Global Green Shipping Development Report (2024–2025), regulatory pressure on ports and shipping is now accelerating across all major economies.

The WMU/SISI report also confirms that ports are increasingly being recognized as the key enablers of maritime decarbonization, with shore power expected to become a mandatory standard in many jurisdictions. The study highlights that “ships in ports will use more shore power or zero-carbon energy in the future” as emission requirements tighten, a view strongly echoed by NatPower Marine.

“This global trend validates our approach,” said Sommadossi. “Shore power and e-charging infrastructure are not optional extras; they are the foundation for clean shipping. Every port that plugs, in our standardized network, becomes part of the global energy transition.”

Energy integration: powering the maritime transition

To ensure clean electricity is available where and when vessels need it, NatPower Marine is supported by 20 GW of renewable generation and over 100 GWh of battery-storage capacity developed by its parent, NatPower Group. Located in strategic coastal regions, these assets deliver stable, low-cost renewable power through private-wire connections and smart Power Purchase Agreements, supporting vessel charging and port operations without burdening national grids.

This integrated approach forms what Sommadossi describes as “the backbone of a clean-shipping network,” linking renewable generation directly to maritime demand and enabling real decarbonization today.

NatPower Marine believes the IMO’s delay could, paradoxically, open space for innovation and collaboration. While waiting for a global mechanism, countries, ports and fleets can lead the way and show what success looks like by developing their own clean-energy routes, projects that cut emissions while creating industrial and economic growth.

Redefining the Green Corridor

Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.

“So far, most green corridors have been defined around alternative fuels and fuel-supply routes,” he said. “But that only addresses part of the challenge. A true green corridor must include the full chain of clean-energy infrastructure, from shore power and propulsion charging to renewable generation and grid integration. That is the only way to deliver zero-emission voyages from berth to berth, at an affordable cost.”

He added that NatPower Marine’s approach, combining e-ship charging, port-grid integration and large-scale battery storage, offers a practical blueprint for this next generation of corridors.

“If the past week has shown anything,” he concluded, “it is that we cannot wait for definitions and policy to catch up with reality. The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:56:30.578403

While airlines are already required to use at least 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030, Whitehead’s review recommends giving operators flexibility: use less SAF if they offset emissions through CDR credits.
The review concedes that curbing air travel is politically unlikely, making removals essential to meeting carbon budgets.

Whitehead concluded that while BECCS has a role, it should just complement the UK’s carbon removal strategy.","A sweeping government-commissioned review has called for a reset of the UK carbon removal strategy — and it could soon force airlines to pay directly for their emissions.

The independent report, led by former MP Dr. Alan Whitehead for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, urges the government to establish a “net zero aviation mandate” that would make the aviation sector fund verified carbon dioxide removal (CDR) projects, including direct air capture and green gas initiatives.

While airlines are already required to use at least 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030, Whitehead’s review recommends giving operators flexibility: use less SAF if they offset emissions through CDR credits. The goal, he said, is to ensure “polluters pay” for the hardest-to-abate emissions, such as those from long-haul flights.

Aviation is projected to be the UK’s largest source of residual emissions by 2050, yet demand continues to grow with new runways approved at Heathrow and Gatwick. The review concedes that curbing air travel is politically unlikely, making removals essential to meeting carbon budgets.

Not all UK carbon removal created equal

Beyond aviation, the nearly 200-page report calls for a national greenhouse gas removal (GGR) strategy and the creation of an Office for GGR, warning that the UK’s current focus on large industrial clusters neglects smaller, scalable solutions.

The Carbon Capture and Storage Association welcomed the publication: “Today’s publication of the Independent Review of Greenhouse Gas Removals marks a pivotal moment for the UK’s net zero transition. GGRs, including BECCS, DACCS, and WECCS, are essential technologies to remove residual emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, support industrial decarbonisation and maintain a reliable, low-carbon energy system.

The UK has a real opportunity to cement its position as a global leader in high-integrity carbon removals, thanks to its large CO2 storage capacity, existing CCUS infrastructure, advanced low-carbon technology expertise and a supportive policy and regulatory environment that can attract private investment and accelerate deployment … With global demand for GGR credits growing – nearly 10 million purchased worldwide – the UK has a clear opportunity to lead in high-integrity carbon removals.”

But the review did take a cautious stance on the UK’s reliance on biomass with carbon capture, warning that BECCS is unlikely to supply more than a small fraction of future clean power.

It urged policymakers to scale back support for large imported-biomass projects like Drax and to prioritise domestic feedstocks from agricultural residues instead. Whitehead concluded that while BECCS has a role, it should just complement the UK’s carbon removal strategy.

Whitehead also spotlighted carbon capture from energy-from-waste facilities as a promising, near-term emissions solution. The Protos incinerator in Ellesmere Port, run by Encyclis, recently became one of the UK’s first commercial-scale projects under the HyNet cluster. Companies like enfinium and Viridor have been actively working on deploying projects of their own.

The challenge here is that most waste plants sit outside such industrial hubs. The review warned that without a framework for non-pipeline CO2 transport — via ship, rail, or truck — many regional facilities will struggle to participate in the UK’s net-zero plans.

Whitehead urged ministers to “put removals on a firm footing” through stronger coordination, regulation reform, and clear market signals, including holding the aviation sector accountable for its carbon footprint.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jay-vicencio-7slin_liPnw-unsplash-scaled-e1761567769217.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:56:43.391000

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will collaborate to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technology maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF requires deep collaboration across the value chain, including from policymakers and investors to SAF producers and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more a meaningful impact.

The joint commitment also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand sides across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Airbus and Cathay aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Airbus and Cathay have a long-standing partnership dating back to 1989, when the airline signed its first order for Airbus aircraft. Today, the Cathay Group operates 86 Airbus aircraft with over 70 more on order for future delivery.

Cathay is also a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, which is a joint initiative between Cathay with other oneworld airline members and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. The fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs.

Malaysia as a potential site for development of SAF

Malaysia has the potential to be one of the locations in Southeast Asia for Cathay Group and Airbus’s newly-announced co-investment projects in the development of SAF. Cathay Pacific general manager of sustainability Grace Cheung said the airline sees Malaysia and other countries in the region and globally as part of its potential project areas, as reported in Malaysia’s The New Straits Times.

“Malaysia and also many countries in the region are all part of where we have potential projects…The partnership that we have with Airbus definitely focuses on SAF development in the Asia region. So, not only limited to Hong Kong, not only limited to Asia but globally,” she said.

Meanwhile, Airbus said Asia holds immense potential for SAF development with about 40 per cent of the world’s feedstock resources located in the region.

Singapore’s levy to boost use of greener jet fuel not suitable elsewhere as it may dampen air travel: IATA

Singapore’s decision to impose a levy on travellers to raise the use of greener jet fuel may have a “dampening effect on air travel”, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) may not recommend such a policy elsewhere, said the body’s official as reported in The Straits Times.

However, given Singapore’s land constraints and limited capacity in producing SAF, the levy – which would go to a fund to procure the fuel – would be suitable for the country, said Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist.

On Oct 14, the Singapore Parliament passed a Bill to impose a fixed levy on all departing flights from 2026 to support airlines’ use of SAF. The target is for SAF to constitute one per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, with the goal raised to three to five per cent by 2030.

Preliminary estimates from the authorities are that economy-class passengers may incur an additional S$3 levy for short-haul flights, S$6 for medium-haul flights and S$16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel_SAF.webp,N,,2025-10-27 12:03:13.593446

Besides Horizon, lead recipients of the grants, made under the Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technology (INSAT) programme, include Flying Whales, Certification Center Canada (3C), BioFlight Fuels and Thales.

Horizon-led Project CRYSTAL, which also involves 3C and the University of Toronto, is intended to develop an all-weather propulsion system for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) applications.

In its first phase, this will analyse the “viability of implementing advanced anti-icing, de-icing, and ice detection technologies” – including ice-phobic and electrothermal coating solutions developed by the University of Toronto – onto eVTOL aircraft.

A follow-on phase, supported by 3C, will “focus on testing and analysing the viability of the technologies on the Cavorite X7”, Horizon says.

Horizon will receive C$2 million in grants towards the total C$10.5 million project.

Capable of accommodating six passengers and one pilot on routes of up to 430nm (800km), the hybrid-electric Cavorite X7 uses an innovative system of electric-powered fans in the wings and canard to achieve vertical lift. Forward propulsion comes from a single pusher-configured propeller driven by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 thermal engine.

Horizon is targeting certification and service entry for the Cavorite X7 by the end of the decade.

Also included in the latest round of INSAT initiatives – the programme’s third – are trials of sustainable aviation fuel, the development of ground testing infrastructure for new propulsion systems, and flight-control technology for the Flying Whales LCA60T cargo airship.

This will see the Canadian arms of French firms Flying Whales and Thales work together to develop the flight-control, avionics, and electrical-distribution systems for the LCA60T.

“These systems are essential for operations, particularly while hovering for the load exchange operations,” the project abstract states.

Ground testing and demonstrations on a simulator will raise the systems to technology readiness level (TRL) 7 by the end of the project. First flight of the LCA60T is scheduled for 2027.

Meanwhile, Thales Canada, eVTOL developer Jaunt Air Mobility Canada, and vertiport provider Vertiko Mobilite are to collaborate on new detect-and-avoid technologies for eVTOL aircraft and unmanned air vehicles.

By turning waste biomass into renewable diesel, biomethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and leaning on hydrogen production through advanced electrolyzers, this joint venture is all about cutting carbon and boosting energy diversity.

Key Details at a Glance

Partnership: Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), a leader in fuel cell technology and electrolysis; plus Edgewood Renewables, experts in biomass-to-fuels conversions.

Location: North Las Vegas, Nevada—home to about 274,000 people in the metro area and a hotspot for clean energy and industrial growth.

Feedstock: Local waste biomass—think farm leftovers, forestry scraps, and organic industrial byproducts.

Outputs: Renewable diesel, biomethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel tailored for trucking, aviation, and heavy industry craving low-carbon alternatives.

Timeline: Announced October 2025; groundbreaking slated for late 2025 once permits are in hand.

Objective: Ramp up domestic low-carbon fuel supply, meet soaring demand for zero-emission tech, and fortify U.S. energy security.

Inside the plant, Plug Power’s proprietary electrolyzer systems will produce green hydrogen on-site, which then reacts with biomass intermediates in a hydrotreating step. Over at Edgewood Renewables, they’ll deploy thermochemical magic—pyrolysis and gasification—to crack lignocellulosic material into bio-oils and syngas. Those building blocks get upgraded into drop-in fuels, clocking in at almost zero net carbon when paired with renewable hydrogen. You’ll see storage tanks for bio-oils, finished fuels, hydrogen compressors, and a control hub buzzing away, keeping an eye on all the numbers in real time.

Electrolyzers: Devices that split water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity, the backbone of low-carbon hydrogen production.

Waste Biomass Conversion: Turning agricultural and forest residues plus industrial organic waste into fuel precursors via pyrolysis, gasification, or biochemical routes.

Fuel Cell Systems: Though mainly known for powering forklifts and vehicles, these units could also help run the plant or serve as backup power—underscoring the versatility of modern hydrogen infrastructure.

You might say this project captures a larger trend: hydrogen developers are branching into liquid fuels to tap existing distribution channels and meet tougher emissions rules. For Plug Power, famous for its material-handling fuel cells and green hydrogen ambitions, this move signals a strategic leap into renewable diesel and SAF territories. And with Edgewood Renewables’ knack for sourcing feedstocks and squeezing out top-tier conversion yields, the partnership feels like a perfect match.

Historical Context

Looking back over the last ten years, America’s clean energy story morphed from a solar-and-wind spotlight to include advanced biofuels. Legislative nudges—like federal tax credits for clean hydrogen (Section 45V) and low-carbon fuel standards—have been the wind in this sector’s sails. Now, projects that blend industrial decarbonization with circular feedstocks are getting more stage time. Plug Power’s dive into liquid fuels mirrors global shifts where ammonia and SAF are sharing the limelight with green hydrogen.

On the money side, Nevada’s Renewable Portfolio Standard and federal incentives tied to carbon intensity reduction are key. While the exact investment numbers are under wraps, industry folks expect a hefty capital injection—likely a cocktail of private equity, debt financing, and government subsidies—to make this plant a reality.

Regional Context & Policy

Nevada’s got sunshine in spades, plus mature industrial zones and a permitting process that won’t drag on forever. North Las Vegas sits smack in the middle of manufacturing hubs and logistics routes, giving easy access to biomass feedstocks and major markets in California, Arizona, and Utah. And let’s not forget the Port of Los Angeles link—not only could these fuels power American fleets, they might even head overseas.

State and local authorities have rolled out the red carpet with tax breaks and speedy zoning approvals. Between airlines and trucking companies clamoring for renewable diesel and SAF, Nevada has become a landing pad for trailblazing waste-to-fuel facilities.

Impact & Outlook

Here’s what we’re looking at:

Hundreds of construction and permanent operations jobs in Clark County.

Major cuts in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil diesel and jet fuel.

Lower particulate and NOx emissions in urban areas, thanks to cleaner-burning renewable diesel and SAF.

Stronger energy security through domestically produced drop-in fuels.

A beefed-up regional hydrogen infrastructure and a more circular waste economy.

Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing. Keeping a steady biomass supply and managing logistics will be a juggling act. Nailing down long-term offtake deals with airlines and trucking firms is critical for financing. Plus, syncing electrolyzer output with biomass processors means the engineering team will need to be spot-on balancing hydrogen and bio-oil flow rates.

Comparative Outlook

Many U.S. efforts zero in on standalone green hydrogen, but this Plug Power–Edgewood Renewables setup is a bit different. By marrying hydrogen production with biomass conversion, it offers a hybrid model that could become a go-to playbook. Imagine fuelling heavy-duty fleets at stations equipped with both renewable diesel and hydrogen blends—if this plant hits its performance and cost milestones, similar projects could pop up in biomass-rich regions, turbocharging America’s shift to low-carbon liquid fuels.

About the Companies

Plug Power, founded in 1997 and trading on NASDAQ (PLUG), builds electrolyzers, liquid hydrogen solutions, fuel cell systems, and hydrogen infrastructure, with deployments spanning material handling, stationary power, and mobility. Edgewood Renewables specializes in designing, developing, and operating renewable fuel facilities, turning waste biomass into renewable diesel, biomethanol, and SAF, all while focusing on sustainable feedstock sourcing and cutting-edge conversion techniques.

As permitting and financing wrap up, everyone’s got their eyes peeled. The first barrels are slated to roll out in the second half of 2026, and if all goes to plan, this plant could set a new bar for U.S. low-carbon fuel production—bridging clean electricity, waste valorization, and conventional fuel supply chains.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/vegas.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 10:57:04.342386

In a statement published by the company following the ruling, TotalEnergies said that it “acknowledges the decision” of the court, but noted that the court rejected most of the claims brought against the company, including dismissing requests around a communication campaign linked to its name change from “Total” in 2021, and about the company’s promotion of gas as a less carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and of biofuel as a low-carbon alternative.
In its judgement, the courtfound that TotalEnergies committed deceptive commercial practices by making claims on its website about its “ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050” and “to be a major player in the energy transition,” which were likely to mislead consumers about the company’s environmental commitments.
In its statement, TotalEnergies highlighted that the judgement only focused on three paragraphs on the customer website of its French subsidiary, criticizing the company “for not having specified the scenario on which TotalEnergies’ multi-energy (oil, gas, electricity) transition strategy is based.” TotalEnergies said that it will not appeal the ruling, and that it will replace the paragraphs on its website with a more factual description of its accomplishments in the implementation of its multi-energy strategy.

The case, based on a lawsuit filed by Greenpeace France, Friends of the Earth France and Notre Affaire a Tous, and supported by environmental law organization ClientEarth in 2022, argued that TotalEnergies’ “reinvention” campaign, in which the company claimed to be “a major player in the energy transition,” and noted its 2050 net zero ambition, falsely portrayed the company as being on track to address the climate crisis.

In its judgement, the courtfound that TotalEnergies committed deceptive commercial practices by making claims on its website about its “ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050” and “to be a major player in the energy transition,” which were likely to mislead consumers about the company’s environmental commitments.

The court ordered the company to end communication from its website of the above statements, as well as claims such as “We place sustainable development at the heart of our strategy, our projects, and our operations to contribute to the well-being of populations…” and “More energy, fewer emissions: this is the dual challenge we must take on alongside our stakeholders to contribute to the sustainable development of the planet and address the climate challenge…,” giving the company one month to comply, after which it would be fined €10,000 per day.

At the same time, air freight flies in from Saudi Arabia, converging in time for the setup on the Miami waterfront.","A Formula 1 race may be decided in milliseconds, but the sport’s biggest challenge happens long before the lights go out – and long after the wheel-to-wheel action ends.

Behind every grand prix lies a logistical feat of global proportions: 24 races, 5 continents, 21 countries, and up to 1,200 metric tons of equipment per event in 2025 – with 3 triple-headers and 5 double-headers. From cars and pit garages to broadcast centers and hospitality suites, every piece must arrive precisely where and when it’s needed.

That’s where DHL comes in. As Official Logistics Partner of F1, we begin planning each season a year in advance – mapping out a mix of sea, air, and road freight to ensure everything is in place for the start of each race. This multimodal logistics solution also keeps costs in check and supports the sustainability goals of F1.

It’s a carefully choreographed symphony of movements across sea, air, and land – balancing speed, volume, cost, and sustainability. And it’s what makes the Race Behind the Race as extraordinary as the spectacle on track. Discover how it works, what the challenges are, and get the inside track on the logistics behind the 2025 F1 season.

We’re not lying when we say logistics is a complex world – and F1 logistics is a never-ending showcase of what complex, international logistics looks like. For every grand prix, hundreds of crates and containers move in parallel: some taking weeks on container ships, others jetting overnight in cargo planes, and more rolling over highways in 18-wheel trucks. The art is choosing the right mode for the right cargo, so that no matter where the race is held, everything is there on time.

Ocean freight

The slowest but most sustainable option, ocean freight carries the bulk of the load: garage structural kits, hospitality suites, fan zones – anything categorized as non-essential to on-track performance. To make it work, teams send five or six identical sets of containers on long rotations, leapfrogging around the globe. For example, sea freight dispatched to China might next appear in Miami, while another set continues from Japan to Singapore and Baku. It’s a global jigsaw that only fits together with meticulous planning.

Air freight

While ocean freight beats at a steady rhythm that keeps the system alive, air freight is the fast pulse that powers each leg of the calendar. Cars, engines, and other race-critical technology – as well as F1’s broadcast equipment – all travel by plane, because they are indispensable on race day and can’t be rotated or left behind. These shipments get absolute priority: the moment the checkered flag falls, critical gear is packed and loaded, often overnight, so that by 10 a.m. on Monday, most air freight has already departed for the next circuit. Without this constant air bridge, there would be no race the following Sunday.

Road freight

Overland transport is the third, vital piece to the puzzle – needed at every race to ferry ocean and air shipments from nearby sea and airports to the track. In Europe, the show moves largely on wheels in trucks, many of which run on biofuels, with freight traveling overland from team factories and regional hubs. Up to 400 trucks hit the road, many with two drivers per cab to keep them moving day and night. Whether they’re snaking their way through mountain passes or shuttling to and from the sea, their arrivals must be timed with precision.

Four crucial considerations guide every move:

Speed – Can the cargo reach its next destination on time?

Volume – Which items can we send by sea to reduce costs and emissions?

Cost – Can we combine modes to keep costs down?

Sustainability – Does our solution help Formula 1 move toward its 2030 Net Zero target?

Every choice carries trade-offs. And with double- and triple-header weekends, customs paperwork, and city-center circuits to contend with, the real challenge isn’t just moving freight – it’s keeping the whole season in motion. Read on to learn more.

Unique local conditions

Some circuits present logistical puzzles all of their own. Each venue requires tailor-made solutions, often in close collaboration with local authorities. Monaco’s streets, for example, are famously tight, leaving no space for convoys to enter the city at once. Instead, trucks must queue in holding bays outside town and are called in one by one, both before and after the race. Although only 500 kilometers separated the Imola Grand Prix from the Monaco Grand Prix, the logistical challenges of entering Monaco ultimately negate any transportation time savings. The Las Vegas Strip Circuit® presents a similar challenge. A special holding yard is created to avoid gridlock as hundreds of trucks deliver equipment in sequence to one of the world’s most iconic boulevards.

Customs complexities

Much of it may be digital nowadays, but the paperwork can still pile up. Every shipment must have precise documentation to clear customs – and sometimes multiple clearances are required before it can enter the country. The complexity and diversity are mindboggling, with fuel shipments clearing easily in one country and requiring special approval in another. In some regions, even the seemingly simple components require special import/export documents that aren’t necessary elsewhere.

External disruptions

Global events can throw even the most detailed plans off course. During the COVID-19 pandemic, three teams were caught in a web of ocean freight delays ahead of the Australian Grand Prix. It took a DHL team of 100 people working around the clock and three dedicated DHL air freighters to ensure all 150 tons of cargo arrived on time. Regional conflicts have also reshaped routes. For example, many sea carriers avoid the Suez Canal – a vital shipping lane near several F1 tracks. Ocean freight for races in the Middle East is rerouted through the port of Jeddah and then trucked to the circuits. Flexibility becomes as critical as speed.

Sustainability

And then there’s the challenge of reducing emissions in a sport that never stands still. Formula 1 has committed to becoming Net Zero by 2030, and DHL is working to help them achieve it – introducing biofueled trucks in Europe, more efficient Boeing 777 aircraft, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for F1’s charter flights. Each step reduces the footprint, but the task remains immense for a race calendar spanning five continents.

Whether it’s navigating customs forms, city-center circuits, or shifting geopolitical landscapes, the world stage keeps every season unpredictable. Yet the mission stays the same: deliver every piece of cargo, on time and in full, so the race can go on.

From Australia to Asia

The season begins in Melbourne, marking the first big logistics test after pre-season testing in Bahrain. With the season’s longest transit times and biggest time zone shift, a global team works around the clock to manage and monitor multiple modes of freight transport. As soon as the checkered flag falls, equipment is packed overnight, and much of it is already in transit to China by Monday morning. Multiple kits are prepared for pre-planned sea shipments to Singapore, Canada, Qatar, and back to Europe.

The first triple header

After China, we move the show to Japan for the first of three triple headers this season – where things get interesting. Air freight from China to Japan is relatively painless, and equipment is shipped by sea in advance from Europe to Bahrain via the port of Jeddah. But there isn’t enough time to truck equipment from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia, so F1’s broadcast items – about 65 tons worth – are leapfrogged from Japan directly by air. Three separate sets of sea freight are also underway to make it all work.

Crossing the globe

Next comes Miami, a major test of multimodal coordination. Sea containers travel from Asia to the U.S. West Coast, then are trucked across the country to Florida in just three days. At the same time, air freight flies in from Saudi Arabia, converging in time for the setup on the Miami waterfront.

The European stretch

Summer in Europe means back-to-back racing and long convoys of trucks. From Imola to Monaco to Barcelona, fleets of up to 400 vehicles move in sequence, often with two drivers per cab to keep them running around the clock. Monaco remains the most delicate operation, with trucks entering one by one into the city’s narrow streets. By the time the paddock reaches Spain, extra crews are drafted in to relieve staff who have been on the road for weeks.

North America and beyond

After Europe, the championship hops over to Canada, where containers arrive by sea from Europe and by road from Miami, while one-kit equipment flies in directly from Barcelona. The Canadian circuit’s island setting on the St. Lawrence River makes space tight, so arrivals and departures are timed with pitstop precision. Later in the year, the calendar shifts to the Americas again, with back-to-back races in Austin and Mexico City – each requiring a different mix of road, air, and sea to overcome customs complexity and border security.

The final push

The closing stretch is as demanding as the start. Brazil, Las Vegas, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi complete the 24-race season. Las Vegas, with its Saturday night race, creates a unique advantage – giving freight just enough time to make the 8,000-mile journey across ten time zones to Qatar by Tuesday morning and ready for the next racing weekend. From there, the season concludes in Abu Dhabi, with sea freight converging from multiple regions for the twilight finale.

By the time the last container is unpacked, preparations for the next season are already under way. With so little downtime, Formula 1 logistics never truly stops – it simply resets for another lap around the globe.",https://www.dhl.com/content/dam/dhl/global/delivered/images/social-share-1200x630/g212-dl-annual-logistics-review2.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 10:57:11.124284

LanzaTech Global Inc. has formalised a new amended version of its agreements with the investors of its subsidiary LanzaJet Inc., which specialises in the production of sustainable aviation fuel. These changes aim to accelerate the commercial rollout of the fuel while adjusting governance and ownership conditions.

The revised agreements introduce a two-tranche share distribution structure, conditional upon achieving development milestones at the Freedom Pines site located in the state of Georgia. If an initial public offering or sale of LanzaJet occurs before LanzaTech receives the full share tranches, its stake will automatically increase to 50% without further financial contribution.

Licence contract extended to 2031

In parallel, the 2020 technology licensing agreement between the two companies has been extended to 31 December 2031. The amendment removes LanzaTech’s right to terminate the contract and imposes an obligation to transfer the licence directly to LanzaJet. It also lifts previous restrictions on sublicensing LanzaJet’s technology to third parties, broadening its commercial application.

This development comes as LanzaJet continues to rely on the Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process, which uses industrial waste converted into ethanol as feedstock. The technology was originally developed by LanzaTech and later improved by LanzaJet.

Strengthened integration strategy

With this restructuring, LanzaTech consolidates its position as the core technology provider while increasing its influence over LanzaJet’s strategic direction. This dual role enables the company to align growth with both technological control and shareholder value creation.

The carrier allocated 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) attributes to the flight through a recognized chain-of-custody system without requiring an equivalent physical uplift. The framework relies on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and on Book & Claim principles. The technical option combines mass balance (accounting allocation within a single infrastructure) and individual certificates for customers. The referenced product is Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) from used cooking oils, backed by internationally recognized certification schemes.

Accounting architecture and control requirements

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recognizes chain-of-custody models compatible with auditable Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV). Mass balance allows fossil and sustainable volumes to be co-processed and attributes to be allocated at the infrastructure outlet while avoiding double counting. Book & Claim decouples the purchase of attributes from uplift, useful at airports without a physical SAF supply chain. Compliance requires retention of allocation evidence, certificate uniqueness, and temporal matching between production, purchase, and claim.

The “50% SAF” claim corresponds to attribute coverage of the flight’s energy needs rather than an identical molecular content in the tank. This approach is designed to create a verifiable demand signal without waiting for high on-site blend availability. Contracts typically include documented traceability, anti-double-counting provisions, and delivery schedules for attributes. Corporate customers integrate these certificates into their Scope 3 Category 6, subject to alignment with their inventory frameworks.

SAF economics and price structure

The unit cost of SAF remains multiple times higher than Jet-A, with a premium driven by supply scarcity, HEFA feedstock costs, and biorefinery capital amortization. Airlines spread the premium through dedicated surcharges, client pricing grids, and certificate programs while limiting exposure via adjustable attribute volumes. Price volatility reflects the gap between rising blending mandates and the cadence of industrial commissioning. Storage, dosing, and certification infrastructure at airports influences the spread between the accounting cost of attributes and the operational cost of a physical uplift.

The announced domestic capacity plan targets premium reduction through feedstock proximity and public incentives. Envisaged feedstocks include used cooking oils and animal fats, with competitive sourcing at urban and regional scale. Bankability rests on staged offtake contracts, performance guarantees, and continuous lot certification. The ramp-up will determine the share of physical uplifts achievable on regional and international routes.

Regional competition and hub positioning

Within the region, Ethiopian Mineral Corp and Sunbird Bioenergy Africa are developing an Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) biofuels complex aiming for blends up to 10% with dedicated agricultural inputs. This trajectory exerts competitive pressure on attracting offtakes and capital, as well as on the ability to supply exportable attributes. Prior cooperation with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines supports technical and documentary standardization, useful for aggregating international corporate demand. The African Airlines Association (AFRAA) facilitates the diffusion of common practices on compliance and quality.

Hub positioning will depend on three factors: pace of securing permits and fiscal incentives, feedstock procurement, and the signing of logistics agreements with key airports. Fueling and storage operators will be central to shifting from a predominantly attribute-based model to a hybrid model with significant uplift. Airlines will seek to minimize operational frictions by harmonizing certification procedures across platforms.

Operational indicators for demand and revenues

The 50% attribute test serves as a measurable proxy for customers seeking verifiable reductions. Book & Claim programs enable monetization of attributes independently of local uplift, creating a distinct and recurring revenue line. Corporate segments with high interregional travel intensity prioritize certificates compatible with their inventories and non-financial reporting. Spreads between attribute pricing and uplift costs guide purchasing tactics, with baskets mixing spot contracts and term commitments.

The most observed contracting policy is modular offtakes indexed to capacity ramp-up and industrial performance milestones. Common clauses cover lot quality, certificate validity, anti-double-counting safeguards, and limited transferability. Airports with dosing and dedicated storage units obtain shorter approval cycles for blends, conditioning expansion to higher physical percentages. The cost trajectory remains sensitive to public decisions on taxes, subsidies, and guarantees.

Kenya Airways has operated its first intra-African flight using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a milestone that places the national carrier among the continent’s early adopters of renewable jet fuel technology. The Nairobi–Cape Town flight, completed under the SkyTeam Aviation Challenge 2025, used a 50 per cent blend of SAF attributes verified through global certification schemes. It marks a significant move by the airline to reduce its carbon footprint and aligns with international efforts to achieve net zero emissions in aviation by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and captured carbon combined with green hydrogen. When produced through Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, it can reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 85 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

The flight, operated under a mass balance system, represents not only a technical demonstration but a signal that Africa’s aviation industry is beginning to confront its share of the global climate challenge.

According to industry analysts, aviation accounts for around 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions but remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that Sustainable Aviation Fuel will deliver up to 65 per cent of the total emissions reduction needed for the industry to reach net zero by mid-century. Kenya Airways’ experiment is therefore less about symbolism and more about testing feasibility within the constraints of African energy markets and infrastructure.

The flight carried a blend of optimism and pragmatism. Kenya Airways said the SAF attributes were verified under globally recognized certification frameworks to ensure traceability and transparency.

Onboard, the airline introduced a series of low-waste initiatives, including upcycled blanket bags, reusable cutlery, and locally sourced Kenyan coffee and tea served in reusable cups. Cabin crew also engaged passengers in discussions on responsible travel practices, an approach that turns sustainability from a back-office metric into a visible in-flight experience.

Hellen Mwariri, Kenya Airways’ Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, described the initiative as evidence of what can be achieved when innovation is paired with collaboration. “This flight shows what can be achieved through partnership and creativity,” she said. “It’s a step towards practical solutions that reduce our impact while keeping operations efficient.”

Behind this optimism lies a set of economic and policy questions. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still prohibitively expensive, costing between two and four times more than conventional jet fuel. In an industry already constrained by thin profit margins and high operational costs, this price gap poses a serious challenge to adoption.

Analysts note that while airlines in Europe and North America benefit from government incentives and clear blending mandates, African carriers face fragmented policy environments, limited refining capacity and weak investment pipelines for renewable fuel production.

Kenya Airways’ move could, however, catalyze regional interest in domestic production. The airline has confirmed ongoing work with government agencies, local innovators and international partners, including IATA, SkyTeam and the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), to establish a local SAF production plant in Kenya by 2026. If successful, such a facility would position Kenya as an East African hub for low-carbon aviation fuel and potentially lower costs through local supply chains.

The global race toward SAF production capacity underscores this ambition. By 2024, the United States and the European Union had jointly accounted for nearly 90 per cent of global SAF output, thanks to a combination of blending mandates and fiscal incentives. Africa, despite being rich in bio-feedstock such as jatropha, camelina and waste oils, contributes less than 1 per cent.

Establishing local production in Kenya could therefore have multiplier effects: stimulating green manufacturing, supporting circular economy models through waste valorization, and reducing dependence on imported petroleum products that strain foreign exchange reserves.

From a sustainability standpoint, the broader challenge lies in scalability. Even at 50 per cent blending, a full network transition would require millions of litres annually. Kenya Airways alone consumed about 700 million litres of jet fuel before the pandemic, meaning that sustained decarbonisation will depend on both fuel availability and supportive regulation. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which mandates airlines to offset emissions on international routes, provides a framework but relies heavily on the development of alternative fuels to meet its long-term goals.

The symbolic value of Kenya Airways’ flight extends beyond corporate sustainability. It demonstrates how African airlines can use sustainability as a competitive asset, attracting environmentally conscious travellers and international partners. It also aligns with Kenya’s national climate agenda, which targets a 32 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero by 2050. In a continent where aviation supports millions of jobs, from tourism and horticulture to logistics, decarbonizing flight operations is both an environmental and economic imperative.

Practical sustainability will depend on continued collaboration between airlines, refineries, policymakers and financiers. Experts argue that regional alliances, such as between Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, could generate economies of scale to justify local refining and research investment.

Beyond environmental benefits, the emergence of a regional SAF supply chain could anchor new industries in waste processing, biofuel refining and logistics sectors with clear employment potential.

Kenya Airways’ milestone is a pragmatic demonstration of what transition can look like when driven by domestic initiative rather than external pressure. The flight does not resolve the cost problem, nor does it eliminate emissions overnight. But it offers a credible test case, one that moves the conversation from ambition to practice, and from pledges to proof.",https://orepulse.com/storage/uploads/CwzE9OwiTsxzSjhEkdosySRhLcxk3w7lsmLPqpAT.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 07:56:10.711958

According to Airbus, airlines will require 43,420 new aircraft deliveries between now and 2044. Of these, around 44% will replace older aircraft that are less fuel-efficient and more expensive to operate. The manufacturer estimates that 18,900 aircraft will retire during this period. This balance marks a structural shift in the economics of fleet management: renewal has become as important as expansion.

A mature cycle of growth

Passenger traffic is forecast to rise by 3.6% annually through 2044, and air cargo by 3.3%. These figures represent a stabilised, long-term trajectory for the industry, suggesting sustained global demand without the volatility of previous decades.

The drivers behind this steady growth remain familiar. Airbus expects world GDP to grow by 2.5% a year, global trade to grow by 2.6%, and the middle-class population to increase by 1.5 billion people. Together, these trends underpin both passenger mobility and trade flows.

But what is changing is how airlines plan to serve this demand. Fleet replacement cycles are accelerating as operators pursue lower unit costs and compliance with new environmental standards. The emphasis is shifting from capacity expansion to efficiency and asset utilisation.

Freighter modernisation

The cargo segment illustrates this transformation clearly. Airbus forecasts a 45% increase in the dedicated freighter fleet by 2044, bringing the total to 3,420 aircraft worldwide. The composition of that growth, however, signals a different kind of expansion. Of the 2,605 additional freighters expected to enter service, 1,670 will be passenger-to-freighter conversions (P2F), while 935 will be new-build aircraft such as the A350F, A330P2F, and A321P2F.

The predominance of conversions indicates a pragmatic approach to growth. By extending the operational life of passenger aircraft, airlines and lessors can expand cargo capacity while limiting capital expenditure and manufacturing emissions.

Airbus projects that Asia-Pacific and North America will together account for almost two-thirds of total freighter demand—about 850 and 920 aircraft, respectively— but much of that capacity will transit through or connect with Middle Eastern hubs.

The Middle East’s strategic position

The GMF highlights the Middle East as a pivotal region in the evolving air-cargo map. Traffic between Asia and the Middle East is expected to grow at 5.3% per year, while intra-Middle East traffic will increase by 5.2%, among the fastest-rising corridors globally.

This projection reinforces the region’s established role as a logistics and connectivity hub. Carriers such as Emirates SkyCargo, Qatar Airways Cargo, Etihad Cargo, and Saudia Cargo already operate some of the youngest and most efficient fleets in the world. Their strategies combine new-build freighter acquisitions with conversion programmes and digital modernisation.

As trade patterns diversify, with manufacturing growth in economies such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil, the Gulf’s location between Asia, Europe, and Africa will continue to provide a competitive advantage. Airbus’s outlook suggests that the Middle East will not only remain a transit centre but also evolve as a regional base for fleet renewal and conversion activities, supported by local MRO capabilities and SAF infrastructure.

Efficiency as the organising principle

Airbus positions fleet modernisation as the most effective short-term pathway to reducing emissions. The company estimates that replacing older aircraft with newer models can reduce fuel burn per seat-kilometre by up to 25%. Since 1990, the industry has reduced fuel consumption per passenger-kilometre by 54%, mainly through advances in aerodynamics, materials, and propulsion.

All Airbus aircraft currently in production can operate with a 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend, to reach 100% SAF capability by 2030. New-generation models, such as the A220, A320neo, A330neo, A350, and A350F, offer between 20% and 40% lower fuel burn than the aircraft they replace.

This improvement in operational efficiency is the main reason why renewal now outweighs expansion. For airlines, newer aircraft reduce fuel and maintenance costs, extend range, and improve carbon-intensity metrics, which are increasingly tied to investor and regulatory scrutiny.

Technology and investment

The GMF also links fleet transformation to sustained investment in innovation. Airbus reports €2.7 billion in research and development spending in 2024, focused mainly on propulsion and aerodynamic efficiency, digital operations, and lifecycle sustainability.

Longer-term projects include the ZEROe hydrogen propulsion demonstrator, which explores hydrogen fuel cells as a future energy source, and hybrid-electric propulsion, aimed at achieving a further 5% fuel saving compared to standard configurations.

At the end of the aircraft lifecycle, Airbus’s Life Cycle Services facility in China has achieved a 91% recycling rate during dismantling, evidence of growing attention to material recovery and circularity within the industry.

The financial logic of sustainability

The GMF frames sustainability not as a separate agenda but as an economic imperative. Fuel efficiency directly influences airline profitability, and regulatory costs related to carbon emissions are expected to rise steadily. In this context, the transition to newer aircraft is both an environmental and financial strategy.

For aircraft manufacturers, this translates into a long-term replacement market. For airlines, it provides measurable reductions in operating cost and exposure to fuel-price volatility. For investors and lessors, it enhances asset value by improving residual performance and conversion potential.

Airbus estimates that 34% of the global in-service fleet already consists of the latest-generation aircraft. The priority for the coming decade is to replace the remaining two-thirds. This process represents the sector’s most immediate opportunity for emissions reduction.

A balanced outlook

The 2025 GMF also reflects a more disciplined optimism than earlier forecasts. The industry’s projected growth is significant but not speculative. It incorporates disruptions such as trade tariffs, energy-price volatility, and policy transitions.

The underlying assumption is that global air transport demand will continue to align with moderate GDP and trade expansion, supported by population growth and urbanisation.

For airlines, the challenge will be maintaining profitability amid heavy capital investment. The shift toward more sustainable fleets requires substantial funding and infrastructure adaptation, particularly in SAF supply and distribution. However, the GMF implies that these investments are economically justified by the operational savings they deliver.

Implications for the Middle East

For Middle Eastern aviation, Airbus’s projections confirm a long-term advantage rooted in geography and strategy. Regional carriers are already aligned with the forecast’s two main trends: fleet modernisation and cargo diversification. The region’s airports and logistics networks are positioned to capture increased flows between emerging manufacturing centres in Asia and consumer markets in Europe and Africa.

As national aviation strategies under Saudi Vision 2030 and the UAE’s long-term transport frameworks emphasise logistics, sustainability, and connectivity, Airbus’s outlook provides data-based support for these priorities. The transition to newer, more efficient fleets is not only environmentally necessary but also commercially sound. For the Middle East, the outlook reinforces a continuing role as a bridge in global aviation. Geographically central, commercially active, and strategically positioned to lead in both fleet renewal and cargo modernisation. The following two decades will not be about recovering lost ground but about rebuilding the foundations of aviation efficiency. Airbus’ forecast confirms that growth will continue, but it will be measured more in terms of performance than volume.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/27/airbus_a380_on_the_ground-1.png,N,,2025-10-27 05:56:33.955953

The introduction of ‘Established on RNP (EoR)’ as the concept is widely referred to enabling aircraft landing at Stockholm Arlanda to fly with curved approaches to a greater extent than before.

The new approach concept allows the airport to increase the landing rate per hour and reduce emissions, both for aircraft flying the shorter, curved approach and for those flying the standard instrument landing approach. This is because fewer aircraft have to use the runway dedicated for arrivals, therefore reducing queues.

“The modernisation of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation,” said Anna Granberg, Director of Operations at Luftfartsverket. She explained that with the new approach traffic flow into Arlanda will be more efficient during peak hours, while arriving aircraft have shorter flight paths with reduced emissions.

“We are very pleased with the initiative from Swedavia and the Swedish Air Traffic Control Provider (LFV) to implement new procedures that will increase the number of curved approaches ((RNP AR- Required Navigation Performance, Authorization Required) at Arlanda,” noted Charlotte Holmbergh, Country Director Corporate Affairs at Norwegian.

She added that shorter approaches result in lower fuel burn and lower emissions. “Our goal is to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 and more efficient flight operations like this are among our top priorities,” she said.

According to regulatory data, the sustainable fuel market has witnessed rapid growth, rising from $175.41 billion in 2024 to $196.04 billion in 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8 percent. Experts attribute this expansion to accelerated industrialization, growing urbanization, the global shift toward renewable energy, increasing demand for biofuels, and rising overall energy consumption.

Analysts forecast that the sector will maintain strong momentum, growing at a 12.3 percent CAGR in the coming years. This growth, they say, is being driven by environmental concerns linked to fossil fuels, rising transportation fuel demand, the global focus on cutting carbon emissions, and the growth of electric vehicles, supported by favorable government policies and regulations.

Emerging trends expected to shape the future of the industry include carbon capture technologies, improved eco-friendly fuel sourcing methods, next-generation biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, and waste-to-fuel innovations.

In Nigeria, efforts are underway to align with this global shift. Managing Director of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Olubunmi Kuku, emphasized the need for collaboration among aviation stakeholders to reduce logistics costs and improve nationwide fuel supply.

Kuku said FAAN is upgrading infrastructure to enhance efficiency in the supply chain.

She stated, “Setting up more fuel farms across airports will make logistics easier, cut costs, and improve air connectivity across the country.”

She also reaffirmed FAAN’s commitment to maintaining safety standards through its Quality Assurance framework, which ensures international best practices in fuel storage, handling, and delivery. Kuku added that the authority plans to expand airside access, upgrade storage facilities, and support innovation in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through partnerships with private marketers.

“FAAN is ready to play its part in building a stronger, cleaner, and more resilient aviation fuel ecosystem in Nigeria,” she said.

Meanwhile, Engr. Peter Dia, General Manager of Operations at Octavus Petroleum Limited, expressed concern over the shortage of skilled technical personnel in the aviation fueling sector. He urged regulators in both the aviation and petroleum industries to ensure that operators possess adequate technical expertise.

“There are marketers in this business today who shouldn’t be here,” Dia remarked, pointing out that Nigeria lacks a local standard for jet fuel. He explained that while Nigeria’s crude oil is suitable for aviation fuel, jet fuel (Jet A1) must go through the proper refining and certification processes before it is safe for use.

He further noted that the aviation fuel business is capital-intensive, citing that a new 45,000-liter Bowser costs around ₦1 billion, and stressed the importance of regulatory checks on the financial stability of fuel marketers.

Dia also criticized the lack of fueling infrastructure planning in many Nigerian airports. “Airports are being designed without involving fuel marketers, which is why some new terminals don’t have fuel hydrants,” he said.

Jet A1 market to grow through 2030-Ex-FAAN MD

The Group Managing Director of CITA Energies, Dr Thomas Ogungbangbe, has echoed the frustration of aviation fuel marketers, stressing that despite the expectations, the reality experienced by aviation fuel marketers since Dangote’s refinery commission has been far more complex and constrained.

According to him, dependence on imports continues as 40% of Jet-A1 is still, saying that although production has begun, a steady domestic supply of aviation-grade Jet A-1 has been slower than expected.

Speaking at a colloquium at the weekend with the theme, “Aviation Fuel Business in Nigeria – The Scenario and the Metaphor, Ogungbangbe said that while the refinery has the installed capacity to produce aviation fuel, the practical rollout of refined Jet A-1 into the domestic market has been slower and more restrictive than anticipated.

On the current reality, he disclosed that Jet A-1 from the Dangote Refinery is not yet cheaper than imported alternatives, noting that the refinery sells in U.S. dollars, aligning prices with global benchmarks.

He hinted that the expected cost relief for airlines and marketers has not materialised, with airlines continuing to face high operational costs.

He further lamented that marketers have limited direct access to jet fuel supply, with distribution still structured through controlled offtake agreements.

The broader market implication, according to him, is that independent and smaller aviation marketers remain dependent on intermediaries or imports.

As Foreign Exchange exposure persists, he said, because the refinery prices are in US dollars, aviation fuel marketers must still source foreign exchange, defeating the earlier expectation of Naira-based transactions, alleging that airlines and marketers still rely partly on imported products to bridge shortfalls.

His words, “Uncertainty in pricing and market operations discourages long-term planning. As the refinery seeks to recoup its investment, it maintains export-oriented pricing, limiting domestic price advantage. Local consumers, including aviation, are yet to feel the economic relief anticipated.”

Speaking further of the quality of aviation fuel in the country, the CITA chief expressed grave concerns about the mislabeling of kerosene as Jet A1.

He lamented that the situation poses serious risks, including engine failure, thermal instability, and contamination, pointing out that enforcing certification and traceability protocols at every supply chain stage is vital to prevent such occurrences.

The rise of modular refineries, he further stated, presents challenges in consistently meeting DEF STAN 91-91 and ASTM D1655 standards, saying success depends on thorough quality control, third-party certification, and alignment with global testing protocols.

“While major marketers such as TotalEnergies, MRS, and CITA Energies maintain ISO-certified QA systems, traceability is fragmented due to manual processes. A digital platform linking refineries, depots, and airlines would enhance real-time visibility and accountability. Establishing Joint Quality Audit Committees with representatives from refineries, marketers, NCAA, and airlines is critical for regular quality reviews and ensuring industry-wide standards.”

He, however, disclosed that Nigeria offers some of the lowest Jet A1 prices in West Africa, influenced largely by Dangote Refinery’s impact and local supply efficiencies rather than competitive market forces alone.

“Although claims of marketer collusion are anecdotal, oligopolistic behaviour exists due to high barriers to entry. Expanding refining capacity and encouraging new market entrants can foster competition. A public pricing template detailing cost components such as crude, refining, logistics, forex rate, and margins would build trust between airlines and marketers.”

Ogungbangbe stated that the evolution of aviation fuel in Nigeria mirrors the nation’s own journey — from dependency to determination, from challenges to change, saying that the advent of indigenous refineries may redefine the supply chain, but noted that it is, “Our collective vision, collaboration, and integrity that will define the future.”

Air transport specialist and a former Managing Director of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Dr Richard Aisuebeogun, posited that passenger traffic in Nigeria continues to rise, driven by connectivity, tourism, infrastructure investment, and economic diversification.

He stated that the Jet A-1 market is projected to grow steadily through 2030, underpinned by domestic refining, infrastructure reforms, and regulatory consistency.

To secure the future of Nigeria’s aviation fueling industry, Aisuebeogun said the country must pursue three key pathways, such as investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable energy innovations, strengthening standards, enforcement, audits and encouragement of joint ventures, shared infrastructure, and bulk procurement for stability and fair competition.

New focus - IRENA chief Francesco La Camera said COP30 in Brazil will likely feature new global targets for sustainable biofuels, Reuters reported. He suggested the summit could include a pledge to quadruple biofuel production by 2035 or set a share target for sustainable aviation fuel. But an analysis earlier this month showed that biofuels emit 16% more CO2 than the fossil fuels they replace once the effects of deforestation, soil degradation, and land-use change are accounted for.

Climate warning - Asian civil society groups have urged Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to stop backing fossil fuels and align with regional climate goals at the 3rd Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) Summit in Kuala Lumpur. In a joint statement signed by 36 organisations, campaigners said AZEC must become a genuine platform for accelerating the region’s energy transition, not a vehicle to prolong fossil fuels. They criticised Japan’s support for ammonia co-firing, hydrogen blending, and carbon capture, warning such projects delay renewables and lock Asia into high-carbon dependence. The groups called on Japan to redirect finance toward community-based clean energy and help unlock Southeast Asia’s 99% untapped renewable potential. Launched in 2023 by Japan, AZEC is a platform for cooperation towards net zero emissions in Asia, however, experts warn its gas-heavy focus risks locking Southeast Asian nations into costly and volatile fossil fuel pathways.

First close - Astarte Capital Partners and Toesca Asset Management have reached a first close of $100 mln for their new regenerative agriculture fund, which will invest primarily in permanent crops through a mix of greenfield and operating assets. The vehicle, which was launched in Q4 2024, was seeding with $45 mln from both firms. With an overall $350 mln fundraising target and an IRR goal of 17%, Toesca Permanent Crops II aims to promote sustainable land use and soil health by owning and managing farmland under regenerative practices, with around 70% of capital expected to go toward developing new projects and 30% into existing operations. The firms said they are looking into the contribution soil carbon credits can make to the fund's financial returns, but this has not been factored into the strategy's target returns. The fund has attracted institutional investors from Europe, North America, Australia, and Chile, reflecting growing global appetite for farmland and nature-based investments that align financial returns with environmental outcomes. Roughly 80% of the fund will be deployed in Chile, with Peru accounting for 20%. (Agri Investor)

The thirtieth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is scheduled to take place from November 10-21 in Belem, Brazil.

This pivotal international summit will gather world leaders, policymakers, scientists, and civil society representatives to address the pressing global challenge of climate change.

COP30 theme

A key objective of COP30 will be for participating nations to present updated National Climate Commitments, often referred to as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

These NDCs outline each country’s plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change, reflecting their highest possible ambition.

The summit will provide a crucial platform for countries to demonstrate their progress since previous conferences and to commit to more ambitious targets in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement, particularly the aim of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels.

Furthermore, COP30 will involve a comprehensive assessment of the progress made on renewable energy targets that were established at prior summits.

This includes evaluating the deployment of renewable energy technologies, the development of supportive policies, and the mobilisation of financing for a global transition away from fossil fuels.

Biofuel pledge

La Camera expects a biofuel pledge to be included in the final declaration, possibly as a target to quadruple production by 2035 or to establish a specific share for sustainable aviation fuel within the overall energy mix, according to a Reuters report.

“I think there will be more focus on the social aspect of the transition and also on the sustainable use of biomass,” La Camera was quoted in the report as saying on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week event.

IRENA has launched an agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization to promote biofuel manufacturing. This initiative follows the preparation of a biofuel report by the agency for the conference.

La Camera announced that the upcoming conference would be dedicated to exploring and facilitating community involvement in renewable energy initiatives.

The focus will be on developing strategies and frameworks that empower local communities to actively participate in the planning, development, and implementation of sustainable energy projects.

La Camera further announced that IRENA now anticipates a reduced deficit in renewable energy installations by 2030, attributing this to the quicker rate of new additions.

The projected shortfall for global renewable capacity by 2030, in relation to the COP28 target of 11.2 terawatts, has decreased to 0.9 terawatts. This marks an improvement over last year’s projection of a 1.49 terawatt shortfall.

At the 2023 COP28 climate summit in Dubai, over 100 nations committed to tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 to help achieve global climate goals.

According to a recent IRENA report, meeting this 2030 target necessitates an annual growth rate of 16.6% from 2025 onwards.

Also speaking, General Manager, Operations, Octavus Petroleum Limited, Engr. Peter Dia has raised concerns on the quality of technical personnel in aviation fuelling space.

He stressed the need for regulators of aviation fuel business in both aviation and petroleum sectors to have adequate knowledge on what should be done to ensure products quality and safety assurance.

“There are fuel marketers today who have no business being in this business,” he said, stating that there is no local standard for jet fuel.

“Our crude oil in Nigeria is the right crude but kerosene is only called Jet A1 after it has gone through the right processes to be called Jet A1. It has to be given a refinery certificate of quality even if it comes from a refinery,” he said.

Dia however, note that jet fuel marketing business is expensive and requires serious minded people. He said one brand new 45 litre capacity Bowser costs about N1 billion and that there are filters in Bowsers that eliminate water from the fuel and make them safe for aircraft.

He recommended that the financial health of aviation fuel marketers should be checked by regulators.

He also frowned at the absence of fuelling infrastructure at the planning stage of airports that were established and the failure to involve aviation fuel stakeholders.

“The airports in Nigeria are being planned without fuel marketers’ involvement. That is why we have new terminals today without fuel hydrants,” he said.

Also speaking, Regional Manager, Lagos & West Africa, Ibom Air Limited, Mr. Martin Abhulimen called on aviation fuel marketers in Nigeria to help the local airlines by championing their collaborative negotiations of jet fuel prices.

He noted that jet fuel price hike that occurred between 2023 and 2024 significantly affected airline business and that impact of the occurrence could not be passed on to air travelers.

He said fuel hedging would have been an option as is done in other climes but that because of volatility of the environment, hedging does not work in Nigeria.

He therefore recommended collaboration of airlines in their negotiation with jet fuel marketers so as to get more favourable price bargain.

He noted that infrastructure had posed a bigger challenge to airlines at secondary airports in Nigeria.",https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/23210606/aviation-fuel.png,N,,2025-10-27 03:56:43.806293

KOTA KINABALU: More than 2,000 kilogrammes of used cooking oil (UCO) were successfully collected through the Used Cooking Oil Collection Competition involving 13 schools across Kota Kinabalu.

The competition was part of the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities’ (KPK) efforts to foster civic awareness and sustainable practices among students regarding the proper management of used cooking oil and its potential as a raw material for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

At the closing ceremony held at Horizon Hotel, Kota Kinabalu, Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities, Datuk Chan Foong Hin, presented prizes to the winning schools.

In the primary school category, SJKC Chung Hwa Likas emerged champion with a collection of 420 kilogrammes, followed by SK St. Francis Convent as first runner-up with 192 kilogrammes, and SK Kepayan in third place with 170.85 kilogrammes. For the secondary school category, SMK SANZAC claimed the top spot with 392.5 kilogrammes, while SM Tshung Tsin and SMJK Shan Tao shared the runner-up position with 113.5 kilogrammes each.

The achievement reflects a high level of environmental awareness among students and school communities regarding the importance of managing used cooking oil responsibly. Active participation from students, teachers and parents played a crucial role in the programme’s success.

In his speech, Chan expressed his appreciation to all participating schools, as well as the key implementing partners — Kota Kinabalu City Hall (DBKK) and JCI Kota Kinabalu, for their commitment and collaboration in making the inaugural initiative a success in Sabah.

“The success of collecting over 2,000 kilogrammes of used cooking oil in just two months proves that environmental education and awareness at the school level can have a major impact on the community. This is not merely a recycling activity but a shared commitment to supporting the nation’s transition towards sustainable energy,” he said.

He added that used cooking oil now holds growing economic value, particularly as a key feedstock for producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), in line with the National Agri-Commodity Policy 2030 (DAKN2030) which emphasises the development of high value-added and low-carbon agri-commodities.

According to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), total UCO collection in Sabah in 2024 was around 5,200 tonnes — less than 1.5 per cent of Malaysia’s overall total of 380,000 tonnes during the same period. Initiatives such as this competition are therefore expected to serve as catalysts for increasing UCO collection rates in Sabah.

Chan also called on more stakeholders, including other schools, non-governmental organisations and local communities, to take part in the initiative for better UCO management. He said this effort not only generates additional income for households but also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution.

“Interested schools may contact my office for coordination with DBKK and licensed UCO collection vendors such as Arus Oil to ensure proper and safe collection processes. Programmes like this prove that small actions at the community level can make a big difference to the nation’s sustainable energy future. Let us strengthen the culture of recycling for the well-being of the people and the sustainability of our planet,” he added.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d65831_acbd0eb45f2040de9d7aaed32790048e~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1080,h_720,al_c/d65831_acbd0eb45f2040de9d7aaed32790048e~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-10-27 03:56:48.711773

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is typically made from agricultural waste such as sugarcane, tallow, canola and cooking oils and can reduce emissions from aircraft by 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

But the UNSW project deploys an electrolyser that uses low-cost metals, carbon catalysts and renewable energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into fuel precursors.

The approach could cut out the need for farm waste and make environmentally friendly fuel easier to produce at scale, project leader Rahman Daiyan said.

“Most of the work so far has been on bio-based sustainable aviation fuel projects,” he said.

“But those sort of biomass resources are limited to some extent.”

The Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program, established by the Federal Education Department, has awarded the UNSW research team an additional $1.2 million to scale up its technology.

While the electrolyser has been proven to work in a lab, Dr Daiyan said a validated prototype would be ready within six to nine months and the project would be commercialised with industry partners Tjindu Power and Chinese energy firm Chuangqi Times.

If successful, the project could help realise Australian ambitions to become a green fuel exporter, he said.

“One of the best aspects of this technology is that it allows us to leverage Australia’s potential — we want to be a hydrogen exporter or a low-carbon fuel exporter,” Dr Daiyan said.

“There is domestic demand but there is also overseas demand because apart from Singapore and Malaysia, there are not a lot of places to make SAF for the Asia Pacific region.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered to be one of the leading ways to reduce carbon emission from air travel and is in high demand worldwide after major airlines committed to using the fuel to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

A report by the CSIRO and aircraft maker Boeing, released last year, found Australia could lead the world in production of the sustainable fuel but warned it had made only moderate progress so far.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We have been clear that airport expansion will only go ahead if it aligns with our legal obligations on climate change, including net zero.""","The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) said government support for airport growth poses serious risks to meeting the legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

In a new report, the committee said that relying on emerging technologies like sustainable aviation fuel is not enough to ensure the aviation sector meets its carbon reduction goals.

Toby Perkins, chairman of the EAC, said: ""The aviation industry is critically important to the UK, but it’s also one of the hardest sectors of our economy to decarbonise.

""Meeting our decarbonisation targets is already a major challenge. Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder.""

He warned: ""Under the government’s existing Jet Zero Strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.""

The committee also said the government has not provided evidence that the economic benefits of airport expansion outweigh the environmental and climate costs.

Recent approvals and ongoing projects at major airports include plans for a third runway at Heathrow, routine use of a second runway at Gatwick, and capacity increases at Manchester, Stansted and Luton.

In April, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander approved plans to nearly double capacity at Luton Airport, including a terminal extension and a new terminal.

The EAC said these decisions appear to be moving forward without updated economic analysis or a revised Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which dates back to 2018.

The committee called on the Government to demonstrate how it will meet its climate and nature targets if it continues to support large-scale airport expansion.

The ruling, which focused on TotalEnergies’ statements about its carbon neutrality ambitions, ordered the company’s French affiliate to remove three paragraphs from its customer-facing website. The court found that the removed content failed to reference the internal energy transition scenario underpinning TotalEnergies’ multi-energy strategy.

However, the court rejected key allegations concerning TotalEnergies’ 2021 rebranding campaign and broader communications about the role of natural gas and biofuels in the energy transition—both central themes in the company’s strategy. No advertising by TotalEnergies or its affiliates was condemned, contrary to some earlier media reports.

TotalEnergies said it will not appeal the ruling, adding that it plans to replace the removed paragraphs with factual updates highlighting its progress in implementing its multi-energy strategy. The company reiterated its view that the decision confirms the overall integrity of its public communications.

The French energy major also used the occasion to spotlight its domestic and global investments in low-carbon energy. Since 2020, TotalEnergies has invested more than €20 billion worldwide—including €4 billion in France—across renewables, biofuels, electricity, and EV charging. It now operates 32 GW of gross installed renewable capacity and produces 50 TWh of electricity annually, equivalent to about fifteen nuclear reactors.

In France, the company has built a 2 GW renewables portfolio spanning 430 wind and solar projects, serves 4.2 million electricity and gas customers, and leads the motorway EV charging market with nearly 1,900 fast chargers. It has also invested close to €1 billion in two biorefineries producing biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, while developing 117 agrivoltaic projects totaling almost 2 GW.

Globally, TotalEnergies said it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions from its operated oil and gas facilities by 36% since 2015 and cut methane emissions by 55% since 2020.

The court’s decision comes amid mounting scrutiny of oil and gas companies’ climate claims in Europe, where regulators and environmental groups have targeted corporate “greenwashing” in advertising and investor communications. In recent years, TotalEnergies and its peers have faced lawsuits seeking to challenge the credibility of their net-zero and transition strategies.

Despite ongoing criticism, TotalEnergies defended its record, emphasizing that it continues to balance energy security, affordability, and decarbonization goals. “Regardless of those who accuse us of greenwashing, we are proud to make every effort to serve our customers every day and to help build the energy system of tomorrow,” the company stated.

Vamsi Krishna Undavalli, Jerry Hamilton and Chuming Wei, all doctoral students studying mechanical engineering, earned second prize of the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Aviation Award and received a total of $150,000 from the $1 million prize pool for all nine winners.

The International Civil Aviation Organization and the General Civil Aviation Authority of the United Arab Emirates collaborate to organize this award open to states, organizations and individuals, with the goal of “recognizing their contribution to the success of the aviation industry.”

“This is a rigorous selection that happens with the jury committee and the technical evaluation committee,” Undavalli said. ”It’s not just students; the competition is open to researchers across the world.”

Undavalli, Hamilton and Wei said they sought to create more sustainable testing methods for aviation fuels. Hamilton focused on testing for fuel compatibility with different mechanical portions of the engine, Wei studied how emerging fuels performed under thermal stress, and Undavalli focused on the emissions and how to reduce them.

“A company who is developing fuels has all the different solutions they made, but they don’t have the money to invest in every single one,” Hamilton said. “This kind of pipeline and this kind of testing allows them to do a more inexpensive initial testing to choose which would be the best pathway to go.”

Hamilton said that Wei’s “very delicate heating and measuring process” for thermal stability tests was one of the most significant challenges of the research.

“My test is a little bit different than theirs because some data they cannot measure,” Wei said. “I’m using a new method where I take some samples of the fuel outside to measure what’s happening inside. No one has done that before.”

Another challenge the group said they faced was replicating the conditions of a real aircraft at a much smaller scale. They started with combustion test rigs for lab testing.

“Now we are venturing into a high-altitude emission test bench where we are trying to replicate what would happen at 40,000 feet,” Undavalli said.

Hamilton’s 20 years of past experience flying helicopters for the military contributed to the researchers’ real-world perspective.

“We were looking for ways throughout this whole process to inject a more realistic testing of what would actually happen from the time the fuel enters the tank, until it’s combusted, until the products are actually in the atmosphere,” Hamilton said.

The researchers said they believe that their tests could be the standard for the aviation industry and that they hope to see their research applied to real-world performances of aviation fuels.

“We created what maybe could be a preliminary benchmark before doing certification processes where much of the large fuel producers can come and avail this research and the test protocols, and eventually use this to better refine their fuel chemistry,” Undavalli said.

They said the global recognition they received has validated their hard work and is motivating them to pursue their goals even further.

“I spent a lot of time to design my experiment, and it always has a lot of problems and improvements that sometimes drive me crazy,” Wei said. “This award has really encouraged me for what I’ve been doing so far, and it’s really helped me to move further.”",https://thecrimsonwhite.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot_26-10-2025_22851_snoflow.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com_.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 23:56:10.538739

The revelation has led to Nationals Senator Matt Canavan warning plane travel will be only for the “very, very rich” in the future.

The airline industry has been working toward streamlining passenger check-ins and comfortable cabins, but major changes are also on the horizon for the cost of air travel.

Last week, the International Air Transport Association’s world sustainability symposium in Hong Kong heard travellers could pay an extra $1,350 on average for a plane ticket by 2050.

This equates to an approximate ticket increase of $54 year on year.

The hike is based on the need for 7000 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants across the world to produce the required levels for airlines, which is estimated to cost $7.23 trillion, or $268 billion per year.

At the moment, only about two million metric tonnes of SAF are being produced annually - a fraction of the almost 500 million tonnes needed by 2050, according to The Australian.

Mr Canavan highlighted the $1,350 jump in prices over the next two decades in a post on X.

“Under net zero plane travel would be reserved for the very, very rich,” Mr Canavan wrote.

IATA chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said the sooner costs rise ""the better” as the increase would be spread over 25 years, rather than an ever-shortening window of time leading up to 2050.

“When are we going to see it? I can’t really say when (but) I hope soon, because if soon, it means that we will get fuel to buy and that will be great. And we also just must,” Dr Owens Thomsen said.

Dr Owens Thomsen said airlines would benefit from SAF, which would also be required by the shipping sector under net zero mandates.

“Should (governments) be looking at subsidising SAF? Yes, absolutely, that is 100 per cent what everybody should do, but then the burden falls on the taxpayer,” she said.

“However, we the world as a whole subsidised the creation of the two new energy markets that were wind and solar. Why did the world collectively think that it was right to use taxpayers’ money to support those energy markets but somehow thinks that it’s not right to do that in this energy market?”

The vehicles were run by electrofuel, a type of eco-friendly fuel which could compete with batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs).

These are dominating automotive markets as campaigns against global warming intensify.

Thailand is heavily promoting EVs and batteries, but as production of electrofuel on a commercial scale is not so far off, the government should pay more heed to this fuel, including it in plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector.

EV sales, which are doing well here, are not a complete solution to air pollution. It is hardly possible to electrify all types of vehicles, especially large-sized buses, trucks and ships which usually travel on long-haul routes. These bus and trucks are often fueled by diesel.

Electrofuel might solve this problem.

Widely known as ""e-fuel"", electrofuel is a type of synthetic fuel created by using electricity from renewable sources to combine hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce synthetic hydrocarbon fuel.

In other words, we are making oil that can fit internal combustion engine-powered cars without the need to make changes to car engines.

The recent Expo in Osaka was the first time in Japan that e-fuel was tested in commercial vehicles.

The shuttle buses took people between the Umekita Green Place Bus Terminal in Osaka and Yumeshima Island, offering a direct service to the Expo site for six months after the event started on April 13.

E-fuel producer ENEOS Corporation collected data from fuel usage, with an aim to produce it on a commercial scale at its factory in Yokohama.

It is a promising carbon-neutral fuel because, though synthetic oil-powered cars emit carbon dioxide, the process to make this fuel requires the need to capture carbon dioxide to blend with hydrogen. One result is there is no additional carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere.

Thailand set a new target to strike a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and absorption by 2050, 15 years sooner than its original goal. To cut carbon dioxide emissions, authorities support the use of various biofuels, including gasohol, a mix of gasoline and sugar cane-derived ethanol; biodiesel, which is made by blending diesel with palm-based methyl ester; and lately sustainable aviation fuel, a biofuel for aircraft made from used cooking oil.

But they have yet to introduce e-fuel to truck and bus operators.

The National Electric Vehicle Policy Committee wants to convert some trucks and buses in the country to EVs. Under its ""30@30"" policy, the panel expects EVs to represent at least 30% of total auto production by 2030, comprising 34,000 electric buses and trucks, 725,000 zero-emission cars and 675,000 electric motorcycles.

During the first eight months of this year, newly registered electric trucks increased by 67% year-on-year to 265 units, up from 158 units, while electric buses fell by 62% to 89 units, down from 237 units, says the Department of Land Transport.

This shows electric mobility technology is less popular among buses and trucks than battery EVs in the passenger car category, with new registrations soaring by 55% to 77,036 units, up from 49,641 units, during the same period.

The figures appear to pave the way for the government to start considering making e-fuel another alternative fuel for buses and trucks, though some pain points of synthetic hydrocarbon production must be addressed.

According to experts, e-fuel is more expensive than battery EVs.

The former has estimated cost of between US$0.30 and 0.50 per kilometre, compared with a range from $0.05-0.10/km for the latter. It is evident e-fuel has low efficiency and high production cost.

One reason behind these obstacles is e-fuel involves a complex production process. Manufacturers first need to use electricity made from renewable energy to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen.

They must use technology to capture carbon dioxide.

A last step is to combine hydrogen and carbon to make synthetic hydrocarbon by using the electrolysis technology.

Chaiwat Kovavisarach, chief executive and president of energy conglomerate Bangchak Corporation, is aware e-fuel is pricey, about four times as costly as fossil-derived fuels.

Yet he believes the synthetic hydrocarbon business has a potential to grow in the future.

Bangchak earlier announced it is seeking partners to conduct e-fuel research and development in a move to replace fossil-derived fuels.

The company does not want to do R&D from scratch but prefers to join hands with energy firms to speed up work in this field, said Mr Chaiwat.

Bangchak is planning to have its own research centre to facilitate the development of e-fuel projects.

The company will spend part of its US$30-milion budget, allocated for new businesses and innovation, to fund the construction, said Mr Chaiwat.

It also plans to ask for financial support from the Office of National Higher Education, Science Research and Innovation to help translate its research facility project into action.

Bangchak has decided to make a crucial move in the fuel business. Will the government follow suit, at least by taking e-fuel development into more serious consideration?",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/10/27/5828237_700.png,N,,2025-10-26 19:56:24.104576

When SmartLynx Australia began operating flights between Sydney and Lord Howe Island on behalf of Qantas in April 2025, it marked more than just a new service. The move reflects the airline’s broader commitment to regional connectivity, operational excellence, and flexibility — three pillars that define its mission in the evolving Australian aviation landscape.

Regional aviation remains a key focus

In October 2024, Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW) awarded SmartLynx Australia the Sydney–Lord Howe Island route license, a service previously operated by Qantas for over three decades. The license covers a five-year period, confirming SmartLynx Australia’s role as a long-term operator on this vital regional route.

Formerly known as Skytrans, the airline brings extensive experience in regional and remote aviation, as well as proven expertise with Dash 8 aircraft, which have long been synonymous with Lord Howe Island operations.

SmartLynx Australia remains firmly committed to regional aviation and turboprop operations, continuing to invest in its Dash 8 fleet and maintenance capabilities to ensure reliability for regional communities. The company also supports other regional carriers facing capacity challenges or ageing fleets, helping to maintain essential air connectivity across the country.

Reliability through continuous effort

Operating regional flights in Australia presents unique challenges, from unpredictable weather to remote destinations and technical constraints. Consistency requires ongoing dedication and performance management.

“The SmartLynx Australia team has been working hard to improve performance across all metrics, and over the last six months, the results are starting to show the impact of that dedication,” said Gytis Gumuliauskas, CEO and Managing Director of SmartLynx Australia.

According to recent data, in August 2025, SmartLynx Australia achieved 89.7% on-time arrivals and 92.9% on-time departures across its scheduled network, with cancellation rates below 2%.

“We see these results as a reassurance not just to passengers but also to airlines looking at options for extending their capacity,” Gumuliauskas added.

Bringing ACMI to Australia

SmartLynx Australia is also expanding its operations into the ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance) leasing sector, offering airlines flexible capacity solutions. This model allows carriers to add aircraft and crew during peak periods, cover maintenance downtime, or test new routes without investing in permanent fleet expansion.

As part of the Avia Solutions Group, the world’s largest ACMI provider, SmartLynx Australia leverages global expertise and infrastructure to deliver high-quality, scalable services. The company’s fleet — now including Airbus A319 aircraft alongside 10 Dash 8s — enables it to balance regional operations with ACMI capacity in Australia and the wider Asia-Pacific region.

For Gumuliauskas, the company’s growth strategy strengthens rather than shifts its original mission. “The rebrand from Skytrans to SmartLynx Australia and expanding our service offering with ACMI is about strengthening our current RPT and charter services, not replacing them. We are here to support the entire Australian and Asia-Pacific markets when capacity is needed. That is exactly what being part of the Avia Solutions Group enables us to do,” he said.

With sporting bodies riding a wave of record-breaking media rights revenues, urgent investment is needed in high-quality, durable carbon removal solutions, finds Stockholm-based impact firm Milkywire’s The Climate Cost of Growth in Sport report, which outlines how expansion strategies – like increasing the number of games and hosting tournaments across multiple continents – are driving significant rises in Scope 3 emissions, particularly from team and fan travel.

FIFA’s upcoming 2026 World Cup, for instance, is projected to generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, a staggering 400% increase over previous editions due to its 48-team format and sprawling North American footprint.

Despite public sustainability commitments, most governing bodies fall short on actual delivery. FIFA for example, which claims to aim for net zero by 2040, failed to meet its carbon neutrality pledge for Qatar 2022.

Only durable carbon removal can credibly offset fossil fuel emissions, the report stresses, yet most offsetting programmes rely on low-quality or short-lived credits, undermining public trust and actual climate impact.

Formula One and E, both popular across Asia, are also spotlighted. Formula One has made progress in cutting emissions through remote operations and sustainable aviation fuel, the report notes, but it omits fan travel from its carbon accounting. Formula E, despite including spectator emissions, still relies on offsets misaligned with the scale and duration of its fossil fuel emissions.

Asian sports markets, particularly cricket in India, football in Japan and South Korea, and growing Olympic aspirations across Southeast Asia, the report points out, are likely to replicate the expansionary trends observed in Western sports events and venues.

As a timely blueprint, the report suggests, the industry should dedicate a portion of its growing revenues ( 1% to 2% ) to verified, long-duration carbon removal, publish transparent Scope 3 emissions inventories ( including fan travel ) and restructure scheduling to minimize travel intensity.

While “big games have led to big emissions”, the report concludes, there is still time on the clock for the sports industry to win on climate. Asia’s sporting authorities and owners also have the opportunity to break away from the same high-emission playbook and set a new standard for sustainable competition.

The analysis, which has been established as setting the baseline for EU SAF monitoring, provides the first comprehensive review of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) activity across the bloc. Initial data on Sustainable Aviation Fuel supply, emissions savings and investment trends across European Union States are comprehensively provided within the new EASA analysis, signalling a crucial step toward meeting upcoming blending mandates.

Baseline Established and Leaders Identified

The report, which covers data from 2024, has established that year as the definitive baseline for tracking progress toward the mandatory ReFuelEU Aviation blending targets. Crucially, it was noted that only about 0.6% of the aviation fuel supplied throughout 2024 was represented by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The feasibility of meeting the subsequent 2030 target of 6% was assessed and it was indicated that this goal could be reached under optimistic production scenarios.

Significantly, five Member States were identified as the current leaders in SAF production, with commercial-scale output already being undertaken. These nations—Finland, France, Germany, Spain and Italy—are shouldering the majority of the European Union’s initial capacity for low-carbon aviation. Much of the current European Union Sustainable Aviation Fuel supply is accounted for by specific, large-scale facilities across these leading countries. These production hubs include Neste’s Porvoo refinery in Finland, TotalEnergies’ facilities at La Mède and Grandpuits in France, BP’s Lingen refinery in Germany, Repsol’s refineries in Spain and Eni’s new 400 kt-per-year Gela biorefinery in Italy.

Continued Development Across the European Bloc

While a large share of the current supply is concentrated in Finland, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, development continues to be recorded across other Member States. For example, a joint EU-funded study on regional production potential is currently being conducted by Estonia and Latvia. Furthermore, their first large-scale SAF plants are actively being built by Poland’s Orlen and Romania’s OMV, showing a commitment to future capacity. Policy initiatives are also being advanced; Ireland’s first national policy roadmap, for instance, was published in August 2025. In terms of offtake, agreements have been secured by Luxembourg’s Cargolux and Lux-Airport with Norsk e-Fuel. However, the report also noted a lack of current domestic capacity, as Malta, Lithuania and Slovenia currently report having none.

Market Shifts and Production Projections

The market outlook for Sustainable Aviation Fuel capacity growth was also detailed. EASA projects that the total European Union output could reach between 1.4 and 5.9 million tonnes by 2030, a range which is dependent on various factors such as overall buildout rates and the progress of investment. However, a significant area of concern was also identified: synthetic fuel projects. These initiatives were reported to remain behind schedule, with no facilities having yet reached the final investment decision stage.

The status of global investment was highlighted as an active and dynamic issue. In one example since the close of the summer, a $150 million investment fund for Sustainable Aviation Fuel was announced through a major airline partnership. Conversely, a major European project was recently scrapped when Shell closed a planned facility that would have been one of the continent’s largest processing centres. This decision was attributed to the necessity of balancing affordability with customer demands in the volatile fuels market.

Commission’s Confident Outlook on Future Targets

In light of the recent plant closure, confidence was expressed by the European Commission regarding the bloc’s ability to reach its mandated 2034 SAF targets. European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen told AVweb that the Commission remained confident in achieving the goals.

The spokesperson stated that, based on announced investments, projections showed that Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in the European Union was expected to reach the mandated SAF targets until 2034. Furthermore, it was noted that SAF producers and airlines were being encouraged by the Commission to produce and purchase SAF over and above the targets, respectively. Several measures were stated to be available for bridging the price gap between SAF and conventional aviation fuel. It was announced that the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, which is slated for adoption in the Autumn, would aim to further facilitate long-term SAF offtake agreements.

Itkonen also conveyed that the Commission was keeping a close watch on the fuels market as its development is attempted in accordance with ReFuelEU plans. Crucially, it was stressed that transparency for airlines on the price of SAF and the establishment of a competitive liquid SAF market would be key to incentivising airlines to buy SAF above the targets. The foundational contributions from Finland, France, Germany, Spain and Italy are seen as central to establishing the necessary industrial base for the European Union to meet these critical future Sustainable Aviation Fuel objectives.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and captured carbon combined with green hydrogen.
Kenya Airways’ experiment is therefore less about symbolism and more about testing feasibility within the constraints of African energy markets and infrastructure.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still prohibitively expensive, costing between two and four times more than conventional jet fuel.
Experts argue that regional alliances, such as between Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, could generate economies of scale to justify local refining and research investment.","Kenya Airways has operated its first intra-African flight using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a milestone that places the national carrier among the continent’s early adopters of renewable jet fuel technology. The Nairobi–Cape Town flight, completed under the SkyTeam Aviation Challenge 2025, used a 50 per cent blend of SAF attributes verified through global certification schemes. It marks a significant move by the airline to reduce its carbon footprint and aligns with international efforts to achieve net zero emissions in aviation by 2050.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and captured carbon combined with green hydrogen. When produced through Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, it can reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 85 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

The flight, operated under a mass balance system, represents not only a technical demonstration but a signal that Africa’s aviation industry is beginning to confront its share of the global climate challenge.

According to industry analysts, aviation accounts for around 2.5 per cent of global carbon emissions but remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that Sustainable Aviation Fuel will deliver up to 65 per cent of the total emissions reduction needed for the industry to reach net zero by mid-century. Kenya Airways’ experiment is therefore less about symbolism and more about testing feasibility within the constraints of African energy markets and infrastructure.

The flight carried a blend of optimism and pragmatism. Kenya Airways said the SAF attributes were verified under globally recognized certification frameworks to ensure traceability and transparency.

Onboard, the airline introduced a series of low-waste initiatives, including upcycled blanket bags, reusable cutlery, and locally sourced Kenyan coffee and tea served in reusable cups. Cabin crew also engaged passengers in discussions on responsible travel practices, an approach that turns sustainability from a back-office metric into a visible in-flight experience.

Hellen Mwariri, Kenya Airways’ Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, described the initiative as evidence of what can be achieved when innovation is paired with collaboration. “This flight shows what can be achieved through partnership and creativity,” she said. “It’s a step towards practical solutions that reduce our impact while keeping operations efficient.”

Behind this optimism lies a set of economic and policy questions. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still prohibitively expensive, costing between two and four times more than conventional jet fuel. In an industry already constrained by thin profit margins and high operational costs, this price gap poses a serious challenge to adoption.

Analysts note that while airlines in Europe and North America benefit from government incentives and clear blending mandates, African carriers face fragmented policy environments, limited refining capacity and weak investment pipelines for renewable fuel production.

Kenya Airways’ move could, however, catalyze regional interest in domestic production. The airline has confirmed ongoing work with government agencies, local innovators and international partners, including IATA, SkyTeam and the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), to establish a local SAF production plant in Kenya by 2026. If successful, such a facility would position Kenya as an East African hub for low-carbon aviation fuel and potentially lower costs through local supply chains.

The global race toward SAF production capacity underscores this ambition. By 2024, the United States and the European Union had jointly accounted for nearly 90 per cent of global SAF output, thanks to a combination of blending mandates and fiscal incentives. Africa, despite being rich in bio-feedstock such as jatropha, camelina and waste oils, contributes less than 1 per cent.

Establishing local production in Kenya could therefore have multiplier effects: stimulating green manufacturing, supporting circular economy models through waste valorization, and reducing dependence on imported petroleum products that strain foreign exchange reserves.

From a sustainability standpoint, the broader challenge lies in scalability. Even at 50 per cent blending, a full network transition would require millions of litres annually. Kenya Airways alone consumed about 700 million litres of jet fuel before the pandemic, meaning that sustained decarbonisation will depend on both fuel availability and supportive regulation. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which mandates airlines to offset emissions on international routes, provides a framework but relies heavily on the development of alternative fuels to meet its long-term goals.

The symbolic value of Kenya Airways’ flight extends beyond corporate sustainability. It demonstrates how African airlines can use sustainability as a competitive asset, attracting environmentally conscious travellers and international partners. It also aligns with Kenya’s national climate agenda, which targets a 32 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and a long-term goal of net zero by 2050. In a continent where aviation supports millions of jobs, from tourism and horticulture to logistics, decarbonizing flight operations is both an environmental and economic imperative.

Practical sustainability will depend on continued collaboration between airlines, refineries, policymakers and financiers. Experts argue that regional alliances, such as between Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, could generate economies of scale to justify local refining and research investment.

Beyond environmental benefits, the emergence of a regional SAF supply chain could anchor new industries in waste processing, biofuel refining and logistics sectors with clear employment potential.

Kenya Airways’ milestone is a pragmatic demonstration of what transition can look like when driven by domestic initiative rather than external pressure. The flight does not resolve the cost problem, nor does it eliminate emissions overnight. But it offers a credible test case, one that moves the conversation from ambition to practice, and from pledges to proof.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1760686694733.jpeg,N,,2025-10-26 17:00:01.696659

The service, launching on May 13, 2026, will run daily through October 2, 2026, marking a strategic move to strengthen the airline’s presence across the Pacific Northwest.

This addition makes Portland the second Pacific Northwest destination that Alaska Airlines will serve directly from St. Louis. The airline already operates successful daily non-stop flights from St. Louis to Seattle, a route that has seen growing popularity among both leisure and business travelers.

A New Gateway Between the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest

The new St. Louis–Portland connection is more than just another flight—it’s a bridge between two vibrant regions known for their creativity, commerce, and outdoor adventure. Travelers will now have faster, more convenient access to Portland’s iconic food scene, arts culture, and nearby natural attractions such as Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge.

Meanwhile, the new route also strengthens St. Louis’s role as a rising Midwest hub. For residents of Missouri and surrounding states, the direct connection eliminates the need for layovers in larger hubs like Denver or Dallas, saving travelers hours and improving convenience.

Airport officials at St. Louis Lambert International hailed the announcement as a significant milestone in the city’s air network expansion. They emphasized that Alaska Airlines’ continued investment reflects strong demand from local passengers and growing interest in connecting St. Louis with key business and leisure destinations in the western United States.

Daily Nonstop Service to Launch in Spring 2026

Beginning in mid-May 2026, Alaska Airlines will operate daily non-stop flights between St. Louis and Portland. The service will be available seven days a week, catering to both business travelers seeking flexible schedules and leisure passengers planning vacations or weekend getaways.

While the detailed flight schedule and aircraft type have yet to be confirmed, industry observers expect Alaska Airlines to deploy one of its fuel-efficient Boeing 737 or Embraer E175 aircraft, both known for their comfort, reliability, and sustainability features.

With the growing emphasis on eco-friendly air travel, Alaska Airlines continues to invest in carbon reduction and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, making this expansion not just about connectivity but also about responsible growth.

Strengthening Alaska Airlines’ St. Louis Network

For Alaska Airlines, this new route represents a natural expansion strategy. The airline first entered the St. Louis market with its Seattle service, which quickly gained momentum thanks to increasing demand for West Coast connections.

By adding Portland to the map, Alaska Airlines is offering passengers greater flexibility and access to its extensive network across the Pacific Northwest, California, and even Alaska itself. From Portland, travelers can easily connect to destinations such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Anchorage, and Vancouver.

This expansion also positions St. Louis as a convenient connecting point for Midwest travelers heading westward. As Alaska Airlines continues to build partnerships through the oneworld alliance, including with American Airlines, travelers flying from Portland can enjoy seamless connections to cities across the Midwest, East Coast, and even international destinations.

Boost for Business and Tourism

The new route is expected to drive benefits on both ends. St. Louis businesses with clients and operations in Oregon—and vice versa—will gain a faster, more reliable travel option. The move aligns perfectly with the airline’s mission to connect regions that share strong economic and cultural ties.

Tourism officials in Missouri and Oregon are equally optimistic. St. Louis travelers heading west will find Portland an appealing destination known for its sustainability, craft breweries, outdoor recreation, and music festivals.

Repsol leads the €1.5 billion project, backed by EU funding, to deliver 200,000 tonnes of SAF yearly and cut aviation emissions by up to 90 per cent. Located in Axarquía, near Malaga’s airport, the facilities fall in line with Spain’s hydrogen strategy and promise economic growth and job creation.

Project details and timeline

Repsol, together with partners like Enagas, plans to build two 100 MW electrolysis plants in Malaga’s Axarquia region. Construction starts in 2026, with operations planned for 2029. The €1.5 billion investment, which includes €300 million from the EU Innovation Fund, supports Spain’s goal of 4 GW electrolysis capacity by 2030, as outlined in the PERTE plan.

What is SAF and how is it produced?

The plants will use electrolysis powered by renewable energy, primarily solar, to produce green hydrogen. The hydrogen is combined with captured CO₂ to create a kind of synthetic kerosene, a near-zero-emission fuel. The process achieves 85 per cent lifecycle greenhouse gas savings, according to IATA standards. Malaga’s 2,500 annual sunshine hours are hoped to cut power costs by 50 per cent, making the location ideal.

Environmental and economic benefits

Green hydrogen SAF could reduce aviation’s carbon footprint by 80 to 90 per cent, supporting the EU’s 6 per cent SAF mix demanded for 2030. Locally, it is said that the project will create 1,500 construction jobs and 300 permanent roles, increasing Malaga’s GDP by €200 million annually, according to an Andalusian impact study. This revitalises the region east of Malaga, hit by agricultural decline due to a series of severe droughts.

Challenges in scaling production

However, high costs and supply chain bottlenecks pose risks. Electrolysis equipment costs €1,200 per kW, with 20 per cent of components facing shortages. Grid upgrades are needed to handle renewable energy fluctuations and abrupt changes in power flow, which are said to have been behind the great power outage in Spain in April 2025. Yet, EU policies, like the €40 billion Hydrogen Bank, offset 40 per cent of costs, which will reduce private investment burdens.

Global context and airline impact

Malaga’s project follows other global precedents like California’s H2@Scale, with 15 SAF plants worldwide by 2024, per the IEA. Lower SAF prices, potentially €1.5 per litre by 2030, could drive airline adoption and meet rising demand projected at 17 billion litres.

Tewodros Getachew, CEO of EMC, and Richard Bennett, CEO of Sunbird Bioenergy Africa, emphasized the crucial role of government support in attracting private investment vital to Africa’s sustainable energy transition. Speaking at the event, Tewodros framed challenges such as climate change and sustainable development not as crises, but as calls to leadership and action. “Our vision is clear and unwavering: to transform Ethiopia into a beacon of green prosperity powered by clean energy, driven by a circular bioeconomy and innovation,” he said.

Drawing on EMC’s 18 years of experience, Tewodros noted that the corporation has been instrumental in the country’s wealth creation and is now aligning national goals with global sustainability objectives. The partnership with Sunbird Bioenergy Africa marks a significant step toward leveraging Ethiopia’s rich agricultural resources to produce clean energy.

Sunbird Bioenergy Africa brings extensive expertise in developing large-scale bioethanol and biofuel projects across the continent. Richard Bennett expressed strong confidence in Ethiopia’s market, attributing it to favorable policy frameworks. He thanked the Ethiopian government, ministries, and partners including the World Bank for fostering a conducive environment, highlighting key policies related to biofuels, blending obligations, and private sector participation.

“The existence of a raw material policy, biofuel blending mandates, and authorization of private investment has made it much easier for us to enter the market,” Bennett noted.

Sunbird’s business model integrates three core elements: an agricultural unit partnering with both large farms and small producers to ensure sustainable feedstock supply; a biorefinery converting agricultural raw materials into renewable fuels; and a fuel business focused on distribution.

The company is already the largest agricultural employer in Sierra Leone, operating a plant that produces 60 million liters of renewable fuel annually. In Zambia, Sunbird is developing a cassava-based biofuel project aimed at meeting 20% of the country’s petroleum demand. This initiative supports 500 direct jobs and 20,000 small-scale farmers.

Bennett explained that the model centers on replacing imported fuel paid for in foreign currency with locally produced alternatives: “Stop spending money in other countries. Buy from your local farmers.”

With EMC’s backing, bioenergy development in Ethiopia is gathering pace. The initial project phase will focus on converting cassava into ethanol. Cassava is favored due to its sustainability, suitability for smallholder farmers, and ability to maximize community involvement while minimizing carbon footprint.

The first phase aims to produce 60 million liters of ethanol annually, utilizing approximately 10,000 hectares of farmland and providing income for 10,000 farmers. This ethanol will meet E10 transportation fuel standards and growing demand for clean cooking fuel.

Highlighting the urgency of advancing the clean cooking sector, Bennett noted that despite established cookware factories backed by partners like Project Gaia, a shortage of local biofuels continues to constrain the market.

Bioethanol cooking fuel offers a sustainable alternative to charcoal, which remains a major contributor to urban air pollution and deforestation. Looking ahead, the partnership plans to conduct a feasibility study for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project designed to produce 40 million liters annually, supporting the aviation industry’s increasing need for renewable fuel blending.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Emc-Web.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:56:17.211456

Unlike prior models, it was also the first to feature only four cockpit windows.
Though there are only four cockpit windows, Boeing's design made each of them larger, which gives pilots ample visibility during operation.
Boeing had another reason to switch to four windows on the 787: These windows are heavy, and having fewer can cut back on weight.
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also contains a tucked away compartment in its design that includes basic sleeping accommodations for pilots on lengthier flights.","Since the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was revealed back in 2007, it has represented a few firsts in the aviation industry. It was the plane that Virgin Atlantic used for the first flight fully powered on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike prior models, it was also the first to feature only four cockpit windows.

This change was made possible because the Dreamliner uses composite carbon fiber-reinforced polymers in half of its construction, as opposed to relying mainly on aluminum like previous models. This material is more elastic and is also why the Boeing 787's wings can bend a lot further than you might think. While other commercial aircraft have incorporated this material in the past, the 787 included more of it than ever before.

Though there are only four cockpit windows, Boeing's design made each of them larger, which gives pilots ample visibility during operation. These windows on the flight deck feature several layers, including a gold film which defogs the glass and is similar to the system used in fighter jet canopies. Boeing had another reason to switch to four windows on the 787: These windows are heavy, and having fewer can cut back on weight.

The lack of additional cockpit windows on the Dreamliner is directly related to Boeing's desire to produce a more efficient passenger aircraft by reducing weight. This is also why the Boeing 787 doesn't have winglets. Jet fuel can comprise as much as 30% of an airlines operating budget. By designing an aircraft that is lighter, airline carriers can potentially use less fuel and reduce the costs of flights. Boeing was largely successful on this front, as the company claims that the 787 offers 20% greater fuel efficiency than comparable models.

Some iterations of the 787 can also fly farther than its 777 predecessors, although the latter can hold more passengers. According to Boeing, the Dreamliner has opened up an additional 425 nonstop routes across the globe that were previously unavailable. Instead of having larger planes that went to capitals or other central locations, the 787 allowed the company to instead travel to smaller airports with more direct flights and fewer passengers.

Pilots who have flown the 787 have noted that the aircraft does climb well due to the weight reduction measures. Others have commented that the 787's cockpit is exceptionally ergonomic, with fewer windows not being an issue at all. As retired British Airways Captain Michael Napier said via Key.Aero, ""The Dreamliner flight deck is a very comfortable working environment — it is quiet, and the large display screens make it feel uncluttered and very roomy.""

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner also contains a tucked away compartment in its design that includes basic sleeping accommodations for pilots on lengthier flights. One Dreamliner variant, the 787-9, is being used by Qantas to fly from Perth, Australia to London, England, which is a trip that lasts for 17 hours. Fortunately, the aircraft is equipped with a crew rest area, which provides a dedicated space for recuperation. It's even sometimes furnished with bedding from first-class.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/why-the-boeing-787-has-four-cockpit-windows-instead-of-six/l-intro-1761173206.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 08:56:23.321613

Achieving this goal will require the construction of thousands of clean-fuel plants, placing long-term financial pressure on both the aviation industry and travellers.
Sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF, is viewed as the most viable short-term solution, though global production remains low.
Only two million tonnes are produced annually compared to the 500 million tonnes needed.
The overall cost of reaching net zero in global aviation is projected to hit $7.2 trillion, which breaks down to $268 billion each year.","Airlines are targeting carbon neutrality by 2050, but the path to sustainability involves high costs that may be passed on to passengers. Industry estimates indicate the average plane ticket could rise by as much as $1,350 by mid-century, adding approximately $54 per passenger each year. Achieving this goal will require the construction of thousands of clean-fuel plants, placing long-term financial pressure on both the aviation industry and travellers.

There is currently a large gap between what is required and what is available. Sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF, is viewed as the most viable short-term solution, though global production remains low. Only two million tonnes are produced annually compared to the 500 million tonnes needed. Airlines are urging governments to subsidise SAF as they did for wind and solar energy.

The overall cost of reaching net zero in global aviation is projected to hit $7.2 trillion, which breaks down to $268 billion each year. Next-generation aircraft powered by electric or hydrogen energy face major challenges, especially for long-haul routes. Many in the industry now believe that aircraft in 2050 will resemble current models, but will instead run on cleaner fuels. Some airlines and manufacturers are prioritising enhancements to existing designs, particularly with longer, thinner wings to improve fuel efficiency.

The broader consequences are significant. Fare increases will vary across regions depending on factors like government support and how quickly technology is adopted. Although the transition will be complex, industry leaders agree it is necessary and ultimately positive, expanding travel opportunities and boosting economies, though likely at a higher cost to passengers.

Former Amazon employees have leveraged their experience at the e-commerce giant to build some of the most successful technology unicorns—companies valued at over $1 billion—spanning diverse industries from grocery delivery to enterprise software. Their Amazon DNA, characterized by customer obsession, operational excellence, and data-driven decision-making, has proven instrumental in creating transformative businesses. These are some startup unicorns founded by Amazon employees.

Instacart

Founded: 2012

Founder: Apoorva Mehta

Amazon Role: Supply Chain Engineer

Apoorva Mehta founded Instacart in 2012 after working as a supply chain engineer at Amazon. His experience with Amazon’s fulfillment operations proved invaluable when he identified a gap in the online grocery market. The inspiration struck when Mehta, staring at his empty refrigerator in his San Francisco apartment, realized that while consumers could order almost anything online, groceries remained stubbornly offline.

Before Instacart succeeded, Mehta had attempted 20 different startup ideas after leaving Amazon in 2010. His persistence finally paid off when he built the first version of the Instacart app in just three weeks. The company’s breakthrough came when Mehta missed the Y Combinator application deadline but managed to secure a meeting by using his own app to deliver a six-pack of beer to a Y Combinator partner—a creative move that earned him admission to the accelerator’s 2012 batch.

Instacart went public in September 2023 at a $9.9 billion valuation, transforming Mehta into a billionaire with a net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. The company now serves more than 14,000 U.S. cities and has delivered over 900 million orders since its founding.

Flipkart

Founded: 2008

Founders: Sachin Bansal, Binny Bansal

Amazon Role: Software engineers

Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal had both graduated from IIT Delhi, and had found themselves working at Amazon in Bangalore. At that point, they had an idea — Amazon didn’t yet operate in India, and the duo felt that they could build a similar service in the country. They quit their Amazon jobs and founded Flipkart in 2008. The followed Amazon’s playbook exactly — they started off with books, and slowly added other products. In 2014, Amazon finally began its operations in India, but it was too late — Flipkart by then was already a major player. The two companies slugged it out in India’s bruising e-commerce wars, and just as it seemed that Amazon was gaining the upper hand, Walmart swooped in and acquired Flipkart at a valuation of $21 billion. Both Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal exited Flipkart as billionaires, and Amazon continues to compete with Walmart-owned Flipkart in India’s e-commerce space to this day.

Twilio

Founded: 2008

Founder: Jeffery Lawson

Amazon Role: Product Manager for Amazon Web Services

Jeff Lawson co-founded Twilio in 2008 after spending time as one of the first product managers for Amazon Web Services (AWS). At Amazon, Lawson witnessed firsthand how offering infrastructure as a service could be transformative. “This whole idea that you can offer infrastructure as a service was kind of mind-blowing,” he told Forbes in a 2016 interview.

Lawson’s experience at Amazon profoundly shaped Twilio’s culture and operations. He imported critical practices from Amazon, including the focus on customer-first principles and the practice of writing long-form memos instead of relying on PowerPoint presentations for decision-making. These “write it down” practices became core to Twilio’s operational DNA.

Twilio went public in June 2016 in one of the year’s most successful tech IPOs, with shares surging 92% on the first day of trading. The company provides cloud-based communications infrastructure, enabling developers to embed voice, text, video, and other communications features into their applications through simple API calls. Lawson served as CEO until January 2024, building the company into a multi-billion dollar enterprise.

Quora

Founded: 2009

Founders: Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever

Amazon Role (Cheever): Software Engineer

Charlie Cheever co-founded Quora in June 2009 with fellow Facebook engineer Adam D’Angelo. Before Facebook, Cheever worked at Amazon after graduating from Harvard, where he had developed a database for fellow students to locate their classmates’ dormitories—a project that partially inspired Mark Zuckerberg’s FaceMash.

Quora was created to address a fundamental question: Why isn’t there a place on the internet where questions can be answered by people who actually know the answers? The platform distinguished itself through its commitment to quality, implementing strong moderation policies and attracting high-profile users who provided authoritative responses.

The platform officially launched in June 2010 and quickly became popular among the tech community, eventually achieving mainstream adoption. Quora reached unicorn status and continues to operate as a leading question-and-answer platform, with D’Angelo remaining as CEO. Cheever stepped back from day-to-day operations in 2012 to pursue other ventures, including co-founding Expo, a platform for mobile app development.

ThoughtSpot

Founded: 2012

Founder: Shashank Gupta (co-founder)

Amazon Role: Principal Engineer

Shashank Gupta co-founded ThoughtSpot in 2012 alongside six other co-founders, including Ajeet Singh (CEO). Gupta brought his search experience from both Amazon and Yahoo to help develop ThoughtSpot’s innovative natural language search over data feature, which allows users to query business data using simple search terms rather than complex SQL queries.

At Amazon, Gupta gained deep expertise in building large-scale systems and search infrastructure. He later used his automated data quality experience from Meta (Facebook) to inform ThoughtSpot’s approach to data observability and quality.

ThoughtSpot achieved unicorn status in 2018 when it raised $145 million in Series D funding at a valuation exceeding $1 billion. The company has since raised additional funding, reaching a $4.2 billion valuation. ThoughtSpot’s AI-powered analytics platform enables non-technical users to conduct self-service data analysis, democratizing access to business intelligence across organizations.

PagerDuty

Founded: 2009

Founders: Alex Solomon, Andrew Miklas, and Baskar Puvanathasan

Amazon Role: All three co-founders worked as software engineers at Amazon

PagerDuty was born from the founders’ direct experience with Amazon’s on-call culture. When Amazon shifted from a monolithic code base to a microservices architecture, engineers became responsible not just for writing code, but for deploying, managing, and fixing their systems in production. This meant carrying a pager and being on “pager duty” when issues arose—a practice that inspired the company’s name.

The three University of Waterloo graduates founded PagerDuty in Toronto in February 2009 after recognizing that other companies would need similar on-call management tools as they adopted DevOps practices. They initially bootstrapped the company with modest goals, joking that their dream was to reach $20,000 in monthly recurring revenue and retire to drink champagne on a beach.

After being accepted into Y Combinator on their fourth attempt, PagerDuty raised $1.9 million in seed funding in 2010. The company went public in April 2019 and now serves over 10,000 customers globally, including major enterprises. The platform has become essential infrastructure for IT operations teams managing digital services.

Notably, founder Alex Solomon demonstrated exceptional self-awareness by stepping down as CEO in 2016 to bring in Jennifer Tejada, recognizing that the company needed different leadership skills to scale to the next level.

Convoy

Founded: 2015

Founders: Dan Lewis and Grant Goodale

Amazon Role: Lewis was General Manager of New Shopping Experiences; Goodale was a software development manager

Dan Lewis and Grant Goodale left Amazon in 2015 to found Convoy, a digital freight brokerage startup aimed at disrupting the analog, fragmented trucking industry. Lewis had been responsible for Amazon’s shopping experience innovations, while Goodale managed software development teams.

The co-founders applied insights from Amazon’s logistics operations to create a platform that matched truck drivers with shippers through a mobile app, eliminating the need for phone calls and faxes. The vision was to reduce waste, increase capacity utilization, and improve earnings for truck drivers while lowering costs for shippers.

Convoy attracted heavyweight investors including Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Marc Benioff, and Al Gore, reaching a peak valuation of $3.8 billion in 2022. However, despite raising over $900 million in funding, the company faced challenges from a freight recession and the capital-intensive nature of the business. Convoy ceased operations in October 2023, with its assets acquired by Flexport for $16 million. The company’s story serves as a cautionary tale about timing and the challenges of achieving profitability in low-margin industries.

Workato

Founded: 2013

Founder: Dimitris Kogias (co-founder)

Dimitris Kogias co-founded Workato in December 2013 alongside Vijay Tella (CEO), Gautham Viswanathan, Harish Shetty, and Alexey Timanovskiy. The founding team had previously worked together at TIBCO Software, where they developed BusinessWorks, an integration platform that became the foundation for Workato.

Workato provides an enterprise automation platform that enables companies to integrate applications and automate business workflows. The platform combines integration platform as a service (iPaaS), robotic process automation, and business process automation capabilities, all wrapped in a low-code/no-code interface accessible to both IT and business teams.

The company achieved unicorn status and raised $200 million in January 2021 at a $5.7 billion valuation. Workato supports integration with over 1,000 applications and has become a leader in the enterprise automation space, serving businesses that need to connect their increasingly complex technology stacks.

Upwork: The Freelance Marketplace

Founded: 1998 (as Elance)

Founder: Srini Anumolu (co-founder)

Srini Anumolu co-founded Elance in 1998 with Beerud Sheth and Sanjay Noronha in a Jersey City apartment. While Anumolu’s specific role at Amazon is not well-documented, the company he helped create would eventually become one of the world’s largest freelance marketplaces.

Elance initially focused on fixed-price project work before merging with oDesk (founded in 2003) in 2013 to form Elance-oDesk. The combined entity was rebranded as Upwork in 2015. The platform connects businesses with freelancers across more than 5,000 skill categories, from software development to graphic design to writing.

Upwork went public in October 2018, raising $187 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. By 2017, the platform reported 14 million users across 180 countries with $1 billion in annual freelancer billings. The company has played a significant role in the growth of the gig economy, providing infrastructure that makes remote work more accessible and efficient.

BOOM Supersonic

Founded: 2014

Founder: Blake Scholl

Amazon Role: Software Engineer

Blake Scholl founded Boom Supersonic in 2014 with the goal of making high-speed travel mainstream and enabling a new world of human connection, starting his career at Amazon as a software engineer where he developed software for personalized and automated merchandising. By age 24, he was responsible for initiatives that generated $300 million in revenue.

After leaving Amazon, Scholl co-founded mobile technology startup Kima Labs, which was acquired by Groupon in 2012. His love of aviation and frustration at never having the chance to fly on the Concorde led him to pursue an ambitious dream: reviving supersonic commercial flight.

In 2025, Boom Technology became the first private American company to build a crewed plane that flies at supersonic speeds. The company is developing the Overture airliner, designed to fly at Mach 1.7 and carry passengers across oceans in half the time of conventional aircraft. With orders from United, American, and Japan Airlines, Scholl aims to make sustainable supersonic travel mainstream using 100% sustainable aviation fuel, targeting passenger flights by 2030.

Chronosphere

Founded: 2019

Founders: Martin Mao and Rob Skillington

Martin Mao, co-founder and CEO of Chronosphere, previously held roles at leading tech companies including Uber, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. He and co-founder Rob Skillington first met at Microsoft and later worked together at Uber, where they built M3, an open-source metrics engine that became the foundation for Chronosphere’s platform.

Chronosphere reached unicorn status in less than three years, announcing a $200 million Series C round in 2021 that propelled its valuation past $1 billion. The company later raised an additional $115 million in growth funding at a valuation of $1.6 billion.

Chronosphere provides cloud-native data observability software that helps companies using cloud-native architecture monitor their data. Reaching unicorn level with a team of only 80 people in just 2.3 years placed Chronosphere in the top 10 fastest B2B SaaS unicorns ever, according to Pitchbook.

Function of Beauty

Founded: 2015

Co-Founder: Joshua Maciejewski

Amazon Role: Operations Manager

Joshua Maciejewski worked as an Operations Manager at Amazon from August 2015 to April 2016. He co-founded Function of Beauty in 2014 (launched 2015) alongside MIT grad Zahir Dossa and cosmetic chemist Hien Nguyen.

The company created a revolutionary approach to beauty products: allowing customers to customize their own shampoo, conditioner, and other hair and skin care products based on their individual needs and preferences. Instead of choosing from pre-made formulas, customers fill out a questionnaire about their hair or skin, and Function of Beauty creates a unique formula just for them.

Function of Beauty has raised over $247 million in six rounds of funding, with the last one in January 2022. The company has expanded from its direct-to-consumer website to retail partnerships with Target and Sephora, demonstrating the mainstream appeal of personalized beauty products.

Gupshup: Conversational Messaging Platform

Founded: 2004

Co-Founder: Rakesh Mathur

Amazon Role (Mathur): Founder of Junglee, acquired by Amazon

Rakesh Mathur is a serial entrepreneur who had sold his startup Junglee to Amazon. He co-founded Gupshup (originally called Webaroo) in 2004 with Beerud Sheth and others to address the fragmented state of mobile communication.

Gupshup raised $100 million in a Series F round from Tiger Global Management in 2021, taking its total valuation to $1.4 billion. The company helps over 100,000 businesses and developers build messaging platforms and delivers over 6 billion messages per month across more than 30 messaging channels.

The company initially focused on SMS messaging before pivoting to become a comprehensive conversational AI platform. Gupshup provides tools for businesses to create AI-powered conversational experiences across WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and other messaging channels.

Jet.com: E-Commerce Innovator

Founded: 2014

Founder: Marc Lore

Amazon Role: CEO of Quidsi (acquired by Amazon)

Marc Lore was the CEO and co-founder of Quidsi, the parent company of Diapers.com, which was sold to Amazon in 2011 for $545 million, and Lore then worked for Amazon for over two years.

In 2014, Lore founded the eCommerce company Jet, and Walmart bought Jet.com less than a year after launch in a deal valued at $3.3 billion. Jet distinguished itself through dynamic pricing that adjusted based on shopping cart contents and customer choices, offering lower prices when customers opted for slower shipping or waived return rights.

Though Jet.com itself was eventually discontinued as a standalone site, the acquisition proved transformative for Walmart’s e-commerce capabilities. Lore became president and CEO of Walmart U.S. eCommerce from 2016 to 2021, helping accelerate the retailer’s digital transformation.

Outreach: Sales Engagement Platform

Founded: 2014

Co-Founder: Manuel (Manny) Medina

Outreach started as GroupTalent, a recruiting platform that was struggling financially. The co-founders were about two months away from being out of cash when they decided to pivot, building an AI engine that could send out emails with personalised messages and follow up on responses.

In just five years, the company got a billion-dollar valuation and became a unicorn, doubling revenue every year for four years. Outreach reached a $4.4 billion valuation after raising $200 million in 2021. The platform now provides sales engagement tools that help companies optimize every interaction throughout the customer lifecycle.

Conclusion

These founders have taken Amazon’s principles and applied them to diverse industries, from logistics and communications to knowledge sharing and enterprise software. While not every venture succeeds—as Convoy’s story illustrates—the track record of Amazon alumni in creating billion-dollar businesses demonstrates the lasting impact of the company’s culture and training ground for entrepreneurial talent.

As the startup ecosystem continues to evolve, Amazon alumni remain among the most sought-after founders and operators, with their experience viewed as strong indicators of potential success in building and scaling technology companies.",http://officechai.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-46.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 10:01:10.038969

光催化SAF生产 研究人员系统评估了系列WOx/ZrOx功能化催化剂在无溶剂条件下催化糠醛（FAL）与环戊酮（CPO）醛醇交叉缩合的性能。结果表明，所有WOx/ZrOx催化剂在紫外光（365 nm）和可见光下均表现出活性，而缺乏表面酸性位点的纯SBA-15和PMO硅胶则转化率极低（<3%）。在紫外光照射下，所有催化剂的质均一化活性均显著提升，其中WOx/ZrOx/PMO(50%)的提升幅度最大（3-4倍）。催化活性不仅取决于表面酸密度，更与PMO骨架中苯基基团调控的表面极性和电子效应密切相关。 通过能带结构分析发现，PMO的引入调节了WOx/ZrOx异质结处的电子环境。随着PMO含量增加，催化剂的带隙（Eg）从SBA-15负载催化剂的4.69 eV减小至PMO(50-100%)的4.25 eV，导致导带底（CBM）从-2.18 eV上移至-1.66 eV，而价带顶（VBM）保持强氧化性（约2.5 eV）。这种能带结构的优化有利于光生电荷的分离和迁移，特别是空穴参与的环戊酮光活化形成烯醇盐（FCp-OH）这一决速步反应。PMO骨架中π-共轭苯基团与WOx/ZrOx异质结的紧密邻近，充当了导电通路，显著增强了从光活化异质结向反应物的电荷分离与转移。 产物分布分析证实了反应遵循级联机制：先由环戊酮光活化形成FCp-OH，再经Br?nsted和Lewis酸位点协同催化脱水生成FCp，最后进行第二次醛醇缩合生成F2Cp。研究还发现，催化剂的疏水性扮演了关键角色。当向反应体系中故意添加水（5 mmol）时，高BTSB含量的催化剂（50%和100%）反而表现出活性提升（分别提高1.6和3.0倍），这归因于疏水微环境将水排出，推动了脱水平衡向产物方向移动。 CPO与FAL的摩尔比强烈影响催化性能和产物分布。当比例≤3:1时，质量平衡高（>95%），表明C-C偶联高效进行，副产物少。当比例>3:1时，质量平衡下降（<85%），同时催化活性和FAL转化率降低，这与胡敏素沉积和活性位点暂时性堵塞有关，可能源于过量的酮发生了自缩合或与中间体的副反应。 催化剂稳定性评估显示，性能最优的WOx/ZrOx/PMO(50%)在三次循环使用后（每次循环后仅用乙酸乙酯洗涤再生），其FAL转化率、初始速率和产物选择性均保持稳定。对使用后的催化剂进行元素分析发现表面有碳积累（一次循环后约36%），但经溶剂洗涤后可轻易去除（残留碳约2%），表明失活主要源于可逆的物理吸附有机物堵塞位点。而未经过再生直接使用的催化剂则活性显著下降（~35%），表面碳含量高达~61%。 3.
结论 本研究成功展示了一种克服生物质转化催化中水致失活难题的新策略。通过将WOx/ZrOx活性位点与具有可调疏水性和电子特性的苯基功能化PMO载体相结合，制备出了高性能的光催化剂。该催化剂不仅通过异质结结构和苯基介导的电荷转移增强了光催化效率，还利用其疏水表面有效排斥水分子，维持了酸性位点的活性。在优化条件下（CPO:FAL = 3:1, 365 nm UV, 80°C, 6 h），WOx/ZrOx/PMO(50%)实现了92.9%的FAL转化率和49.9%的F2Cp收率，其质均一化活性是SBA-15负载类比物的两倍，且催化剂稳定性好，易于再生。这项工作为设计用于规模化、高能效生物质转化为SAF过程的稳定、高选择性光催化剂提供了新的设计范式，直接支持了航空业的脱碳目标。未来通过进一步优化介孔疏水性、孔径和酸密度，有望在更广泛的生物质转化反应中取得突破。","《Applied Catalysis O: Open》：Light or acid?

航空业是全球经济与科技发展的关键推动力，但同时也是严峻的环境挑战者。它贡献了约2.5%的全球能源相关CO2排放，若考虑巡航高度产生的非CO2效应（如氮氧化物、水蒸气和烟尘排放导致的凝结尾迹和云层形成），其对气候变暖的实际影响更为显著。因此，发展可持续航空燃料（Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF）已成为航空业脱碳战略的核心。利用来源丰富、成本低廉的非食用木质纤维素生物质（第二代生物质原料）生产SAF，是符合循环经济理念的理想路径。其中，由富含木糖的半纤维素脱水得到的平台分子糠醛（Furfural, FAL）因其 versatile 的化学反应性，成为升级制取SAF的关键中间体。

然而，在将FAL等C5-C6中间体通过醛醇缩合等C-C偶联反应转化为符合航空燃油C8-C16烃范围的过程中，一个主要的挑战是反应过程中持续产生的水。这些水（无论是原料固有还是原位生成）会引发糠醛水解生成高粘度聚合物（如胡敏素），导致催化剂表面结垢、快速失活和产物收率下降。传统的固体酸催化剂（如沸石、混合氧化物、酸性树脂）由于其微孔和/或亲水特性，对水致失活尤为敏感。因此，开发兼具介孔结构（利于质量传输）和定制化表面疏水性（以排斥水分子）的催化剂至关重要。

光催化策略为缓解失活过程（如胡敏素形成）提供了额外途径，因其可在更温和的条件下进行。近年来，周期性介孔有机硅（Periodic Mesoporous Organosilicas, PMOs）作为多功能催化剂载体受到关注，其通过将有机桥联硅氧烷基团（如双(三乙氧基硅基)苯，BTSB）作为骨架组成部分，能够精确调控表面特性（如疏水性/亲水性），并促进与活性相的协同相互作用，从而增强水相耐受催化。

在此背景下，由Vannia C. dos Santos-Durndell、Mark A. Isaacs、Jinesh C. Manayil和Lee J. Durndell共同完成的研究，在《Applied Catalysis O: Open》上发表题为“Light or acid?

Sustainable fuel production and policy Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels comprising nearly 80% of this figure.
Under these conditions, sustainable fuel use could nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and increase to 28 exajoules by 2035.
Cost challenges and investment needs A major hurdle is that sustainable fuels are currently more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts.
Technology diversification and regional focus The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve.","An influential report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) provides a detailed analysis of the global landscape for sustainable fuels.

The assessment prepared to support COP30 suggests that the utilisation of sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels could quadruple by 2035.

This growth is contingent on the complete implementation of existing and newly announced policies alongside substantial investment and innovation.

According to the IEA's analysis under the leadership of Executive Director Fatih Birol, the IEA is advocating for sustainable fuels to become a critical component of the future global energy mix.

The report examines the necessary pathways to accelerate the production and use of biofuels, biogas and hydrogen-based fuels across key sectors like transport, heavy industry and power generation.

Sustainable fuel production and policy

Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels comprising nearly 80% of this figure.

In 2024, these fuels contributed to a reduction in global oil demand by approximately 2.5 million barrels per day and decreased the reliance on imported transport fuels for some nations by 5-15%.

The report notes that ""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled"".

However, the current trajectory points towards gradual progress rather than the rapid acceleration needed to meet climate targets.

The IEA presents an accelerated case scenario where planned policies are fully legislated, market barriers are dismantled and production capacity is expanded. Under these conditions, sustainable fuel use could nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and increase to 28 exajoules by 2035.

The transport sector would continue to be the main source of demand, making up half of sustainable fuel consumption in 2035.

This would cover 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation and 35% of shipping needs.

The private sector also recognises the importance of government backing.

Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of RegenRate, says: ""We need policy on our side.

""We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality"".

Cost challenges and investment needs

A major hurdle is that sustainable fuels are currently more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts.

For instance, electrolytic hydrogen is about 3.8 times more costly and biomethanol is 3.7 times the price of conventional fuels.

Despite these higher costs, the impact on consumer prices is expected to be modest. A 15% blend of sustainable aviation fuel could raise ticket prices by 5-7% while steel produced with low-emissions hydrogen would add less than 1% to the price of an electric vehicle.

The report stresses that ""policies that address only one dimension risk leaving critical gaps,"" calling for integrated frameworks that combine long-term demand signals and support for new technologies.

To achieve this accelerated deployment, cumulative investments from 2024 to 2035 could reach US$1.5tn. This investment would also fuel job growth, with direct employment projected to almost triple to around two million jobs by 2035.

Liquid and gaseous biofuels would account for two-thirds of this increase. Data shows investment in sustainable fuels grew by 20% between 2023 and 2024, spurred by policies in the United States and Brazil for liquid biofuels and the European Union's REPowerEU Plan for biogas.

Technology diversification and regional focus

The composition of the sustainable fuel portfolio is set to evolve. While liquid and gaseous biofuels are expected to retain a two-thirds share in 2035, low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives are projected to grow from just 1% today to one-third of total use.

This change highlights a substantial increase in funding for hydrogen-based solutions.

""With US$1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035 and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping chemicals and beyond,"" explains Antonio Villaluenga, Vice President of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International.

It is important to recognise that investment strategies will differ based on geography and resource availability. The report suggests that ""National shares, mixes and volumes would still vary widely depending on regional conditions"".

The IEA concludes that no single fuel or feedstock can satisfy global demand alone. Instead, a unified effort is required to drive progress across multiple fronts, including expanding established markets, developing new ones and commercialising emerging technologies.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 05:56:09.648643

Apresiasi kepada para pegawai Pertamina di seluruh negeri tersebut, diberikan atas dedikasi dan inovasi mereka dalam memperkuat ketahanan energi nasional.

Sebab kerja keras mereka telah mengantarkan Pertamina memborong 11 penghargaan sekaligus dalam ajang bergengsi Penghargaan Soebroto ke-8 tahun yang dihelat tahun 2025.

Diketahui, ajang Penghargaan Soebroto merupakan bentuk penghargaan tertinggi dari Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM). Penghargaan ini ditujukan bagi perusahaan dan lembaga yang berkontribusi besar terhadap kemajuan sektor energi dan sumber daya mineral di Indonesia.

“Atas nama jajaran Direksi, saya mengapresiasi sumbangsih seluruh Perwira Pertamina yang telah memberikan kontribusi terbaik bagi industri energi nasional. Kami juga berterima kasih kepada Kementerian ESDM atas penghargaan yang diberikan kepada Pertamina,” ujar Simon dalam acara penganugerahan Penghargaan Soebroto 2025 di Jakarta, dikutip dari keterangan resmi Minggu 26 Oktober 2025.

Simon menegaskan, Pertamina terus mendukung kebijakan Kementerian ESDM yang berperan penting dalam mewujudkan visi Asta Cita terkait ketahanan energi nasional.

Ia juga optimistis, kolaborasi dan inovasi yang berkelanjutan akan mempercepat terwujudnya Indonesia Emas 2045.

“Sejalan dengan arahan Menteri ESDM, Pertamina berkomitmen untuk bersinergi dengan berbagai pihak agar mampu mendukung tercapainya ketahanan energi nasional, sebagaimana diamanatkan Presiden Prabowo Subianto,” tegas Simon.

Pada kesempatan yang sama, Kementerian ESDM juga meluncurkan logo baru yang mengusung filosofi Pancar Dipa. Filosofi ini menggambarkan energi yang menyinari seluruh aspek kehidupan, memberi manfaat bagi bangsa, sekaligus menjadi simbol inovasi dan arah baru pengelolaan sumber daya energi Indonesia.

“Kami mengucapkan selamat atas peluncuran logo baru Kementerian ESDM. Ini menjadi simbol semangat baru dalam mencapai target ketahanan energi dan kesejahteraan bangsa,” tutup Simon.

Dengan 11 penghargaan ini, Pertamina semakin menegaskan posisinya sebagai perusahaan penggerak transisi dan kemandirian energi nasional, sejalan dengan komitmen perusahaan untuk terus menghadirkan energi bersih, berkelanjutan, dan berdaulat bagi Indonesia.

Pertamina Dorong Swasembada Energi dan Ekonomi Hijau Lewat Ekosistem Sustainable Aviation Fuel

PT Pertamina (Persero) mempertegas langkahnya dalam transisi energi nasional dengan mengembangkan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

SAF yang dikembangkan Pertamina merupakan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan yang diperuntukkan untuk pesawat terbang.

Langkah ini sekaligus menandai ambisi Pertamina demi menjadikan Indonesia sebagai pusat pasokan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan di Asia Tenggara.

Komitmen tersebut disampaikan Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis Pertamina, Agung Wicaksono dalam ajang 15th International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) Regional Stakeholder Meeting Southeast Asia di Jakarta, Kamis 23 Oktober 2025.

“Peluang pengembangan SAF ini berawal dari visi Presiden kita, Presiden Prabowo Subianto, yang tertuang dalam ASTA CITA, delapan prinsip dasar pembangunan nasional,” ujar Agung lewat keterangan resmi, Jumat 24 Oktober 2025.

Dalam paparannya berjudul Advancing Indonesia’s Sustainability Commitment through Pertamina’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Ecosystem, Agung menegaskan bahwa pengembangan SAF bukan sekadar proyek bisnis, melainkan kontribusi Pertamina terhadap visi nasional menuju ekonomi hijau dan swasembada energi.

Ia menjelaskan, arah kebijakan itu sejalan dengan Strategi Pertumbuhan Ganda Pertamina, yang menyeimbangkan bisnis energi konvensional seperti hulu migas, kilang, dan ritel bahan bakar dengan pengembangan bisnis rendah karbon di masa depan.

“Pada satu sisi, Pertamina tetap mengembangkan bisnis warisan seperti sektor hulu migas, kilang, dan ritel bahan bakar sebagai sumber bisnis utama. Sedangkan pada sisi lain, kami membangun bisnis rendah karbon untuk memastikan keberlanjutan energi di masa depan,” jelas Agung.

Ekosistem SAF: Dari Jelantah Jadi Energi Penerbangan

Pertamina kini memusatkan perhatian pada pembangunan ekosistem biofuel terintegrasi, mencakup produksi SAF, pengembangan energi panas bumi (geothermal), serta penerapan teknologi Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) untuk mendukung target nasional Net Zero Emission (NZE).

Indonesia disebut memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan SAF karena ketersediaan bahan baku melimpah, khususnya dari minyak jelantah (Used Cooking Oil/UCO). Pertamina telah membangun rantai ekosistem lengkap mulai dari pengumpulan UCO hingga pengolahan dan pemanfaatannya sebagai bahan bakar pesawat.

Dalam ekosistem ini, Subholding Kilang Pertamina International (KPI) berperan mengolah minyak jelantah menjadi SAF melalui fasilitas co-processing. Pertamina Patra Niaga menangani distribusi bahan bakar, sementara Pelita Air Service, maskapai milik Pertamina, menjadi pengguna langsung SAF dalam operasional penerbangan.

“Dengan demikian, kami memiliki rantai ekosistem lengkap. Mulai dari pengumpulan minyak jelantah hingga produksi SAF, lalu penggunaannya dalam penerbangan. Suplai UCO berpotensi meningkat seiring dengan meningkatnya permintaan dari kawasan, Eropa, dan Amerika Serikat,” papar Agung.

Kilang Cilacap dan Plaju Jadi Basis Produksi SAF

Pertamina juga memperluas kapasitas produksi SAF di dua lokasi strategis, yaitu Kilang Cilacap dan Kilang Plaju. Kilang Cilacap saat ini mampu memproduksi sekitar 238 ribu kiloliter SAF per tahun dengan teknologi co-processing yang memanfaatkan 2,4% bahan baku UCO. Produksi ini akan terus meningkat seiring penambahan fasilitas baru.

Langkah ini memperkuat posisi Pertamina sebagai pemain utama dalam energi berkelanjutan kawasan. SAF disebut mampu mengurangi hingga 84 persen emisi karbon dari aktivitas penerbangan internasional.

Dengan kemampuan tersebut, SAF menjadi inovasi kunci dalam upaya dekarbonisasi sektor transportasi udara.

“Keberhasilan pengembangan SAF merupakan bukti nyata bahwa ekonomi sirkular dapat berjalan di Indonesia dan Asia Tenggara,” tegas Agung.

Sebagai perusahaan energi nasional, Pertamina menegaskan komitmennya mendukung target Net Zero Emission 2060 dengan memperkuat inisiatif yang sejalan dengan Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) dan prinsip Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis.

“Dampaknya, SAF dapat mengurangi hingga 84 persen emisi karbon dari penerbangan internasional. Kami berharap dapat terus bekerja sama untuk mengembangkan SAF bagi Indonesia dan dunia,” tutup Agung.

The stock has continued a steady upward trend over the past week and month. Investors are taking stock of this momentum as they consider the company’s recent annual growth numbers.

Calumet’s recent momentum comes after a stretch of volatility earlier this year. The 19% share price return over the past 90 days shows sentiment is improving even as the one-year total return remains mildly negative. This pattern hints at building optimism around the company’s growth story.

If you’re weighing your next investment move, now’s a smart time to broaden your search and discover

With shares now hovering close to analyst targets after months of gains, the key question remains: does Calumet still offer room for upside, or has the recent rally fully captured its future potential?

Most Popular Narrative: 4.4% Overvalued

Calumet is trading just above the most popular narrative’s estimate of fair value, with its last close almost matching the newly lifted target. Behind this close gap are bold expectations about cash flows and future margins, setting the tone for an ambitious outlook.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026. This will enable Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs, capturing premiums of $1-$2 per gallon over renewable diesel and tapping into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally. This is likely to drive a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

Wondering what’s powering this fair value call? The real surprise comes from a combination of sudden profit turnaround, accelerated revenue growth, and a future valuation multiple that breaks the industry mold. What financial leaps and risks are hidden in their math? Find out where expectations collide with reality in the deep dive.

Result: Fair Value of $19.25 (OVERVALUED)

However, persistent regulatory uncertainty and Calumet's high debt load could quickly change sentiment, making future gains less certain than recent momentum suggests.

Another View: Sales Multiple Signals Value

Looking at Calumet’s valuation through the lens of its price-to-sales ratio, the story changes. Calumet trades at 0.4x sales, not only far lower than the US Oil and Gas industry average of 1.5x, but also below its fair ratio of 0.5x. This suggests room for the market to re-rate the stock, or a caution flag if industry enthusiasm fades. Which metric will prove more reliable as the company evolves?

They serve communities that larger carriers won’t reach, fly where rail won’t go, where ferries are seasonal, and where roads are impractical. They connect students to universities, patients to hospitals, and families to each other. Yet, despite their efficiency and essential role, regional operators are facing increasing regulatory pressure. The ongoing implementation of the Fit for 55 package risks undermining the very operators who are already doing the most with the least. “Regional airlines are more than just carriers, they’re lifelines,” says Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, Chief Executive Officer of ATR. “They serve the most essential routes and are already leading the way in low-emission aviation. We must protect them, not penalise them.”

Neste expands SAF deal with United: Neste and United Airlines have expanded their existing partnership to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to three new major airports in the United States. The new agreement makes United the first commercial airline to purchase SAF for use on flights from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington D.C. As part of the agreement, Neste will supply neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ to United Airlines. The sustainable aviation fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel before use to meet jet fuel specifications. Neste began the SAF deliveries to United at George Bush Airport in July and they will continue until the end of October 2025. Deliveries of SAF to Newark Airport and Dulles Airport started in September 2025 and are set to continue until the end of 2025. The fuel is delivered to each airport via existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Houston. This new agreement builds on the long-term partnership between Neste and United. Neste has been supplying SAF to United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport since August 2024, after the SAF purchase credit was enacted in Illinois, making United the first airline to use SAF at the airport. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel has also been used by the airline at San Francisco International Airport in California, where the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is supporting the use of renewable fuels.
