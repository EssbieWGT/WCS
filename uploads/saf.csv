It also provides a new pathway for producing SAF in the first place, which can power planes while lowering planet-killing emissions by 80%.

This would be a major breakthrough if it pans out, since biocrude has had trouble finding a use case due to its high oxygen content versus fossil fuels. It also provides a new pathway for producing SAF in the first place, which can power planes while lowering planet-killing emissions by 80%. We're rooting for this one.

Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with help from the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation, tested whether molybdenum carbide nanocatalysts, once dispersed onto the mineral zeolite, could remove oxygen from biocrude. They then upgraded the tar-like substance using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a process that does in mere minutes what it takes the Earth eons to do — namely, turn dead biomass into explodey stuff that makes engines go vroom.

That all concluded with some very promising results, including complete oxygen removal and a high heating value (HHV) very near to the industry standard fuel, called Jet A. Getting rid of the oxygen is key, since the famously corrosive gas would eat through the actual plane engines, which would be very bad. In addition, this treated substance hit its targets in surface tension, density, freeze point, and other key metrics in order to qualify as SAF. While it's not quite ready to go into aircraft just yet, this is a huge step towards getting there.

There are already a number of ways to make SAF, and it can be made from a variety of sources (called feedstocks), including vegetable oils, fats, and greases. Did you flush your leftovers down the disposal last night? Should have put it in an airplane instead, it could have flown to Argentina with that.

Okay, not quite. But 360,000 commercial flights have already been powered by SAF, and Virgin Atlantic recently flew an entire flight with 100% SAF, so this is a proven technology that works. Plus, it just slots right into existing infrastructure; it can be piped through the same pipes and pumped into the same planes as ordinary fuel, so nothing needs to be re-engineered. It's a truly drop-in solution. The trick, as it ever is, is money. Right now, SAF is just more expensive than petroleum jet fuel, and given that fuel is one of an airline's highest costs, switching to it just isn't going to happen on its own. Either governments will need to subsidize SAF, or SAF will need to get cheaper. Plus, for the industry to switch over entirely, we're going to need to be able to make a lot more of the stuff.

The breakthrough these scientists have made doesn't necessarily solve those problems immediately, but it does open up another pathway to the production of SAF. The more we know about making the stuff, the likelier we'll find a cost-efficient solution. In this case, it also has the benefit of giving biocrude, which has otherwise struggled to find a use case, a new lease on life.

Air travel accounts for 2% of CO2 emissions globally, and fully 12% from the transportation sector, per the U.S. Department of Energy. Due to battery weight, electric planes for commercial use aren't plausible. So if aviation wants to go green, the best way to do it is with SAF, which creates 80% fewer net emissions. In other words, that banana peel rotting in your trash right now just might save the planet, if we can just find a way to turn it into jet fuel on the cheap.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/scientists-find-new-way-to-power-your-next-flight-with-rotted-food/l-intro-1752262017.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 16:12:54.934053

Liz Craddock, partner at Holland & Knight and co-lead with Peter of our Agriculture & Food [Policy] practice in our Public Policy & Regulation Group.
We're going to start with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, as everyone knows, was signed into law by the president on July 4.
I think, as we know, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act essentially stripped away several key provisions or titles of the traditional Farm Bill and put them into the act itself.
Liz, Isabel, I don't know what you've got to add to that.","Peter Tabor: Hello, and welcome to another session of ""The Eyes on Washington"" podcast from Holland & Knight. I'm Pete Tabor, a senior policy advisor with Holland & Knight and co-lead of our Agriculture & Food [Policy] Team here in the Public Policy & Regulation Group. And I'm joined by my colleagues, Liz Craddock and Isabel Lane. I'll let Liz and Isabel introduce themselves.

Liz Craddock: Hi everybody. Liz Craddock, partner at Holland & Knight and co-lead with Peter of our Agriculture & Food [Policy] practice in our Public Policy & Regulation Group.

Isabel Lane: Hi everyone. Isabel Lane, also with the Public Policy & Regulation Group, a senior public affairs advisor focusing on energy, climate, agriculture and the intersection of those things with tax and funding.

Peter Tabor: Great. So I'm really thrilled to be working with Liz and Isabel, but also to be giving you this really quick update on a couple of things. There's been a lot going on, we're going to cover in the next few minutes. We're going to start with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, as everyone knows, was signed into law by the president on July 4. There are a lot of implications outside of agriculture. We're going to focus on those that really do impact food and agriculture.

And so I think we'll start with Isabel on a couple of topics there. Just to familiarize everybody, this is a massive piece of legislation that folks weren't sure it would get across the finish line, but it's primarily focused on tax cuts and some spending on defense and immigration. But we'll kick it over to Isabel for an overview of the impact on ag with respect to biofuels and energy.

Isabel Lane: So with the One Big Beautiful Bill's passage, it includes a number of changes that are going to have significant impacts on the intersection between agriculture and energy, particularly on renewable energy and biofuels. One of the highest profile issues in the One Big Beautiful Bill was the rollback of a number of the IRA clean energy tax credits that were developed and created in the Inflation Reduction Act in order to advance the clean energy transition in the United States and to support biofuels producers as well. The bill does include rollbacks and significant changes to a number of those credits. In particular, wind, solar are hit hard. And both terminations to those credits and restrictions on foreign entities of concern or FEOCs and the incorporation of components and sub-components in renewable energy products from countries of concern will have significant impacts on the usability of a number of those credits. For the purposes of anyone that is doing solar on farmland or looking at renewable energy in conjunction with any of their agricultural products, there are a number of changes in this bill that are important to look at. And the Energy Tax Team here at Holland & Knight is doing a great job covering that. So I'll encourage you to go take a look at some of those.

I also do want to mention very quickly the changes to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, which is the technology-neutral biofuels credit, originally established in the IRA. It was only a two-year credit in the IRA, so it went through 2027. This bill actually extends it through 2029, but does make some changes in its implementation that will have significant impacts for biofuel producers and the feedstock growers here in the United States. The proposal will ban foreign feedstocks under the tax credit grown outside of the U.S., Mexico and Canada. It also changes some of the emissions calculations and changes the value given to gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, under the credit. So the impacts there will hit biofuel producers and American agricultural producers different. There was a lot of lobbying on this. Ultimately, I think between the House and the Senate, they ended up in a compromised position. But again, this is an area where H&K is going to be covering both implementation at Treasury and also the changes that are going to be happening in the biofuels market because of this credit and the One Big Beautiful Bill's extension and revision of it. So with that, I'll turn it to Liz to cover some of the other pieces impacting ag in the bill.

Liz Craddock: Thanks, Isabel. Yeah, there's a lot of changes, I think, on the tax side that will relate to energy and how that will impact farmers and the agriculture industry that has been partaking and utilizing some of those technologies to provide energy and create fuel, you know, produce fuel for the country. So a lot of exciting and potential changes there.

Another big change that occurred during this reconciliation package is on SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This is the program that provides what most people call ""food stamps"" to our economically distressed families and individuals across the country. There are several changes that are mainly on the administrative side, but there's one major one also on the participant side that I want to just quickly review. On the administrative side, while SNAP is a federal program, this bill is going to shift additional administrative costs to individual states in 2027. So the impacts here are delayed a few years, but it's going to increase the state's burden [by] 25 percent of the administrative costs. Currently, it's at 50 percent, so this will be an additional burden for states in implementing and doling out SNAP benefits to residents of those states. In addition, states with high error rates, and error rates can result from a whole host of reasons — the two main ones are either from overpayment or from an underpayment to the beneficiaries — but if states have a high error rate, then they will have to begin actually paying for their SNAP benefits to the beneficiaries on top of the extra administrative costs that I had mentioned earlier going to 75 percent. So this is going to be a big additional cost to states in the years to come. States mainly have balanced budgets. That's how a lot of states operate, unlike the federal government. And shifting these priorities, they'll have to shift a lot of their priorities around in the individual states to absorb these additional costs and administrating the SNAP program.

On the participant side, there are about 43 million people in the country, including 16 million children, who are on SNAP benefits. It's approximately 13 percent of the U.S. population. And just to give a little bit more of a fulsome picture, states with the highest participation include New Mexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, Oregon, Oklahoma. So we're talking about blue states, red states, from coast to coast. While the legislation doesn't touch the amount of a benefit a SNAP participant will receive, which is roughly around $200 a month in fiscal year (FY) 2024, it does change the work requirements for participants, raising the age of those required to work from 49 to 65 and having to work for at least 20 hours a week. So you heard a lot if you're paying attention to the passage of this bill in Congress about the decrease in SNAP benefits to participants. That's mainly twofold. One from the extra costs that states will have to endure in administrating the program, but also on the work requirement side. There's about 3 million Americans, they believe, who will lose their existing benefits under this new requirement. So, that's a significant change for that program.

Also on the SNAP front, while we didn't see any changes to items that are eligible for SNAP purchase under this legislation, that has been a hot topic here in D.C., especially under the new Make America Healthy Again mantra. And so while SNAP does a great benefit to economically distressed in the U.S., it's also a giant economic engine for grocery stores and American farm products, including food and beverage here in the U.S. So Pete, perhaps this is a great time to segue over to you on what you're hearing in regards to MAHA and developments there that will impact the U.S. food and agriculture sector.

Peter Tabor: Thanks, Liz. Yeah, while it's not involved directly in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, you rightly pointed out that the changes to SNAP really do, they're perhaps an outgrowth of the MAHA movement under the Trump Administration. And one thing I'll note as well is that Secretary Rollins, when she came into office, made it a point that she was going to be very willing to approve SNAP waivers submitted by states. And I believe some states, several states have already made those requests and those SNAP wavers might involve, you know, the eligibility of certain products for SNAP programming in certain states.

With respect to MAHA overall, just to kind of give folks a quick overview, the MAHA Commission Report was issued in May, and it focuses on childhood chronic disease. And four specific factors it identifies include poor diet, environmental chemical exposure, lack of exercise or more screen time, that kind of thing, and chronic stress. Again, all related to childhood chronic disease. And then it comes up with some recommendations, I think, that have folks in the food and ag sector in certain sense, very interested.

Eating more whole foods. The specialty crop industry is perhaps encouraged by the MAHA Commission Report emphasis on eating whole foods and fruits and vegetables. Everybody is still trying to better understand in terms of the environmental stressors that there's two factors, I think, that really come up for food and ag stakeholders. That's the use of pesticides and herbicides. The MAHA Commission Report really stresses that there needs to be more scrutiny paid to the use of pesticides and herbicides. As folks know, RFK Jr. has spoken and even litigated issues related to the use of certain pesticides and herbicides.

The other area is ultra-processed foods, which is a term that doesn't quite have a definition. It's not an agreed definition. And so that's an area that has many food producers in the United States concerned in terms of the implications for SNAP and eligibility of certain products, including soft drinks, etc. We've already seen, I think, some voluntary moves by the food industry to remove certain additives and chemicals. And that kind of bleeds over into this other issue that's addressed a little bit in the MAHA Commission Report. But it's another issue that the Department of Health and Human Services has emphasized, and that is the generally recognized safe standard that is used by many in the food industry to essentially self-approve food additives without FDA formal review. And the MAHA Commission Report and RFK Jr. have indicated they want to revisit that, get independent studies to review the process and some of the additives. So I think those are things that we need to be watching out for and clients need to view and those in the food sector need to watching very closely.

In a very short segment, I want to also touch on an event that Secretary Rollins hosted on the steps of the Whitten Building. And this relates to, I'm switching gears a little bit here, the issues of immigrant labor and foreign ag land ownership in the United States. Secretary Rollins was joined by several administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and several governors. And they really focused on, I think, from an ag labor standpoint, the fact that we should not expect relief in the food and ag sector in terms of immigration enforcement. And so that is an issue that I think stakeholders will need to be paying very close attention to. And then on the issue of foreign ag land ownership, I think there's a lot of attention paid to this, but it looks like it's going to be an issue of putting in place measures that have already been discussed and agreed, adding the Secretary of Agriculture to CFIUS and updating the AFIDA provisions to ensure a closer oversight of acquisitions of U.S. agricultural land by foreign entities. I think, a lot of factors related to SNAP that Liz covered and related to this MAHA Commission Report, really looking at what we produce and how it goes into programs that many Americans rely on.

Now, I think we'll shift gears really quickly to the Farm Bill and the implications of all of this for the Farm Bill. And I'll start us off and then ask my colleagues to chime in. I think, as we know, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act essentially stripped away several key provisions or titles of the traditional Farm Bill and put them into the act itself. Those relate to reference prices for crops, crop insurance, as Liz mentioned, the SNAP provisions that were updated, and that leaves us with the big question mark as to whether we will see a ""skinny"" Farm Bill excluding those provisions that were addressed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — and if so, what the timing might be. And I think we're hearing that the House is eager to begin work on a ""skinny"" Farm Bill. Agriculture Committee Chair GT Thompson has indicated that he'd like to get the ball rolling on this. And he even threw out a number or something in the neighborhood of $8 billion for the Farm Bill in the late summer, early fall. And then I think we're hearing on the Senate side that there is an appetite to address this and move some of these other issues forward that weren't addressed in the recent legislation, but that their timeline is maybe more looking at early 2026. Liz, Isabel, I don't know what you've got to add to that. I'm sure you've been hearing and talking with other folks as well.

Liz Craddock: Yeah, thanks Pete. You know, as you mentioned, a ton of priorities were already carried in the One Big Beautiful Bill, whether it was, you know, disaster assistance or crop insurance or commodities, etc. So I think the state of play now is to see what wasn't taken care of. I think there are some priorities that still remain. I know that both chairmen of the Senate and the House committees are very eager to get a Farm Bill done. So their focus will still remain on trying to move forward on it. But I think the pressure is off a little bit on timing, given that some of the more critical needs in the agriculture sector were taken care of, but it's a great time to sort of dust off what wasn't taken care of, maybe some long-standing priorities for the ag sector that still remain that maybe haven't received a lot of attention in past Farm Bills because, you know, the commodity title sort of reigns or the nutrition title reigns. So it's a great, I think, time to sort of see how we can advance forward, maybe on ag tech and some other issues that are out there that people have as priorities that they'd like to move forward on. Isabel, you have any additional things to add?

Isabel Lane: Just from the energy perspective, echoing a lot of what you just covered, Liz. There are a lot of pain points after some of the changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill for some biofuels producers and for renewable energy interests in the United States. And looking for opportunities to use the Farm Bill to sort of tackle and address and create more opportunities where those changes were made could be something that the energy industry is trying to focus in on and carry into the next year and into the next Congress. So some appetite there from those interests for sure.

Peter Tabor: Well, thanks to you both. The Farm Bill discussion we'll be very closely monitoring and engaged on that. And so for clients or potential clients with interest, please contact us. We're very much involved in that process to see whether a Farm Bill moves forward.

Shifting gears to trade, I just wanted to spend a minute or two looking at the trade landscape because it does affect U.S. food and agriculture production, U.S. food and ag exports. There has been so much going on that we probably need to devote a separate podcast to that, but suffice to say that Holland & Knight has a Tariff Task Force comprised of many attorneys and professionals who are covering this topic, addressing these issues. And I'm going to cover them very briefly here. With respect to reciprocal tariffs, they were supposed to have taken effect [July 9]. President Trump issued letters. This week he's issued, I think, a total of 21 letters to countries — and they've been made public — advising them of the tariff they will pay effective August 1. I guess serving as an incentive to those countries to come to the negotiating table. Again, the Commerce Secretary, the Treasury Secretary and the USTR are heavily engaged and involved in their teams, the administration, heavily engaged involved in negotiations with multiple countries. And so we've got a handle on that. I think the implications for U.S. agriculture involve possible retaliation if we don't see resolution that results in some sort of agreement. I'll add too that we're probably looking at 10 percent baseline tariffs as the cost of entry into the U.S. market for many products from our trading partners. And so that's something to keep in mind. The negotiations to date have pretty much factored that in. And I think it's becoming more and more accepted in many of the discussions that are happening, including with the European Union, with Japan, Korea, etc. There are also 232 investigations going. These are handled by the Department of Commerce. You're well aware that we've got steel and aluminum tariffs at 50 percent right now. We've got auto tariffs and parts tariffs at 25 percent. There is a raft of investigations. This week, the president announced that there would be tariffs increased on imports of copper into the United States, and we're expecting tariff investigations to conclude on timber, lumber and derivatives, and pharmaceuticals. So there's a lot happening there and other investigations as well underway.

And finally, in the trade space, not specific to tariffs, is USMCA review. We've been following this very closely. We understand that USTR is poised to issue the notice requesting input from stakeholders that will allow it to complete its work and deliver a report to Congress by January 1 on recommendations for updates to USMCA. Canada and Mexico are currently operating in a slightly different tariff environment, but this USMCA review piece, looking at how the Trump Administration has worked on some of these issues, I think this is going to be an opportunity for many food and ag stakeholders to really weigh in with the administration, ensure that their voice is heard and that their concerns are addressed in the USMCA review process. So that's a very quick overview.

And now I think we're going to shift gears again to look at what's coming, especially with respect to the FY of 2026, which starts October 1. The process is already well underway in both the House and the Senate for appropriations. And Liz, what are you seeing, hearing? What should we be focusing on in the coming weeks and months?

Liz Craddock: Thanks, Pete. Yeah, as you said, we've already seen the House move forward with their Agriculture Appropriations Bill. They were able to vote it out of committee in late June. So that process has already occurred. One of the first ones out of the gate. It is a decrease. The House bill is a decrease over FY25 funding by about $1.1 billion dollars or 4.2 percent. So the overall bill [that] is going to be on the House side is $25 billion. So we are continuing to see other Republicans on the House side want to decrease discretionary spending out of the federal government. Some of the key things I just want to highlight. While the overall bill includes USDA, it also includes FDA. So there are a few other agencies included in it. For the Department of Agriculture or USDA, the bill would provide $21.9 billion, which is about $800 million below FY25-enacted level. So again, we're seeing a decrease in the amount of discretionary spending for the agency. Some of the key priorities I just wanted to highlight is there was an increase for the Agriculture Research Service of about $2.5 million above FY25-enacted levels. This includes high-priority initiatives for emerging pests and diseases. So we continue to see, I think, a big focus from USDA on pests and disease and focusing on those over at the agency. Unfortunately, for a lot of our research institutions, is a decrease. In the National Institute for Food and Agriculture, or NIFA, it's about $25 million below the enacted FY25 level. Again, this is competitive research and capacity programs that support our nation's land grant universities. So I know a lot of those universities will be disappointed to see that number coming out of the House. It does maintain the amount of funding for APHIS, or the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, at $1.1 billion dollars. So again, that sort of pairs with the money that was focused on emerging pests and diseases. So that kind of, at the moment, seems to be a big priority for the House Ag Appropriations Committee, I think in pairing and keeping close on USDA and what their priorities are. We're taping this literally the day before the Senate full committee will be marking up their Ag Appropriations Bill. So we don't have the Senate framework yet, but they will eventually work their bill through the process. And by the end of it, hopefully by the end of September, we'll have a final Ag Appropriation Bill for FY26 and funding all of the USDA programs. So that's what's next for funding for USDA. I don't know if Isabel or Peter, you all have any other additional what's next on the agenda?

Isabel Lane: Sure, I do want to jump in and just mention a few items on the regulatory front. Now that the One Big Beautiful Bill is law, Treasury is going to need to implement many of the changes to the tax credits that I had previously mentioned. So there's going to be a good amount of attention paid to the Treasury and IRS rulemakings and notices coming out on some of those new provisions. The Holland & Knight Energy Tax Team is doing a lot of coverage of that, so I encourage you to keep eyes on that insofar as energy impacts your agricultural footprint. Also on the biofuels front, the renewable fuel standard is, of course, the most important policy driver for the biofuel industry in the United States. The EPA has issued a proposed rule to set volumes under that program for 2026 and 2027 and is aiming to finalize that rule by October 31 this year. So there's going to be an open comment period and a flurry of activity to try and shape the rule of that. That also has a protectionist slant like we are seeing in some of the tax credits. There's a restriction on the participation of imported feedstocks under the program and imported fuels. So, you know, a lot of back and forth between American agricultural interests on that and fuel producers. So an area to keep eyes on as well, certainly going to be a contentious and hot button issue in the months to come as the agency tries to finalize that rulemaking.

Peter Tabor: Yeah, I think there's so much to review, to discuss, to analyze, for our own benefit, for our client's benefit. I think the best bet for many of you listening is to contact us if you've got questions. We serve as a resource for clients. We're always happy to share more information. We're constantly gathering intelligence on all these issues.

And I think we're kind of at time. So we thank you for joining us. Thanks to my colleagues, Liz and Isabel, for all the hard work putting this together, and thank you again.

Virgin Atlantic will phase out in-flight bars. Here’s why

Amelia Neath

Friday 11 July 2025 18:38 BST

Virgin Atlantic is phasing out its iconic in-flight bars, a feature known for creating a social atmosphere on its premium flights.

The decision was made to replace the bars with more seating areas, specifically new ""Retreat Suites,"" as the current setup is considered an old-fashioned and inefficient use of space.

The removal of the bars will begin within the next three years, with the final ones expected to be gone by 2028.

This move marks a U-turn for the airline, as Richard Branson had previously pledged to reintroduce the bars after their initial removal was deemed a ""dreadful mistake.""

The introduction of the spacious ""Retreat Suites"" is part of a broader overhaul of Virgin Atlantic's flight experience, which also includes plans for free Wi-Fi and other cabin enhancements.

A company filing stated that Sean Major had resigned as General Counsel and Secretary effective 11 July, with a successor due to be named at a later date.

Some industry insiders expect this to be the first of several changes in the Air Products executive line-up as Menezes, who took up the top job in February, looks to shape the firm to his agenda.

In his first quarterly earnings call, Menezes issued a return to basics message to investors, focusing on lower-capex projects with long-term offtake agreements.

The shift marks a stark departure from Ghasemi’s high-capex, first-mover strategy, which activist investor Mantle Ridge had accused of “dramatically underperforming.”

At the heart of its concerns were the company’s large-scale clean hydrogen projects.

Ghasemi had positioned the high-capex drive as a way to capture “first mover advantages.” However, the strategy showed clear divergence from the company’s peers, typically known for delivering stable, long-term returns through take-or-pay contracts.

As more projects came onto the books, cash reserves fell significantly, while debt steadily increased.

Once in post, Menezes announced a $3.1bn write-down as it exited three US projects, including a green hydrogen plant and a hydrogen-based sustainable aviation fuel project.

The company also announced changes to the 2.2GW Neom green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia – for which it is the owner, operator, and sole offtaker. Instead of selling green hydrogen from start-up in 2027, the company will supply ammonia free-on-board until 2030, when the first offtaker is expected to begin deliveries.

Major’s exit could be the first a several boardroom departures, it has been speculated, as Menezes steers Air Products away from Ghasemi’s high-capex hydrogen strategy and toward a more disciplined, returns-focused model.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/05/AP012955-scaled-e1746103589937.webp",N,,2025-07-11 14:11:35.180939

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed H.R. 1—dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)—enacting significant modifications to clean‑energy credits previously enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

OBBBA scales back clean‑energy tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) including speeding up phase‑outs for certain energy credits, tightening domestic content rules and foreign‑entity restrictions, and imposing new deadlines for projects to qualify. Below is a summary of these changes along with our insights. Frost Brown Todd will continue to monitor any regulatory guidance or executive orders as they are published.

Foreign Entity Definitions

At the outset, OBBBA restricts access to certain credits[1] from certain Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) and those who receive material assistance from such entities. A Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) includes Specified Foreign Entities (SFE) and Foreign Influenced Entities (FIE), each of which are defined below:

An SFE includes the following:

An entity designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189);[2]

An entity included on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC);[3]

An entity alleged by the Attorney General to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained under certain national security laws;[4]

An entity identified as a Chinese military company operating in the United States[5] pursuant to 1260H of the 2021 NDAA;

An entity included on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act list;[6]

Certain Chinese battery manufacturers;[7]

A foreign controlled entity (FCE).[8]

A FIE is an entity, excluding certain public corporations, in which:

A SFE has direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer (such as a member of the board or an executive officer) of such entity;

A single SFE owns at least 25% of such entity;

Multiple SFEs combined own at least 40% of such entity;

At least 15% or more of the entity’s debt is held in aggregate by one or more SFEs; or

An “applicable payment” to an SFE is made pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement granting the SFE effective control over qualified facility or energy storage technology or production of eligible components.

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity: Under OBBBA, a project’s eligibility for key energy credits turns on whether it receives “material assistance” of goods or service used within a facility. To measure this, the statute uses the Material Assistance Cost Ratio (MACR), which is calculated by subtracting the cost of PFE‑sourced goods from the total cost of goods, and then dividing that result by the total. A project must meet or exceed certain MACR thresholds, which vary by technology and construction year, to remain eligible for the credits.[9]

The MACR calculation differs by credit type. For the Clean Electricity Production Credit (§ 45Y) and the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (§ 48E), the ratio includes all manufactured products (and their subcomponents) incorporated into a facility. For the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (§ 45X), only direct materials used to produce the eligible component are counted. In either case, if any portion of the product or its inputs originates from a PFE, that portion must be removed from the numerator.

To help taxpayers navigate this test, the Treasury Department is required to release safe harbor cost tables no later than December 31, 2026.[10] Until then, and for a brief period after the tables are released, taxpayers can rely on existing guidance under IRS Notice 2025-08 to estimate the total cost of eligible components and manufactured products. Taxpayers may also rely on certifications from suppliers confirming that the product or any of its components were not sourced from a PFE.[11] These certifications must include the supplier’s EIN, be signed under penalty of perjury, retained for at least six years, and either attest that the property was not manufactured by a PFE (and that the supplier has no reason to believe otherwise), or specify the portion of costs not attributable to PFEs.[12]

A separate grandfathering rule, the binding contract exception, applies to any facility using products or components acquired under a written agreement executed before June 16, 2025, provided that the facility begins construction before August 1, 2025, and is placed in service by January 1, 2030 (or, for some solar and wind facilities, January 1, 2028). In those cases, the costs covered by the contract are excluded from the MACR entirely.

To enforce these requirements, the statute allows the IRS to assess any deficiency tied to an incorrect MACR calculation for up to six years after a return is filed. If a taxpayer overstates the MACR and receives a disallowed credit, a 20% accuracy-related penalty may apply. In the case of direct pay for applicable entities under § 6417, the disallowed credit triggers an excessive payment penalty of 20%. Suppliers that submit false certifications may also face penalties if the error results in a disallowed credit and the tax understatement exceeds certain thresholds.

Accelerated/Bonus Depreciation

Property that qualifies for the Clean Electricity Production Credit (§ 45Y) and the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (§ 48E) will continue to be treated as five‑year MACRS property under § 168(a). By contrast, any “energy property” as defined in § 48(a)(3)(A)—including wind, solar, and standalone storage—with construction beginning after December 31, 2024, is removed from the five‑year class designation. These assets may nonetheless qualify for 100 percent bonus depreciation (restored under OBBBA) if acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025 (subject to the utility‑owned property exclusion). In the absence of explicit guidance, taxpayers can rely on Rev. Proc. 87‑56 and the general MACRS‑classification rules to establish an appropriate recovery period, or they may elect the Alternative Depreciation System under § 168(g) for a 12‑year straight‑line schedule.

Investment Tax Credits (ITC)

Clean Electricity Investment Credit (§ 48E)

Overview: Under current law, § 48E provides a base investment tax credit of 6% for expenditures on zero‑emission electricity or standalone energy‑storage facilities. If prevailing‑wage and apprenticeship requirements (or applicable exceptions) are satisfied, the credit rises to 30%.

Enacted Changes: OBBBA terminates the eligibility of wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, for § 48E credits, with an exception for wind and solar projects that begin construction within twelve months of enactment of the legislation. By contrast, other qualifying facilities, such as nuclear, geothermal, and clean‑hydrogen projects, remain on the original statutory timeline, phasing down after 2032 at 100% in 2033, 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035, and 0% in 2036.

OBBBA also disallows the credit for residential solar‑water‑heating or small wind installations leased to third-party customers. Taxpayers who begin construction on qualified facilities after December 31, 2025, are not permitted to receive material assistance from a PFE (as defined above). Taxpayers that are considered a PFE are no longer eligible for § 48E for tax year beginning after enactment. Finally, OBBBA adjusts the domestic content percentages that qualified facilities and energy storage technology must satisfy to qualify for the domestic content bonus as follows:

40% (20% for an offshore wind facility) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (27.5% for an offshore wind facility) if construction begins on or after June 16, 2025, and before January 1, 2026;

50% (35% for an offshore wind facility) if construction begins during the calendar year of 2026; and

55% if construction begins after December 31, 2026.

These percentages are consistent with the current domestic content requirements under current § 45Y.

Guidance: Wind and solar developments face a compressed window to secure § 48E credits where projects may want to target commencing construction within the next 12 months to satisfy the start of construction exception due to the general uncertainty of when a project may be placed in service to avoid the risk of becoming ineligible for the credits in their entirety. Developers should confirm prevailing‑wage compliance early to maximize the 30% rate and evaluate transferability as a tool to monetize credits if they lack sufficient tax liability. Those working on other advanced technologies can rely on the later 2032 timeline but must track domestic‑emissions metrics in case the alternative threshold date applies. Finally, all sponsors should undertake due‑diligence on their supply chains and ownership structures to screen for any prohibited‑foreign‑entity implicatures that would irrevocably disqualify § 48E benefits.

Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (§ 48C)

Overview: Under § 48C as previously enacted, taxpayers may claim a 30% investment credit for certified “advanced energy” projects. Congress capped total allocations at $10 billion, including $4 billion reserved for projects in low‑income or disadvantaged areas, and required applicants to secure Treasury certification within two years and place their project in service within two years thereafter.

Enacted Changes: OBBBA stipulates that any § 48C allocation withdrawn for missing the two‑year in‑service deadline will be permanently retired from the $10 billion pool, rather than reissued to another project.

Guidance: Awardees of the credit should treat their in‑service deadlines as non‑negotiable since missing the window forfeits their credit and reduces the total program capacity. Sponsors should consider frontloading project planning by securing permits, equipment, and financing early to ensure timely completion.

Production Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production Credit (§ 45Y)

Overview: 45Y provides a production tax credit of 0.3 ¢ per kWh for electricity generated by zero‑emitting facilities for ten years after they’re placed in service. Meeting prevailing‑wage and apprenticeship rules raises the rate to 1.5 ¢ per kWh.

Enacted Changes: Wind and solar projects that begin construction more than one year after enactment must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to claim any § 45Y credit. Accordingly, those wind and solar facilities that start construction within the first post‑enactment year do not face a placed in-service deadline. Wind and solar projects starting on January 1, 2025, until July 4, 2025, (i.e., the date of enactment) will receive credits at the full rate. Non‑wind/solar facilities follow the existing post‑2033 phase‑out: 100% credit for 2033 starts, 75% for 2034, 50% for 2035, and zero thereafter. The credit no longer applies to residential solar‑water‑heating or small wind installations leased to third parties. Additionally, new measurement methods for capacity additions grant developers greater flexibility in calculating eligible output. Taxpayers who begin construction on qualified facilities after December 31, 2025, are not permitted to receive material assistance from a PFE (as defined above). Taxpayers that are considered a PFE are no longer eligible for 45Y for tax years beginning after enactment.

Guidance: Developers of wind and solar may want to consider prioritizing meeting the start of construction exception to the December 31, 2027, placed‑in‑service deadline given the general uncertainty of construction timelines, accelerating procurement and construction schedules to secure full benefits. Those working on geothermal, nuclear, hydrogen, or other zero‑emission projects can rely on the extended timeline through 2033 but should monitor Treasury’s forthcoming capacity‑addition guidance to optimize credit calculations. All sponsors must perform rigorous foreign‑entity due diligence, including supplier certifications and ownership reviews, to avoid inadvertent disqualification under the material‑assistance and prohibited‑entity rules.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (§ 45X)

Overview: 45X offers a production tax credit for manufacturing certain eligible components and critical minerals within the United States. Credit amounts differ by component type. Under current law, component credits phase down after 2029 on a five‑year schedule (100% for sales before 2030; 75% in 2030; 50% in 2031; 25% in 2032; and 0% thereafter), while credits for critical mineral extraction remain available indefinitely.

Enacted Changes:

Critical Mineral Phase Out: The permanent credit for critical minerals (other than metallurgical coal) would instead taper off beginning in 2030 as follows:

Wind Component Sunset: All wind‑related component credits would be eliminated for items produced and sold in 2028 and beyond.

Metallurgical Coal: OBBBA treats metallurgical coal as an eligible component under §45X. However, metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029, would not be eligible for the credit.

Integration Rule Repeal: The option to claim a credit on components incorporated into a larger eligible product sold to an unrelated buyer would be removed.

Foreign‑Entity Exclusions: Any component made with material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity after December 31, 2025 is ineligible, and taxpayers classified as specified foreign entities or foreign‑influenced entities lose § 45X eligibility for tax years beginning after enactment.

Guidance: Manufacturers should accelerate production of wind components before the end of 2027 to capture remaining credits and reassess assembly strategies that rely on integration elections. Firms in the critical‑minerals sector must plan extraction or processing activities to occur before 2034 or qualify projects ahead of accelerated phase‑outs. Given the new foreign‑entity bar, clients need to strengthen supplier due‑diligence processes—tracking key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance—and maintain documentation proving domestic origin. Finally, companies should evaluate whether credit transfers remain the optimal monetization route or if reshaping operations to fully absorb credits in‑house yields better after‑tax returns.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (§ 45V)

Overview: Qualified clean hydrogen produced by the taxpayer is eligible for a per kilogram credit percentage of $0.60 that ranges from 20% to 100% depending on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate that occurs in the process. The credit applies to the hydrogen produced during the ten-year period that the facility is placed in service.

Enacted Changes: Facilities that commence construction after December 31, 2027, would no longer be eligible for any § 45V credit. No new FEOC rules would apply to § 45V.

Guidance: Project developers should prioritize breaking ground on or before December 31, 2027, to preserve § 45V eligibility and avoid forfeiting the credit entirely. They must also optimize production processes and feedstock choices to qualify for the lowest‑emission tier and secure the maximum per‑kilogram rate. Early planning for credit transfers will help monetize benefits if on‑site tax capacity is insufficient. Because § 45V is not subject to foreign‑entity restrictions, sponsors can concentrate their due diligence on operational execution and offtake agreements rather than supply‑chain or ownership concerns.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (§ 45U)

Overview: Electricity produced by existing nuclear power plants is eligible for a credit equal to 0.3¢ per kWh or, if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions in constructing, repairing, or altering the facility are met, 1.5¢ per kWh with the credit being reduced as power prices rise above $25 per MWh.

Enacted Changes: Beginning in 2028, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel they use was not sourced from “covered nations” or covered entities—unless acquired under a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023. In addition, OBBBA bars SFEs from claiming § 45U for tax years beginning after enactment and disqualifies FIEs from claiming § 45U for tax years beginning two years after enactment.

Client Guidance: Operators should inventory their fuel supply chains now and secure certifications to demonstrate compliance or rely on pre‑2023 contracts to grandfather existing arrangements. Nuclear plant owners must implement robust tracking and documentation systems for fuel procurement to satisfy new certification requirements. Foreign‑owned or -affiliated operators should evaluate their corporate structures immediately to determine whether they face outright ineligibility under the SFE/FIE bans and, if so, explore alternative credit monetization strategies before the two‑year FIE cutoff. Finally, continuing to meet wage and apprenticeship rules remains the fastest route to the enhanced 1.5 ¢ rate, so workforce compliance programs should be maintained without interruption.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (§ 45Z)

Overview: Certain transportation fuel is eligible for a credit equal to the applicable amount multiplied by an emissions factor. The applicable amount for transportation fuel is $0.20 per gallon, and the applicable amount for sustainable aviation fuel is $0.35 per gallon. If prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions are met, the credit is increased by a factor of five ($1 per gallon for transportation fuel and $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel). The credit applies to fuel sold before 2028.

Enacted Changes: The proposed legislation extends the availability of the § 45Z credit through the end of 2029 but introduces a suite of significant eligibility and calculation changes starting in 2026. Most notably, the credit would no longer be available for fuel derived from feedstocks sourced outside of the United States, Mexico, or Canada, narrowing the geographic scope of eligible inputs. Additionally, the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20% beginning in 2026. The enhanced rates for sustainable aviation fuel are eliminated for fuel sold after December 31, 2025. In a move to standardize emissions accounting, the proposal bars the use of negative lifecycle emissions rates for most fuels starting in 2026, except in the case of animal-manure-based fuels. For those fuels, the Treasury Department is directed to issue specific lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rates tailored to the type of manure feedstock (e.g., dairy, swine, or poultry). Further, lifecycle emissions calculations would be required to exclude emissions attributable to indirect land use changes, thereby aligning more closely with international sustainability standards. To prevent double-dipping, the credit is reduced by the amount of any excise tax credit under § 6426(k)(1) for fuel sold after 2024, and the § 6426(k)(1) credit itself would sunset on September 30, 2025. OBBBA also directs Treasury to issue guidance clarifying how related-party sales of qualifying fuel should be treated under § 45Z. Finally, the credit would no longer be available to SFEs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. FIEs would lose eligibility for § 45Z in tax years beginning two years after enactment. These changes reinforce broader FEOC compliance themes present throughout the legislation and could significantly affect multinational producers and joint ventures operating in the biofuels space.

Guidance: Producers should ensure compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements in order to maximize the available credit rate. Given the restrictions on foreign entities, clients need to strengthen supplier due‑diligence processes, tracking key inputs to ensure feed stocks are of a domestic origin and maintaining documentation proving domestic origin. Clients that produce fuel made from foreign feedstocks should evaluate costs and look to potential domestic feedstocks as a cost-alternative option in production.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (§ 45Q)

Overview: 45Q provides a federal tax incentive for projects that capture carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide emissions and either permanently store them in secure geological formations or utilize them in specific commercial applications such as enhanced oil recovery or chemical production. The credit is designed to encourage decarbonization across heavy industry and power generation by reducing the effective cost of deploying carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology. Eligibility generally hinges on placing qualified capture equipment in service and beginning construction by a statutory deadline. Once in operation, eligible facilities can claim the credit for a 12-year period. The amount of the credit per metric ton varies depending on whether the carbon is permanently sequestered or utilized and can be significantly increased for projects that comply with prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards.

Enacted Changes: OBBBA simplifies the credit structure by equalizing the rates for sequestration and utilization for qualified facilities placed in service after a certain date, with the base and enhanced rates fixed across project types. The base rate is now $17 per metric ton of carbon and the rate for qualified facilities placed in service after 2022 is $36. Additionally, the legislation imposes foreign-entity restrictions to prevent credits from flowing to entities tied to certain adversarial governments. Specifically, SFEs become ineligible for the credit in tax years beginning after OBBBA’s enactment. Foreign-influenced entities FIEs, including those with material ownership or control links to SFEs, lose eligibility two years later. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the foreign involvement is direct or contractual and are aligned with similar limitations adopted for other clean energy incentives.

Guidance: Developers and investors should carefully evaluate their ownership structures and supply chains in light of the new foreign-entity prohibitions. Companies with any degree of foreign participation should review whether their arrangements could compromise eligibility. While transferability remains available under § 6418, taxpayers may not transfer § 45Q credits to SFEs, which could reduce the pool of eligible transferees and impact monetization strategies. As a result, sponsors should consider whether capturing the credit directly, or using partnerships or tax equity structures, better suits their project economics. Finally, sponsors pursuing carbon utilization strategies should review updated credit amounts and ensure that lifecycle emissions reporting, measurement, and verification procedures comply with evolving federal guidance. Robust documentation, early engagement with qualified independent engineers, and conservative tax position reviews will be critical to protecting the credit over the full claim period.

Clean Vehicle Credits

Overview: Taxpayers may claim a credit for previously owned clean vehicles (§25E), new clean vehicles (§30D), and qualified commercial clean vehicles (§45W).

Enacted Changes: OBBBA eliminates these clean-vehicle credits for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, and taxpayers may only claim them for purchases completed by that date.

Guidance: Businesses should expeditiously evaluate future vehicle needs to take advantage of the clean vehicle credits during the brief window they remain available.

Residential Energy Credits

Overview: Taxpayers may claim several credits or a deduction related to residential clean energy expenditures. The currently available tax incentives are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (§25C), the Residential Clean Energy Credit (§25D), the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (§179D), and the New Energy Efficient Home Credit (§45L).

Enacted Changes: The §25C and §25D credits terminate for property placed in service or cost paid after December 31, 2025. The §179D deduction now terminates for property the construction of which begins after June 30, 2026. The §45L credit terminates for qualified property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Guidance: Homeowners planning efficiency upgrades or renewable installations should consider starting work well before late 2025. Contractors or builders of energy-efficient homes should time construction and sales to meet eligibility. With respect to the §45L credit, it may be difficult for contractors or builders (especially with respect to multifamily developments) to meet the June 30, 2026, requirement to sell or lease the qualified property. Taxpayers should maintain documentation and ensure equipment meets quality standards (Energy Star, etc.).

Transferability

Section 6418 preserves the ability to transfer credits, including those under §§ 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, and 48E, without imposing a new sunset on transfer elections, but it explicitly prohibits any transfer of these credits to an SPE. Under OBBBA, taxpayers would still be free to sell their credits broadly—subject only to the FEOC’s prohibitions on certain purchasers—without any added constraints. In addition, the measure introduces a twelfth sellable credit: the biodiesel incentive under section 40A for small agricultural producers, which had lapsed after 2024. OBBBA would resurrect that incentive through the end of 2026 and increase the subsidy from ten cents to twenty cents per gallon. While this maintains transferability in principle, clients should note that the overall value of these elections may be diminished by the accelerated phase‑outs and placed‑in‑service deadlines embedded elsewhere in OBBBA. Moreover, OBBBA additional foreign‑entity restrictions onto §§ 45Y, 48E, and 45X, rules that do not extend to credits under §§ 45U, 45Q, 45Z, or the broader § 48 investment credits, further complicating structuring for affected taxpayers.

Penalties

Taxpayers who choose to avail themselves of the energy tax credits must be diligent in ensuring compliance with the requirements and restrictions of the sought-after credits. Noncompliance may be accompanied by strict penalties. Taxpayers who understate income by 1% or more due to disallowed energy credits (§§45X, 45Y, or 48E) are hit with a penalty equal to 20% of the understatement under a change to § 6662. Credits disallowed due to FEOC or foreign-sourcing restrictions may contribute to a taxpayer’s understatement, so it is critical that clients are diligent in ensuring compliance through their supply chains. Misstatements on certifications made by suppliers regarding domestic content or foreign sourcing after 2025 will be subject to a penalty that is the greater of $5,000 or 10% of credit amount claimed by the taxpayer relying on the misstated certification.

[8] A foreign controlled entity includes the government of a covered nation (North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran), an agency or instrumentality of a covered nation, a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, an entity or business unit incorporated or organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or any entity “controlled” by those described in this parenthetical) (where “control” = 50 percent vote or value of stock of corporation or 50 percent capital interest or beneficial interests). Publicly traded entities are excluded from this restriction except to the extent that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (ii) 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

[9] The MACR thresholds vary by technology and start‐of‐construction date. For example, qualified facilities under §§ 45Y & 48E must meet 40 percent in 2026, rising to 60 percent for projects starting after 2029; energy storage thresholds begin at 55 percent in 2026 and climb to 75 percent post‑2029; solar‑component sales require 50 percent in 2026 up to 85 percent after 2029; and similar step‑ups apply to wind, inverters, batteries, and critical minerals.

[10] Until the tables are issued, taxpayers may use the domestic content cost tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 and rely on supplier certifications. Projects beginning within 60 days of the tables’ release may also use this transitional approach.

[11] Certifications must: (i) include the supplier’s EIN; (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury; (iii) be kept for at least six years; and (iv) state either that no PFEs were involved and that the supplier has no contrary knowledge, or disclose the cost share not linked to PFEs.

[12] However, if a taxpayer has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that a product or component was manufactured by a PFE, then the taxpayer must treat all associated costs as PFE-sourced and may not rely on the supplier’s certification. Treasury is also directed to issue regulations aimed at preventing abuse of these rules, such as through misleading licensing arrangements or attempts to stockpile materials under the binding contract exception.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16362_5006.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 13:18:54.887706

This major infrastructure programme marks Heathrow’s most significant transformation in over a decade.

London Heathrow Airport is currently Europe’s most punctual major airport and remains the world’s best-connected, continuing to deliver strong value for both the UK and its passengers. The five-year plan that the airport has announced today marks the next step in its strategy to reclaim its place among the world’s top airports – building an extraordinary, future-ready hub.

Shaped by what matters most to passengers, this plan is said to enhance the airport experience, strengthen operational resilience, and unlock growth opportunities for airlines and UK businesses alike – including a boost for the UK supply chain within this parliamentary term. Backed entirely by private investment, it positions Heathrow to become more sustainable and digitally advanced, all while keeping costs down. Thanks to ambitious efficiency savings of over £800 million, the airport charge will remain below its level from a decade ago in real terms.

Over the past 12 months, Heathrow says it has been working closely with airline partners – including hosting over 120 hours of joint planning – and heard from more than two million passengers to understand what matters most, resulting in a customer-led investment plan which will span from 2027 – 2031.

This major infrastructure programme marks Heathrow’s most significant transformation in over a decade – including creating new space within existing terminals equivalent in size to 10 football pitches. From smoother journeys to new lounges, shops and restaurants, the changes will make Heathrow a more enjoyable, resilient and efficient hub for millions of passengers each year.

The aim? A delightful journey from check-in to take-off:

99% of bags travelling with passengers

80% of flights departing on-time

95% of passengers waiting less than five minutes at security

A step-change in service with more choice for passengers requiring additional support

The result: a travel experience where 95% of passengers rate their journey as “good” or “excellent”.

How will the Heathrow private investment boost capacity, trade and Britain’s global reach?

The upgrade is designed to do more than improve the airport – it’s set to boost the country. Once complete, Heathrow will be able to serve 10 million more passengers a year, a 12% increase in capacity that supports our airlines’ growth plans. Cargo handling will also get a significant lift, with plans to increase freight capacity by 20%, giving UK businesses a more efficient gateway to international markets.

Behind the scenes, we are planning the redevelopment of the Central Terminal Area and will seek planning permission to demolish the old Terminal 1, extend Terminal 2 and build a new southern road tunnel to improve access.

Built in Britain, backed by Britain

The project will be delivered by a UK-based supply chain 60% of which is based outside London and the South East, supporting skilled jobs and local businesses around the country in this Parliament. Crucially, it is funded entirely through private investment, not taxpayer money, and is designed to be cost-effective. A £2bn equity contribution from Heathrow shareholders will mean that the investment plan can be delivered affordably. Heathrow’s airport charge has dropped 23% over the past decade and, even with this investment, the new £33.26 charge remains below 2014 levels in real terms.

The airport is also committed to driving efficiency:

Stretching operating cost efficiencies of 6%

£500 million efficiency savings on the capital spend

What are the sustainability plans?

The future of Heathrow must be sustainable. The investment includes steps toward reducing the airport’s environmental footprint:

Removing 3,000,000 tonnes of carbon – equivalent to 15% of 2024 footprint

Noise insulation for 6,500 homes and 15 schools

A sustainable and secure energy supply that maintains 100% renewable electricity

10% cut in waste and 20% rise in recycling

And Heathrow is keeping its promise to give back – aiming to reach 1 million people locally with programmes in skills, education and community support by 2030.

Commenting on the investment plan, Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said:

“We’re making good progress on our strategy to become an extraordinary airport – having become Europe’s most punctual major airport so far this year. But our customers want us to improve our international rankings further, as do we. To compete with global hubs, we must invest. Our five-year plan boosts operational resilience, delivers the better service passengers expect and unlocks the growth capacity airlines want with stretching efficiency targets and a like-for-like lower airport charge than a decade ago. With Heathrow’s UK-based supply chain, this private investment will create jobs and drive national growth during this Parliament. We are ready to deliver the more efficient, sustainable Heathrow that will keep Britain connected to the world.”

Next steps

The Civil Aviation Authority will now review and evaluate the plan. The airport will support this process alongside our airline partners and look forward to getting started with delivering improvements to make Heathrow an extraordinary airport, fit for the future.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2373868775-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 13:18:58.014234

This proposal reflects the Trump Administration’s efforts to protect and grow domestic renewable fuel production while disfavoring foreign feedstocks and fuel.

Changes to Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit The Act includes changes to the eligibility for and the calculation of the amount of the Section 45Z Tax Credit.
This change would limit the Section 45Z Tax Credit available with respect to SAF produced after December 31, 2025.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has recently proposed a new rule and the U.S. Congress has recently enacted a new law affecting the global renewable fuel industry.

First, EPA announced its proposed changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) program through its “Set 2 Rule”.1 This proposed rule seeks to promote the growth of domestic feedstock and renewable fuel production by increasing volume obligations for 2026 and 2027 while curbing the use of foreign-made feedstocks and fuel. EPA is currently taking comments on the proposed Set 2 Rule through August 8, 2025.

Second, on July 4, 2025, the President of the United States signed into law the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (the “Act”). The Act made sweeping changes to the rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), relating to energy tax credits, including the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (“Section 45Z Tax Credit”) under Section 45Z of the Code.

This Client Alert summarizes key proposed changes to the RFS program and to the Section 45Z Tax Credit.

EPA’s Proposed Set 2 Rule Seeks to Expand Renewable Fuel Volumes While Disfavoring Foreign Feedstock and Fuel

On June 17, 2025, EPA proposed the Set 2 Rule. This proposal reflects the Trump Administration’s efforts to protect and grow domestic renewable fuel production while disfavoring foreign feedstocks and fuel.

First, EPA intends to continue expanding the renewable fuel volume requirements for 2026 and 2027 at a rate similar to the 2023–2025 rule—leading to the highest volume requirements in the history of the RFS program.2 As shown below, EPA has taken a particular interest in increasing biomass-based diesel production, which EPA states will provide support for domestic soybean farmers and feedstock producers.

More importantly, though, EPA proposes reducing the number of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) generated for imported renewable fuel and domestic renewable fuel produced from foreign feedstocks by half. As such, domestic renewable feedstocks and fuels are intended to outpace foreign sources in RIN generation, incentivizing businesses to end their reliance on foreign feedstocks and production facilities. To support this change, EPA has asserted a need to decrease America’s reliance on imports, promote American production, support rural agricultural sectors, and increase American energy security.

To implement and enforce this change, EPA also proposes that domestic renewable fuel producers will be required to keep records of feedstock purchases and transfers (e.g., bills of sale or delivery receipts) and report each feedstock’s point of origin (i.e., foreign or domestic) as part of their renewable fuel batch reports. These requirements are added as EPA expresses concern that bad actors may try to claim foreign feedstock as domestic to gain a financial benefit. EPA states that these new recordkeeping and reporting requirements are “minimally onerous” given the RFS program’s current recordkeeping obligations. EPA is also adding requirements for attest engagement auditors and QAP providers to verify that feedstock point of origin was correctly reported.

Finally, EPA proposes to reduce the equivalence value for renewable diesel from 1.7 to 1.6 to account for the non-renewable portion of the fuel. Likewise, EPA proposes an equivalence value of 1.6 for jet fuel, which previously had been determined on a facility-by-facility basis.

Comments on the proposed Set 2 Rule are due by August 8, 2025.

Changes to Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit

The Act includes changes to the eligibility for and the calculation of the amount of the Section 45Z Tax Credit. The Act also includes new foreign entities of concern restrictions, which largely uphold the prior Senate version of the Act. Below is a summary of key changes in the Act as they relate to the Section 45Z Tax Credit.

Section 45Z of the Code provides for a production tax credit for each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) and non-SAF clean transportation fuels produced at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated buyer. The producer must be registered as a clean fuel producer.

The credit amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable amount per gallon of qualifying fuel by the “emissions factor” for SAF or non-SAF transportation fuel. Prior to the Act and for fuel produced through December 31, 2025, the applicable amount was 35 cents per gallon for SAF and 20 cents per gallon for non-SAF clean transportation fuel. The applicable amount was increased to $1.00 per gallon and $1.75 per gallon, respectively, if certain “prevailing wage and apprenticeship” requirements are satisfied. In order to qualify for the Section 45Z Tax Credit, transportation fuel and SAF cannot have an emissions rate greater than 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU. The statute authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to publish annual emissions rate requirements the fuel must meet to qualify for the credit and to issue guidance for implementation of Section 45Z.

The Act eliminates the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF (i.e., up to $1.75 per gallon) by capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF. This change would limit the Section 45Z Tax Credit available with respect to SAF produced after December 31, 2025.

The Section 45Z Tax Credit was scheduled to expire at the end of 2027 under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Act extends the Section 45Z Credit through 2029. Although this extension is down from 2031 proposed in the earlier House and Senate versions of the Act, it still provides certainty for renewable fuel project developers and investors for the next four years.

The Act also changes how lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for purposes of the Section 45Z Tax Credit. Specifically, the Act excludes any emissions associated with indirect land use change. Effective January 1, 2026, the proposal would increase the value of the credit for renewable fuels produced from crop-based feedstocks such as corn ethanol and canola biodiesel. Furthermore, under the Act, for transportation fuels derived from animal manure—such as dairy manure, swine manure, and poultry manure—a distinct emissions rate would be provided with respect to each of the specific feedstocks used to produce eligible fuel.

The Act imposes certain limits on the use of foreign feedstocks. The Act modifies Section 45Z to prevent the use of certain foreign feedstocks outside of North America (i.e., United States, Mexico, and Canada), such as used cooking oil from China. This is consistent with the prior House version of the Act. The prior Senate version would have allowed the use of feedstocks outside the United States but would reduce the credit amount by 20% effective January 1, 2026.

The Act includes new foreign entity of concern provisions applicable to many energy tax credits, including the Section 45Z Tax Credit. In general, these rules restrict various energy tax credits by prohibiting them from being claimed by taxpayers or projects that engage in certain activities with, or otherwise have, significant relationships to “prohibited foreign entities.” There are two sets of restrictions applicable to energy tax credits: Under the first set of restrictions, no Section 45Z Tax Credit would be allowed if a renewable fuel project is owned by a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-influenced entity” (as defined in proposed Section 7701(a)(51) of the Code). Under the second set of restrictions, no Section 45Z Tax Credit would be allowed if the project received “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity (i.e., a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity); however, restrictions based on “material assistance” are not applicable to the Section 45Z Tax Credit.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 added Section 6418 to the Code, which allows eligible taxpayers to transfer all or portion of their eligible credits (including the Section 45Z Tax Credit) for cash to an unrelated taxpayer. The prior House version proposed repealing the tax credit transferability, including for the Section 45Z Tax Credit attributable to SAF or non-SAF clean transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2027. The Act retains the tax credit transferability provision under Section 6418 but prohibits transfers of any portion of eligible tax credits to specified foreign entities.

Outlook

With the U.S. Congress’s and the Trump Administration’s focus on domestic renewable fuel, companies should consider the financial impact of overseas operations. Fuel producers should also be prepared for new reporting requirements to ensure their RFS eligibility and to obtain the benefits of the Section 45Z Tax credit.

One example is Air New Zealand, which currently has 14 Trent 1000-powered 787s but no GEnx models, but has three GEnx 787s on order.
Rolls-Royce introduced the Trent 1000 TEN in 2016, which upgraded the engine's heat resistance, high-pressure turbine blade, and software.
These strengths have led some airlines that previously received Rolls-Royce-powered 787s to opt for purchasing new aircraft with General Electric engines.
However, this engine also has its drawbacks that may leave some airlines regretting their decision to shift towards the General Electric engine.","Issues with Trent 1000-powered aircraft have severely hampered many Boeing 787 operators. British Airways has blamed many of these issues on shortages caused by Rolls-Royce. This is the latest in a string of bad news for the Trent 1000 program, which has seen some airlines switching to General Electric's GEnx for their Boeing 787 Dreamliner orders.

This article explores the combination of GEnx strengths and Trent 1000 weaknesses that have led many airlines to opt for the GEnx, along with signs that General Electric will continue to hold dominance over the widebody aircraft market. It finishes with thoughts on whether some airlines may start to regret their commitment to GEnx-powered 787s over the coming years.

The Airlines Choosing GEnx-Powered 787s

Recent months have seen many airlines, some of whom operate Trent 1000-powered 787s, opting for the GEnx on their pending orders. One example is Air New Zealand, which currently has 14 Trent 1000-powered 787s but no GEnx models, but has three GEnx 787s on order. More significant is All Nippon Airways, which has 78 Rolls-Royce-powered 787s and just seven GEnx examples. Meanwhile, the carrier has 15 GEnx 787s on order.

Perhaps the most damning example for Rolls-Royce is British Airways, which currently operates 41 Trent 1000-powered 787s. However, the carrier has opted to order six GEnx-powered Dreamliners. This indicates a split between two iconic British companies that have previously shared exceptionally close relationships. For example, in 2007, British Airways opted for more Boeing 777s powered by Trent 800 engines. Mike Terrett, then-President of Civil Aerospace at Rolls-Royce, reflected on the two companies' closeness:

""The Trent’s selection reflects British Airways’ positive view of the engine’s in-service performance, while the extension of the TotalCare contract is an endorsement of the maintenance agreements which have been in place for the last seven years. Repeat business sends a strong signal, and I’m delighted that we are expanding our fleet presence with a world-class customer.”

Smaller 787 operators have also opted to move away from the Trent 1000. For example, Air Tanzania operates 2 Trent 1000 and 1 GEnx-powered Dreamliners. The African carrier has opted for GEnx engines on its single 787 on order.

Why Might Airlines Prefer The GEnx-1B?

The GEnx-1B is the ideal engine for the 787 Dreamliner's mission of achieving low operating costs and high efficiency in aviation for several reasons. It outperforms the Trent 1000 in operating expenses and carbon emissions. The GEnx is also a more reliable engine, with fewer unscheduled removals, which allows for fewer disrupted flights.

The table below compares the key statistics for the 787 engine operations. The selected GEnx variant (-1b74/75) is the engine used for the 787-9:

The GEnx is also attractive in the marketplace because it powers the 747-8, although only the -2B67B variant has this role. That makes General Electric's engine ideal for carriers that have a mixture of 787s and 747s, as this combination represents a reduction in maintenance challenges.

Reliability Concerns Continue To Hamper The Dreamliner

A key reason that many carriers have opted to move away from the Trent 1000 is its seemingly endless reliability issues. A significant problem is blade cracking, first experienced by All Nippon Airways, and later impacting Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic. These airlines had to ground some 787s in 2017. High-pressure turbine wear and compressor fatigue have also caused airlines problems. These issues necessitate financially crippling maintenance and repairs.

Rolls-Royce's 2017 annual report promised that these issues would be addressed. The company wrote:

""“We continue to make solid progress with longer-term solutions, largely through the re-design of affected parts, and we expect these to be fully embodied in the Trent 1000 fleet by 2022.”

However, given the unconvincing nature of Rolls-Royce's past efforts to improve the Trent 1000's reliability, this promise will not inspire confidence in its customers. Rolls-Royce introduced the Trent 1000 TEN in 2016, which upgraded the engine's heat resistance, high-pressure turbine blade, and software. The fact that the market is moving away from the Trent 1000 indicates such efforts have not managed to turn around negative perceptions of the engine.

The 777X And Another Case of General Electric's Widebody Dominance

Rolls-Royce was able to secure its position as one of the engine options for the Dreamliner, although its performance has underwhelmed some carriers. This was not achieved for the upcoming 777X, which will be powered exclusively by the General Electric GE-9X, demonstrating an impressive dominance for General Electric in the widebody industry.

The GE-9X is slated to be the largest and most powerful commercial jet engine ever built. Such power is necessary because just two of these engines will power an enormous aircraft. This engine has already undergone 27,000 cycles and 17,000 hours of testing, including 1,600 cycles of dust ingestion tests. This testing is more than any other GE Aerospace engine of previous years has undergone before entering into service. It has now started rolling off the production line, allowing 777X production to get back on track. Tyler-Blair Sheppard, head of marketing for the GE9X, said:

“We’ve run the heck out of the engine, and customers have been really impressed by the dust test data coming back, which is the equivalent of almost three years of normal use on the engine... It will all result in a more durable engine in harsh environments.”

However, the 777X has continued to be delayed, and deliveries are not expected until 2026. In this context, the GE-9X is yet to be tested under actual commercial operating conditions. No matter how many hours the engine puts in on the testbed, its actual capacity cannot be known until its trials in the real world begin.

Rolls-Royce Fights Back

Rolls-Royce isn't going down from the widebody aircraft market without a fight. It has been working on the UltraFan, the world's largest commercial aviation engine. This jet can produce 85,000 lbs of thrust, and Airbus wants to work with the manufacturer to produce the most efficient long-range engine yet.

This engine was first tested in 2023, powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgic, described the importance of the engine for Rolls-Royce and aviation's future:

""The UltraFan demonstrator is a game changer - the technologies we are testing as part of this programme have the capability to improve the engines of today as well as the engines of tomorrow. That is why this announcement is so important - we are witnessing history in the making, a step-change in engine efficiency improvement.""

Not only will the UltraFan be highly efficient and powerful, but it is also set to be compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Such capabilities will allow Rolls-Royce to be at the forefront of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Will The Shift Towards General Electric Have Drawbacks?

As has been seen, the GEnx-1B is a preferable choice for a huge number of 787 operators. This engine is more reliable and efficient, leading to more profitable services that depart on time. These strengths have led some airlines that previously received Rolls-Royce-powered 787s to opt for purchasing new aircraft with General Electric engines. This decision will come at a substantial cost for carriers as many will need to invest in new maintenance infrastructure to keep their General Electric-powered aircraft in the skies.

However, this engine also has its drawbacks that may leave some airlines regretting their decision to shift towards the General Electric engine. The primary concern is that some airlines have experienced performance drops when operating in high temperatures. Such issues can cause airlines to struggle when operating in particularly warm climates, such as the deserts of the Middle East. General Electric has been working to overcome the difficulties of operating in such environments by undertaking 400 hours of 'sandstorm' testing in 2020. Shawn Pearson, GEnx Engineering Leader, said:

“These tests are specifically conducted for operators and our direct customers who use their aircraft in areas of the world that we technically call ‘Severe Operating Environment’ or SOE—desert areas, such as Africa and the Middle East, or regions affected by certain environmental phenomena that spread sand or dust. Sand can degrade the cooling muscle in our hot section components—like combustors, but also turbines—and create distress in protective coatings, accelerating hardware damage and leading to early engine removals.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/engines.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 11:19:26.223536

The move is part of ORLEN’s wider plan to support cleaner energy use and reduce pollution caused by air travel.

The new fuel, which is made using waste materials like used cooking oil and agricultural or industrial leftovers, can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its full production and use cycle, depending on the materials and process used. The SAF is blended with regular jet fuel, so it works in current aircraft without the need for any modifications.

“We’re introducing SAF to help lower emissions from aviation and offer airlines a practical way to fly cleaner,” said an ORLEN spokesperson. “This is a big step toward our long-term goal of offering more eco-friendly energy options.”

SAF is already being used in other countries, and now Poland is joining the push for cleaner skies. Airlines using Polish airports have welcomed the change, noting that it helps them meet growing environmental expectations.

The new offering also helps ORLEN meet upcoming European Union rules. Starting in 2025, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation will require that 2% of all jet fuel sold in the region comes from sustainable sources. That share is set to rise to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The rules apply to EU airports that served over 800,000 passengers or moved 100,000 tonnes of cargo the previous year.

To meet the growing need for SAF and reduce dependence on imported components, ORLEN is building a special facility at its Plock refinery. The plant will make aviation fuel from used cooking oil and is expected to be ready in 2025. Until then, the company will continue importing SAF materials from abroad.

“This is just the beginning,” said the spokesperson. “We’re working hard to build the supply here in Poland, so the aviation sector can make real progress in cutting emissions.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-17.png,N,,2025-07-11 11:19:45.768066

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) will temporarily shut its 3,00,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser at the Panipat refinery to upgrade it for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil (UCO).

SAF Production to Begin by 2026

The upgrade, scheduled for late 2025 or early 2026, is expected to yield 30,000 metric tons of SAF annually, according to Arvind Kumar, Head of Refineries at IOCL. Nevertheless, diesel production will remain unaffected during the shutdown, as backup hydrotreaters at the site will continue to ensure uninterrupted output.

Supporting India’s SAF Blending Targets

The strategic move is part of India’s broader effort to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. The government has set a target to blend one percent SAF by 2027, with plans to increase this to two percent by 2028. IOCL’s Panipat upgrade aligns directly with these national goals.

More SAF Projects in the Pipeline

Beyond Panipat, IOCL is evaluating retrofit options for other kerosene-producing units across its network of refineries. These upgrades will further expand SAF production capacity and contribute to India’s decarbonisation agenda.

Green Hydrogen Bids to Open Soon

IOCL plans to invite bids shortly for a new 70,000 tonnes-per-year green hydrogen facility and an additional SAF project. This comes as part of IOCL’s commitment to scaling up clean energy initiatives.

Major carriers like United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Alaska Air Group (ALK), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) saw big gains. This happened after Delta shared its positive financial report and full-year guidance update.

But what about the airline’s environmental and sustainability impact? The company’s net-zero journey shows equally impressive progress.

Delta’s Q2 Performance Sparks Market Optimism

Delta’s stock alone jumped by about 12.5%, making it the top mover of the day. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.10, beating analyst forecasts of $2.05–$2.08. Revenue climbed to $15.5 billion, exceeding the expected range of $15.42–$16.41 billion.

Delta also restored its full-year 2025 guidance, showing management’s confidence. This was important because most major airlines, like Delta, stopped giving forecasts earlier this year. They were worried about global economic instability, especially due to President Trump’s new tariff policies.

Now, Delta expects full-year earnings per share between $5.25 and $6.25, with free cash flow projected to range from $3 billion to $4 billion. These results gave investors a clear signal that the travel sector may be turning a corner.

Sympathy Rally Lifts the Entire Airline Sector

Delta’s upbeat results caused a “sympathy rally.” This is when good news from one company boosts others in the same industry. Here’s how key players performed:

United Airlines (UAL) surged between 9.4%and 14%, reaching over $89 per share.

American Airlines (AAL) rose by 7.8% to 13%, closing in on its 200-day moving average.

Alaska Airlines (ALK) gained nearly 10%, adding more than $5 per share.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) posted a more modest gain of 2.8% to 3.4%.

This rise shows that investors are more confident now. This comes after a tough start to 2025, which was marked by trade tensions and fluctuating fuel prices.

Analysts liked Delta’s earnings report. They expect United and American Airlines will also do well in their next earnings announcements. Deutsche Bank, among others, forecast continued strong results across the sector.

For investors, these trends suggest that the airline sector may be entering a more stable and profitable phase, following the turbulence of early 2025. But how about the sector’s environmental footprint? Let’s take a closer look at Delta’s sustainability and climate goals.

Delta Airlines: In Route Toward Net Zero

As climate concerns grow and investor pressure mounts, Delta Air Lines has taken firm steps toward its long-term sustainability goals. The company aims to become the first carbon-neutral airline globally and has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

This goal covers three areas: Direct operations (Scope 1), indirect emissions from energy use (Scope 2), and some Scope 3 emissions like upstream fuel production and corporate travel.

Since nearly 90% of its greenhouse gas emissions come from jet fuel, reaching net-zero by 2050 requires Delta to effectively decarbonize its flight operations. The company’s sustainability strategy is designed to support this goal by focusing on:

What We Fly — transitioning its fleet to more fuel-efficient aircraft

How We Fly — adopting new technologies, procedures, and other strategies to improve fuel efficiency

The Fuel We Use — collaborating to scale supply and reduce the cost of SAF

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): A Key Ingredient

One of Delta’s biggest bets in reducing emissions is sustainable aviation fuel. SAF comes from renewable sources like used cooking oil or plant waste. It can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% when compared to traditional jet fuel.

Delta has signed several major SAF purchase agreements, including:

A long-term agreement with Neste to purchase 10 million gallons of SAF per year.

A partnership with Gevo, with the potential for 75 million gallons annually starting in 2026.

The company’s goal is to replace at least 10% of its conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2030, a target aligned with broader aviation industry goals. Below is the company’s SAF purchases:

Cleaner Planes and Smarter Flying

Delta is also focused on fleet renewal—replacing older planes with newer, more efficient models. The latest Airbus A321neos and A220s offer 20–25% better fuel efficiency per seat, helping lower emissions on each flight.

In addition, Delta uses AI and data analytics to optimize flight routes and reduce fuel burn. The company added lighter seats and cabin materials to cut aircraft weight. It also improved aerodynamics to save energy while flying.

Ground Operations and Renewable Energy

Beyond the skies, Delta is greening its ground operations. So far, the airline has:

Converted over 25% of its ground service equipment to electric or hybrid.

Purchased renewable electricity for 100% of its operations at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport—Delta’s largest hub.

Set a goal to electrify 50% of its ground operations by 2025.

Carbon Offsets: A Transitional Tool

While Delta previously announced carbon neutrality starting in 2020, it primarily relied on carbon offset credits to compensate for emissions. These carbon credits supported projects like forest protection and methane capture. In 2022, Delta shifted away from offsets. They decided to focus on reducing actual emissions instead of using compensatory measures.

This move reflects the industry-wide demand for real climate impact and transparency in offset claims. Delta now uses offsets sparingly and only in cases where decarbonization options are limited.

Tracking Progress

According to Delta’s latest difference report, the company has emitted over 60 million tonnes of CO2e. It has achieved the following progress in cutting its emissions:

The company cut its Scope 1 emissions intensity by 13% compared to 2019 levels.

Delta invested $1 billion over 10 years in a long-term climate strategy starting in 2020.

It avoided 1.7 million metric tons of CO₂ through efficiency improvements and SAF use between 2021 and 2023.

Public Accountability and Disclosure

Delta regularly publishes climate data through its annual ESG and TCFD reports. The company joined the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). It shares risks about climate change, policies, and fuel prices. In 2023, Delta ranked among the top U.S. airlines for climate transparency.

Earnings Up, Green Goals Still in Sight

Delta’s net-zero plan is one of the most comprehensive in the airline industry. It combines technology, SAF, operational efficiency, and transparency to make measurable progress. The company faces challenges, like scaling SAF production and electrifying long trips. Still, its recent actions show a strong commitment to growth and environmental responsibility.

Delta’s strong Q2 2025 results have not only boosted its stock but also lifted the entire airline industry. Behind the numbers is a broader story of operational resilience, pricing discipline, and strategic planning during uncertain times.

At the same time, Delta is showing that profitability and sustainability can go hand in hand.

Background information

The Regulation that put the Flight Emissions Label (FEL) in place was adopted in December 2024 by the European Commission and aims to empower passengers with information on flight-related emissions, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking and comparing flights. The label will also increase accountability within the aviation sector by establishing a harmonised emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the European Union. Building on a fully digitalised process, FEL will also reduce the administrative burden for the sector.

The FEL provides a trustworthy framework for airlines to share flight emissions data with passengers. Airlines from both EU and non-EU countries, covered under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 “ReFuelEU Aviation”, can voluntarily join the FEL. Only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the European Union, in accordance with Article 6(5) of the Regulation. The European Commission and EASA encourage airlines to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when, for example, offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other emissions offsets to passengers.

The Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) will support the internal decision-making process within the aircraft operators through a guided onboarding process performed by EASA experts. This will allow the group to have an initial pre-assessment of the label values generated, as well as an indication of the efforts involved. As part of this, Air France-KLM will test the digital channels as the EASA Flight Emission Portal, the data reporting process, and the administrative effort required.

For its part, Air France-KLM voluntarily agrees to provide emissions-related data under Article 3 FEL to support the assessment and indicative generation of flight emissions pursuant to Article 5 FEL. The data submitted will include, in accordance with Article 3 FEL, actual flight performance data, such as the aviation fuel consumption and time per flight, the average load factors and freight carried, as well as the amount and type of aviation fuels (fossil kerosene and SAF) consumed per airport. This will enable the prospective coverage of emissions labels for upcoming operations.

Note: Article 14(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation) establishes a voluntary environmental labelling scheme enabling the environmental performance of flights to be measured, open to all aircraft operators falling within the scope of that Regulation.

After four decades of partnership, China has become Airbus' largest single-country market for commercial aircraft, with Airbus planes now accounting for over 50 percent of the active fleet in the country's civil aviation sector.

Moreover, Airbus' collaboration with China has evolved beyond aircraft exports to encompass the entire product lifecycle, ranging from R&D to manufacturing, assembly, operational support and even end-of-life disassembly and recycling.

""The past 40 years of Airbus in China have represented an extraordinary success story achieved with our Chinese partners,"" said Erik Buschmann, chief operating officer of Airbus China, adding that not only has China's aviation industry flourished, but Airbus has also witnessed the rapid expansion of its fleet in the country.

Airbus has established deep roots in China, extending beyond aircraft sales by maintaining full-function teams across all business segments nationwide. ""Most notably, our cooperation has evolved from pure aircraft sales to deep industrial collaboration, which gives us a competitive edge,"" Xu said.

According to the CEO, Airbus has established comprehensive industrial facilities in China, including an engineering center in Beijing, a composite materials manufacturing center in Heilongjiang Province, and an aircraft Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Tianjin Municipality.

Airbus established its A320 family FAL in Tianjin in 2008, marking its first commercial aircraft assembly line outside Europe. To date, the facility has assembled over 750 A320 family aircraft for customers worldwide, becoming a flagship project of China-Europe economic and trade cooperation.

""This series of mutually beneficial collaborations has propelled the development of China's aviation industry while significantly boosting Airbus' market share and industrial resilience in China,"" Xu said.

Currently, around 200 Chinese suppliers support Airbus' commercial aircraft production, covering the entire industrial chain from upstream raw materials to downstream fuselage equipping. All Airbus commercial aircraft models now incorporate components manufactured in China. The annual value of Airbus' industrial cooperation with the country exceeds 1 billion U.S. dollars.

The second A320 family FAL project in Tianjin serves as a cornerstone of Airbus' five-year development plan and marks the next major milestone in its growth journey in China.

The project is expected to start operation in early 2026. Upon completion, Tianjin will establish a complete setup comprising two single-aisle aircraft production lines and one wide-body aircraft completion center. This will double Airbus' A320 family FAL production capacity in China, providing strong support for the company's global production ramp-up, according to the company.

Buschmann noted that the second A320 family FAL currently under construction also reflects Airbus' commitment to doubling its overall industrial footprint in China. ""Looking ahead to the next 40 years, we are highly confident in growing together with China's civil aviation industry. Airbus remains dedicated to deepening its presence in the Chinese market and maintaining excellent partnerships,"" Buschmann said.

Green and digital transformation will become key focus areas for bilateral supply chain collaboration.

""Europe and China share similar decarbonization commitments. Airbus is acting as a catalyst to accelerate the application of sustainable aviation fuel, while China holds multiple advantages in sustainable energy. There are significant prospects for our collaboration in markets, technology, and production capacity,"" Xu said.

Earlier this year, Airbus became the first foreign aviation enterprise in China to obtain a value-added telecom license. ""We see vast potential for future cooperation in building smart civil aviation and are willing to continue working with Chinese partners to forge a sustainable future for the aviation industry,"" Xu added. ■",,N,,2025-07-11 11:20:18.789771

While the company's Q1 2025 results disappointed on earnings and revenue, its stock soared 7.8% on the day of the release—a signal that Wall Street sees more than meets the eye. Let's dive into why Neste's long-term bets on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and its relentless cost-cutting could make this a “buy the dip” opportunity.

The Near-Term Storm: Missed Targets, but a Strategic Shift

Neste's Q1 2025 results were a mixed bag. Revenue fell short of forecasts, and the company reported a negative cash flow of €225 million, largely due to inventory normalization after prior-quarter refinery outages. Comparable EBITDA of €210 million also lagged expectations, with the Renewable Products segment hit by high feedstock costs for Chinese YUKO and Indonesian oils.

But here's the key takeaway: Neste is not just a fuel company—it's a climate tech play. The stock's surge suggests investors are pricing in the future, not the past. The company's performance improvement program, targeting €350 million in annualized cost savings by 2026, is already yielding results, with a €52 million annualized run rate achieved in Q1. This program includes refinery efficiency gains, streamlined logistics, and procurement overhauls—moves that will directly boost EBITDA margins as production scales.

The Green Bond Gambit: Funding Growth Without Breaking the Bank

Neste's issuance of a €700 million green bond in Q1 2025 wasn't just a financing move—it was a strategic masterstroke. The funds are fueling the expansion of its Rotterdam refinery into a 1.5 million-ton SAF powerhouse, which will be critical to meeting Europe's ReFuelEU mandate (6% SAF blend by 2030). This expansion, paired with its Singapore facility's flexibility to dodge U.S. tariffs, positions Neste to dominate SAF distribution in both regions.

Meanwhile, Neste's leverage ratio remains disciplined at below 40%, thanks to a refinanced €1.3 billion credit facility. This financial flexibility is vital as it ramps up capital expenditures to €1.2 billion in 2025—a bet that could pay off handsomely as SAF demand surges.

The DHL Deal: A Lifeline for SAF Demand

Neste's partnership with DHL, announced in Q1, is a game-changer. The logistics giant committed to buying 300,000 tons of neat SAF annually by 2030, locking in a massive customer for Neste's Rotterdam output. This deal isn't just about volume—it's about proving SAF's commercial viability. DHL's Sustainability Roadmap, which aims for 30% SAF blending by 2030, aligns perfectly with Neste's production timeline.

The Overhang? Overblown.

Critics will point to near-term headwinds: oversupply in renewable fuels, margin pressure from feedstock costs, and geopolitical risks. But here's why they're wrong:

1. SAF's regulatory tailwinds: The EU's ReFuelEU and U.S. incentives will force airlines to buy SAF, even at higher prices.

2. Neste's feedstock advantage: Its reliance on 97% waste/residue-based feedstocks ensures compliance with strict sustainability standards, giving it a leg up on competitors.

3. Cost-cutting is real: The performance program's savings are already materializing, and further refinery efficiencies could flip margins in 2026.

The Bull Case: SAF is the Next Big Thing

The global SAF market is set to explode. Analysts project demand to hit 20 million tons annually by 2030, up from just 1 million tons today. Neste's first-mover advantage—with 130 kilotons sold in Q1, tripling year-over-year—is a goldmine.

Buy, Hold, or Bail?

Neste isn't a “set it and forget it” investment. The path to profitability is littered with potholes like feedstock price spikes and geopolitical trade wars. But for investors with a 3-5 year horizon, here's why Neste is a buy:

- Valuation: The stock trades at just 7.95 euros, a discount to its peers in sustainable energy.

- Catalysts: Rotterdam's ramp-up, DHL's offtake, and 2026 EBITDA targets all create potential upside.

- Moat: Neste's technical expertise in refining complex feedstocks and its existing scale in SAF production are hard to replicate.

Final Call

Neste Oyj is a company in transition—fighting short-term pain for long-term gain. While Q1's misses are a speed bump, its strategic moves in SAF, cost discipline, and partnerships like DHL make it a must-watch stock for green investors. If you believe in the future of sustainable aviation, Neste is the jet fuel of choice.

Action: Buy Neste at current levels, with a 12-month price target of €10-12 euros as SAF demand takes off.

In the 100 years since Fred Rentschler formed Pratt & Whitney (P&W), the company has been at the forefront of aero-engine technologies, leading the way with a series of era-defining milestone projects.

In July 1925, Rentschler teamed up with George J Mead and a small cadre of colleagues with whom they had both previously worked at Wright Aeronautical to develop a new, lightweight, air-cooled, radial engine for the US Navy. With a promising concept, but lacking funds, Rentschler approached the Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool Company, which was emerging from the WW1-era with cash in hand and a glut of manufacturing capacity. The organisation loaned Rentschler $250,000 (around $4.5m today), the use of the P&W name and space in its building. It proved to be a shrewd investment as the first example of the 425hp P&W R-1340 Wasp engine was completed by Christmas Eve. By the time production finished, more than 363,000 members of the Wasp family had been built.

Shifts in architecture

To mark the centenary of P&W, AEROSPACE spoke with Dr Michael ‘Doc’ Winter FRAeS, chief scientist at RTX, the global aerospace and defence giant which is now the engine maker’s parent company.

“When you are designing an aircraft or an engine, it is the architecture that matters most,” explained Winter. “The radial configuration of the Wasp allowed air cooling and this step change in architecture was groundbreaking as it led to an increase in thrust to weight ratio by a factor of around 2.5:1.”

This shift, Winter emphasises, is what the company has done repeatedly over the past century and continues to do today. “After WW2 we took the basic jet engine and, via an architectural shift, created the twin-spool J-57 which, although it was designed for military use, also opened up economics that enabled commercial jet travel.”

Low bypass engines in turn led to high bypass turbofans and, by the late 1990s, the company began working on what Winter considers the next ‘step change’ – the PW1000G geared turbofan (GTF) family, which ultimately entered service in 2016 on the Airbus A320neo. “The GTF represents about a 16% improvement in fuel burn,” he explained, adding that, “I take pride in the fact that the modern gas turbine engine is the most sophisticated mass-produced device known to humankind.”

More runway ahead

One of P&W’s significant step changes in recent years has been the introduction of the PW1000G geared turbofan, which provided around a 16% improvement in fuel burn compared to earlier engines. (RTX)

In today's engines, the performance is governed by the efficiency of the fan, the bypass duct and the nozzle. “That propulsive efficiency is then multiplied by the thermal efficiency of the core,” explained Winter. “This is where we take the energy that is stored in the fuel, liberate it and turn it into motion on the shaft. When we introduced the GTF we created a step change in propulsive efficiency but we also recognised that there was a lot of runway ahead of us to go much deeper into the design.”

Further investigation is under way, looking at increasing the gear ratio and boosting the bypass ratio to allow more air to bypass the engine’s core. “We have so far improved the thermal efficiency of the jet engine by 400%, compared to Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain’s pioneering engines,” added Winter. “If you plot that relative to the ideal thermodynamics, we're tracking at about 60-70% of ideal efficiencies. However, it turns out that if you extend that line to higher temperatures and pressures all the way to the stoichiometric limit of the fuel, then we've only come halfway.”

Hybrid sweet spot

The engine manufacturer has tested its various engines using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), including the most recent GTF Advantage – the latest iteration of the original GTF, which offers improved fuel efficiency, thrust and durability. “Once there is a certified 100% SAF, our engines will be ready for it,” he said.

Meanwhile, P&W engineers are reimagining commercial propulsion systems as what he refers to as “a hybrid-electric, cyber-physical machine that I can control in new and important ways.” Having looked across all the domains of flight, P&W has found what Winter refers to as “a sweet spot” somewhere between a half a megawatt to a megawatt for hybrid-electric. “That size of power output is enabling urban air mobility (UAM), whereas a [conventionally-powered] regional turboprop is powered by 2,000-3,000shp – which is roughly 2MW to 3MW,” he explained. “In a mild hybrid electric configuration 0.5-1MW can contribute meaningfully to performance.”

It is an area where P&W collaborates closely with its RTX sister business Collins Aerospace, a pioneer in aircraft electric systems, which today offers a range of power-dense electric motor and control systems, ranging from 250kW to 1MW and beyond. The businesses are currently exploring hybrid-electric applications of these motors across various demonstrator programmes.

In terms of regional turboprops, P&W has developed a system which uses the same novel gas generator, motors and drives but architected to be used as a parallel hybrid. “In this configuration you can either draw power from the electrical system or from the gas generator into a common gearbox that drives the propeller on a turboprop,” he explained. “We have built that engine and run it through the mission up to full power and we are now integrating that onto a Dash-8-100 airframe that is likely to fly in 2026. We anticipate the hybrid system will generate up to 50% of the total power required, allowing for a fuel improvement of up to 30%.”

The company has also partnered with Airbus Helicopters to develop a hybrid-electric propulsion for the PioneerLab demonstrator project, which will combine two 0.25MW scale electric motor generators alongside a P&W Canada PW210 turboshaft. Winter also emphasised that work is under way with the EU’s Clean Aviation programme as part of Phase 1 of the Sustainable Water-Injecting Turbofan Comprising Hybrid-Electrics (SWITCH) project, which will develop a hybrid-electric GTF demonstrator engine. It is important to note that using such a system will allow times in the mission where the engine can work at its optimal efficiency – “we are not just replacing fuel with electrons,” emphasises Winter. “In fact, we land with full batteries.”

Hydrogen hopes

P&W’s Hydrogen Steam Injected, Inter‐Cooled Turbine Engine (HySIITE) harnesses the cold of the hydrogen to condense the water. It is then trapped by the exhaust and reinvested in the thermodynamic cycle. (RTX)

Many airframe and propulsion developers have pinned great hopes on hydrogen as a wonder fuel. “It has three times the energy density per unit mass of kerosene at 121 megajoules (MJ) per kg,” explained Winter, “but it takes up four times the volume and you really need to store it as a cryogenic liquid. That means finding space for both the fuel and the means to keep it at -253C.”

However, P&W has experience in hydrogen exploration going back 60 years. “In the 1950s, when the CIA discovered that the USSR had missiles capable of reaching the high-altitude Lockheed U-2 spyplanes, designer Clarence ‘Kelly’ Johnson conceived of an aeroplane that burned hydrogen and flew at 100,000ft,” shared Winter. “We [P&W] had the contract to develop the engine for what was codenamed Project Suntan. It used a thermodynamic expander cycle and we ran that engine in 1958. In the first quarter of this current decade, we dusted off those blueprints and studied the architecture to see how it could be used in a modern gas turbine.”

Of course, there are different considerations today than in the 1950s and the fact that burning hydrogen produces higher levels of nitrogen oxides is no longer acceptable. “When I burn hydrogen, if I balance the chemical reaction at the equivalent thrust point, I will produce 2.6 times more water [than kerosene],” added Winter. “Water, of course, plays a role in the formation of contrails, which are known to participate in the overall albedo of the Earth and its climate.”

However, Winter suggests there is a way to turn these challenges into opportunities: “We have conceived the new architecture of an engine called the Hydrogen Steam Injected, Intercooled Turbine Engine (HySIITE). This takes the cold of the hydrogen and harnesses it to condense the water. The exhaust of the engine traps that water so that it does not escape as emissions and reinvests it in the thermodynamic cycle.”

It has been known since the dawn of the jet age that injecting water into engines produces more thrust – as evidenced by film of smoky B-52s taking off in the 1960s. Winter explained: “we take advantage of the water byproduct to cool the flow and increase the density. In turn, we can shrink the size of the engine, reducing its mass and improving the thermal efficiency. Research by the stationary gas turbine industry also shows that adding water reduces the oxides of nitrogen.”

The key enablers for such an engine are a heat exchanger that can be mounted in the exhaust temperature and pressure flows. Recent rig tests of key components – part of a project supported by the US Department of Energy’s ARPA-E agency – delivered promising results. “We have demonstrated, first and foremost, that we can get that heat exchanger to function and continue to function in that environment,” he continued. “That was the first technology ‘brick’. The second was when we discovered that we could capture significant amounts of the water by using the coolant flow in the equivalent exhaust system. In fact, we have been able to capture the equivalent of one gallon of water every three seconds. The third ‘brick’ was being able to inject that water into a combustor system and look at the impact on the oxides of nitrogen.”

In rig testing of key engine components, the scientists discovered that if the engine was fed with 100% hydrogen, they could reduce the oxides of nitrogen by 99.3%, compared to a benchmark GTF engine. Furthermore, Winter claims a 35% increase in fuel efficiency compared to today’s conventional engines, mostly thanks to the ability to shrink the size of the engine core and recover heat energy. With both airlines and air forces quoting 30-40% of their costs coming from fuel burn, these efficiency savings show immense promise.

While the HySIITE project has concluded, P&W continues to study hydrogen-enabling technologies, including at its Canadian arm where engineers are working to demonstrate hydrogen combustion on PW127XT turboprop engines as part of a project known as HyADES (Hydrogen ADvanced Engine Study). However, hydrogen’s long-term future is currently limited – not because of its capabilities but because of the sheer lack of available ‘green’ hydrogen.

Around 95% of the hydrogen produced in the world today is manufactured using fossil fuel sources and, furthermore, is mostly used in the production of ammonia. “Ammonia is a main ingredient in fertiliser and so we do not want to compromise the food chain,” clarified Winter. “Plus, if we are relying on the grid to make hydrogen, clean water is also something of a limited commodity. Crucially, if you use 90% of the hydrogen that was produced last year you would only have enough energy to power 10% of the commercial airline fleet on an equivalent energy basis.” The investment in the infrastructure to generate, move and store green hydrogen must be a priority if this wonder fuel is to be make a difference to net zero targets.

Demand for engines (and engineers)

Pratt & Whitney is collaborating with the EU’s Clean Aviation consortium under the Sustainable Water-Injecting Turbofan Comprising Hybrid-Electrics (SWITCH) project. (RTX)

When pressed on the biggest threats and opportunities to the powerplant sector, Winter thought carefully before saying: “they are one and the same. We are in an era where technologies are moving at an exponentially faster pace than ever before and, at the same time, we are enjoying an era where there is unprecedented demand from around the world.""

""The order backlog for engines is the greatest it has been since WW2 and we are seeing a shift from demand constrained to supply constrained economics. At the same time, we are under pressure to bring ever more efficient and capable products to market. The plus side of this is that aero-engineering is a secure career option, as well as an exciting one. It also provides a tremendous opportunity for public private partnerships to accelerate these new technologies into the market.”

For such a large organisation, P&W aims to emulate the ‘start-up’ ethos that Fred Rentschler and his cohort brought to the industry a century ago. Working fast and clever, they designed the Wasp inside a garage and completed the first engine in under six months. “We reach for that same agile development,” Winter told AEROSPACE. “As with HySIITE, we focus on the hardest things first as that is the mentality that we bring to innovation.” Perhaps that is why 57,000 of the company’s 185,000 employees (almost one in three) is an engineer and why the company holds 60,000 patents – more than one per engineer.

A lot of that innovation takes place in the RTX Technology Research Center, which itself marks its 96th anniversary this year, and traces its roots to a facility first established by Fred Rentschler in 1929, soon after the company opened its doors. Winter began his career there “as a fresh lab rat PhD student” and today, it is one of the groups within RTX that incubates the new technologies and ideas that form the group’s ten technology roadmaps.

One hundred years and well in excess of half a million engines since the first Wasp was conceived, P&W remains at the forefront of propulsion technology and ‘Doc’ Winter retains his infectious enthusiasm for creating better, more efficient aero-engines.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26940/pw5a.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 11:21:13.666406

When used as a marine fuel, biomethanol offers up to 95% lower CO2 emissions (tank-to-wake) than conventional fuels.
While methanol synthesis technology is proven, the commercial viability of biomass-to-methanol still depends on access to incentives, predictable feedstock pricing and buyers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon methanol.
To support this high-capacity production, SunGas has selected JM as its methanol synthesis technology partner, along with Linde and Merichem.
Biomass-to-methanol sits at the intersection of energy, waste and industrial policy.","As the global energy system undergoes a fundamental transformation, pressure mounts to find low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels across hard-to-abate sectors. Methanol, a clean-burning fuel with wide-ranging applications in shipping, power generation and sustainable chemicals, offers an alternative to traditional fuels. But biomethanol, technically mature and increasingly scalable, is building its case as a critical enabler of the net-zero transition.

Biomethanol, distinct from e-methanol (which is produced entirely from captured CO2 and green hydrogen), is produced by converting sustainable biomass sources into low-carbon methanol. It helps tackle two major challenges: cutting carbon emissions and reducing organic waste. Coupled with its compatibility with proven industrial processes, biomethanol stands a practical and attractive fuel option in the transition to cleaner energy systems. Biomethanol also lays a road to compliance with upcoming maritime emissions regulations, provides a renewable alternative to current chemical feedstocks facing Scope 3 reduction goals, and offers an outlet for organic waste disposal.

Process Pathways and Technical Readiness

The production of methanol from biomass typically follows one of two routes: biochemical conversion or thermochemical conversion. The former uses anaerobic digestion to create biogas, which can then be reformed into synthesis gas (syngas—a mixture of CO, H2, and CO2). Thermochemical conversion involves converting solid biomass into syngas. Biomass-derived syngas contains different toxins than fossil-based syngas, layering additional challenges in gasification and methanol synthesis. The gas is then cleaned and catalytically converted into methanol. Some advanced systems also incorporate partial oxidation during gasification to enhance syngas quality and increase methanol yield. Green hydrogen may also optionally be integrated into the biomass-to-methanol process to enhance syngas composition and increase methanol yield.

The process can accommodate a wide range of typically nonedible lignocellulosic and organic waste feedstocks such as forestry residues (branches, bark, wood chips) agricultural byproducts (straw, husks, corn stover); black liquor (a byproduct of the pulp and paper industry); and biogenic municipal solid waste (food scraps, green waste).

While the underlying chemistry is well understood, the integration of biomass gasification with methanol synthesis requires careful engineering. Companies with deep experience in methanol production, such as Johnson Matthey, have adapted their synthesis loop and catalyst platforms to manage biomass-derived syngas. These solutions are tailored to tolerate feedstock variability, including hydrogen availability, high-conversion efficiency maintenance, and product purity assurance—all critical for commercial viability. This is not an experimental pathway, however. Biomass-to-methanol leverages decades of industrial methanol expertise and infrastructure at significant scale. This means deployment can happen more quickly than some emerging fuel technologies.

Environmental Impact and Growing Policy Relevance

A 2021 study by the International Renewable Energy Agency estimated that methanol production and use contribute around 0.3 gigatonnes of CO2 annually, or about 10% of global emissions from the chemical industry. Lifecycle analysis shows that biomethanol can reduce global warming potential by up to 185% (cradle-to-gate) relative to fossil-based methanol, depending on feedstock type and carbon accounting assumptions (this figure reflects the CO2 absorbed during biomass growth). Methanol produced from residual or waste biomass has the potential to deliver large carbon footprint savings, especially when it displaces fuels like heavy fuel oil or naphtha.

When used as a marine fuel, biomethanol offers up to 95% lower CO2 emissions (tank-to-wake) than conventional fuels. It also provides immediate improvements in air quality by producing lower nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur oxides (SOX) and particulate matter during combustion. In regions facing tightening emissions standards for shipping, these benefits strengthen biomethanol’s case as a compliance-friendly fuel option.

Global maritime regulations are increasing momentum for low-carbon fuels. The FuelEU Maritime Regulation initiative mandates a progressive reduction in greenhouse gas intensity from marine fuels, creating long-term renewables demand signals. Meanwhile, the International Maritime Organization has set a global decarbonization trajectory, including a 20% reduction in shipping’s total GHG emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050, with a global carbon price set in April 2025. These regulations are expected to accelerate the adoption of drop-in fuels, which offer compatibility with existing infrastructure and measurable lifecycle emission benefits. Policy support is not only helping close the investment gap but also solidifying biomethanol’s role in the maritime sector’s energy transition. However, many jurisdictions still lack specific frameworks to differentiate between fossil-based and renewable methanol, or to reward the full lifecycle emissions savings of biobased production. Closing this policy gap will be essential for investment certainty.

Scaling Challenges and Collaboration Needs

Scaling biomass-to-methanol is not without challenges. Feedstock availability, logistics and supply chain integration are common barriers. While biomass is theoretically abundant, practical access is shaped by geography, seasonality and competing demand from other sectors such as bioenergy, animal feed or composting. Effective scaling will depend on the development of stable, regional biomass supply chains. This includes investment in collection and preprocessing infrastructure, better data on feedstock volumes and quality, and systems for tracking sustainability credentials.

Technical challenges also remain. Biomass-derived syngas can contain a range of impurities including tars, sulphur compounds and chlorine, which can impair catalyst performance if not properly managed. Methanol synthesis technology must be resilient to variable gas composition and impurities. Here, advancements in catalyst design and process engineering such as those pioneered by companies like JM are helping make the utilization of sustainable feedstocks more reliable.

Equally important is project financing. While methanol synthesis technology is proven, the commercial viability of biomass-to-methanol still depends on access to incentives, predictable feedstock pricing and buyers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon methanol. Emerging low-carbon fuel standards and voluntary corporate commitments are helping close this gap, but market confidence remains essential. Project viability improves significantly when developers can partner with experienced technology licensors and supply chain integrators who can derisk project delivery.

Case Study: SunGas Renewable Energy Project

One of the most significant projects highlighting the commercial viability and scaling potential of biomethanol is the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project by SunGas Renewables in Pineville, Louisiana. With a planned investment of $2 billion, this facility will be one of the largest biomethanol plants currently being developed in the U.S. Set on the site of a former paper mill, it reflects a growing trend toward repurposing existing industrial infrastructure to support the energy transition. The plant is expected to produce approximately 500,000 metric tons of biomethanol annually, enough to power up to nine large oceangoing container vessels per year. This output is aimed primarily at the marine fuels market, but it will also serve as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel and other renewable chemical applications.

To support this high-capacity production, SunGas has selected JM as its methanol synthesis technology partner, along with Linde and Merichem. A final investment decision is expected by 2026, with operations commencing by late 2028. SunGas has already secured an offtake agreement with shipping giant Maersk.

A Pragmatic Fuel for a Complex Transition

The long-term role of biomethanol will likely vary by region. In feedstock-rich countries, it could become a dominant fuel. In others, it may complement hydrogen or e-methanol solutions, offering a near-term option during scaling. What will ultimately determine its success is not just technical performance, but system thinking. Biomass-to-methanol sits at the intersection of energy, waste and industrial policy. Making it work at scale will require alignment across sectors, coordinated planning and smart regulation. It also calls for pragmatic partnerships between technology providers, feedstock suppliers, policymakers and end users.

As the world confronts the dual pressures of climate action and sustainable growth, fuels like biomethanol deserve close attention. It offers a flexible platform for converting available sustainable feedstocks into low-carbon fuel. In terms of impact, readiness and relevance, biomethanol is proving to be a vital contributor to decarbonization.

The record-breaking aircraft has set 135 city-pair missions, further highlighting its incredible performance attributes

With more than 200 aircraft in service achieving more than 250,000 flying hours, the proven Global 7500 sets the stage for the company’s Global 8000(2), which is ready to enter into service later this year

MONTREAL, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bombardier today announced that its performance-leading Global 7500 business jet has achieved another record-breaking milestone: 135 speed records(1), the most ever set by a single business aircraft type. Some of the blazing-fast aircraft’s impressive city-pair speed records include key city pairs such as Tokyo to San Francisco, London to Riyadh, Oakland to Tokyo, Hartford to Dubai, Tokyo to Toronto and Montreal to Paris, among many others.

Earlier achievements on the Global 7500 include the longest flight ever recorded in business aviation – an 8,225 nautical mile (15,232.7 km) flight from Sydney to Detroit – as well as the industry’s longest range non-stop mission from London City Airport to Los Angeles.

“This is the ultimate recognition, the most speed records of all time – and it’s precisely what Bombardier’s discerning customers need: a reliable, fast, efficient business tool that gets them to destination quickly and efficiently,” said Jean-Christophe Gallagher, Executive Vice President, Aircraft Sales and Bombardier Defense. “Even more impressive is the fact some of these records have been set with passengers on board in varying conditions and airports. It’s a testament to how well engineered the aircraft is, ensuring customers fully benefit from the aircraft’s outstanding performance attributes for their everyday important missions.”

With its incredible performance attributes, the Global 7500 aircraft has achieved an impressive number of speed records since coming to market. Boasting a top speed of Mach 0.925 and a baseline range of 7,700 nautical miles (14,260 km), the Global 7500 sets a new benchmark for performance in the ultra-long-range category. The aircraft’s unique Smooth Flĕx Wing is like an in-air shock absorber, designed with a sophisticated slats and flap system that generates exceptional lift on takeoff and approach, maximizing aerodynamic efficiency and boosting performance while improving safety and offering the industry’s smoothest ride. It also reduces fuel burn, lowers emissions and produces excellent short-field and high-speed performance – producing the perfect platform for our discerning customers.

The industry-defining attributes of the Global 7500 aircraft will soon be enhanced with the introduction of the Global 8000 (2) aircraft. Bombardier’s flagship for a new era is anticipated to have an industry-leading range of 8,000 nautical miles (14,816 km) and a top speed of Mach 0.94, making it the ultimate all-in-one business aircraft. It will also have a low cabin altitude of less than 2,900 feet when flying at 41,000 ft.

Bombardier’s nimble Global 8000 also possesses impressive runway performance comparable to a light jet. Its unique design and cutting-edge engineering provide customers with the ability to access smaller airports other aircraft in its category can’t access.

Renewable Diesel has that alignment.
What will you build—an SAF dream factory or a Renewable Diesel fortress?","If you had the keys to America’s first commercial SAF refinery, how would you play it?Welcome, new Sheriff in town.

You’re not just acquiring some sleepy old plant. You’re stepping into the long, layered saga of the Paramount Sustainable Fuels Facility—a place whose ownership story is less a deed than a palimpsest. In 2018, World Energy bought the old Delek refinery outright, proudly declaring it a wholly-owned renewable showcase. Then Air Products quietly financed, built, or assumed control of critical infrastructure—new hydrogen units, expanded renewable fuels plants—until they were issuing sale memos describing Paramount as their domain. And now, a Guggenheim Securities teaser advises us that the facility is back on the market, the world’s most heavily rebranded and “Monster Deliverer of Actual Fuel” is looking for its next Daddy.

Who really owns Paramount? It depends on the week you ask. But as GTESI reminds us, it hardly matters. Systems like this endure beyond the names on the balance sheet. They persist because barrels keep rolling, contracts keep signing, and the story keeps getting told.

What You’re Getting

Let’s be clear about what’s in the box:

Current Production: 3,500 barrels per day with nearly 100% liquid yield—1,800 barrels SAF, 1,056 RD, the rest Renewable Naphtha.

Expansion Potential: A paused project to scale to 25,000 barrels per day—most of it SAF.

Feedstock Flexibility: Tallow, soybean oil, lard, used cooking oil.

Strategic Position: Locked into California’s logistics—pipelines, rail, trucking, port access, and an aviation fuel market desperate for decarbonization.

On paper, this is an irreplicable platform. But the path you choose will decide whether it becomes a legend or a cautionary tale.

Renewable Diesel: The Quiet Empire

Today, Renewable Diesel is the quiet empire of low-carbon fuels. It doesn’t get headlines, but it dominates the volumes. Last year, RD made up 65% of distillate fuels in California. SAF? Barely 2%.

GTESI gives us language for why: RD is a system with high persistence:

Trust Rituals: Regular earnings calls, expansions, clear policy.

Narrative Coherence: Everyone understands “cooking oil becomes diesel.”

Entropy Export: The processes are mature, the infrastructure stable.

The result is a fuel that just works—and keeps working. If your goal is to keep barrels moving and investors calm, Renewable Diesel is the path of least resistance.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Aspirational System

SAF, in contrast, is still learning to walk. Even with subsidies and tax credits, it’s an ecosystem with structural stress:

Symbolic Compression: Big claims—“the first SAF refinery!”—compressed from complex realities.

Entropy Hoarding: Conversion pathways like ethanol-to-jet are energy- and water-intensive, with carbon value diluted at each step.

Trust Ritual Fragility: No large-scale ATJ plants have proven themselves yet. Announcements outpace delivery.

Yet, SAF also carries the biggest upside if you believe the aviation industry’s decarbonization promises will turn into mandates—and if you’re willing to bet on the policies and rituals catching up to the narrative.

The GTESI Lens

GTESI argues that systems thrive when their stories, processes, and symbolic rituals align. Renewable Diesel has that alignment. SAF is still stitching it together.

In GTESI terms:

RD has a high Inverse Persistence Ratio—its story and reality match.

SAF suffers from Symbolic Compression Divergence—its story is ahead of its actual production footprint.

RD exports entropy efficiently—integrated refineries and proven logistics.

SAF hoards entropy—more complexity, more fragility.

Your Decision

As the new sheriff, you must decide whether to double down on an aspirational narrative or build on operational reality.

If you choose SAF, prepare for extraordinary trust rituals, policy fortification, and the patience to wait out technological growing pains.

If you choose RD, you inherit a system that already knows how to persist.

Remember: the molecules don’t care who owns the plant. But the system does care whether it can keep moving barrels through it, week after week, year after year.

What will you build—an SAF dream factory or a Renewable Diesel fortress?

The choice is yours. And the barrels are waiting.",,N,,2025-07-11 11:22:17.182700

He said while he would have preferred a stand-alone Farm Bill — which hasn't passed since 2018 — the measure goes a long way in providing relief.
Boosting production of sustainable aviation fuel is particularly exciting, he said, because it provides an emerging market to sell his crop.
Cuts to SNAP divide the farm bill coalition and reductions in Medicaid will have harmful effects on millions of Americans.
This approach undermines the foundation of the farm bill and puts its future at risk,"" he said.","Farmers are set to see a boost from the so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" that Congress cleared and President Trump signed into law last week.

That tax and spending package includes $66.4 billion in new money for programs assisting farmers, strengthening the safety net if there is significant volatility in crop prices and revenues. There are also enhancements to crop insurance.

While the legislation rolls back climate friendly tax incentives established in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for wind and solar development, it extends the clean energy fuel production credit until 2029 — though the value of that credit is reduced. That supports sustainable aviation fuel, which can cut down on carbon emissions from air travel.

Rob Tate, who is on the board of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association and has a farm in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, said he gives the bill high marks for supporting agriculture. He said while he would have preferred a stand-alone Farm Bill — which hasn't passed since 2018 — the measure goes a long way in providing relief.

""For all the provisions that are in that bill, I would have to give it an 'A.' There's really a lot of things that hit home to us,"" he said.

Boosting production of sustainable aviation fuel is particularly exciting, he said, because it provides an emerging market to sell his crop. Some of the corn he grows is used to produce ethanol, which is blended with gasoline and available at gas stations across the country.

And ethanol is an option for sustainable aviation fuel. The first plant doing so opened last year in Georgia, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Minnesota is the fifth-largest ethanol producer in the country.

""We've talked about other alternatives for aviation fuel, which is great, but we have to be able to have a large volume to be able to supply the aviation industry,"" he said. ""And corn and ethanol can do that, so I'm excited about the potential that's there.""

But not everyone is pleased with the GOP-backed law that includes many signature pieces of Mr. Trump's second agenda for his second term. Cuts to Medicaid and food assistance draw fierce pushback.

In a statement, the National Farmers Union said there are meaningful provisions in the bill to help farmers and ranchers and praised many of the same policies as Tate. But union president Rob Larew raised concerns with the changes to those welfare programs.

""These gains are paired with harmful tradeoffs. Cuts to SNAP divide the farm bill coalition and reductions in Medicaid will have harmful effects on millions of Americans. Farm policy should unite us. This approach undermines the foundation of the farm bill and puts its future at risk,"" he said.

He also called on Congress to pass a comprehensive farm policy bill, too. The process is supposed to happen every five years, but the Farm Bill is also the mechanism by which lawmakers reauthorize nutrition and food assistance programs.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/11/16a1e604-8dd8-4a48-a02b-8da901d4ea85/thumbnail/1200x630/6f41e77c6c346f7fc08298ea9c912193/6p-pkg-mn-farmer-budget-bill-wcco887t.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 02:01:28.127855

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested to bring New Rise Reno online which has created approximately 60 full-time management, engineering, and related jobs in the Reno-Tahoe area.

Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives like tax credits - by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people. This clear, expanding global demand underpins XCF's decision to scale production at home and internationally, ensuring the company is positioned to serve markets where policy, aviation demand, and decarbonization goals align.

""We're not simply dreaming about decarbonizing the aviation industry - we're building it right now,"" said Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair of XCF. ""With over $350 million already invested through New Rise Reno, we've proven that we can bring large-scale, commercial SAF production online. Our strategy is to invest nearly $1 billion over the next three years to develop multiple production facilities that will deliver real volumes, real revenue, and real impact for our shareholders.""

U.S. Growth Pipeline

XCF's U.S. expansion plan includes three additional production sites which have already been acquired and are ready for development. Each facility is expected to have nameplate production capacity of 40 million gallons. Together with New Rise Reno, these sites are expected to deliver total production capacity of approximately 160 million gallons per year by the end of 2028.

New Rise Reno 2 - Adjacent to the existing New Rise Reno facility, enabling economies of scale and leveraging shared utilities and logistics infrastructure; facility expected to be completed in 2027.

Ft. Myers, Florida - Growing SAF demand in the Southeast U.S. and with access to port infrastructure; facility expected to be completed by 2028.

Wilson, North Carolina - Strategically located to serve East Coast markets and support local economic development; facility expected to be completed by 2028.

These new sites are expected to replicate New Rise Reno's modular, patent-pending site design and bundled technology stack, allowing for rapid deployment, flexible production, and capital-efficient scaling. Each facility is expected to have the ability to produce multiple renewable fuel products, including SAF and renewable diesel, supporting a multi-product revenue strategy that maximizes plant utilization and financial performance.

International Expansion Strategy

In addition to its U.S. pipeline, XCF is pursuing an international growth strategy to expand its platform into high-potential global markets. The company recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to launch New Rise Australia, a new SAF and renewable diesel production platform in partnership with Continual Renewable Ventures. This venture is designed to leverage XCF's patent-pending site design, configuration, and layout to enable faster, capital-efficient deployment of SAF and renewable diesel capacity in Australia.

""We're executing a strategy that combines proven technology, modular design, and disciplined capital investment to facilitate global SAF adoption,"" added Dange.

US Senate bill cuts 45Z extension, boosts crops

New York, 30 June (Argus) — The latest Senate draft of a major US budget bill would extend a biofuels tax break for an additional two years, down from four years in the prior draft, and set far more sweeping limits on foreign feedstocks. The ""45Z"" clean fuel production credit would last until 2029 and be available for only domestically produced fuels produced from North American feedstocks starting next year, according to a draft released over the weekend by Senate leaders that could be voted on as soon as Monday. An earlier Senate draft proposed extending the incentive through 2031 and cutting credit values for foreign feedstocks by just 20pc. The incentive, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, kicked off this year and currently offers a sliding scale of subsidy to US-made alternative fuels through 2027 based on their greenhouse gas emissions. The updated language is a win for farm groups, which have worried that imports of used cooking oil, tallow, and sugarcane ethanol are hurting demand for home-grown crops that can also be turned into biofuels. Refiners that had previously looked abroad for renewable diesel inputs, expanding US production to record levels last year, would have to pay up for scarcer domestic options. A shorter credit extension could frustrate corners of the industry that had emphasized the need for policy certainty — including companies with plans to start producing novel fuels later this decade — although biofuel incentives have a long history of extensions. For instance, the Senate bill would revive an expired tax credit for small biodiesel producers in a major change from earlier drafts. Facilities with capacities of no more than 60mn USG/yr could claim a 20¢/USG subsidy for up to 15mn USG of annual production this year and next year, supplementing tax breaks they can already claim under 45Z. That could keep more biodiesel plants, which have struggled to adapt to policy changes and competition from larger renewable diesel producers, running after a difficult start to the year. Smaller producers also would benefit from the latest Senate draft preserving the ability of companies without enough tax liability to sell tax credits to others. The bill is otherwise similar to earlier versions. It would still bar regulators next year from considering indirect emissions from land use changes, a shift from current law that in effect ups subsidies for fuels made from crops, another top priority for farm groups. If passed, the typical gallon of US dry mill corn ethanol and canola biodiesel would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy — unlike under current rules — and soybean-based road fuels would earn larger credits next year. Aviation fuels conversely would see slimmer subsidies starting next year, since the bill would eliminate extra credit under current law for jet fuels over road fuels. That would be a major disruption to airlines and to those refiners that have invested in upgrading more of their renewable diesel output to instead produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Trucking groups had argued that the imbalance was diverting feedstocks away from road markets to costlier SAF production — and that treating fuel types equally was one way conservative lawmakers could reduce the credit's price-tag. More changes possible The bill could be changed further Monday as the Senate proceeds with a process in which lawmakers can propose amendments. If the bill passes, it would go back to the House for approval. President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to finalize the sprawling package this week, an ambitious timeline given lawmakers still disagree on key issues. Any revised 45Z credit would also need final rules from the US Department of Treasury, which still has questions to answer about eligibility this year. The ultimate profitability of biofuels will depend on interactions between the tax credit and other policies that are also in flux. That includes a federal biofuel blend mandate, which the Trump administration wants to revamp to discourage foreign feedstocks, and newly tougher carbon intensity targets in California's influential low-carbon fuel standard market.

SEA biodiesel industry looks to decarbonise: Correction

Corrects figure for capital expenditure forecast in paragraph 15 Singapore, 30 June (Argus) — Regional biodiesel associations from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for stakeholder support to further decarbonisation goals during the 5th Palm Biodiesel Conference in Bangkok over 23-24 June. Thai electrification shift competes with biodiesel industry Thailand has been driving a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) under the 30@30 policy, targeting at least 30pc of total motor vehicles produced annually by 2030 to be EVs, while support for biodiesel producers is waning, said Thai biodiesel producer association Chairman Sanin Triyanond. Thailand will no longer subsidise the price of biofuels such as biodiesel under the oil fund act after 24 September 2026, said Supatchalee Sophonthammaphat, an official with the Thai department of alternative energy development and efficiency (DEDE). Triyanond called for both the EV and biodiesel industries to coexist, citing a study that said an EV and biofuel energy mix was recommended for the country. A low biodiesel blend target in Thailand resulted in only 30pc of Thailand's 11.7mn l/d in installed biodiesel capacity being utilised, and high operating costs across its 14 registered companies, Triyanond said. When domestic crude palm oil (CPO) stocks fall below 200,000t, local prices also increase in comparison to the global price, he added. This raises the cost of production when biodiesel producers import CPO as it is subject to 143pc import tax and exempt from export duties in Thailand. Thailand manages CPO supplies and prices by altering its volumetric blend target for biodiesel under the alternative energy development plan (AEDP). However, the biodiesel industry has been struggling with a low blending policy and feels that the stock management program needs to be redesigned to better support producers. Indonesia needs more investment to hit B50 biodiesel blend goal Indonesia is targeting 15.6mn kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2025 and has been conducting road tests for a higher B50 biodiesel blend with fossil diesel this year. To meet higher biodiesel blend ratios in subsequent years, new investment from the private sector and policy support from the government on pricing, funding and legislation is needed to drive infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions, said deputy of promotion and communication at the Indonesian biofuels producer association (APROBI) Ravi Farkhan Pratama. For suppliers, complex logistics resulting in higher costs for transporting biodiesel to remote regions remain, said manager of biofuel and additive supply chain at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Adi Rachman. A price disparity between public service obligation (PSO) and non-PSO (NPSO) biodiesel blends in the market poses a challenge in ensuring each fuel is supplied to the right customer group, he added. The PSO sector includes state-owned firms that serve the public. Fuel suppliers in this sector receive subsidies from the oil plantation fund management agency (BPDPKS) to fund the difference between palm oil-based biodiesel and the indexed price of diesel, while non-PSO fuel suppliers do not. Biodiesel plants in Indonesia have been running at an average 80pc of Indonesia's 20.9mn kl/yr installed capacity across 24 producers this year, said Pratama. Indonesia consumed about 20pc of annual CPO production under the B35 blend mandate in 2024. This year's B40 biodiesel blend mandate could eat into exports and other avenues including food use, Pratama added. Any further increase to blending mandates would exacerbate how palm supplies are distributed between food and fuel. There are also additional costs around infrastructure upgrades such as coating pipelines and storage tanks, said Rachman. A move to a B50 blend mandate would likely happen in 2027 or later, said head of B40 road test and B40 commercial test team at LEMIGAS research and development center of oil & gas technology, ministry of energy and mineral resources Cahyo Setyo Wibowo at the event. Malaysian biodiesel producers push for higher blending mandates Malaysia's B20 biodiesel blend mandate set in January 2020 has been limited to Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Labuan and Sarawak in the transport sector. A separate 7pc biodiesel blend is required in the industrial sector, first mandated in July 2019. President of Malaysian biodiesel association Tee Lip Teng sought a nationwide B20 implementation for on-road fuels, and a B30 blend ratio by 2030. However, Tee said that a capital expenditure of more than 600mn ringgit ($142mn) would be required to achieve a full B30 nameplate biodiesel production capacity for the transport sector in Malaysia. On the other hand, the country is set to introduce a carbon tax as early as next year, allowing palm oil methyl ester (PME) prices to be more competitive, he added. Lower palm oil prices in relation to gasoil amid oil market uncertainty and during the upcoming peak palm production season could also drive voluntary blending. But fossil diesel continues to be subsidised for qualified businesses in the transportation and logistics sector, increasing the funding burden needed to subsidise PME in these sectors. While PME production continues to face challenges, Tee cited the potential to expand waste-based biodiesel production in Malaysia. Biodiesel exports out of Malaysia rose up to 2019 before declining afterward due to the EU ban on palm-based biofuels, Tee said. Majority of the biodiesel exported now comprises used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and palm oil mill effluent oil methyl ester (Pomeme) rather than PME, he added. First generation biodiesel producers should be incentivised through government grants to retrofit their plants to use waste-based oils to complement their existing palm oil feedstock, Tee said. Other alternative feedstocks carrying a lower levelized cost of production such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) should be considered as a feedstock of choice, said general manager for strategy and sustainability at Petronas Dagangan Berhad Ms. Harlina Pikri.

US reps resist Senate approach to biofuel credit

New York, 26 June (Argus) — A coalition of US House members is pushing the Senate to scrap planned changes to a tax credit that the biofuel industry sees as crucial for profitable production. Republicans in both chambers have looked to use a fillibuster-proof budget bill to keep but modify the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" tax credit, which increases subsidies for fuels with lower emissions. But some farm-state House members are displeased with the Senate's approach , including less-punitive treatment of foreign feedstocks and substantial cuts to subsidies for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ""We respectfully urge you and your committee to revise the language around 45Z to reflect the House language,"" seven House Republicans, including three on the House tax-writing committee, wrote Wednesday in a letter to Senate Finance Committee chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). Both the House and Senate bills would prevent tax officials from factoring in indirect emissions from land use changes, a win for crop-based fuels like corn ethanol, and would extend 45Z four more years through 2031. But the House bill, which passed the chamber narrowly last month, would also strip eligibility from fuels derived from feedstocks outside North America starting next year. The Senate Finance draft, on the other hand, cuts subsidies for fuels from foreign feedstocks by 20pc while still allowing them some credit. The issue is highly contentious across the biofuel supply chain. Farm groups say that recently fast-rising imports of used cooking oil and tallow are hurting demand for domestic crops that can also be refined into renewable diesel. Refiners insist that flexibility around feedstocks is essential for scaling up biofuel output. The House lawmakers say that the Senate language would ""subsidize imported feedstocks"", some of which come from countries that ""actively discriminate against our domestic biofuels industry"". The House letter also asks the Senate to retain additional subsidies for SAF, which they say are critical given the fuel's typically higher cost of production. Under current law, road fuels are eligible for up to $1/USG and SAF up to $1.75/USG, plus inflation adjustments for all types of fuel — but the Senate Finance draft would eliminate that jet fuel premium. Notably, the House lawmakers say they prefer the Senate's more lenient approach to tax credit ""transferability"", which allows smaller companies without enough tax liability to instead sell tax credits to other businesses. President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to send him the budget bill before 4 July, but lawmakers still disagree on key details with just days before that self-imposed deadline. Along with fighting over energy policy, some conservatives are wary of the package's potential impact on the federal budget deficit and want more sweeping cuts to government spending. The letter was signed by representatives Michelle Fischbach (R-Minnesota), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Max Miller (R-Ohio), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Brad Finstad (R-Minnesota) and Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa).

The initiative, announced by a coalition of eight countries—France, Kenya, Barbados, Spain, Somalia, Benin, Sierra Leone, and Antigua & Barbuda—aims to raise funds for development, public health, and climate resilience efforts.

The proposal places particular emphasis on taxing premium class travellers and is being positioned as a funding tool ahead of the upcoming COP30 climate summit. However, ACI World has warned that the measure could have unintended consequences for global air connectivity and the wider economic and environmental goals it seeks to support.

Justin Erbacci, Director General of ACI World said:

We fully support the global pursuit of sustainable development and climate resilience. However, targeting aviation with additional taxes is likely to undermine the very connectivity and economic growth that support these goals. The aviation sector must be empowered—not penalised—if we want to achieve long-term global progress.

ACI cites research showing that existing taxes on aviation already have a measurable dampening effect on connectivity and regional economies. Its analysis suggests that removing the current 90 billion USD in annual aviation-related taxes could result in the creation of over 5 million jobs and generate approximately 180 billion USD in global GDP. The organisation argues that these figures point to the sector’s potential to drive economic progress when not restricted by fiscal policy.

While the coalition of states promoting the tax has stated its intention to invest proceeds into “resilient investments and fair transitions,” ACI World has also raised questions about how such funds would be managed. It expressed concern that a new tax could divert resources away from existing, internationally agreed climate frameworks.

The aviation industry, under the guidance of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is already implementing strategies to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. These include the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), as well as commitments to sustainable aviation fuels, infrastructure upgrades, and emerging low-emission technologies.

ACI World is concerned that overlapping or competing funding mechanisms could slow progress by diluting investment in the sector’s own transition plans.

ACI World is aligned with ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) in calling for a more unified approach to sustainable aviation policy. The group warns that unilateral tax measures could create market imbalances, distort competition between carriers, and place disproportionate pressure on nations with fewer alternative transport options.

Instead, ACI advocates for globally coordinated action that recognises aviation’s existing environmental commitments and its broader role in social and economic development.

That is according to a report from the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Kearney and the Ministry of Tourism Saudi Arabia.
It was estimated that the T&T sector accounted for about 10% of the global GDP in 2023.
Asia is emerging as a major driver in GDP growth in the future of the travel and tourism industry.
“Tourism is a powerful driver of jobs, culture and economic growth around the world.","The global tourism and travel (T&T) sector will contribute around $16 trillion to the world’s GDP by 2034, when it hits 30 billion trips yearly. That is according to a report from the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Kearney and the Ministry of Tourism Saudi Arabia.

After finally recovering from the huge blow dealt by the pandemic, tourism and travel are now presented with big opportunities for growth in an increasingly connected world. It was estimated that the T&T sector accounted for about 10% of the global GDP in 2023. The impact of the sector extends beyond airlines and hospitality into a wide range of other areas like food services, retail, and an array of local businesses.

T&T is expanding about 1.5 times faster than the rest of the global economy, though continued success will hinge on whether companies and governments can grapple with big challenges related to climate change, persistent labor shortages, and demand for better infrastructure.

The Covid-19 freeze on travel dealt a deadly blow to the T&T sector, with total GDP contribution nearly halving from 2019 to 2020. By last year, the sector was back to pre-2020 levels and GDP contribution is now expected to continue growing at a rate of over 4% per year.

If all goes according to plan, the sector could end up contributing $16 trillion in GDP by 2034. This growth can materialize in different ways and, in the best case scenario, there is great potential for the sector to contribute positively to cultural understanding, inclusion, and regeneration.

The overall economic impact of the T&T industry varies widely among countries at different stages of development and economic diversification. For example, tourism-centric economies like the Bahamas, Seychelles, and other vacation hotspots depend heavily on visitors. They have great natural assets, but are very vulnerable to economic downturns or natural disasters.

Emerging tourism destinations like Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, among others, are projected to see more and more tourism in the future and are actively investing in infrastructure. Many of these countries are likely to continue shifting their economies towards tourism, but currently face issues in areas like workforce development.

Then there are the diversified economies that already have strong tourism sectors. These include large economies with strong tourism sectors like France, Turkey, Japan, the United States, and others. The contribution of the T&T industry to GDP is well balanced, though tourist destinations in these countries are concentrated in specific locations (Paris, Istanbul, Tokyo, and New York City, for example).

Asia is emerging as a major driver in GDP growth in the future of the travel and tourism industry. Direct contributions from the sector to national GDPs are all over 7% in Asia, with countries like China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan clearly dominating.

This accelerated growth could soon position Asia as one of the world’s tourism hotspots. Africa comes second in the list of top T&T contributions to GDP. With destinations like Tanzania, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt, and the Seychelles attracting growing numbers of visitors in these relatively low GDP countries, it is no wonder why.

Challenges from all sides

Though these projections are positive for industry players, whether the industry will see consistent growth going forward largely depends on whether the looming threats of global challenges can be successfully navigated. These threats are complex and seem to come from all sides.

For example, air travel is one of the largest and hardest to abate contributors to carbon emissions. Tourism is also a major strain on natural systems around the world, accounting for about 10% of global energy consumption and 7% of solid waste, according to the study.

Global risks like geopolitical tensions also threaten to disrupt the industry. For example, air travel has routinely been disrupted over the past few years in large parts of the Middle East since the conflict in Israel/Palestine and fighting with Hezbollah and Iran escalated periodically.

Another area of concern is whether infrastructure and investment can keep up with T&T growth. There will need to be additional regulatory changes to expedite development in order for the industry to reach the projected 30 billion trips by 2034.

The reality laid out by the report is that without decisive, coordinated action, the sector could face up to $6 trillion in revenue loss by 2030 from all types of disruptions.

“Tourism is a powerful driver of jobs, culture and economic growth around the world. As the industry grows to meet the needs of billions more travellers, it also needs to evolve,” said Bob Willen, managing partner and chairman at Kearney.

“That means using technology responsibly, supporting workers and small businesses, protecting the planet, and making sure local communities truly benefit. The principles in our report lay out a practical path forward from investing in greener infrastructure and building a more inclusive workforce, to preserving cultural heritage and planning for future crises.”",https://www.consulting.us/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-07-10-092319845-Global_tourism_on_the_rise__though_industry_grapples_with_challenges_spot.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 21:07:46.222348

In my head, you know, I said one day I will work close to the airlines. And now for two years I've been working in the aviation sector. I do care about the future. I think we all have to find a solution for lower emission energies. Energy is not just about fuel. It's about people, progress and finding the right balance. Reusing used cooking oil and animal fats will be part of this journey. My job is about selling sustainable aviation fuel, which is known as SAF, to the aviation sector. The key part of my role everyday is to respond to the needs of the clients. To work together with them to find solutions and reduce their carbon emissions. Aviation is evolving. What do you think about the partnership between TotalEnergies and Air France?

Antoine Laborde, Head of Fuel Procurement, Air France-KLM: Sustainable aviation fuel is starting to play a bigger role in the industry. In 2024, Air France-KLM bought around 100,000 tons of SAF, making Air France-KLM one of the biggest buyers of SAF of all of world airlines. As you know, aviation is under strong pressure in order to reduce its CO2 emissions. And yet, in 2024, just 0.3% of total aviation fuel was SAF. So it’s very important that all together, the airlines but also the fuel producers, will bring this knowledge, will communicate the importance of SAF so that we can reach our sustainability ambitions. Let me show you, come. The great thing about SAF is that you don’t need to change the aircraft, or to change the engine, or anything in the airport, and you get the CO2 benefits of using SAF.

Simon Pouilly: TotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company, primarily producing hydrocarbons while expanding its investment in lower carbon energies like sustainable aviation fuel. Welcome to the CRES. Sustainable aviation fuel incorporates renewable carbon like biogenic waste and organic waste coming from used cooking oil or animal fats. Today, aircrafts can be fueled with a mix of SAF and conventional fossil fuel up to 50% of the total blend. At the lab, we are working for the next generation of production based on agricultural waste and potential ethanol intermediates. Grandpuits used to be an oil refinery and TotalEnergies is investing to transform it to become a biorefinery. It will produce up to 230,000 tons of SAF per year from 2026. SAF reduces the life-cycle CO2 emissions by at least 65% compared to its fossil fuel equivalent.

Antoine Laborde: TotalEnergies will supply us with up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over the next 10 years. The commitment and consistency of TotalEnergies is at the heart of this great partnership.",https://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/styles/crop_landscape_ratio_9_5/public/images/totalenergies_cnbc-saison-5-episode-5-futur-en-vol_2025.png?itok=EMzMiN-m,N,,2025-07-10 16:13:34.731355

To date, all the SAF managed through Avelia has been supplied by Shell, but the companies now are opening it up to participation from other SAF suppliers as well.
Both corporations and airlines, as well as freight intermediaries, will be able to manage SAF purchases from other suppliers in the program.
""Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF,"" Shell Aviation president Raman Ojha said in a statement.

American Express Global Business Travel partnered with Shell and professional services company Accenture in 2022 to launch Avelia, a blockchain-powered ""book-and-claim"" platform through which travelers could pay for SAF even if it was not available at their departure airport.

As of the end of the first quarter of this year, more than 57 companies were participating in the program, and it had executed more than 900 ""retirements,"" the permanent assignment of benefits of a SAF purchase to a specific user. That represents more than 33 million gallons of SAF at 17 airport locations, which reduced carbon by more than 300,000 tons, according to the companies.

To date, all the SAF managed through Avelia has been supplied by Shell, but the companies now are opening it up to participation from other SAF suppliers as well. Both corporations and airlines, as well as freight intermediaries, will be able to manage SAF purchases from other suppliers in the program.

That will include a ""bring your own SAF"" model, in which airlines can manage their SAF portfolio in Avelia, bringing in purchases that otherwise would have been tracked offline, according to the companies. Avelia also is setting up a governance structure to enable that multi-party involvement.

""Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF,"" Shell Aviation president Raman Ojha said in a statement. ""We are proud to help enable broader participation and transparency in the sector’s efforts to reduce life cycle [greenhouse gas] emissions while supporting our customers in reaching their climate goals.""

SAF can cut life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions up to 80 percent compared with conventional jet fuel, but the International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF production this year will account for only 0.7 percent of total jet fuel production.

[Announcer] For decades, Iowa Press has brought you political leaders and newsmakers from across Iowa and beyond. Celebrating more than 50 years on statewide Iowa PBS, this is the Friday, July 11th edition of Iowa Press. Here is Kay Henderson.

[Henderson] Our guest on this edition of Iowa Press has been the mayor of Mount Pleasant. He was a state senator. He served as Iowa's governor for eight years. For 12 years, he was the nation's secretary of agriculture. And since March of this year, he has been the CEO of the World Food Prize Foundation. Governor Tom Vilsack, welcome back to Iowa Press.

[Vilsack] It's good to be back.

[Henderson] Joining our conversation are Brianne Pfannenstiel, the politics reporter for the Des Moines Register. And Erin Murphy, the Des Moines bureau chief for the Gazette in Cedar Rapids.

[Murphy] So, Governor Vilsack, we want to start with your work at the Food Prize. Is there something that attracted you to that job, or is it just that it's become a requirement for former Iowa governor, since your predecessor was former Governor Branstad?

[Vilsack] Well, I do I do joke with Ambassador Branstad that I keep following him in jobs. No, I think it's a continuation of the historic work that I did and we did at USDA in terms of nutrition and food security. Look, it's a it's a major issue globally, and it's a major issue domestically, globally, 733 million people are currently food insecure. One out of every ten people in the world today is malnourished. And tragically, nearly 60 million children are stunted under the age of five. Globally. Here at a home in Iowa, one out of eight Iowans are food insecure. One out of six Iowa children are food insecure, and every county in the state of Iowa experienced an increase in food insecurity in the last year, according to Feeding America. So, it's a continuation of the work that I did and trying to help feed people and make sure that they're fed nutritiously. It's a tremendous organization, and it does more than I think a lot of people in Iowa may realize. We have the one-of-a-kind opportunity every year to award some researcher or scientist that has done extraordinary work in terms of productivity. But we also have youth institutes impacting, affecting thousands of young people all over the United States. And the world. Right now, we have youth institutes that are taking place as we speak in Africa. We also do a lot of recognition beyond the prize. So, we recognize researchers in ag pioneers. And so, it's a it's a great organization. And it's got a terrific mission to elevate innovation in agriculture and to make sure that we continue to look for ways in which we can increase the quality, the quantity and the affordability of food for all.

[Pfannenstiel] Governor, the World Food Prize is hosting the Iowa Hunger Summit next week, and the goal is to focus on the root cause of food insecurity. So, what more do you think needs to be done? And what is the biggest misperception about food insecurity here in Iowa?

[Vilsack] Well, I think some people seem to think that food insecurity occurs someplace else other than Iowa. We like to think of ourselves as a state that cares and is compassionate about people in need. But again, those statistics suggest that we've got some work to do. There's a lot of work that needs to be done, and I think what we're trying to do in the Hunger Summit is to raise awareness of the of the challenge that we face, a challenge that's going to get a little bit more difficult because the federal government has made decisions to sort of take a step back in terms of the assistance that is traditionally been provided. That's going to put the onus on the rest of us to step up our game. And that's why we're bringing people from all over the country to this summit to explore best practices. What can we do? For example, with early childhood? How can we ensure that more people take advantage of the Wick program? What are we doing in terms of improving school meals, and how do we make sure that kids during the summer months have access to good nutrition as well? And what about our seniors? For too many seniors, they don't have the assistance and financial assistance and the wherewithal to be food secure. What can we do there? I think there are a number of strategies that need to be looked at, and that's the purpose of the summit is to basically raise awareness and to inspire people to go out and do as much as they possibly can to help their friends and neighbors.

[Pfannenstiel] Earlier this month, President Trump signed legislation that is expected to cause millions of Americans to lose access to the Snap program. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. What do you see that bill's effect being on Iowa?

[Vilsack] Well, here's the interesting thing about that bill and the impact of the Snap program. When we talk about it, we always talk about the fact that there are going to be millions of people that won't get the assistance and help, which means they're not going to be able to go to the grocery store and purchase as much, which means that the end of the month, they're going to have a tough time. They're going to have to make very tough choices, but it has a far greater impact than people realize. The reality is that $0.20 of every food dollar that's spent at the Hy-Vee’s in the fairways in Iowa, and the grocery stores in Iowa, 20 $0.20 of that food dollar goes to a farmer. So, when you cut snap, you're also cutting farm income. So that will have an impact and effect on Iowa farmers. When you make it more difficult for people to purchase food at a grocery store, well, that means that less food has to be stocked and processed and packaged and transported. Those are all jobs at the grocery store and throughout the entire food supply chain. That could impact an affected by a decision like this. So, it has a rippling impact. When you ask the state to begin to bear some of the cost of the Snap program beyond administrative expense, well, that's going to have an impact on public education, on safety, public safety, and also on, on health care access, because the state budget is already tight. Now you're going to ask it to incur additional responsibilities that it hasn't been factored into.

[Henderson] Your successor, Brooke Rollins, the current Secretary of Agriculture, this week talked about food production and the workers who are in that industry and said there will be no amnesty, but there will be selective deportation efforts at that level. As someone who was in the office, what is your view of the impact that may have on the availability of food in the U.S.?

[Vilsack] Well, it's going to make it more difficult for those who are reliant on migrant workers to basically produce the food that we take for granted here in this country. It will have a profound impact specifically on the dairy industry, that relies a great deal on migrant labor. It will have an impact and effect on fruits and vegetable access. And the reality is there's a solution to this, and it's been out for quite some time. It's the Farm Worker Modernization Act, which essentially creates an opportunity for farm workers to gain legitimacy. The perhaps they have to acknowledge that they came into this country improperly by paying a fine. They are given the opportunity to continue working on the farm under certain conditions, and they are able to get gain citizenship after a ten year or more process. So, there is a way of doing this, and there was significant support for this in farm country. And it passed the House a number of years ago. It just didn't get the 60 votes in the Senate, something like that could work. What we did during the Biden administration is we created a pilot project where we essentially identified workers in El Salvador and Honduras, and we and we provided some grant money to farmers to be able to adequately pay and train these folks. I think that program has been cut back by the Trump administration. So, there are solutions to this that can maintain a quality working workforce. I think it's unlikely that you're going to see a lot of Americans take these jobs. These are really, really, really tough jobs. And I think the secretary has suggested that Medicaid eligible, able bodied folks on Medicaid would be in a position to take these jobs. I think she's going to find that that's not as easy as she may think.

[Murphy] You, as has been established, led the USDA for 12 years. Eight years under President Obama, four years under President Biden, the Supreme Court this week ruled that the current administration's plans for reducing the federal workforce can be allowed to proceed. USDA we heard reports from very early in the administration was one of the agencies impacted thousands of USDA workers, took a payout to resign based on your experience, you work, you headed that organization. You know those people. What kind of impact does that kind of staffing change and even the uncertainty have on the operation?

[Vilsack] Well, I suspect morale is going to be impacted and affected by those who remain. That certainly was the case when I came in to the office. In the Obama years. The morale was at the you know, every year they do a survey and the morale at USDA was at the lowest point. We were like next to last in terms of large agencies. By the time I left, one of the major business publications ranked USDA as the 263rd best place in the in the country to work, because we had really focused on increasing morale. I came back the Biden administration and morale was again at the low end of the federal survey. We got significant improvement. So, I think you'll probably see some significant impacts in terms of morale. Look, elections have consequences in every administration has the right to do what they think is best for the country and for and for the for the workers. But the reality is you can reduce the workforce, but you have to do it strategically and thoughtfully, and you can do it in a way that doesn't necessarily impact the services that people depend on. I think the challenge here, if you're looking at wholesale reductions and massive reductions at one time, that makes it hard on those who are left. They end up having to do 2 or 3 jobs. And at the end of the day, it's pretty hard to do.

[Murphy] And you said earlier to a different question, some of this stuff puts the onus on the rest of us. When you see what's happening at the federal level, do you look at that through the prism of your current job at the World Food Prize and think, what? What role can we play in picking up whatever slack there.

[Vilsack] Well, the World Food Prize historically has had three primary responsibilities. We recognize, we inspire, and we convene. I think we now have a fourth responsibility, which is to raise awareness so that the rest of us know and appreciate that because of actions that have been taken, it does create a greater responsibility on the part of us to try to respond. Now, can we respond to fill the complete void that may be created as the federal government takes a step back on some things that's to be seen, but I think we have to try. And that's why we have the hunger summit. That's why we have an opportunity to travel to India to discuss with our number of farmers in India the work they're doing to increase global food security. And that's why we have, obviously, the World Food Prize that takes place later part of October.

[Henderson] A question about the USDA. During his first term, President Trump and his allies suggested moving the USDA out of Washington, D.C., maybe even locating it to Iowa. Is that a valid idea?

[Vilsack] It's already outside of Washington, D.C. USDA has over 5000 offices, 5000 offices. Most of them are in counties across the country. Virtually every county in Iowa has USDA presence out west. Virtually every area of the west has a Forest Service location. So, you're talking about a relatively small aspect of USDA being located in the nation's capital. They did move the research activities to Kansas City. That was a little bit disruptive the way they did it. And for a period of time, that area was understaffed. We finally got to a point where we actually had it fully staffed. I think if that decision is made, they need to think about it strategically. I don't think it necessarily means it will be closer to the people, because it's already extraordinarily close to the people. I mean, you have county offices, you've got regional and statewide offices, you've got state directors, you have rural development directors that are in every state. So, it is a very, very down on the ground kind of department. So, I don't think you're going to really see a whole lot different if you were to move the, the, the headquarters, if you will. The challenge with moving the headquarters is this out of sight, out of mind. And in Washington, D.C., the people that you want to make sure are always thinking about the USDA are up there on Capitol Hill. The appropriators and the and the standing committees. You want them to be thinking about USDA. You want them to understand the challenges that we face in rural places. And I will tell you, I think there's a major, major opportunity for messaging for USDA. And it's this there's a tendency to think in this country that every farmer is essentially like every other farmer. And the reality today is that we have two groups of farmers. We have large scale, commercial sized operations that represent roughly 10% of all farms. They sell more than $350,000 in sales every single year. They do pretty well, even in difficult times like we're experiencing today. They get 85 to 90% of the of the profit or the income that's generated from agriculture. The top 10% get 85% of the income, which means 1.6 million farms, the other 90% that sell less than 350,000. They get 15% and in some cases 10%. Those top 10% get 60% of all subsidies, which means the other 1.6 million get basically 40%. That top 10% represents 180,000 farms. So, there's a significant distinction between the large-scale commercial folks in terms of their viability and the smaller and midsize folks. And until the Biden administration, there were bits and pieces of a strategy to try to address those 90%. We actually had a full scale, comprehensive effort to try to create an option to getting bigger, getting out. We've lost since 1981 when Bob Bergland left this this job of secretary. He said, you know, I'm a little concerned about what we're doing here. We're focused on production. We're focused on markets. That's great. But that's kind of an impact on the number of farms we've lost 544,970 farms since he issued that warning. That's every farmer today in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Missouri and Oklahoma. And a little bit of Indiana. We've lost 151 million acres of farmland that was in farming. That's not in farming today. That's the equivalent of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland, and part of Virginia. So, it's a massive erosion of the basic economic unit of rural America. And I think, you know, the department, the federal government has a responsibility to address that issue. And that's hard to do if you're not in the capital in Washington, D.C., bugging those folks in Congress and in the Senate about the need for adequate appropriations and adequate support.

[Pfannenstiel] Well, here in central Iowa, there's tension kind of building once again over water quality. Central Iowa is dealing with high levels of nitrates in the drinking water again. How do you build the political will to address this issue? And is there a role for the federal government in solving it?

[Vilsack] Well, I think there's definitely a role. And I think the challenge, I think, is we keep looking at this as an either-or circumstance. And I think the challenge and the opportunity is that we need to look at it as an and proposition. So how do you essentially deal with the nitrate issue at the same time, understand the important role of agriculture and at the same time deal with this issue of small and midsize farming operations? How can you do all of that? Here's how you essentially say one of the reasons we have the nitrate problem is because there is an over of manure on ground around the around the state that overapplication results. There's only so much nutrient nutrients that land needs. It gets rid of the excess. It goes into rivers and streams. We got the problems. What if you diverted that manure? What if you created opportunities to basically take that manure and create something more valuable from it, rather than simply overapplying it on land? This is being done in parts of the country today where it's being used to generate energy. It's being used to potentially generate fuel. It's being used to generate a multitude of different products. What if you created a third commodity, if you will, or a farming operation? It's not just corn and soybeans, but it's also the manure that basically it's redirected into a manufacturing process that creates a new product, a new value-added product. You've reduced the level that's applied to land, which reduces nitrates, which deals with the water issue. You've created an opportunity for that farmer to have additional income, which helps with the 10% or 90% that are struggling. And you also create jobs in rural places. What's not to like about that opportunity? How do you do that? Well, you basically fund the research. You fund the capacity, the economic development opportunities to create that kind of world. In addition, you provide farmers with additional sensor technology and the ability to understand that each acre of their land is different. And so therefore, the application depends on the nature and characteristic of each acre. The more they know about the land, maybe the less they need. In some cases. It's been suggested by folks at Iowa State that maybe 30% of our corn acres don't necessarily need fertilizer at all. Well, if that's the case, there's a savings for farmers. So, there are a multitude of ways. The challenge with this debate is it's always an or debate. It's not an and debate. And I think our policymakers, our politicians have to start thinking in terms of an. We are a country now that are thinking in terms of or and that stymies it in essentially freezes us from creative thought and creative solutions. There's a solution there. It's creative and it can be great for rural places and for farmers.

[Henderson] Federal incentives are driving a project in Iowa that would take carbon and ship it to underground storage. Elsewhere in the carbon would come from ethanol plants. Corn growers support it. They say it will help them build the market for ethanol. In some places, a carbon neutral or maybe a very low carbon fuel. There are a lot of landowners in Iowa who don't want that pipeline on their land. What's your view of the use of eminent domain for that project?

[Vilsack] Well, I have a slightly different view than most people have about eminent domain. And I think I you know, my history suggests that I vetoed a bill that the legislature passed some time ago to basically expand the use of eminent domain. I think there's a balance between individual property rights, which are really important to protect, and the need for community to have economic opportunity. And the kind of infrastructure that's necessary for folks to be able to have quality of life in all parts of the country. I think there's a, you know, a challenge here. And the challenge is that that it goes back to this issue of small and midsize farming operations. I think if we had a healthier economy for small and midsize farming operations, we might not have quite the angst that we have out there in the countryside today, which reflects itself in the in the pushback on eminent domain. I think if we had a more opportunity for farm families to generate more multiple income streams from what they do on the farm, right now, 88% of farm families in in America and in Iowa have an off-farm job to be able to keep the farm 88%. I mean, what other occupation, what other profession do you have to work two jobs to be able to do the one job that you want to do? Why can't we figure out a way? Not for the farmer to work harder, but for the farm itself to work harder to generate multiple sources of income? I mentioned things with manure, but there's also opportunities with climate smart agriculture to create new market incentives for that which is grown sustainably. There are ecosystem service market credits that can be paid to farmers because they're reducing the footprint of their farming operation. There's local and regional food systems, which is a much better deal for the farmer than the $0.20 I mentioned earlier. It's a 50 to $0.70 of the food dollar goes to the farmer. Why can't we create a structure and system like that? I think if we had that kind of system, we'd have a little bit less angst. Let me tell you something about the pipeline. You know, we're all proud of our ethanol industry, and our corn growers have done an amazing job. They've continued to expand access to and produce more corn. Some people are concerned about it. Some people think that biofuel industries not necessarily a good thing. It's going to lead to more land in sustainable, unsustainable practices. But here's the deal. Our aviation industry is absolutely intent on having sustainable aviation fuel. You cannot make that fuel in a sustainable way. Cost competitively unless you basically incent certain practices on the farm and you incent the ability to basically capture the carbon that's produced, produced from developing that fuel and redirecting it someplace else. You know, we may not have electric cars today, but at some point, in time we're going to have vehicles that don't need as much transportation fuel as we have today. And the question is, what happens to our ethanol industry? What happens to the jobs connected to the ethanol industry? What happens to the stability of the corn, the corn market and the corn farmers when that occurs? But if you have sustainable aviation fuel, which is a 36-billion-gallon industry twice the size of ethanol, now you've got a sustainable future as well. You've got more jobs, you've got a better environment, and you have more income for farmers. What, again, is not to like about something like that? So, we this is again the or situation, right. This whole discussion is about or somebody needs to talk about well how do we make this an and discussion. Why do we constantly put ourselves in a position where it's either your idea or my idea? Why can't we come together and say, what's our idea?

[Murphy] Well, in that spirit, in our last couple of minutes, we wanted to talk about this stuff and a little bit of Iowa politics. Before we let you go, too.

[Vilsack] Haven't we already been doing that?

[Murphy] Well that's true. Fair enough. In literally the last couple of minutes here, you've been talking to Democrats across the state, working a little bit with the state party to figure out a way that Iowa Democrats can connect with voters a little better than they have in recent elections. What lessons have you learned or what --

[Vilsack] Better? They're not connected at all.

[Murphy] Okay.

[Vilsack] Let's be fair about it. I mean, let's be let's be honest about it. The Democratic Party has not communicated effectively except in a few limited circumstances of people outside of the state where we just haven't simply haven't talked to these folks.

[Murphy] And so what are the lessons in 90 seconds?

[Vilsack] First and foremost, you have to talk about folks in a way that you express appreciation for what they do. What does rural Iowa do? What does rural America do for us? Well, it feeds us. You know, the water that we drink is impacting, affected by what happens there. The energy, all the energy for this show and for our instruments and so forth. And our computers. Where does it come from? It comes from rural places. Where do we go when we want to get away from it all? We don't go to necessarily the big city. We go to the iconic landscapes which are located where in rural places, who sends their sons and daughters disproportionately into military, rural Americans. It's a really important place. So first you got to talk about it and you have to express the appreciation. You also have to understand the stress that they're under, as we've lost 544,970 farm families, that means that there are fewer kids going to rural schools. What does that mean? It means there's more pressure on those rural schools. Eventually, they have to consolidate and merge. Nobody likes that. The small business owner doesn't have as many customers. So that small business owner doesn't survive. What do you put in place, a box store? Where do the profits from that box store go? They don't go in Iowa. They go outside of Iowa. There aren't enough people to basically support the health care system. So, what does that mean? You can't get a doc. You can't support your hospital. It becomes a clinic. You got to drive a million miles to get health care. You watch your children and your grandchildren leave. Devastating. Emotionally devastating. I don't care what anybody says about zoom and about web and about all of that. Great. But you can't hug over those over those technologies. The reality is there's been a slow erosion. So, somebody's got to speak to that. And Democrats need to speak to it, and they need to have a plan. They need to have a vision for how things can get better. So, it's not big or get out in agriculture, but it's get entrepreneurial and create opportunity.

[Henderson] My vision is the clock and we are out of time. Governor, thank you for joining us on this edition of Iowa Press.

This year’s show shines a spotlight on innovation and technology and also what is needed to attract and retain talent as workforce issues persist industry-wide. Organisers at RX Global are now shaping a complementary and complimentary line up of seminars which mirror the conference themes, aligning with stellar speakers from all over the world. Click here to be part of the journey – http://bit.ly/3HzK6uJ

“We are thrilled to be running this event once again in collaboration with Munich Airport,” commented Event Director Syreeta Tranfield, who is most enthusiastic to return to RX to lead the show. Syreeta is working alongside Maria Gabriels, Product Marketing Manager, dedicated to IAE25 and Polly Magraw, RX Global’s Portfolio Director – Transport.

Also welcoming the return of the show Jost Lammers, CEO of Munich Airport commented: “We are delighted to be the gateway for the global airport community participating in inter airport Europe 2025. For over two decades, this exhibition has been driving innovations and technologies in the airport industry. As a premium airport that focuses on optimising processes and the passenger experience through innovation and digitalisation, we acknowledge the significance of this leading exhibition.”

Organisers are pledging a lot of value-add content this year, throughout the show floor. Here are this year’s themes:

Sustainability - as airports prioritise operational efficiencies, IAE25 will tackle how regulations differ between the EU / UK / and governments around the world and how the industry needs to collaborate and cooperate to achieve compliance and harmonisation. The exhibition’s sustainability track will also cover successes in scaling the supply of sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen fuelling infrastructure projects and how airports are decarbonising airside operations in line with the industry’s net-zero goal. It will also look at how airports can be designed sustainably.

Technology & Innovation -How are airport operations benefitting from digitalisation? How is generative AI transforming day-to-day airport operations? And from the passengers’ perspective, how are airports deploying technology to create optimal customer experiences? Exhibitors and speakers will address the opportunities, solutions and challenges with AI and machine learning.

Cyber Security – Security remains an ongoing priority at airports with cyber security breaches increasingly prevalent. Rising geopolitical tension and the use of generative AI in cyberattacks adds to the severity and frequency of these threats. How can airports stay vigilant? What crisis communication strategies should they have in place? With a growing range of diverse (non-aviation) stakeholders, find out how all parties can be kept adequately informed.

Safety & security – Passenger and baggage screening is an integral part of airport operations, ensuring the safe and smooth passage of customers. How do advances in smart screening technology developments improve detection and how can airports best embrace biometric developments, addressing passenger privacy concerns? Airside – IAE25 will explore security runways, taxiways, and navigational systems and the threats these areas face.

Big Data - Gen AI is contributing to the data influx. How do we handle such volumes of big data? IAE25 will demonstrate how big data is driving decision making and efficiency at airports with real life case studies.

Workforce of the future - Five years on from the global pandemic, aviation is still workforce deficient. For an airport to thrive and flourish it needs dedicated people. Attracting new talent and retaining existing personnel is a top priority. IAE25 will look at the skill sets future leaders need to help develop their human resource in a constantly evolving industry. It will also explore how the wider rollout of AI and automation is impacting the workforce.

Airport Development and Infrastructure – With passenger traffic set to double over the next 20 years, IAE25 will delve into the factors driving this growth and how airports are responding. The exhibition offers an ideal platform to showcase some of the exciting terminal projects and innovations being developed across the Middle East and Asia. It will also look at new airport projects being implemented across Europe and how they are embracing continuous learning around efficiency.",https://www.atc-network.com/Upload/Editor/Events/inter-airport-Europe-2023-seminar-sessions1.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 23:00:46.595342
,,2025-07-10 16:20:36+00:00,UkrAgroConsult - World-class agricultural consulting,Palm waste emerges as key SAF feedstock in SE Asia amid UCO constraints,Not Available,,,,,https://ukragroconsult.com/en/news/palm-waste-emerges-as-key-saf-feedstock-in-se-asia-amid-uco-constraints/,"“We’re seeing a high level of interest in certified sustainable palm-derived feedstocks,” said moderator Thareq Ariffin Mohd Tajmi of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
Local feedstock, from palm biomass to alcohol sources, will define each country’s SAF strategy.” Palm players pave way Malaysia and Indonesia together account for approximately 85% of global palm oil production.
The geographic spread of palm residues adds logistical challenges, especially for producers focused on exports.
Sustainable palm residues, once viewed as by-products or waste, are emerging as strategic assets in a more localized, resilient SAF ecosystem.
Additionally, Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and Indonesia’s B40+ biodiesel programs are boosting interest in higher-value uses of palm residues, including for SAF.","Up to 500 million mt of palm-based residues and biomass in Southeast Asia in Southeast Asia could be tapped to produce sustainable aviation fuel, helping the region diversify, beyond limited used cooking oil supplies, experts said at the MyAero SAF Symposium this week from July 1-3.

In a wide-ranging panel titled “Beyond UCO – Sustainable Palm-Based Feedstock as a Game Changer for SAF Development in APAC,” experts from technology licensors, leading palm industry companies, and sustainability organizations stressed the urgent need to diversify SAF sources, emphasizing waste and residue streams from palm oil production as a largely unused solution.

“We’re seeing a high level of interest in certified sustainable palm-derived feedstocks,” said moderator Thareq Ariffin Mohd Tajmi of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). “We’re not talking about virgin palm oil—this is about second-generation waste and residues like empty fruit bunches, palm oil mill effluent, and sludge oils that can be valorized for SAF.”

Throughout the discussion, panelists agreed that while UCO has helped jumpstart SAF production, its limitations in volume and price volatility mean Southeast Asia must now unlock its indigenous advantages in sustainable palm-based feedstocks.

UCO is currently the primary feedstock for HEFA-SAF but faces significant supply constraints. The IEA estimates global UCO supply at 6 million mt/year, mainly concentrated in China, the US, and the EU.

Southeast Asia, despite being a significant biofuels region, imports UCO to meet biodiesel mandates. This raises concerns about UCO’s scalability for SAF in the region.

Mature tech, emerging potential

Technology providers Topsoe and Axens emphasized the readiness of HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathways—already dominant in today’s SAF market—but highlighted the limitations in UCO availability.

“From now until 2030, HEFA will remain the leading SAF pathway due to maturity and lower cost,” said Colin Choong, Key Account Manager at Topsoe. “But post-2030, feedstock constraints will push the market toward alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), Fischer-Tropsch (FT), and e-fuels. Flexibility in feedstock and hydrogen sourcing will become crucial.”

Topsoe’s integrated HydroFlex™ and HydrogenBridge™ technologies were presented as key enablers for reducing carbon intensity, especially when plant off-gases are reused to generate hydrogen.

Axens’ Sebastien Huchette echoed this view: “The SAF story is no longer just about HEFA. We’re advancing ATJ and BTL [biomass-to-liquids] technologies and working on future methanol-to-jet (MTJ) pathways. Local feedstock, from palm biomass to alcohol sources, will define each country’s SAF strategy.”

Palm players pave way

Malaysia and Indonesia together account for approximately 85% of global palm oil production. For every metric ton of crude palm oil (CPO) produced, several tonnes of by-products are generated: Empty Fruit Bunches, POME, PKS, and PAO, among others.

These are considered second-generation, non-food, non-feed biomass and meet sustainability thresholds under many SAF frameworks.

Representing one of Malaysia’s largest palm producers, FGV’s Dr. Noor Azam Md Saad confirmed growing interest from the palm industry to engage in SAF ventures. “Our ecosystem—from plantations to mills—is already optimized for biomass valorization. While CPO remains our core business, we’re actively exploring partnerships to unlock SAF potential using residues like POME and sludge oils.”

Malaysia’s Loken, a homegrown energy firm, also outlined plans to increase SAF production using domestic palm waste. “Feedstock availability isn’t the issue,” said Navin Kumar, COO. “The challenge is logistics—collecting, aggregating, and processing scattered biomass at a viable cost.”

Economics, logistics, and policy

While technology advances quickly, panelists warned that costs and policy barriers still exist. Alternative SAF pathways, although promising, require significant capital. The geographic spread of palm residues adds logistical challenges, especially for producers focused on exports.

“The price premium airlines are willing to pay increasingly depends on carbon intensity,” noted Topsoe’s Choong. “That makes hydrogen sourcing and process efficiency a make-or-break factor in plant economics.”

Both Axens and Topsoe emphasized the importance of policy support and carbon credit schemes that acknowledge low-carbon SAF production pathways. Indonesia’s geothermal potential, Malaysia’s biomass infrastructure, and Thailand’s alcohol supply could each support different SAF technologies—if they receive the right investment signals.

Looking ahead

As UCO volumes plateau and global mandates become more stringent, the Asia-Pacific SAF sector is being encouraged to pursue deeper feedstock innovation. Sustainable palm residues, once viewed as by-products or waste, are emerging as strategic assets in a more localized, resilient SAF ecosystem.

“It’s not just about technology,” concluded RSPO’s Thareq. “It’s about connecting feedstock producers, technology providers, and off-takers under a long-term, sustainable vision for aviation decarbonization in the region.”

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil has certified over 4.9 million hectares worldwide and encourages the use of waste and residues from certified mills as a low-ILUC (Indirect Land Use Change) risk option for biofuels.

RSPO-certified feedstocks are increasingly being sought for SAF and renewable diesel production, especially in markets like Europe and Singapore, where traceability is essential.

EU’s RED II and RED III include stricter criteria for UCO traceability and indirectly promote diversification toward waste and residue-based SAF.

Moreover, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation permits a wide variety of feedstocks—including palm mill residues—if they meet sustainability and lifecycle GHG criteria.

Additionally, Malaysia’s National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and Indonesia’s B40+ biodiesel programs are boosting interest in higher-value uses of palm residues, including for SAF.

Why widespread SAF adoption matters for aviation’s future

SAF represents aviation’s most immediate pathway to significant emissions reductions, yet adoption remains frustratingly slow across much of the sector.

Robinson’s research reveals a stark reality: in 2023, 52% of airlines did not use any SAF, highlighting a fundamental challenge in the industry’s journey toward net-zero emissions by 2050.

The implications of this slow adoption extend beyond individual airline sustainability goals. “In the long run, if half the industry decarbonises and the other half does nothing, we still have a problem—not just for the industry, but for the planet as a whole,” says Robinson. This uneven progress also threatens to undermine collective climate commitments and risks creating competitive distortions between early and late adopters.

Robinson emphasises that achieving meaningful climate impact requires industry-wide transformation. The current trajectory, where SAF represents just 0.21% of global fuel consumption, demands exponential growth. “We have to get to 10% by 2030,” he notes, describing the steep curve required. Reaching this ambitious target necessitates engaging the broader industry, not just the small group of early movers, to take meaningful action.

5 takeaways from the conversation

1. The innovation paradox: how safety culture blocks progress

Aviation’s deep-rooted safety culture, while essential for operational operations, can paradoxically hinder the very innovations needed for sustainability, argues Robinson. He sees this cultural dynamic as a central reason why many airlines remain hesitant to adopt SAF at scale.

“Airlines have long been built around safety cultures, and when it comes to operations, that’s a very good thing,” Robinson explains. “But when it comes to innovation—particularly technological change—that can be a very bad thing.”

This ingrained risk-aversion, shaped by decades of risk management, now acts as a barrier to adopting sustainable technologies. Robinson points out that airlines often avoid being first movers, due to the financial and operational risks associated with unproven innovations. “Why go and innovate, do something different, do something more expensive, if another competitor will do it for you?” he asks. “Being first is expensive. Being first has risks.”

The result is a widespread “fast follower” mindset, as Robinson puts it, where airlines prefer to wait and adopt solutions only after others have proven them viable. While this caution-first approach may minimise individual risk, Robinson warns that it can become a systemic obstacle, slowing or even hindering the coordinated progress urgently needed for industry-wide decarbonisation.

2. Finding the right balance: competition vs collaboration

Accelerating SAF adoption requires more than cooperation; it demands a strategic blend of collaboration and competition, both of which Robinson sees as essential to driving meaningful progress.

This balance helps resolve two common challenges: the collective action problem that often slows infrastructure development and the lack of urgency among airlines when adoption is left entirely to voluntary action.

Collaboration alone, Robinson warns, can enable free-riding. “That’s what you see with the 55% of airlines globally that haven’t used any SAF whatsoever,” he says. “They’re free-riding on the other 45%.”

However, unchecked competition can lead to greenwashing, making it essential, Robinson argues, to have clear structures and standards grounded in collaboration. Even so, he maintains that it’s competition that ultimately drives performance and accountability.

For Robinson, the path forward is clear: true progress requires both collaboration and competition, not one at the expense of the other.

3. How regulatory backlash stifles progress

Greenwashing accusations and regulatory crackdowns can have an unintended consequence: discouraging genuine sustainability efforts across aviation, says Robinson. He also sees this as a significant barrier to accelerating SAF adoption and broader decarbonisation efforts.

Robinson cites the greenwashing case against KLM as a prime example. “It’s a real travesty that they ended up in the headlines and were effectively penalised for doing meaningful work, and talking about it,” he says. He details KLM’s substantial contributions: one of the world’s first SAF flights, the first global investment by an airline in a SAF producer, and the creation of corporate partnerships to co-fund SAF purchases. “They even operated the world’s first power-to-liquid flight,” he adds.

KLM’s sustainability efforts drew legal and regulatory scrutiny, which Robinson suggests has made some airlines more cautious about public communication. This caution, he notes, may be weakening the public support and political will needed to scale sustainable solutions.

He argues that while some regulatory oversight is necessary, recent rulings, particularly those in the Netherlands and UK, have gone too far. “If you can’t describe anything as sustainable, even when it’s part of government policy, then it becomes almost impossible to communicate progress or drive demand,” he explains.

4. Why Europe leads in SAF adoption

The contrast in SAF adoption between European and North American airlines reflects deeper cultural and policy differences in how sustainability is prioritised. Drawing on his experience, Aaron Robinson offers insight into the regional dynamics behind this uneven global progress.

“In Europe, sustainability is fundamentally more important and significantly more prioritised,” Robinson notes.

This cultural emphasis drives not only stronger climate policies but also influences corporate behaviour. “Companies follow through on those policies because they see the demand from both their customers and employees,” he adds.

Policy frameworks further reinforce these cultural divides. European carriers benefit from a range of supportive measures, including national-level SAF incentives, emissions trading schemes, and airport-specific programmes like Heathrow’s. These tools create a financial rationale for adopting SAF, making it not just environmentally sound but economically practical.

5. Making SAF economically viable

IAG’s experience in scaling SAF adoption illustrates how airlines can build a viable business case for cleaner fuels by combining regulatory incentives, market dynamics, and strategic partnerships. According to Robinson, this multifaceted approach is essential for making SAF more accessible, despite its current price premium.

Robinson attributes IAG’s success in part to a supportive policy environment in the UK and Europe. National-level SAF incentives, emissions trading schemes, and airport-specific programs, such as those at Heathrow, combine to strengthen the economic case for adoption.

A key part of IAG’s strategy also involves working with corporate customers to bridge the price gap. “We’ve done a great deal of work with companies like DHL, Microsoft, and Kühne + Nagel that have helped fund that [price] difference [between SAF and conventional fuel],” says Robinson. “These partnerships have made it extremely affordable for us to decarbonise,” he adds, as corporate clients contribute to SAF costs to meet their own climate targets.

However, Robinson is realistic about the limitations of this approach. “[Corporate partnerships are] not going to be an unlimited well,” he cautions. “It helps jumpstart the industry, but in the long term, we need to bring those premiums down—through scaling up, efficiencies, and innovation.”

Three ads, shown on LinkedIn, Google, and Instagram between 22 November 2023 and 5 January 2024, were under scrutiny. They featured imagery of Aston Martin’s F1 car bearing Aramco branding and text highlighting research into “ultra-efficient hybrid internal combustion engines and advanced fuels.”

The Instagram video included a voice-over posing questions about innovation, emissions and reaching global net-zero targets.

Aramco responded by stating the ads were not promoting its broader activities or environmental record, but were specifically focused on its role in the F1 partnership and efforts to enhance vehicle performance. The company also noted it does not sell products directly to UK consumers and did not believe further environmental context was necessary.

The ASA agreed, stating the ads would be understood by viewers as highlighting research into performance-related technologies within a motorsport context.

The watchdog determined that while some questions in the ads, such as “How can we pioneer fuel that could lower emissions?”, implied environmental ambition. But it ruled that these were speculative and not positioned as factual claims about Aramco’s current operations.

In assessing the phrase “advanced fuels,” the regulator found it was used in a technical rather than environmental context and did not require further clarification in the absence of explicit green claims.

The decision comes despite the regulator’s recent track record of banning similar fossil fuel-linked campaigns for failing to include material information.

In recent months, the ASA has ordered high-street bank Lloyds to pull a social media campaign for implying climate credentials without acknowledging its fossil fuel financing. It also banned a Virgin Atlantic radio advert promoting sustainable aviation fuel, and a TotalEnergies campaign that claimed it was on the “road to carbon-neutral” while underplaying its ongoing fossil fuel operations.

Racing to net-zero

F1 is aiming to enable the use of 100% alternative, lower-carbon fuels in its race cars by 2026. The partnership between Aston Martin F1 team and Aramco aligns with this aim.

F1 has also set a 2030 net-zero target. It is striving for a 50% reduction in absolute emissions by this point and will offset the remaining residual emissions.

As the world’s largest oil producer, Aramco extracts more than 12 million barrels of oil and gas per day.

In 2024, the company invested more than $50bn across its portfolio, spanning traditional hydrocarbons and expanding renewable energy assets.

As part of its ‘energy transition strategy’, Aramco has committed to developing up to 12 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind capacity by the end of the decade.

Indian Oil Corp plans to temporarily shut down its 300,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser unit at its Panipat refinery for an upgrade. This upgrade aims to produce 30,000 metric tons per year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil (UCO). Indian Oil will also invite bids for a green hydrogen plant and a sustainable aviation fuel project.

Indian Oil Corp plans to shut its 300,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser unit at its Panipat refinery for an upgrade aimed at producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) next year, Arvind Kumar, its head of refineries, said on Thursday.

The overhaul of the diesel unit is scheduled for late this year or early next year, Kumar told an industry event in New Delhi.

India aims to have 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in aviation fuel by 2027, doubling to 2% in 2028.

The refinery's diesel output would not be hit due to the shutdown as the refiner has additional diesel hydrotreaters at the Panipat site.

The upgraded unit will process used cooking oil (UCO) to produce 30,000 metric tons per year of SAF, he said.

Live Events

Indian Oil, the country's largest refiner, will also look at upgrading some kerosene-producing units at other refineries to make SAF, he said.

He also said that Indian Oil will soon invite bids for a 70,000 tons-per-year green hydrogen plant and a sustainable aviation fuel project.

Indian Oil has already awarded a bid to build a 10,000 tons-per-year green hydrogen facility at the Panipat refinery to engineering major Larsen and Toubro. L&T will build and operate the plant and sell green hydrogen to Indian Oil at 397 Indian rupees ($4.64) per kilogram.

India has set a target for refiners to meet half of their hydrogen demand through green hydrogen by 2030, he said.

He highlighted India’s renewed push in hydrocarbon exploration, announcing the opening of 2.5 lakh sq km under the OALP Round-10.
Our goal is to expand exploration acreage to 0.5 million sq km by 2025 and 1 million sq km by 2030,” he said.
“India will account for nearly 25% of the incremental global energy demand growth in the coming years,” he noted.","Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, spoke at the 9th OPEC International Seminar in Vienna, Austria, addressing a gathering of leaders, industry experts, and professionals on the topic of “Oil Markets: Energy Security, Growth & Prosperity.”

Puri detailed India’s strategy to manage the uncertain global energy scenario, which includes diversifying crude import sources from 27 to 40 countries, boosting domestic production, developing alternative fuels, transitioning toward a gas-based economy, and aiming to become a global refining hub by raising refining capacity to 310 MMTPA by 2028 and expanding petrochemical capacity to build a $300 billion industry by 2030.

Despite geopolitical challenges worldwide, India has managed to balance energy availability, affordability, and sustainability. It remains the only major economy to reduce fuel prices amid rising global oil costs. “Our target is to achieve energy independence by 2047 and reach Net Zero emissions by 2070,” he stated.

He highlighted India’s renewed push in hydrocarbon exploration, announcing the opening of 2.5 lakh sq km under the OALP Round-10. “With this significant move and the near discovery of a Guyana-scale oilfield in the Andaman Sea, India is undertaking one of its most ambitious exploration efforts under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Our goal is to expand exploration acreage to 0.5 million sq km by 2025 and 1 million sq km by 2030,” he said.

This plan is backed by important policy changes, including the shift from a Production Sharing Contract system to a Revenue Sharing Model under HELP. Amendments to the ORD Act of 1948 aim to improve lease management, safety, and dispute resolution while integrating renewables into hydrocarbon projects. Furthermore, the reduction of ‘No-Go’ areas by 99% has opened over 1 million sq km for exploration, supported by initiatives such as the National Seismic Program, Andaman Offshore Project, Mission Anveshan, and the Extended Continental Shelf Survey.

As the world’s third-largest energy consumer with a demand of around 5.4 million barrels per day, India is positioned as both a key growth engine and a long-term stabilizer of global oil markets. “India will account for nearly 25% of the incremental global energy demand growth in the coming years,” he noted.

The Minister also emphasized the growing role of biofuels, mentioning the Global Biofuels Alliance, which now includes over 29 countries and 14 international organizations collaborating to scale up sustainable biofuels. Within India, the use of ethanol, compressed biogas (CBG), biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is accelerating as part of the country’s decarbonization plan. “India believes the global energy transition must be just, inclusive, and equitable. For 1.4 billion Indians and many more in the Global South, it must also guarantee development with dignity,” he added.

Puri also highlighted India’s inclusive approach to energy access. Over 103 million LPG connections have been provided to women from economically weaker households through the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana — the world’s largest clean cooking program — significantly improving energy access and public health.

As a result, LPG coverage in India has surged from 55% in 2014 to nearly universal access today. Despite a 58% rise in international LPG prices, beneficiaries of the scheme pay only $6–7 for a 14.2 kg cylinder — about 39% less than the $10–11 charged in July 2023 — thanks to substantial government support and oil marketing companies absorbing $4.7 billion in losses last year to keep prices affordable.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ANI-Hardeep-Singh-puri.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 14:12:31.903050

China’s Greater Bay Area ideal SAF hub: Cathay Pacific

Shanghai, 10 July (Argus) — China's Greater Bay Area (GBA) could become a global demonstration zone for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) within 2-3 years, said Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific's head of climate action Nikola Xing at the Sustainable Aviation Forum in Guangzhou today. The GBA's strategic advantage is its world-class airport cluster, which includes the Guangzhou Baiyun, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Zhuhai and Macau airports, as their proximity makes SAF deliveries easier, he said. The cluster is expected to generate demand for up to 15mn t/yr of jet fuel, but the proportion of SAF in this mix remains undetermined. Hong Kong is expected to set a SAF consumption target in 2025, but has not yet done so. Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has set a SAF consumption target for 2025 of 50,000t (1,000 b/d), but the country does not have a mandate for SAF usage yet. Cathay Pacific consumed 217.8t of SAF between 2016 and 2023 and aims to use SAF for 10pc of its total fuel consumption by 2030, Xing said. The airline also started using SAF to offset 10pc of emissions from staff duty travel starting from 2024. Cathay Pacific also aims to support the development of SAF technologies and signed an initial agreement with State Power Investment (SPIC) in 2023 to encourage the use of the power-to-liquid (PtL) pathway. Most SAF plants produce via the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway, but interest is growing in the alcohol-to-jet and PtL pathways.

Opec sees oil demand rising to 123mn b/d by 2050

London, 10 July (Argus) — Opec has raised its long-term oil demand forecast by nearly 3mn b/d, driven by stronger growth in India and the Middle East and a shifting policy landscape that it says is reinforcing fossil fuels' role in the global energy mix. ""There is no peak oil demand on the horizon,"" Opec secretary-general Haitham al-Ghais said in the group's latest World Oil Outlook (WOO), repeating a line he used in last year's edition and underscoring Opec's ongoing rejection of forecasts that see oil use peaking before 2030. Opec argues that such forecasts underestimate demand growth in developing economies and overstate the pace of the energy transition. The 2025 WOO lifts Opec's 2050 oil demand projection to 122.9mn b/d, from 120.1mn b/d in last year's WOO. Its 2040 forecast is revised up to 120mn b/d from 117.8mn b/d. The 2030 outlook is unchanged at 113.3mn b/d, but the group sees a steeper rise in demand in the later years of the forecast. While the overall trajectory remains consistent with last year's WOO, the new report places greater emphasis on policy recalibration in major economies. It highlights growing political resistance to decarbonisation targets — particularly in the US and parts of Europe — and said energy affordability and supply security are increasingly shaping national strategies. These shifts, Opec suggests, are slowing the pace of energy transitions and supporting continued oil demand growth. The 2025 WOO adopts a more cautious tone on electrification, citing infrastructure and cost challenges, and acknowledges the geopolitical effect of the US' second withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement — a development not covered in last year's edition. India leads the pack India makes the biggest single contribution to the long-term demand increase. Opec forecasts the country's oil use to more than double from 2024, to 13.7mn b/d by 2050. Demand in China, on the other hand, rises in the medium term but flattens after 2035, reflecting slower economic growth and rising electric vehicle uptake. OECD demand is projected by Opec to edge up to 46.6mn b/d by 2030 — from 45.7mn b/d in 2024 — before entering a steady decline. By 2050, it is put at 37.2mn b/d, led by sharp reductions in Europe's transport and residential sectors. The sectoral breakdown remains broadly unchanged from last year. Road transport, petrochemicals and aviation account for most of the demand growth between 2025 and 2050. Oil use in road transport is forecast to rise by 5.3mn b/d, aviation by 4.2mn b/d and petrochemicals by 4.7mn b/d. Supply to match demand On the supply side, Opec projects global liquids output at 113.6mn b/d by 2030 and 123mn b/d by 2050. It still expects US production to peak at just over 23mn b/d around 2030, before falling to 19.6mn b/d by mid-century. Non-Opec+ supply is seen plateauing in the 2030s, with Opec+ producers expected to meet most of the incremental demand, lifting their share of global supply to 52pc by 2050 from 48pc in 2024. Opec estimates $18.2 trillion of investment will be needed to meet oil demand through to 2050, up from $17.4 trillion in the 2024 report. Of the total, $14.9 trillion — more than 80pc — is allocated to upstream. The group reiterated that underinvestment could threaten future supply security and market stability. The report notes refining capacity is expected to keep pace with long-term demand growth, but warns of a potential short-term tightening later this decade as the rise in oil demand outpaces new capacity — particularly in Asia-Pacific.

US’ 50pc Cu levy unlikely to dent Japan’s metal output

Tokyo, 10 July (Argus) — The US' sweeping 50pc tariff on copper imports effective from 1 August is expected to have minimal impact on Japanese metal producers given limited shipments to the US market. The impact of the blanket 50pc tariff by the US government will be negligible, a domestic electric copper producer told Argus on 10 July, because the company primarily supplies copper products to Asian nations. There are virtually no shipments to the US market, it added. The company's selling prices are likely to remain stable given that most purchase agreements are locked in through term contracts, the firm said. The company has not yet received unexpected windfall orders following the White House's announcement of the tariff hikes. Another Japanese metal producer echoed this sentiment, saying that the US' tariff measure is unlikely to hit its operations given limited deliveries to the country. The firm owns stakes in a South American copper mine project but its copper offtake from the mine is not destined for the US market, reinforcing the limited direct impact from the tariffs. But the company expressed concerns over potential broader implications, citing uncertainty around Washington's definition of ""copper products"". The impact could be larger if the US government plans to enforce tariffs on a wider range of copper-based products. The producer's concern also lingers over potential indirect impacts from possible disruptions in the metal supply chain. The company ships processed copper products to Asian nations for further manufacturing in the region, but some of the final products are partly exported to the US market. The company could face challenges if these end-products fall under the new tariff, it added. Japan produced around 1.6mn t of copper ingot in 2024, up by 4.9pc from a year earlier, according to the industry group Japan Mining Industry Association and the Japan Mining Promotive Foundation. Around half of total domestic output is exported, with the majority going to Asian markets, according to a market participant.

Trump threatens 50pc Brazil tariff: Update

Updates with comments from Brazil's vice president Washington, 9 July (Argus) — US president Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 50pc tariff on imports from Brazil from 1 August, citing the ongoing trial of that country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's letter to Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, released on Wednesday, is one of the 22 that the US leader sent to his foreign counterparts since 7 July, announcing new tariff rates that the US will be charging on imports from those countries. But his letter to Brazil stands out for allegations of a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro, who — much like Trump — disputed his electoral defeat and attempted to stay in office. Brazil's supreme court qualified Bolsonaro's actions in 2022 as an attempted coup, ordering him to stand trial. Trump said he will impose the 50pc tariff because ""in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"". The latter is a reference to orders by judges in Brazil to suspend social media accounts for spreading ""misinformation"". Trump separately said he would direct US trade authorities to launch an investigation of Brazil's treatment of US social media platforms — an action likely to result in additional tariffs. Trump's letter to Lula also contains language similar to that included in letters sent to 21 other foreign leaders, accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and suggesting that the only way to avoid payments of tariffs is if Brazilian companies ""decide to build or manufacture product within the US"". The Trump administration since 5 April has been charging a 10pc extra ""Liberation Day"" tariff on most imports — energy commodities and critical minerals are exceptions — from Brazil and nearly every foreign trade partner. Trump on 9 April imposed even higher tariffs on key trading partners, only to delay them the same day until 9 July. On 7 July, Trump signed an executive order further delaying the implementation of higher rates until 12:01am ET (04:01 GMT) on 1 August. Trump earlier this week threatened to impose 10pc tariffs on any country cooperating with the Brics group, which includes Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa. Lula hosted a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July. Brazil vice president Geraldo Alckmin, speaking to reporters before Trump made public his letter to Lula, said: ""I see no reason (for the US) to increase tariffs on Brazil."" The US runs a trade surplus with Brazil, Alckmin said, adding that ""the measure is unjust and will harm America's economy"". Trump has justified his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs by the need to cut the US trade deficit, but the punitive duties also affect imports from countries with which the US has a trade surplus.

(Nasdaq: SAFX) is taking off like a jet on a runway! As of this writing, SAFX is screaming higher, posting an eye-popping gain of over 80% in pre-market trading on July 10, 2025. Why the surge? The company just dropped a bombshell announcement that’s got investors buzzing: a nearly $1 billion plan to build a network of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facilities to decarbonize the skies. Let’s dive into what’s driving this stock’s meteoric rise, what it means for traders, and the risks and rewards of jumping into this high-flying name.

The Catalyst: A Billion-Dollar Bet on Green Skies

XCF Global isn’t just talking the talk—they’re walking the walk when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel. Today’s press release laid out a bold vision: invest close to $1 billion by 2028 to crank out SAF, renewable diesel, and other eco-friendly fuels at multiple new facilities across the U.S. and beyond. This isn’t some pie-in-the-sky dream either; they’ve already poured $350 million into their New Rise Reno facility, which is up and running, producing SAF, renewable diesel, and naphtha since February 2025. That’s real revenue, folks, and the market’s clearly eating it up.

The plan includes three new U.S. sites—New Rise Reno 2, Ft. Myers, Florida, and Wilson, North Carolina—each designed to pump out 40 million gallons of renewable fuel annually. Add that to the existing Reno plant, and XCF’s eyeing a total capacity of 160 million gallons per year by 2028. They’re not stopping at home either; a partnership in Australia aims to bring their modular, patent-pending tech Down Under, tapping into a global market where over 2 billion people already live under SAF mandates, with that number expected to double by 2030. CEO Mihir Dange is swinging for the fences, saying, “We’re not simply dreaming about decarbonizing the aviation industry—we’re building it right now.” That’s the kind of gusto that gets Wall Street’s attention!

This news is a classic catalyst, folks. Big expansion plans, especially in a hot sector like clean energy, can light a fire under a stock. Posts on X are buzzing with excitement, with traders pointing to the 80%+ pre-market pop as a sign of momentum. But before you hit that buy button, let’s break down what’s at play here and how you can navigate this wild ride.

Why SAFX Is Soaring: The Green Fuel Revolution

So, why’s the market going gaga over SAFX? It’s all about timing and trends. The aviation industry’s under pressure to cut carbon emissions, and SAF—made from waste oils, green waste, and non-food crops—is a drop-in solution that doesn’t require airlines to swap out their fleets. Governments worldwide are rolling out mandates and tax credits to push SAF adoption, and XCF’s positioning itself as a first-mover in this niche. Their New Rise Reno facility is already churning out fuel, and with $350 million invested, they’ve got skin in the game.

The numbers tell a story too. XCF’s market cap, as of recent data, is around $125.66 million, with about 149.3 million shares outstanding and a tight free float of less than 20%. That low float can amplify price swings—when demand spikes, like today, there aren’t many shares to go around, so the price rockets. But here’s the flip side: that same low float can make the stock a rollercoaster when sentiment shifts. Volatility’s been a hallmark of SAFX, with a 52-week range from $1.51 to a jaw-dropping $45.90, and a beta of -3.71 signaling it moves in wild, unpredictable ways compared to the market.

The company’s also got a narrative that’s catnip for investors: clean energy, job creation (60 full-time jobs in Reno already), and a scalable model with modular plant designs. Their international push, starting with Australia, shows they’re not just a one-trick pony. But let’s not get too starry-eyed—there’s plenty of risk here, and we’ll get to that in a sec.

Trading in Today’s Market: Lessons from SAFX’s Surge

XCF’s monster move is a textbook case of how news can drive a stock. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just dipping your toes in, here’s what this kind of action teaches us about navigating the markets:

Volatility Is a Double-Edged Sword: SAFX’s 80%+ jump as of this writing is thrilling, but its history of swinging from $1.51 to $45.90 shows it can be a wild ride. Low-float stocks like this can spike fast but also drop just as quickly if the hype fades. Always know your risk tolerance before diving in.

Do Your Homework: XCF’s got a compelling story, but digging into their financials reveals challenges. Their last quarter showed a net income loss of $1.43 million, worse than the prior quarter’s $314,000 loss. With only three employees and disputes with their Reno facility’s landlord and lender, there are red flags. Check filings, read the fine print, and don’t just chase the headlines.

Timing Matters: Early movers in pre-market trading often set the tone for the day, but momentum can fizzle. If you’re eyeing SAFX, watch how it trades after the opening bell. Big pre-market gains can lead to profit-taking, so don’t assume the party lasts all day.

Think Long-Term: As a wise trader once said, “Small gains add up over time; focus on building wealth gradually, not chasing jackpots.” SAFX’s story is exciting, but trading isn’t about one big score—it’s about consistent, disciplined moves.

Risks and Rewards: Is SAFX a Golden Ticket or a Turbulent Flight?

Let’s talk turkey about SAFX’s potential. On the reward side, XCF’s in a sweet spot. The global push for net-zero emissions means SAF demand is set to soar, and XCF’s already producing fuel while others are still planning. Their modular plant design could let them scale fast, and the $1 billion investment plan signals ambition. If they execute, they could grab a chunk of a growing market, especially with partnerships like the one in Australia. A successful expansion could mean big revenue growth, and for a small-cap stock, that’s the kind of story that can drive multiples higher.

But don’t get blinded by the green glow. The risks are real. XCF’s financials are shaky—those net losses aren’t pretty, and their tiny employee count raises questions about operational capacity. Disputes with their landlord and lender over the Reno facility could disrupt production or drain cash. The stock’s volatility is a gut-check; a beta of -3.71 means it doesn’t just dance to its own tune—it’s doing a full-on breakdance. Plus, SAFX doesn’t pay dividends, so you’re banking on price appreciation, which is never guaranteed. And let’s not forget the broader market—economic shifts, regulatory changes, or a drop in oil prices could mess with SAF demand.

Then there’s the execution risk. Building three new plants and going international sounds great, but $1 billion is a big number for a company with a $125 million market cap. They’ll need to raise cash, likely through debt or dilutive stock offerings, which could spook investors. The SEC filings also warn about regulatory hurdles, competition, and the risk of not meeting Nasdaq’s listing standards. This isn’t a slam dunk, folks.

The Big Picture: Why SAFX Matters for Traders

XCF Global’s surge today is a reminder that the market loves a good story, especially one tied to a megatrend like clean energy. But it’s also a wake-up call to trade smart. Stocks like SAFX can be a trader’s dream—big moves, big potential—but they’re also a minefield of risks. Whether you’re bullish on their SAF mission or skeptical of their financials, the key is to stay informed and nimble.

BBC News, Bristol

Plans to expand Bristol Airport to 15 million passengers a year will be ""destructive"" to the climate and pose health risks, a councillor has said.

Under the proposals, the airport's runway will be extended and flights to the US and the Middle East, including additional late-night services, will be introduced.

Bristol Airport said the move was in response to a ""growing demand"" for travel, and would boost job opportunities and economic growth in the region.

But speaking at a council meeting, councillor Izzy Russell said: ""Time and time again we have made it clear that expansion is not wanted or needed.""

Two years ago, the airport won permission from the High Court to expand from 10 million to 12 million passengers per year, although this has yet to be implemented.

At a Bristol City Council meeting on Tuesday, the majority of councillors formally opposed the airport's new plans, the Conservative members backed them, and Labour councillors abstained from a vote.

However, the decision on granting planning permission will ultimately be taken by North Somerset Council, as the airport falls within its patch.

Green councillor Ms Russell, who tabled the motion, explained the symbolic vote served as ""a sign of solidarity"".

""This airport expansion is not just a destruction of our environment, it represents the erosion of democracy,"" she said.

Ms Russell cited concerns with congestion, noise pollution at night, carbon emissions, health risks and ""precious wildlife being increasingly encroached upon"".

She added that ""sustainable aviation fuel"" only makes up a small percentage of total aviation fuel, and electric and hydrogen planes are unfeasible anytime soon.

But according to Labour councillors, in the event the airport does not expand, people will still want to fly to America or the Middle East.

They will just do so from London instead, resulting in more emissions.

""The world is heating up, we are in a climate emergency, and the airport is a big contributor to emissions,"" Labour councillor Susan Kollar said.

""But I'm not convinced that stopping one regional airport from expanding is the best way to reduce emissions.

""We need to decarbonise air travel and the best way to do this is tackling demand and providing alternatives.""

She also suggested the government roll out a frequent flyer levy to discourage excessive flying.

A Bristol Airport spokesperson said the plans have been published following an ""extensive consultation with local communities and businesses"".

""The airport is vital in providing a gateway for visitors to explore the South West – supporting the tourism sector that many local businesses and attractions rely on,"" they said.

The airport is the largest private sector employer in our area, providing about 5,500 jobs on-site, the spokesperson added.

""We expect our proposals to deliver 1,000 additional on-site jobs and support many more in our region, boosting economic growth.

""We hope to be able to work with Bristol City Council, so that we maximise the economic benefits for our city,"" they added.

The plans are expected to be submitted to North Somerset Council in the autumn.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/342f/live/2ee536f0-5d61-11f0-ac62-59034e8db663.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 11:19:14.929302

Editor’s note: Serafina Lalany is the executive director of the Northwest Arkansas Council’s StartupNWA.","Congress just passed the Budget Reconciliation Bill, a sweeping 1,200-page piece of legislation that will significantly impact the U.S. economy.

Commonly referred to as the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” it has drawn national attention for its more controversial provisions, including a permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts and significant funding reductions for healthcare and SNAP benefits.

But beyond the headlines, several lesser-known measures could reshape the trajectory of early-stage companies and investors across the country. For regions like Northwest Arkansas, the bill may unlock new momentum in building a stronger innovation economy.

This analysis focuses on a narrow slice of the law: provisions that directly affect how capital is taxed, deployed and recovered in the innovation economy. In many respects, the legislation is good news for founders, funders and the future of startup formation.

A Boost for Early-Stage Investment

One of the most impactful changes is the expansion of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) treatment. The law raises the cap on tax-free gains from $10 million to $15 million and clarifies eligibility for more business models. It also introduces a partial exclusion structure for holders under five years. For founders finalizing equity grants or converting Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), this change could lock in long-term upside. For early investors, it shifts incentives toward high-risk, high-reward startup investing, the kind of capital most needed in emerging ecosystems like Northwest Arkansas.

Expensing Changes Give Startups Breathing Room

The bill restores full expensing for domestic R&D and makes 100% bonus depreciation for qualified equipment permanent. These changes are critical for capital-intensive startups in biotech, hardware and energy. Expensing real costs in the year they’re incurred helps stretch runway and defer taxes. It also improves optics for later-stage investors evaluating burn rates and margins. These provisions give early-stage companies in places like Northwest Arkansas more room to grow.

AI and Clean Tech: Mixed Signals

The bill includes $150 million in federal funding to build science-grade AI infrastructure through the Department of Energy. This signals growing federal interest in AI for research, defense and health care. For companies in these areas, the funding could accelerate development.

At the same time, lawmakers dropped a proposal for national AI standards, leaving most companies to navigate a patchwork of state laws. That creates a divide: science-focused AI may benefit from new investment, while commercial AI faces continued uncertainty.

Clean tech saw setbacks and new openings. EV credits end after the third quarter of 2025, and incentives for solar, wind and hydrogen are being phased out earlier than expected. That sharpens the divide between companies that can stand alone and those that rely on subsidy. One bright spot: the bill expands eligibility for Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), allowing more clean energy projects, including sustainable aviation fuel and domestic nuclear, to access infrastructure capital.

Boosts for Defense, Biotech and Manufacturing

Other sectors saw targeted support. Defense tech received increased investment across autonomous systems, cybersecurity and Indo-Pacific resilience. Biotech retained orphan drug protections and benefits from restored R&D expensing. Manufacturing gained a 35% CHIPS investment credit and full expensing for new U.S.-based facilities, lowering costs for domestic production.

Why It Matters for Northwest Arkansas

Northwest Arkansas has seen a surge of startup activity in recent years but still faces gaps in early-stage capital. For local founders and angel investors, the QSBS expansion could make equity more attractive, especially for patient capital. Programs like VC Immersions, which connect startups with national investors, are well-positioned to help founders seize this moment. The region’s push into applied AI, manufacturing and logistics tech could also benefit from the bill’s incentives and shift in national priorities.

A More Technical, But No Less Consequential Shift

While the full impact of this legislation won’t be clear for years, many of its provisions could open new opportunities outside traditional investment hubs. It doesn’t include a flashy grant program or targeted stimulus. Instead, it changes the mechanics: tax treatment, expensing and sector-specific incentives. For the right companies in the right regions, that shift could be just as powerful. The challenge now is knowing how to put them to use.

Trump threatens 50pc Brazil tariff

Washington, 9 July (Argus) — US president Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 50pc tariff on imports from Brazil from 1 August, citing the ongoing trial of that country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's letter to Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, released on Wednesday, is one of the 22 that the US leader sent to his foreign counterparts since 7 July, announcing new tariff rates that the US will be charging on imports from those countries. But his letter to Brazil stands out for allegations of a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro, who — much like Trump — disputed his electoral defeat and attempted to stay in office. Brazil's supreme court qualified Bolsonaro's actions in 2022 as an attempted coup, ordering him to stand trial. Trump said he will impose the 50pc tariff because ""in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"". The latter is a reference to orders by judges in Brazil to suspend social media accounts for spreading ""misinformation"". Trump separately said he would direct US trade authorities to launch an investigation of Brazil's treatment of US social media platforms — an action likely to result in additional tariffs. Trump's letter to Lula also contains language similar to that included in letters sent to 21 other foreign leaders, accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and suggesting that the only way to avoid payments of tariffs is if Brazilian companies ""decide to build or manufacture product within the US"". The Trump administration since 5 April has been charging a 10pc extra ""Liberation Day"" tariff on most imports — energy commodities and critical minerals are exceptions — from Brazil and nearly every foreign trade partner. Trump on 9 April imposed even higher tariffs on key trading partners, only to delay them the same day until 9 July. On 7 July, Trump signed an executive order further delaying the implementation of higher rates until 12:01am ET (04:01 GMT) on 1 August. Brasilia did not immediately react to Trump's threat of higher tariffs. Trump earlier this week threatened to impose 10pc tariffs on any country cooperating with the Brics group, which includes Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa. Lula hosted a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July. By Haik Gugarats Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025. Argus Media group .

Australian liquid fuels policy to free up ACCUs: CEFC

Sydney, 9 July (Argus) — Annual demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) could be reduced by as much as 7.5mn t of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2050 if Australia adopted policy changes to develop a low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry, according to a report this week. Encouraging companies to reduce direct scope 1 emissions through changes to the federal safeguard mechanism and/or voluntary adoption would drive the development of an Australian LCLF market and free up ACCUs for use in sectors that cannot achieve on-site decarbonisation due to technical challenges, state-owned green investment fund Clean Energy Finance (CEFC) said in a report authored by consultancy Deloitte . Under its central case scenario, which would involve constraining the use of carbon offsets, CEFC said that a 7bn litres/yr LCLF market could be created by 2050, abating up to 12mn t CO2e in 2040 and 20mn t CO2e in 2050 as a result. Annual ACCU demand across six sectors covered by the report — mining, aviation, rail, heavy freight, maritime, and construction — could be reduced by around 6.8mn t CO2e by 2050 in that case, to 2.4mn t CO2e/yr. Demand for ACCUs could reach as low as 1.7mn t CO2e by 2050 under an accelerated scenario, which would involve EU-style mandates for LCLF. Demand for ACCUs would be around 9.2mn t CO2e/yr under the base scenario, which assumes a market-led transition in which carbon prices remain low and LCLF demand is driven by a small group of customers willing to pay significant premiums to reduce their scope 3 emissions. 30pc cap under the safeguard mechanism The central case scenario assumes a hypothetical government intervention to cap the use of ACCUs under the safeguard mechanism at 30pc of the baseline for liquid fuel-related emissions. Currently, there is no limit to the number of ACCUs or safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs) that facilities can use to manage their excess emissions under the scheme, but those that surrender carbon units equivalent to 30pc or more of their baselines need to publish a statement explaining why they have not undertaken more on-site abatement activities . The central case scenario also assumes the removal of baseline adjustments for trade-exposed baseline-adjusted facilities . Adopting a minimum 70pc direct on-site decarbonisation would trigger a positive supply-side response, driving significant technology deployment and competition between pathways and feedstocks, the CEFC said. Stakeholders claim that the current safeguard mechanism and ACCU pricing are not enough to drive early LCLF uptake, the report said. Policy intervention is needed to accelerate the bridging of the cost gap between the LCLF production cost and the ACCU price, which is currently not expected to happen until the 2040s, the report said. A market-led transition, on the other hand, would lead to greater pressure on the ACCU market, with up to 7.35mn t CO2e of ACCUs needed to meet demand in 2035 and 15.5mn t CO2e in 2050. ACCU supply reached an all-time high of 18.78mn in 2024 and is forecast at 19mn-24mn for 2025 . But the industry needs to boost future issuances to address an expected shift in the supply-demand balance within a few years .

EIA cuts 2025 US biofuel outlook, ups 2026 view

New York, 8 July (Argus) — The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year. US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook . That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production. EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth. The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import. Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years. In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation. Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report. EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption. But the agency now sees US production and consumption balanced at 49,000 b/d next year, a 1,000 b/d increase from its June expectations. The Environmental Protection Agency last month proposed substantially raising biomass-based diesel mandates in the next two years, while also potentially throttling credits for biofuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. And President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend a sprawling budget bill that extends a tax credit for biofuels through 2029 and, starting next year, ups subsidies for crop-based fuels while limiting eligibility to North American feedstocks.

French diesel, HVO customs data mislabelled: Eurostat

Barcelona, 8 July (Argus) — French firms have mislabelled imports of 10ppm diesel as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) this year, following confusion over new customs codes, EU data service Eurostat has said. The confusion has come about after the introduction of a new import-export (CN) code for HVO that took effect at the start of 2025. Some French data will be restated. A diesel code of 27101943 was discontinued at the end of 2024 and was replaced by 27101944. A new CN code 27101942 for HVO was introduced. HVO is produced by treating vegetable oil with hydrogen, counts against biodiesel blend mandates, but is molecularly separate from biodiesel output by esterification. When customs data for 2025 began to be published at the end of the first quarter, France appeared to be importing large amounts of HVO from Saudi Arabia and the US. Cargoes from the former amounted to around 255,000t in the first quarter. Saudi Arabia has no HVO production known by Argus , nor does it re-export cargoes. It is France's largest diesel supplier. There were also 140,000t labelled as HVO from the US in January-March. But because the EU has anti-dumping and countervailing duties on US HVO imports, shipments of this size appeared questionable. The US is the second biggest diesel supplier to France. The mislabelling has made French and EU HVO traffic difficult to track. It has distorted French diesel import data , which show imports have fallen sharply. Argus first questioned the numbers in March when initial 2025 customs data were released. These queries were rebuffed, but after a follow up in May Eurostat said French customs had ""confirmed that there has been an input error"". New data will be supplied by France at an unspecified time this year, it said. By Adam Porter Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

Now in its 20th edition, the 2024 Sustainability Report arrives in a challenging business environment marked by growing uncertainties in global supply chains. Against this backdrop, the report highlights key achievements in carbon reduction operations and new lower-carbon businesses under the company’s Green Transformation roadmap, aimed at driving sustainable and profitable growth.

GS Caltex is evolving into a Lower Carbon Refining & Chemical Complex by implementing structural changes in its energy practices through measures such as the expansion of self-generated power, the introduction of carbon-free steam, and the use of renewable energy. Solar power systems installed in 2024 are now operational in facilities nationwide. The company also plans to directly purchase over 100 MW of renewable energy, which is expected to reduce tens of thousands of tons of CO₂ annually and lower long-term electricity costs.

To build a New Energy Platform for the energy transition, GS Caltex is advancing lower-carbon businesses in hydrogen; carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS); bio-based solutions; and chemical/material recycling technologies. The company recently secured land at the Yulchon Convergence Logistics Complex in Yeosu to establish a hydrogen hub. It also became the first Korean refiner to export ISCC CORSIA-certified sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at commercial scale.

Aligning its new businesses with carbon reduction efforts, GS Caltex plans to issue carbon credits in the Voluntary Carbon Market. These credits will be certified by Verra’s Verified Carbon Standard Program, based on CO₂ reductions achieved through the company’s nationwide EV charging network.

A key driver of progress in lower-carbon businesses is GS Caltex’s revised investment decision-making process. The company now incorporates carbon pricing into evaluations of major investments, considering both short-term profitability and long-term climate risks.

GS Caltex is also advancing its biofuels, recycling, and lower-carbon projects after establishing a corporate-level Business Council in 2024. At the same time, its enhanced compliance due diligence and information security frameworks are helping it proactively manage a broad range of risks.

Additionally, the company is strengthening the reliability of ESG disclosures by adopting a new ESG disclosure system connected to existing platforms to improve data consistency. The system is structured in accordance with global ESG guidelines, positioning the company to efficiently meet future domestic ESG disclosure requirements.

“We are committed to sustainable management that goes beyond short-term achievements to strengthen our core competitiveness. Amid rapid change, we will steadfastly fulfill our responsibilities and strive to become a centennial company by sincerely challenging ourselves and pursuing innovation,” said GS Caltex CEO Saehong Hur.

In February, the European Union imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese biodiesel imports, ranging from 10% to 35.6%, with sustainable aviation fuel being exempt.","Chinese biodiesel pioneer Zhuoyue New Energy has unveiled plans to invest approximately CNY700 million (USD97.6 million) in a new biofuel production facility in Thailand, underscoring its commitment to international expansion and renewable energy development. The project will be located in Chonburi province and executed in two distinct phases, the company announced recently.

In the initial phase, Zhuoyue will establish a production capacity of 300,000 tons of biodiesel per year, with a projected construction timeline of 12 months. The second phase will focus on producing 100,000 tons annually of either hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), aligning with growing global demand for cleaner alternatives in aviation and road transport.

Zhuoyue has already completed all necessary regulatory formalities to move forward with the Thai project. This includes offshore investment registration with the Chinese government, securing a formal approval certificate from Thailand’s Board of Investment, and signing a land lease agreement for the site of the plant. Based in China's Fujian province, Zhuoyue has long been recognized as a trailblazer in the domestic biofuel sector. It was the first Chinese company to commercialize biodiesel production from waste oils and has maintained leadership in production, sales, and exports for several consecutive years.

The company’s robust supply chain is centered on a reliable waste oil collection network that spans both China and Southeast Asia. In 2023 alone, Zhuoyue sold 376,000 tons of biodiesel, bringing in revenues of CNY3.3 billion (USD462 million), which constituted approximately 93% of its total annual income. Notably, export sales made up a dominant share, nearing CNY3.2 billion.

Apart from the Thai venture, Zhuoyue is also constructing another biodiesel production facility in Singapore. This plant, with an expected annual capacity of 100,000 tons, is scheduled to commence operations later this year. Its primary purpose will be to meet Singapore's demand for low-carbon marine fuels, given the city-state’s status as the world's largest bunkering port.

Despite its international growth, Zhuoyue faces certain trade challenges. In February, the European Union imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese biodiesel imports, ranging from 10% to 35.6%, with sustainable aviation fuel being exempt. Zhuoyue specifically was hit with a 23.4% tariff, which will remain in effect for five years. While this presents a hurdle for exports to Europe, the company’s strategic investments in Southeast Asia and Singapore are expected to diversify its market exposure and enhance its competitiveness in the global biofuels arena.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-10 08:04:12.819680

Its board will be chaired by CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan, while its founding CEO will be Philip Goh, airline industry veteran and former regional vice-president for Apac at the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said CAAS on Thursday (Jul 10).

Han noted that Apac’s air travel demand is expected to treble over the next 20 years, “enabling tremendous economic development and supporting the aspirations of a rising middle class”.

At the same time, Apac states are committed to tackling climate change, which will support aviation’s global net-zero emission goals.

“Asia-Pacific states want both growth and sustainability, not one at the expense of the other,” he said.

APSAC thus aims to provide “a menu of policy options and instruments” for countries to achieve sustainability goals while accounting for their own circumstances.

The centre will advance sustainable aviation in three key ways.

Firstly, it will carry out policy research in areas such as cleaner fuels, carbon accounting and carbon market development, as well as green financing. Another potential area is the economics of sustainable aviation fuel supply chains.

Secondly, it will facilitate collaboration across government, industry and academia, for joint studies and projects.

Finally, it will support capacity building by governments and companies, through offering technical assistance and training.

For a start, the centre will launch a five-day foundational course on growing aviation sustainably, with topics such as challenges and opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel, and airline and airport sustainability management. It aims to hold the first run in November 2025 or early 2026.

The industry lacks courses on understanding sustainable aviation issues from an ecosystem perspective, said Goh.

“So our very first course will be targeted at that: equipping people with that kind of broad-based (knowledge), so that they can connect what affects what, and how it all works in the end.”

He expects this course to run three to four times a year from 2026.

APSAC will also plan courses to meet needs identified in regional engagements, he added, and will look at holding country-specific workshops when it has the resources.

The centre will build a team of up to 10 people in the next year or year-and-a-half. While ASPEC identifies courses to offer and develops their curriculum, it will tap its network of industry experts to provide content and facilitate.

Here, APSAC will lean on an advisory council of key partners in aviation, energy and green financing – comprising senior executives from Airbus, Boeing, Chevron, ExxonMobil, GenZero, Iata and Neste – for guidance.

To formalise this, the council partners, CAAS and APSAC will sign a memorandum of understanding on Jul 14 at the Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium.

On the same day, CAAS and APSAC will engage the directors-general of Apac civil aviation authorities of more than 20 states in a roundtable, to understand their sustainable aviation plans and how the centre can support them.

First High-Level Aviation Week

The Roundtable on Advancing Sustainable Aviation is one of seven events in the inaugural High-Level Aviation Week.

Held by CAAS from Jul 14 to 19, it will bring together governments and industry leaders to discuss the future of aviation.

“It is a response to the fundamental changes to the global operating environment and its impact on global aviation, and the need for us to come together to ... formulate strategies that are joined up across domains and across countries,” said Han.

Besides sustainable aviation, there will be events on shaping the future of aviation; facilitating advanced air mobility (air taxis and drones); ensuring aviation safety; and building a quality workforce and enabling opportunities.

Avelia’s evolution aims to better meet customer needs, accelerate SAF adoption, and provide companies with a clear, scalable pathway to credible business travel life cycle GHG emissions reductions* from aviation.

This comes at a critical time for the aviation sector. SAF is widely recognised as the most viable solution for reducing* the life cycle GHG emissions of aviation today, with the potential to reduce life cycle GHG emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel when used neat. However, according to IATA, in 2025, SAF production is expected to reach only 2.1 million tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production.

Avelia has established itself as the leading blockchain-powered book and claim solution with the aim of scaling SAF, reducing the life cycle GHG emissions of aviation and enabling greater participation in the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. Launched in 2022, Avelia helps companies to access the GHG benefits of SAF without being constrained by its physical availability at specific locations.

As of 31st March 2025, more than 57 corporations and airlines had joined Avelia and over 900 retirements had been executed. This contributed to the injection of over 33 million gallons of SAF into the existing global fuel network at 17 airport injection points around the world, resulting in over 300,000 tonnes of CO2e abated, the equivalent of over 530,000 passengers flying from London to New York.

Avelia’s evolution towards an industry-wide solution introduces functionalities that will enhance transparency, flexibility, and industry participation, including:

Independent data hosting. With the platform data now hosted and handled by Accenture, Avelia also provides a blockchain-powered transparent, secure, reliable and externally verified platform for accessing and allocating the information for the applicable SAF offering.

Multisupplier solution. Until now Avelia has only accepted SAF supplied by Shell. With this change, Avelia is in the process of evolving from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier solution, helping users access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple SAF suppliers, including Shell. Customers, including airlines, corporations, and freight forwarders, will be able to manage SAF from different suppliers within Avelia, simplifying their SAF overview.

BYOS (Bring Your Own SAF) model. Avelia is looking to introduce a BYOS model, which enables airlines to manage more of their SAF portfolio in Avelia, including SAF originally purchased outside of the Shell supply network as well as SAF that otherwise would have been tracked offline and not on a digital registry. This feature will support the use of book and claim solutions for tracking SAF, helping build credibility for book and claim at an industry level and accelerating SAF adoption.

Multilateral governance. Avelia is in the process of setting-up a multilateral governance structure to enable multi-party involvement and more transparency information around the Avelia operating procedures.

Raman Ojha, President, Shell Aviation said: “This moment marks a significant milestone not only for Avelia but for the aviation sector. Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF. We are proud to help enable broader participation and transparency in the sector’s efforts to reduce life cycle GHG emissions while supporting our customers in reaching their climate goals.""

Evan Konwiser, Chief Product and Strategy Officer, Amex GBT said: “For the majority of companies, Scope 3 emissions represent the largest share of their total carbon footprint and reducing them can be challenging. As a leading software and services company for travel, expense, and meetings & events, Amex GBT is committed to leading with our customers on decarbonisation. As a partner in Avelia, we continue to grow and evolve the world’s first and now most established book and claim platform for SAF. Together we can accelerate its scale and increase customer access to its environmental benefits.”

Dr Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel and Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture, said: “Evolving Avelia into a multi-supplier industry solution is a decisive step to scale SAF in aviation, strengthening industry collaboration and resilience while using sustainability as a growth driver. As Avelia’s strategic advisor and technology partner, Accenture continues to shape its evolution while overseeing data processing and hosting for Shell. This safeguards data compartmentalisation and transparency, giving customers clear control. It also builds the secure, scalable foundation needed for a flexible industry platform. Together, we are enabling aviation to advance towards achieving its climate commitments.”",,N,,2025-07-10 08:04:39.956552

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Oil Corp plans to shut its 300,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser unit at its Panipat refinery for an upgrade aimed at producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) next year, Arvind Kumar, its head of refineries, said on Thursday.

The overhaul of the diesel unit is scheduled for late this year or early next year, Kumar told an industry event in New Delhi.

India aims to have 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in aviation fuel by 2027, doubling to 2% in 2028.

The refinery's diesel output would not be hit due to the shutdown as the refiner has additional diesel hydrotreaters at the Panipat site.

The upgraded unit will process used cooking oil (UCO) to produce 30,000 metric tons per year of SAF, he said.

Indian Oil, the country's largest refiner, will also look at upgrading some kerosene-producing units at other refineries to make SAF, he said.

He also said that Indian Oil will soon invite bids for a 70,000 tons-per-year green hydrogen plant and a sustainable aviation fuel project.

Air transport in Latin America and the Caribbean supports 8.3 million jobs and contributes $240 billion to the region’s GDP.
“This margin leaves us highly vulnerable to external shocks—from political instability to outdated infrastructure.” Taxes That Clip Wings Aviation in Latin America has long battled a contradiction: it is essential, yet it is taxed as if it were a luxury.
“In some countries, we’re seeing aviation taxes rise while support for emissions frameworks like CORSIA erodes,” said Cerdá.","In late June, over 400 senior aviation executives, policymakers, and public officials convened in Bogotá for the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Wings of Change Americas (WOCA) conference—marking the first time the event was hosted in Colombia.

Set against the backdrop of a region grappling with economic disparities, fragmented regulation, and mounting demand for air connectivity, the two-day forum underscored the urgency of aligning policy and industry efforts to ensure aviation remains a key driver of growth and inclusion across Latin America and the Caribbean.

Latin American Aviation is at a Tipping Point

Across the region, planes are full, demand is surging, and middle-class travelers are ready to take to the skies. But years of underinvestment, erratic regulation, and tax-heavy policies are beginning to take their toll.

As Peter Cerdá, IATA’s Regional Vice President for the Americas, took the stage to deliver his opening remarks, the message was clear: aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean is not merely a mode of transportation—it’s a catalyst for economic and social transformation.

“Each flight represents a step toward opportunity,” Cerdá told delegates. “Economic opportunity, social inclusion, and regional integration. But to reach our full potential, we need to overcome the obstacles holding us back.”

Throughout the two-day summit, the exchange of ideas was shaped by a high-caliber lineup of airline CEOs who brought regional nuance and business insight to the forefront of every conversation.

Among the most prominent voices were Adrian Neuhauser (Abra Group), Frederico Pedreira (Avianca), Erika Zarante (LATAM Airlines Colombia), Pedro Heilbron (Copa Airlines), Estuardo Ortiz (JetSMART), Eduardo Lombana (Wingo), and Roberto Roselli (Plus Ultra), among others, each offering clear-eyed perspectives on growth, regulation, and sustainability. Their contributions reflected the breadth of airline models and market realities across the Americas.

Adding a strong institutional presence, Carlos Galán, the Mayor of Bogotá, emphasized the central role of Colombia’s main gateway, El Dorado International Airport, in driving local and regional progress.

A Region of Immense Potential—Grounded by Barriers

The numbers tell both a story of promise and a paradox. Air transport in Latin America and the Caribbean supports 8.3 million jobs and contributes $240 billion to the region’s GDP. Yet the average person flies less than once a year—only 0.65 trips, compared to 2.5 in North America and 4.5 in Spain.

In 2024, nearly 481 million passengers traveled across the region, a 7.8 percent increase from the previous year. Colombia’s domestic market has surged 38.8 percent over the past decade, driven in part by increased competition. In Brazil, international traffic spiked 17.7 percent in the first half of 2025 alone.

But that momentum risks stalling, according to IATA. The region’s average airline profit is just $3.40 per passenger—”less than the cost of a Juan Valdez coffee at the airport,” Cerdá quipped. “This margin leaves us highly vulnerable to external shocks—from political instability to outdated infrastructure.”

Taxes That Clip Wings

Aviation in Latin America has long battled a contradiction: it is essential, yet it is taxed as if it were a luxury.

In some Caribbean nations, taxes and fees account for up to 40 percent of the cost of a plane ticket. The latest concern comes from Brazil, where a proposed 26.5 percent VAT on airfares could slash passenger demand by as much as 30 percent.

“Airlines have worked hard to bring prices down. Since 2015, fares in Brazil have dropped over 15 percent internationally and nearly 15 percent domestically. The ball is now in the government’s court,” said Cerdá. “Punitive taxes only make flying inaccessible for the very people we need to serve.”

Under the proposed VAT, average domestic airfares in Brazil could rise from $130 to $160, while international fares may climb from $740 to $935—pricing out millions of travelers.

A Patchwork of Policies

Cerdá also warned of a “fragmented regulatory landscape.” With 33 countries and 33 sets of aviation rules, the lack of regional harmonization creates inefficiencies and hinders connectivity.

Consumer protection laws—many modeled after Europe’s EU261—are spreading across the region but are often misaligned with local operational realities. Proposed laws in Peru, Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico aim to ban ancillary fees, cap fares, or penalize overbooking, potentially driving up costs for both airlines and passengers.

“The test of any regulation should be simple,” Cerdá said. “Does it solve a real problem? And do its benefits outweigh the cost?”

Overcrowded Runways, Saturated Terminals

From Bogotá to São Paulo, gleaming new terminals are opening—but many are already operating at capacity.

Major airports in Lima, Panama City, Mexico City, Santiago, and Buenos Aires are expanding, but demand continues to outpace supply. “We need a strategic vision,” Cerdá urged. “Not just for our largest hubs, but for secondary cities that are key to regional integration.”

He highlighted an IATA-led airspace and capacity study for Bogotá’s El Dorado Airport—developed in collaboration with the airport authority, government, and airlines. “The recommendations were sound,” he said. “But only a few have been implemented. We welcome Aerocivil’s renewed commitment to act on these findings.”

Net-Zero by 2050? Not Without Support

Sustainability was a recurring theme throughout the conference. While the global aviation industry remains committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, progress has been uneven.

Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is set to double in 2025 to reach 2 million tonnes, yet this will still account for just 0.7 percent of the industry’s needs. Only a handful of countries—Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico—have taken regulatory steps to encourage SAF production.

“In some countries, we’re seeing aviation taxes rise while support for emissions frameworks like CORSIA erodes,” said Cerdá. “We can’t be penalized and expected to decarbonize at the same time.”

Voices That Shape the Future

The conference also spotlighted the human side of aviation. One of the most resonant moments came during the Women in Aviation Breakfast, where Erika Zarante, CEO of LATAM Airlines Colombia, shared her path to becoming the country’s first female airline chief.

WOCA also served as a prelude to a high-level Ministerial Roundtable co-hosted by IATA and UN Tourism, bringing together 10 regional tourism ministers and airline executives for over 50 bilateral meetings aimed at strengthening air connectivity.

Looking ahead, IATA has pledged its support for the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Punta Cana this December and announced plans to collaborate with Carlos Peguero, Vice Minister of Tourism for the Dominican Republic, to keep aviation at the forefront of the regional development agenda.

A 20-Year Horizon

Projections shared at WOCA forecast that Latin America and the Caribbean’s air traffic will grow by 5.8 percent in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate of 3.2 percent through 2044. That translates into 218 million additional passengers over the next two decades.

“This is more than just numbers,” said Cerdá. “It’s about the future of mobility, of opportunity, and of prosperity for millions.”

He closed with a simple but powerful goal: “Everyone in this region should be able to fly at least once a year. Let’s work together to make aviation a force for good.”

Sometimes the free market is sufficient to produce enough demand, whilst other times it needs to be incentivised by subsidy, regulation or both.
The free market would not pursue SAFs on their own.
They can see that the free market is not moving fast enough.
Subsidising SAFs, mandating carbon offsets and introducing regulation starts to make the maths of choosing traditional fuels over SAFs a bit more complicated for airlines.","There's SAF (biofuel) and then there's SAF (Kerosene made from carbon capture and hydrogen from Fischer-Tropf).

The former likely isn't environmentally friendly at all from a zero emissions perspective and will have too big a demand on growing space that could be used for food, and the latter is a nonstarter because by the time it's at enough scale you can just skip the carbon and pump the hydrogen straight into your hydrogen powered gas turbine.

Is it viable? Yes, it can be produced from a variety of feedstocks (bio based and non bio) and can help scale some technology like carbon capture. Is SAF itself truly scalable to zero blend? That’s up for debate. Once you add up the setup and operating costs of plants, sourcing feedstock (potentially impacting food crops) then the equation is a little more difficult. SAF is worth pursuing to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, but it doesn’t do much for tailpipe carbon emissions reductions- that is only possible with electrification which has its own drawbacks, most significantly the energy density problem.

As with any emergent technologies, it needs to reach a critical mass before it is truly viable. Different technologies have different barriers to overcome. Sometimes the free market is sufficient to produce enough demand, whilst other times it needs to be incentivised by subsidy, regulation or both.

SAF is currently in fairly early stages and there are a lot of barriers. It’s more expensive than traditional fuels. The infrastructure of producing and transporting it currently doesn’t produce nearly enough. Engines aren’t currently certified to run on 100% SAF and may require redesign and recertification to do so. But until the demand is there, stakeholders are reluctant to invest. And until the supply is sufficient (which would help it compete on price) the airlines are reluctant to commit. The free market would not pursue SAFs on their own.

So, with many governments around the world committing to various environmental strategies and targets, aviation is an obvious industry to focus on. They can see that the free market is not moving fast enough. So governments and international bodies (ICAO) are stepping in. Subsidising SAFs, mandating carbon offsets and introducing regulation starts to make the maths of choosing traditional fuels over SAFs a bit more complicated for airlines. And this is only going to get more complicated.

I think some airlines recognise these issues with SAF but also appreciate that it could well be the future. Early birds often get the worm and so by taking a hit on costs now they hope they will have an edge in the future. So it is in their interest to bang their big Green PR strategy drum in the hope it encourages investment whilst also helping to offset a bit of the increased cost now as environmental conscious travellers look to reduce their impact. Many investors now also like to see companies across all industries to show an effort in reducing their environmental impact, so I believe Green PR is predominately for share holders rather than end users.",,N,,2025-07-10 10:10:18.571089

The project will be developed in two phases, according to a company statement issued yesterday. The first phase is set to produce 300,000 tons of biodiesel annually and is expected to be completed within 12 months. The second phase will add capacity for 100,000 tons per year of either hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), both of which are key fuels in the global low-carbon transition.

Zhuoyue has already cleared key regulatory hurdles for the project. The company has secured offshore investment registration from Chinese authorities, received approval from Thailand’s Board of Investment, and finalized a land lease agreement for the construction site.

Headquartered in Fujian province, Zhuoyue is widely recognized as China’s pioneer in industrial biodiesel production from waste oils. It has consistently held the top position in the country in terms of biodiesel output, sales, and exports, and maintains a stable supply network for waste oils across China and Southeast Asia.

In 2023, Zhuoyue sold 376,000 tons of biodiesel, generating revenue of CNY3.3 billion (USD462 million), with exports accounting for nearly CNY3.2 billion of that total — roughly 93 percent of its annual earnings.

The company is also nearing completion of a separate 100,000-ton biodiesel plant in Singapore, which is set to begin operations later this year. The Singapore facility will primarily serve the city-state’s bunkering market, the largest in the world, with a focus on low-carbon marine fuels.

However, Zhuoyue faces challenges in international markets. In February, the European Union imposed anti-dumping tariffs ranging from 10 to 35.6 percent on Chinese biodiesel imports. Zhuoyue was hit with a 23.4 percent tariff, which will remain in place for five years. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was excluded from the duties.

As Arsonneau puts it, “It’s not just about reducing emissions—it’s about building the infrastructure for the airport of the future.” In the future, it’s not just aircraft that need to fly clean.","Airports offer one of the most practical and immediate opportunities to cut carbon emissions in the aviation ecosystem. And while aircraft decarbonisation still faces technical and fuel-related hurdles, ground infrastructure presents a clearer and more electrified path forward.

Why airports are the real green frontier

Aircraft may be the visible symbol of aviation, but they are only part of the emissions equation. Airports are energy-intensive environments, operating 24/7 and relying on a vast array of power-hungry systems, including HVAC, runway lighting, baggage handling, ground support vehicles, and more. Electrifying these systems is both feasible and impactful.

Arsonneau puts it plainly, “Planes still use kerosene, and while more and more are shifting to biofuels, we’re not working on that. Where we can really help is on the ground by starting with electrifying vehicles, increasing building efficiency, and optimising energy management systems.”

Schneider Electric has developed what Arsonneau calls a “full playbook” to help airports move through the levels of the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme, from basic energy tracking to full carbon neutrality.

The first step, he explains, is visibility. “You need to track the energy you’re consuming, such as runway lights, airport buildings, baggage handling. You need to know where the problems are.”

From there, the roadmap continues with the electrification of ground support vehicles and airport transport fleets, replacing fossil-fuel-powered systems with electric alternatives. This shift is essential for reducing emissions across day-to-day airport operations.

Another priority is implementing advanced HVAC and building management systems, which can significantly reduce energy waste through smart automation and real-time performance monitoring.

Schneider Electric also emphasises the need to engage suppliers to tackle Scope 3 emissions, helping airports influence the broader value chain by aligning partners with sustainability goals.

Airports are further supported through consulting services that guide the procurement of green energy at competitive prices, helping operators make informed decisions that align with regulatory and ESG targets.

Finally, the roadmap includes the installation of local power generation systems, primarily solar, complemented by battery storage to support reliability and off-grid resilience.

Critically, these measures aren’t just about ticking sustainability boxes, but they come with real operational and financial benefits, offering both environmental impact and a compelling return on investment.

Proof of concept: JFK’s microgrid

Schneider Electric’s most tangible example to date is its project at New York’s JFK Terminal 1, where it installed a 12 MW microgrid combining solar, battery storage, and backup systems.

“This 12-megawatt microgrid has reduced carbon emissions by 38%,” says Arsonneau. “The return on investment is below ten years. It’s not only sustainable, it’s economical.”

Microgrids provide a safety net in environments where downtime is not an option. “You absolutely need to have power 100% of the time. A power interruption in an airport is not good at all,” he adds.

Building for sustainability

While new airport projects like the upcoming mega-hub in Dubai have the luxury of integrating sustainability from the outset, Arsonneau is quick to stress that retrofitting existing airports is just as important.

“It’s easier to start green when you’re building from scratch,” he says. “But even in existing airports, we can put digital systems in place to visualise and improve energy use. You can digitise old equipment, track consumption, and optimise operations.”

This is where Schneider Electric’s use of digital twin technology becomes critical. “A twin helps you plan the evolution of your electrical system. If I add solar, how will it perform? What’s the cost? You can simulate all this,” he says. “And it helps with safety. You don’t need to rely on outdated paper maps of electrical networks. The twin stays up to date.”

In both greenfield and brownfield scenarios, the digital twin serves as the foundation for long-term, sustainable planning and risk mitigation.

Solar power advantage

Solar presents an obvious solution in the Middle East, where sunlight is abundant and energy demand is high. “Solar is the cheapest way to produce electricity today,” Arsonneau says. “Every airport should go solar, be it on the roof, on the sides, wherever space allows.”

But solar alone isn’t enough. “The constraint is that at night, you don’t have the sun. So you need battery storage. And that’s usually not enough for the whole airport. So you need a grid connection as well.”

To make these mixed power sources work seamlessly, Schneider Electric builds microgrid systems that manage the switch between solar, battery, and grid power. “It’s about making sure there’s no drop in energy and no interruption,” he says.

This layered approach is particularly relevant in light of recent grid failures in Europe. “Barcelona and Madrid had to run generators back in April,” Arsonneau notes. “It’s a reminder that having your own on-site energy gives you resilience.”

A strategic segment for the future

The airport and aviation segment is no side project for Schneider Electric as it is now a dedicated growth vertical.

“This sector is growing at 10% yearly,” Arsonneau says. “That’s why we created this new segment, with airports as a key focus. The public wants aviation to be greener, and airports are where they can start delivering on that.”

He acknowledges the criticism the industry often receives, even though it accounts for only 2–3% of global emissions. “In sustainability, not everything is fair,” he says. “But airports are visible, and people want them to change. That’s where the opportunity is.”

One of the complexities of operating across the Middle East is adapting to the region’s diverse regulations and energy norms. “There are differences in voltage, frequency, and even data sovereignty between the UAE and Saudi Arabia,” Arsonneau explains.

But this is where Schneider Electric’s decentralised model helps. “We’re very local. We understand the norms and adapt accordingly. The idea is to push global sustainability standards but always customise to local conditions.”

Towards net zero

If the aviation industry is serious about decarbonisation, airports are the low-hanging fruit. From electrifying fleets to managing energy through microgrids, the technologies exist, and the ROI is real.

As Arsonneau puts it, “It’s not just about reducing emissions—it’s about building the infrastructure for the airport of the future.”

Why in news?

Recently, IATA (International Air Transport Association) highlighted that India has a major opportunity to become a global hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel – SAF is a renewable, low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from sources like agricultural waste, non-food crops, used cooking oil, algae, and municipal solid waste.

Aircraft fuel – It is chemically similar to fossil jet fuel, making it compatible with existing aircraft engines and refuelling infrastructure.

It can be used by blending biofuel with conventional jet fuel.

Lifecycle emissions – For SAF it is upto 80% lower than conventional fuel, depending on the feedstock and production method, making it central to achieving net-zero targets in aviation.

Decarbonisation – According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF alone is projected to contribute over 60% of the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the global trade association of airlines is established in 1945, headquartered at

Montreal, Canada, and it represents around 300 airlines worldwide, accounting for over 80% of global air traffic.

Other measures such as operational efficiency, hydrogen, electric aircraft, and carbon offsetting also play a role, but SAF is considered the most impactful and immediately deployable solution.

Global SAF ecosystem – There are over 300 renewable fuel projects announced globally, but only 160 have clear SAF production plans.

India’s current SAF ecosystem – India has been exploring SAF for over a decade.

Several Indian energy companies are developing SAF production capabilities and government has signalled intent to introduce blending targets, but a formal roadmap is awaited.

What are the opportunities for India to Become a Global SAF Hub?

Abundant feedstock availability – India generates large quantities of biomass, agricultural waste, and ethanol, which can be channelled towards SAF production without compromising food security.

Existing refining infrastructure – India’s oil refineries can be upgraded to produce SAF, reducing capital investment requirements compared to greenfield plants.

“Make in India for the world” potential – India can meet domestic SAF demand and export surplus to international airlines operating in the region, creating an economic and strategic opportunity.

Estimated production potential – By 2050, India could produce up to 40 million tonnes of SAF, significantly contributing to global supply chains.

What are the key challenges that India must address?

Lack of clear policy framework – A comprehensive SAF policy with time-bound blending targets, production incentives, and certification guidelines is urgently needed.

Feedstock prioritisation and sustainability – SAF feedstock selection must avoid competition with food crops and meet strict environmental sustainability standards.

Global certification compliance – SAF produced in India must adhere to international sustainability and emission reduction certification requirements to be globally accepted.

Investment in research and development – India must invest in SAF R&D to diversify production technologies, including pathways like Alcohol-to-Jet, Power-to-Liquid, and others.

Global competition – With the US and Europe rapidly building SAF ecosystems, India must act swiftly to capture market share.

What are the suggested measures?

Time-bound blending targets – The government should finalise ambitious yet achievable SAF blending mandates aligned with global standards like CORSIA.

Financial and production incentives – Production-linked incentives, tax breaks, feedstock subsidies, and concessional financing should be provided to encourage SAF production.

Sustainable feedstock aggregation – A robust supply chain for sustainable feedstock aggregation must be established through farmer incentives and technology support.

Technology neutrality and competition – All SAF production pathways should be encouraged, with market forces determining the most efficient technologies.

Public-private collaboration – Strong partnerships between government, private companies, and research institutions are essential to accelerate SAF ecosystem development.

In contrast to this, much of the cooking oil used in households is simply thrown away.
It is now important to build a framework to lift the contribution of cooking oil from residential homes.","The aviation industry’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are progressing with advances in fuel transitions. Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum, and its increased use pushes up the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. When thinking about ""decarbonizing the skies,"" the key to success is using recycled aviation fuel made from used cooking oil and urban trash, also known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Energy companies have an essential role to play in creating supply chains for SAF.

Used Frying Oil to Power Jet Engines Flying With Japan's First Mass Produced SAF

Airplanes will take to the skies fueled by oil already used to make tempura. Compared to petroleum-based fuel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel emits far fewer greenhouse gases because it is made from used materials such as cooking oil, wood chips, used plastic, and used paper. The reason for this low impact is that plants are the original raw materials processed to create SAF, and flora absorb CO2 as part of photosynthesis to live and grow.

Yokohama-based Saffaire Sky Energy LLC commenced mass production of SAF for the first time in Japan in FY2025. The company was established by Cosmo Oil Co. Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd, along with the other founding partners JGC Holdings Corporation and Revo International Inc. The new firm will produce 30,000 kiloliters of SAF annually from 100% used cooking oil to be manufactured at Cosmo Oil's Sakai Refinery in Sakai-city, Osaka. The company will supply this sustainable fuel to Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways and DHL Express, a major German international logistics company.

As people and goods increasingly move around the world, demand for air transport services will grow. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that the worldwide passenger number for air travel will exceed 5 billion people for the first time in 2025. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has a goal of making the nation a tourist-oriented nation and boosting the number of visitors to Japan from overseas to 60 million by 2030.

Aircraft CO2 emissions are far higher than trains. At one time, people in Europe traveling by air who were aware of climate change criticized themselves feeling a sense of “flight shame,” a judgement that was also cast onto air travel more generally. This growing sense of crisis is the reason SAF was first introduced for distribution across Europe. Global demand for SAF is now also expected to grow rapidly. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aims to reduce aviation industry greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relying on SAF to achieve this 2030 target. On the domestic front, Japan’s government has set the goal of replacing 10% of aviation fuel consumption across the nation with SAF by 2030.

In addition to tackling the conditions creating global warming, Japan is also confronting the serious issue of energy security. Saffaire Sky Energy producing SAF from used cooking oil procured domestically in Japan is a boon. This company's production of ""domestically produced fuel"" is highly significant exactly because Japan relies almost entirely on fossil fuel imports from overseas.

The key to the Saffaire’s SAF production is the stable supply of raw materials. In Japan, there is a system already in place whereby the majority of used cooking oil is collected from businesses. The firm procures used cooking oil to produce SAF from restaurant chains such as Marugame Seimen, a noodle shop chain operated by Marugame Udon, Inc. and Sushiro, a major Kaiten Sushi chain operated by Akindo Sushiro Co. Ltd.

In contrast to this, much of the cooking oil used in households is simply thrown away. It is now important to build a framework to lift the contribution of cooking oil from residential homes. To achieve this, the firm has partnered with large shopping outlets such as AEON Mall to place collection containers for used cooking oil at five commercial facilities across Osaka Prefecture near the Sakai Refinery.

Recycling has become a common practice for aluminum cans and plastic (PET) bottles with much investment into systems to collect, process and turn the discarded items into resources again. Can Japan develop the same customs of offering used oil for processing instead of putting it in the trash? This is now a question for every individual consumer.",https://project.nikkeibp.co.jp/ESG/atcl/eng/sdgf/88/og.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 08:05:05.408607

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural & biological engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem. Their findings, published in Science Advances (""Upgrading biocrude oil into sustainable aviation fuel using zeolite-supported iron-molybdenum carbide nanocatalysts""), present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts. Illustration of the experimental setup. (Image: Reprinted from DOI:10.1126/sciadv.adu5777, CC BY) “There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.” Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour. Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone. After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers used HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab. “Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said. For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels. “We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper. Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.",https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news3/id67182.jpg,N,,2025-07-10 01:02:39.072895

The Eagle County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday signed a letter of interest with SynTec Holdings of Morris, Illinois. That non-binding agreement is the first step toward SynTec building a plant on 13 acres of property at the landfill and using up to 90 tons per day of municipal solid waste to convert into aviation fuel.

According to the letter, which is a non-binding agreement, the county will authorize a 10-year lease with a 10-year renewal option with SynTec, which will build and operate a facility to convert solid waste into aviation fuel. That fuel would then be transported to Signature Aviation’s private aviation facility at the Eagle County Regional Airport, formerly the Vail Valley Jet Center. That fuel will then be mixed with standard aviation fuel and used in the private jets that use the facility. Signature Aviation has had a sustainable fuel program since 2022, but that fuel is trucked in from outside Eagle County.

According to the document, SynTec will be responsible for obtaining all necessary county land use approvals and will also be responsible for all project financing.

The letter states that the county will benefit from extending the life of the landfill. Syntec’s plant will use only “clean” household waste. No hazardous or construction waste will be allowed.

Asked by Commissioner Jeanne McQueeney to define “sustainable aviation fuel,” SynTec CEO Wayne McFarland said that his firm’s process “puts less or no new carbon into the environment.” Another gallon of fossil fuel drilled, refined and put into a vehicle puts more carbon into the environment, McFarland said. Sustainable fuel uses material that has already put carbon into the environment, extracts energy from it, and uses it as fuel.

McFarland said the project will ultimately be an “amazing” one for Eagle County.

“There are no downsides to this,” he said, noting that the amount of waste used will allow the county to be almost “landfill-free.” And, he added, with people flying out of the Eagle County Regional Airport on sustainable fuel, “Everybody’s going to want to be you.”

Commissioner Matt Scherr noted that the document approved Tuesday is just a letter of intent. But, he added, the SynTec proposal is “an exciting idea.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/7/2022/08/28053204/75e0756b-9374-54f6-ae55-9ac2e1cbc797-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 21:08:26.800635

Trump threatens 50pc Brazil tariff

Washington, 9 July (Argus) — US president Donald Trump is threatening to impose a 50pc tariff on imports from Brazil from 1 August, citing the ongoing trial of that country's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's letter to Brazil's president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, released on Wednesday, is one of the 22 that the US leader sent to his foreign counterparts since 7 July, announcing new tariff rates that the US will be charging on imports from those countries. But his letter to Brazil stands out for allegations of a ""witch hunt"" against Bolsonaro, who — much like Trump — disputed his electoral defeat and attempted to stay in office. Brazil's supreme court qualified Bolsonaro's actions in 2022 as an attempted coup, ordering him to stand trial. Trump said he will impose the 50pc tariff because ""in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections and the Fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans"". The latter is a reference to orders by judges in Brazil to suspend social media accounts for spreading ""misinformation"". Trump separately said he would direct US trade authorities to launch an investigation of Brazil's treatment of US social media platforms — an action likely to result in additional tariffs. Trump's letter to Lula also contains language similar to that included in letters sent to 21 other foreign leaders, accusing Brazil of unfair trade practices and suggesting that the only way to avoid payments of tariffs is if Brazilian companies ""decide to build or manufacture product within the US"". The Trump administration since 5 April has been charging a 10pc extra ""Liberation Day"" tariff on most imports — energy commodities and critical minerals are exceptions — from Brazil and nearly every foreign trade partner. Trump on 9 April imposed even higher tariffs on key trading partners, only to delay them the same day until 9 July. On 7 July, Trump signed an executive order further delaying the implementation of higher rates until 12:01am ET (04:01 GMT) on 1 August. Brasilia did not immediately react to Trump's threat of higher tariffs. Trump earlier this week threatened to impose 10pc tariffs on any country cooperating with the Brics group, which includes Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa. Lula hosted a Brics summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 July. By Haik Gugarats Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025. Argus Media group .

Australian liquid fuels policy to free up ACCUs: CEFC

Sydney, 9 July (Argus) — Annual demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) could be reduced by as much as 7.5mn t of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2050 if Australia adopted policy changes to develop a low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry, according to a report this week. Encouraging companies to reduce direct scope 1 emissions through changes to the federal safeguard mechanism and/or voluntary adoption would drive the development of an Australian LCLF market and free up ACCUs for use in sectors that cannot achieve on-site decarbonisation due to technical challenges, state-owned green investment fund Clean Energy Finance (CEFC) said in a report authored by consultancy Deloitte . Under its central case scenario, which would involve constraining the use of carbon offsets, CEFC said that a 7bn litres/yr LCLF market could be created by 2050, abating up to 12mn t CO2e in 2040 and 20mn t CO2e in 2050 as a result. Annual ACCU demand across six sectors covered by the report — mining, aviation, rail, heavy freight, maritime, and construction — could be reduced by around 6.8mn t CO2e by 2050 in that case, to 2.4mn t CO2e/yr. Demand for ACCUs could reach as low as 1.7mn t CO2e by 2050 under an accelerated scenario, which would involve EU-style mandates for LCLF. Demand for ACCUs would be around 9.2mn t CO2e/yr under the base scenario, which assumes a market-led transition in which carbon prices remain low and LCLF demand is driven by a small group of customers willing to pay significant premiums to reduce their scope 3 emissions. 30pc cap under the safeguard mechanism The central case scenario assumes a hypothetical government intervention to cap the use of ACCUs under the safeguard mechanism at 30pc of the baseline for liquid fuel-related emissions. Currently, there is no limit to the number of ACCUs or safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs) that facilities can use to manage their excess emissions under the scheme, but those that surrender carbon units equivalent to 30pc or more of their baselines need to publish a statement explaining why they have not undertaken more on-site abatement activities . The central case scenario also assumes the removal of baseline adjustments for trade-exposed baseline-adjusted facilities . Adopting a minimum 70pc direct on-site decarbonisation would trigger a positive supply-side response, driving significant technology deployment and competition between pathways and feedstocks, the CEFC said. Stakeholders claim that the current safeguard mechanism and ACCU pricing are not enough to drive early LCLF uptake, the report said. Policy intervention is needed to accelerate the bridging of the cost gap between the LCLF production cost and the ACCU price, which is currently not expected to happen until the 2040s, the report said. A market-led transition, on the other hand, would lead to greater pressure on the ACCU market, with up to 7.35mn t CO2e of ACCUs needed to meet demand in 2035 and 15.5mn t CO2e in 2050. ACCU supply reached an all-time high of 18.78mn in 2024 and is forecast at 19mn-24mn for 2025 . But the industry needs to boost future issuances to address an expected shift in the supply-demand balance within a few years .

EIA cuts 2025 US biofuel outlook, ups 2026 view

New York, 8 July (Argus) — The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year. US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook . That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production. EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth. The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import. Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years. In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation. Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report. EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption. But the agency now sees US production and consumption balanced at 49,000 b/d next year, a 1,000 b/d increase from its June expectations. The Environmental Protection Agency last month proposed substantially raising biomass-based diesel mandates in the next two years, while also potentially throttling credits for biofuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. And President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend a sprawling budget bill that extends a tax credit for biofuels through 2029 and, starting next year, ups subsidies for crop-based fuels while limiting eligibility to North American feedstocks.

French diesel, HVO customs data mislabelled: Eurostat

Barcelona, 8 July (Argus) — French firms have mislabelled imports of 10ppm diesel as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) this year, following confusion over new customs codes, EU data service Eurostat has said. The confusion has come about after the introduction of a new import-export (CN) code for HVO that took effect at the start of 2025. Some French data will be restated. A diesel code of 27101943 was discontinued at the end of 2024 and was replaced by 27101944. A new CN code 27101942 for HVO was introduced. HVO is produced by treating vegetable oil with hydrogen, counts against biodiesel blend mandates, but is molecularly separate from biodiesel output by esterification. When customs data for 2025 began to be published at the end of the first quarter, France appeared to be importing large amounts of HVO from Saudi Arabia and the US. Cargoes from the former amounted to around 255,000t in the first quarter. Saudi Arabia has no HVO production known by Argus , nor does it re-export cargoes. It is France's largest diesel supplier. There were also 140,000t labelled as HVO from the US in January-March. But because the EU has anti-dumping and countervailing duties on US HVO imports, shipments of this size appeared questionable. The US is the second biggest diesel supplier to France. The mislabelling has made French and EU HVO traffic difficult to track. It has distorted French diesel import data , which show imports have fallen sharply. Argus first questioned the numbers in March when initial 2025 customs data were released. These queries were rebuffed, but after a follow up in May Eurostat said French customs had ""confirmed that there has been an input error"". New data will be supplied by France at an unspecified time this year, it said. By Adam Porter Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

A circular economy for these materials could keep them circulating at their highest value, closing the supply-demand gap while insulating companies against supply shocks and price volatility.
To achieve a thriving circular economy, we need policies that support innovation and innovation that supports infrastructure.
The advocacy supports the business action and the business action strengthens the advocacy while both accelerate results.","Circularity isn’t just about environmental responsibility; it’s a competitive business strategy.

Individual business action is important but true transformation happens at the market level.

The most effective leaders are combining internal circular initiatives with external collective advocacy.

We don’t have time for incremental change. In addition to its devastating planetary impacts, the linear “take, make, waste” system does not offer the long-term stability and resilience our economy needs to deliver prosperity.

The business case for change has never been stronger: economic headwinds, supply chain disruptions, consumer distrust and geopolitical conflict are reshaping the landscape. In times of disruption, entrenched systems are questioned, opening the door for innovation and new market leadership.

Leaders have two choices: act with urgency to accelerate change or adapt to markets that will change around them.

Risk-savvy industries are sounding the alarm

Business leaders increasingly agree that finding ways to succeed commercially while respecting planetary boundaries is a key business imperative. Just ask anyone in the insurance industry – the supreme arbiters of risk.

Insurance leaders have been consistently warning that the effects of climate change will make insurance premiums unviable, potentially undermining the entire financial system and putting capital at risk. In the food industry, manufacturers are seeing that unless they act to help nature thrive, their supply chains will literally dry up.

“

The most visionary business leaders are looking beyond their own operations to transform the conditions in which they compete.

”

Innovative leadership can shape the future of markets but it requires a shift in mindset.

The circular economy is not a nice-to-have sustainability play; it’s a competitive strategy to generate long-term value, reduce risk to capital and build resilience, balancing commercial interests with the needs of the planet.

Through design, we can eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials at their highest value and regenerate nature, creating an economy that benefits people, businesses and the natural world.

It’s firmly on leaders’ agendas. Today, 75% of businesses recognize circularity as important, up from 40% just three years ago. Capital investment in circular initiatives has grown by over 70% in the same period. The shift is real and it’s happening now.

Scale over individual action unlocks potential

Here’s what we’ve learned: individual business transformation gets you started but market transformation gets you results. The more businesses prioritise reuse initiatives, the easier it becomes for the entire market.

The most visionary business leaders are looking beyond their own operations to transform the conditions in which they compete. Because while markets continue to externalize environmental costs and undervalue crucial transition investments, even the most committed businesses hit systemic barriers.

This requires more than just agreeing on a vision – it’s a new type of leadership. Businesses need to collaborate and cooperate in new ways to break down shared barriers.

Individual business action towards a shared vision is crucial to identifying systemic barriers and can accelerate solution development. However, it’s time to take the next step, to take everything we’ve learned about roadblocks to change and build shared pathways through them.

Commercial collaboration changes the game

Commercial collaboration paired with collective advocacy can unlock circular solutions at scale. When businesses align on systemic barriers, we can present a unified voice to policymakers, who need clear evidence of positive business intent to create supportive policies.

Policy alone will not move fast enough, though – businesses can go further. By working together, companies can invest in solutions, launch joint ventures, share infrastructure or co-develop products and services that create new circular value.

“

The circular economy is a strategic business imperative.

”

Take critical minerals. Tech and energy firms, as well as governments, are seeking to safeguard access to critical minerals such as copper, nickel, and lithium, in the face of an expected fivefold rise in demand by 2040.

A circular economy for these materials could keep them circulating at their highest value, closing the supply-demand gap while insulating companies against supply shocks and price volatility. The environmental wins are substantial but the business case drives action.

Collaboration the catalyst for circular scale

Commercial collaboration can accelerate innovation, create new markets, build key infrastructure and drive customer adoption much more efficiently and effectively than businesses focusing only on transforming themselves. And they can still compete robustly in the marketplace.

With the right governance, safeguards and ambition, commercial collaboration can expedite system change well within the bounds of competition laws.

We have to redesign the “rules” and how businesses operate within them. To achieve a thriving circular economy, we need policies that support innovation and innovation that supports infrastructure.

The plastics industry is working towards this right now. Over 280 companies, including market leaders such as PepsiCo and Unilever, have joined the Business Coalition for a Plastics Treaty to speak with an aligned voice in advocating for global regulatory changes for every business using plastic.

In parallel, these businesses continue to work towards reducing their own use of virgin plastic. The advocacy supports the business action and the business action strengthens the advocacy while both accelerate results.

As part of their ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship and innovation in aviation, Integrity Flight Support is proud to announce its partnership with 4AIR, offering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through a flexible and accessible program known as Book & Claim.

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel. Rather than being derived from petroleum, SAF is made from sustainable feedstocks, including used cooking oils, tallow, and municipal waste, with the potential to include algae or power-to-liquid fuels in the future.

SAF is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works seamlessly with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. When blended with conventional Jet-A fuel, SAF meets all safety and performance standards (ASTM D1655 or DEFSTAN 91-91), and significantly reduces lifecycle carbon emissions — up to 90% with neat SAF, and typically 20–25% when blended.

Despite its benefits, SAF remains scarce at most airports due to logistical and supply challenges — that’s where Book & Claim comes in.

✈️ What is Book & Claim — and How Does It Work?

Book & Claim is a long-standing chain of custody model that enables flight operators to purchase the environmental benefits of SAF, even when physical SAF isn’t available at their airport.

Here’s how it works:

Producers deliver SAF into a local pipeline or airport fuel system near where it’s made, minimizing transportation emissions and costs.

The fuel is sold as regular Jet-A (without its sustainability attributes) to a third party.

You, the operator, purchase the environmental attributes of that SAF, known as a “green premium.”

You get to claim the emissions reductions as part of your carbon footprint reduction strategy, while contributing to increased demand and future scalability of SAF.

This approach is similar to how Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) work in the electricity market. The actual molecules of SAF don’t reach your aircraft, but your purchase helps displace fossil fuel use globally, encourages more SAF production, and allows you to meet sustainability targets — all without changing where or how you fuel.

✅ Why Book & Claim Makes Sense

Immediate Emission Reductions: Supports decarbonization goals without needing physical SAF delivery.

Market Expansion: Helps SAF producers reach broader markets, boosting industry viability.

Cost Efficiency: Reduces distribution costs and makes SAF more affordable over time.

Verifiable Transactions: All transactions are third-party verified through platforms like 4AIR’s Assure SAF Registry, ensuring emissions reductions are never double-counted

Aircraft departing from Warsaw Chopin Airport, Kraków, and Katowice can now refuel with this innovative fuel, which promises a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from both its production and combustion.

The strategic launch underscores ORLEN's commitment to its 2035 strategy, which prioritizes the expansion of its product portfolio while addressing the urgent need for decarbonization across both supply and demand chains

SAF is distinguished by its production from renewable or waste-derived feedstocks, adhering to strict sustainability criteria that prevent deforestation or the depletion of vital food and water resources. These feedstocks can include a diverse range of materials such as used cooking oils, as well as municipal, industrial, agricultural, and forestry waste. Crucially, the renewable component of SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel, making it fully compatible with existing aircraft engine technologies. This seamless integration allows for immediate adoption by airlines, facilitating an instant reduction in emissions from flight operations. SAF can reduce emissions by up to 80% throughout its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and production method.

The introduction of SAF has been met with enthusiasm from key stakeholders in the Polish aviation sector.

Beyond its environmental benefits, ORLEN's introduction of SAF is also a proactive measure to comply with the European Union's ambitious ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. This regulation mandates that sustainable aviation fuels must constitute at least 2% of total jet fuel sales by 2025, with further increments planned to reach 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and a significant 70% by 2050. The regulation applies to EU airports that handled over 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tonnes of cargo in the preceding year.

To meet the increasing demand and regulatory obligations, ORLEN is actively developing a hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) facility at its Plock refinery. This facility will enable the domestic production of aviation fuel from used cooking oils, reducing reliance on imported SAF components. The HVO project, with an estimated value of over PLN 1.4 billion, is slated for completion in 2025. Until the facility becomes operational, ORLEN will continue to source SAF components from abroad.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:12.109814

The Royal Air Force display team, the Red Arrows, will make aviation history at the forthcoming Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), as the display will be powered entirely by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The performances will be the first time a national aerobatic team has not only flown on SAF, but also used a biofuel in the production of the iconic vapour trails.

Usually created by injecting a mixture of diesel and dye into the hot exhaust of the Hawk, for RIAT the Red Arrows will use a hydrotreated vegetable oil, a renewable biofuel, to paint the skies.

The RAF pushes forward with sustainable aviation fuel

While civilian aviation led much of the early work on sustainable aviation fuel, air forces around the world are now taking steps to modernise fleets and reduce carbon footprints. It’s not just about saving the planet, but also delivers fuel resiliency in a time of geopolitical instability.

The Royal Air Force (RAF) has been particularly proactive on sustainability. In 2022, it flew a Voyager, the military version of the A330, on 100% SAF in a world-first for the type.

Then, in 2023, in conjunction with the Sustainable Skies World Summit, a Voyager powered by 43% SAF successfully completed an air-to-air refuelling flight from Brize Norton.

In 2023, the RAF conducted mid-air refuelling of both the Typhoon and the C-130 Hercules, and the Typhoon first flew a display on 100% SAF at RIAT in 2024.

The Typhoon is set to display using 100% SAF again this year. Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said:

“In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Red-Arrows-vapour-trails-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:16.660071

During the RIAT airshow, the Red Arrows will use both SAF and a renewable biofuel called Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) to create their signature vapour trails. This will mark the first-ever aerobatic performances by the Red Arrows at the airshow using both SAF and HVO.

Three Air Displays Powered By SAF

The RAF is exploring alternative fuels to power both current and future aircraft, aiming to reduce dependence on global fossil fuel supply chains and enhance energy security, ultimately strengthening operational resilience. According to a statement by the RIAT, the Red Arrows will perform three times on the SAF, as well as feature in various special formation flypasts across the weekend event.

Also flying on SAF will be the RAF’s Typhoon display team, which made history by performing its first full routine using sustainable fuel at last year’s show. More than 170,000 people are expected at RAF Fairford for the aviation showcase, which is due to take place on Friday 18th, Saturday 19th, and Sunday 20th.

The flights are being made possible through the support of Air Space Intelligence, Intel Foundry, and Team Lewis, with HVO supplied by Power Electrics and SAF provided by AFS Aviation. Commenting on the news, Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said:

“Their nine-ship team are known across the world, so we are delighted to be hosting this landmark display here at RAF Fairford. In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”

The RAF Started Testing SAF In 2021

The RAF has been steadily advancing its testing of sustainable aviation fuel on military aircraft. In November 2021, it successfully flew a microlight powered by synthetic fuel derived from air and water. A major milestone followed in 2022, when an RAF Voyager (Airbus A330 MRTT) became the first large military aircraft to complete a 90-minute flight powered entirely by 100% SAF.

Less than a year later, the RAF expanded its SAF trials to include air-to-air refueling missions. It conducted its first such operation using a SAF blend of 46 to 48%, refueling both a Eurofighter Typhoon and a C-130J Hercules. During 2023, the RAF’s Voyager was used in a routine training mission with a 43% SAF blend for air-to-air refueling of Typhoon fighter jets.

SAF is made from a variety of renewable and waste-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, animal fats, agricultural and forestry residues, and even municipal waste. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute up to 65% of reductions by 2050.

Net-Zero Emissions By 2050: A Pipe Dream?

ambitious and far from easy. While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a promising part of the solution, it is not a silver bullet. SAF faces significant hurdles, including high production costs, limited scalability, and concerns about its true environmental impact.

In the UK, for instance, SAF is primarily produced from used cooking oil, some of which is imported from Asia. This long-distance shipping contributes to carbon emissions, with maritime transport accounting for about 2% of global CO2 output. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, expressed skepticism: “It's very hard to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel. There are aviation fuels that are less polluting than those currently used, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.”",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/red-20250505-255-ve_day_80_flypast-295_1-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 15:12:19.755090

""This RFS proposal is the most exciting since the RFS was expanded in 2007,"" Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw told the EPA.
Finalizing the proposed renewable fuels blending levels will provide the right boost at the right time for our farmers.
And 24 billion gallons must mean 24 billion gallons for total RFS volumes.
Cooper also said the RFA ""strongly supports"" EPA's proposed 50% reduction in RINs generated for import-based renewable fuels and fully agrees that there are ""reduced economic, energy security, and environmental benefits"" provided by imported renewable fuels.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Biofuels groups testifying in a public hearing on Tuesday on the Renewable Fuel Standard volumes proposal could hardly contain their excitement about what they say is one of the strongest-ever RFS proposals for 2026-2027 volumes.

All the while, the groups expressed concern about how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will address a backlog of more than 180 small-refinery exemptions still pending from previous years.

Biofuels interests told the agency they supported the commitment to account for prospective SREs in the final rule and to reallocate gallons exempted.

""This RFS proposal is the most exciting since the RFS was expanded in 2007,"" Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw told the EPA.

""I cannot overstate the optimism it has caused in rural America at a time when farm income has plummeted and talk of tariffs triggers uncertainty. Finalizing the proposed renewable fuels blending levels will provide the right boost at the right time for our farmers. It will enhance American energy dominance, lower prices for consumers and improve the environment. IRFA urges the EPA to maintain the robust RFS levels in the final rule.""

When it comes to RFS volumes and the effect SREs can have, Shaw said ""at the end of the day, 15 billion gallons needs to mean 15 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuels like ethanol. And 24 billion gallons must mean 24 billion gallons for total RFS volumes. SREs should be few and far between.""

Shaw said the agency could reallocate gallons lost to any exemptions.

""The optimism around the RFS is real today and it would be a mistake to pull the rug out from under one of the only bright spots in the current ag economy,"" he said.

Shaw also called on the EPA to unleash E15 access by eliminating regulations.

""EPA needs to reboot the effort begun during President Trump's first term to remove outdated regulations limiting E15 sales,"" Shaw said.

""E15 should be allowed in all fueling infrastructure from the storage tank through the nozzle. Requiring retailers to spend thousands of dollars to replace perfectly compatible equipment serves only to slow down the growth of consumer access to E15.""

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said during the hearing that ""strong"" renewable volume obligations will play a key role in delivering on President Trump's vision for U.S. ""energy dominance and rural prosperity.""

""If finalized, these RVOs would unlock investments, create jobs and support growth in rural America by expanding our country's renewable fuel production and use,"" she said.

""By setting conventional biofuel blending volumes at 15 billion gallons for two years, this proposal will create the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. This is the strongest RFS proposal we've ever seen, with the highest volumes ever, showing this administration's commitment to American biofuel producers and the farmers that depend on them.""

Skor joined other biofuels interests in urging the EPA to make it clear that small-refinery exemptions will not be ""granted recklessly"" and that any gallons lost will be accounted for in the market.

""Only with these pieces in place can this proposal truly deliver the game-changing impact the president wants it to have and that the nation's biofuel producers and rural communities are counting on,"" Skor said.

Clean Fuels Alliance America CEO Donnell Rehagen said the proposed bump in biomass-based diesel volumes have already had a positive effect on the markets.

""Our industry has made substantial investments over the past several years in both biofuel production, feedstock supply, and distribution infrastructure,"" he said during the virtual hearing.

""Domestic production of biodiesel and renewable diesel has doubled since 2020 and continues to grow. We supplied more than 5 billion gallons of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) to the U.S. market in 2024 and we are poised to deliver more in 2026. We are pleased that since the proposed rule came out the markets have reacted in a positive fashion. However, uncertainty around small-refinery exemptions still hangs over the industry. We ask that you sustain the volumes as proposed to ensure that our capacity is fully utilized.""

Brian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol, said while his group supports EPA's proposal, he encouraged the agency to consider using its statutory authority to exceed the 15-billion-gallon conventional biofuel threshold.

Jennings said that would help offset the potential impact of lost export markets and ensure U.S. ethanol producers are not displaced by surplus renewable identification numbers, or RINs, from other categories.

Jennings highlighted ACE's ongoing efforts to establish the link between low-carbon farming practices and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production tax credit recently extended by Congress.

Jennings emphasized the importance of rewarding farmers for implementing practices that reduce the carbon intensity of ethanol.

""In partnership with USDA, DOE, 13 ethanol companies and hundreds of farmers, ACE is currently leading a project to unlock new markets and tax credits, such as 45Z, based on low-carbon farming,"" Jennings said.

Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said the proposal was ""an important step toward achieving President Trump's vision for lower gas prices, a stronger agriculture industry, and American energy dominance.""

While the RFA applauded EPA's decision to prospectively reallocate any renewable fuel volumes lost to small-refinery exemptions in the final rule, Cooper cautioned that the EPA must be ""extremely judicious"" in determining whether any refiners have truly suffered, or will suffer, ""disproportionate economic hardship"" related to compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, adding that ""it is critically important that EPA accurately estimate exempted volumes in the final rule to ensure that the volume requirements that are actually implemented in 2026 and 2027 match those that are published in the rule.""

Cooper also said the RFA ""strongly supports"" EPA's proposed 50% reduction in RINs generated for import-based renewable fuels and fully agrees that there are ""reduced economic, energy security, and environmental benefits"" provided by imported renewable fuels.

He said the enhanced recordkeeping and reporting procedures in the proposal, however, are not needed for corn-based ethanol given that the U.S. does not import corn ethanol and corn imports make up just one 10th of 1% of the U.S. corn supply.

It will serve as a central marketplace for energy and raw materials, starting with the launch of its first mechanism – the hydrogen mechanism.

Garrett Monaghan, renewable energy expert at Pinsent Masons, said: “The mechanism will enhance security of supply while also enabling the decarbonisation of sectors such as industry and transport where reducing carbon emissions is both difficult and urgently needed.”

The hydrogen initiative, launched on 2 July, will match suppliers of hydrogen and its derivatives, such as ammonia, methanol and electro-sustainable aviation fuel, to offtakers, building on the success of the AggregateEU platform that achieved similar goals within the gas market. The platform will also perform a number of other services, such as displaying information about available financing solutions as well as collecting and using market data to assess supply and demand. The hub will also use market insights to support the development of infrastructure for hydrogen transport and storage, providing a platform for assessing potential interest in infrastructure projects.

By aggregating and matching supply and demand, it is hoped that the hydrogen mechanism will help firms identify infrastructure needs, access financial solutions, and build long term partnerships. The first round of matching supply and demand is planned for September, and the mechanism is authorised to operate under the European Hydrogen Bank until 31 December 2029.

The hydrogen mechanism is just the first step, with the Commission set to roll out additional tools in the coming months. This includes a raw materials mechanism - to help industries secure access to essential minerals and metals – and the gas mechanism – to support the transition from natural gas to renewable gases like biomethane. These mechanisms will be integrated into the same online hub.

Stakeholders can now register on the platform and subscribe to the hydrogen mechanism, with the Commission encouraging companies of all sizes – from energy producers to industrial consumers – to participate.

The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.
In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.
The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.","The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year.

US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production.

EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth.

The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import.

Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years.

In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.

Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.

EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.

This move aims to diversify Mexico's energy mix and reduce its reliance on fossil fuel production.

The updated statute outlines PEMEX's participation in the exploration of hydrogen fields and geoenergy projects. The NOC will also explore electricity generation projects based on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Additionally, PEMEX plans to engage in the generation of biofuels, including biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

One initiative to promote clean energy use includes establishing a photovoltaic generation network for self-consumption. This involves installing solar panels on the rooftops of PEMEX franchised service stations, aiming for energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

In geoenergy, PEMEX anticipates geothermal projects and electricity generation at existing assets, such as disused offshore platforms. Mexico possesses high meteorological and oceanic potential from tides, currents, waves, and wind, which can be leveraged with these out-of-operation platforms. The company also plans specific projects to reduce gas flaring.

Furthermore, PEMEX is collaborating with the Federal Electricity Commission on three cogeneration power plants. These, located at the Tula and Salina Cruz refineries and the Cangrejera Petrochemical Complex, are projected to generate an estimated 2,422MW. Their purpose is to use residual heat from industrial plants to produce electricity efficiently. Operations for these plants are expected to begin in 2029 and 2030.

Financing Innovation: The Role of Credit Adopting technology and sustainability practices requires financing structures aligned with the realities of Brazil’s farmers.
These blended approaches—linking financial incentives, digital monitoring, and carbon markets—can accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices while lowering the risk profile of loans by enhancing farm resilience and diversification.
Regenerative agriculture practices, including no-till farming, cover cropping, integrated crop-livestock systems, and bioinputs, are central to building climate resilience while supporting soil health and carbon sequestration.
SAF and Brazil’s Potential as a Sustainable Fuel Hub A particularly insightful discussion during the summit centered on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), underscoring Brazil’s potential to become a global SAF leader.","By Victoria Moura, Agritecture | Post–World Agri-Tech South America 2025 Recap

At the World Agri-Tech South America Summit in São Paulo, one message resonated above all: Brazil’s agriculture is evolving into a new agri-culture—one defined not merely by yields and exports but by how technology, sustainability, and collaboration converge to future-proof food systems in a climate-challenged world. Brazil already feeds 10% of the global population while using land with remarkable efficiency, having increased its agricultural production by nearly 600% over the past 40 years while expanding its planted area by only around 100% (Embrapa, 2023). However, to maintain its competitiveness while meeting growing international demands for traceability, quality, and environmental stewardship, systemic transformation is essential, and technology will be at the heart of this transition.

Building the Right Tech for Real Farmer Needs

Brazilian agrifoodtech funding surged in early 2025, with US $76.8 million raised in Q1 alone—a 32% increase from the previous quarter and an 85% year-over-year rise—positioning Brazil to capture 55% of all Latin American agtech funding in 2024, despite representing just 1.5% of global agtech investment (AgFunderNews, The Brazilian Report). Additionally, consultancy Liga Ventures reported that Brazilian agtech startups received over BRL 1 billion (~US $177 million) in 2024, the second-highest year on record.

This momentum reflects growing confidence in agtech’s potential to drive transformation in Brazil’s agriculture. Yet, as emphasized during summit discussions with Embrapa, Danone, and ABAG leaders, a critical disconnect remains: many startups focus on developing sophisticated, capital-intensive technologies designed to attract investors, while often overlooking the urgent, practical needs of farmers on the ground. This gap is particularly relevant in Brazil, where over 80% of the country’s more than 5 million agricultural establishments are smallholder farms (IBGE Agricultural Census, 2023).

Smallholder farmers require affordable, low-complexity technologies that can address critical challenges such as irrigation, pest management, and soil health while enabling adaptation to climate variability and water stress. For example, a 2020 Embrapa survey found that only ~3% of irrigating producers had properties over 1,000 hectares, while 64% irrigated less than 5 hectares, underscoring that irrigation in Brazil is predominantly practiced by small- to mid-scale farmers (Embrapa). Research by the World Bank (2024) highlights that prioritizing irrigation and basic mechanization in smallholder systems can increase yields by up to 50% while reducing labor demands and post-harvest losses by 30%.

Silvia Dávila of Danone highlighted this need for targeted, appropriate technologies, citing Danone's Flora Project as an example, which increased smallholder milk farmers’ incomes by 17% while reducing methane emissions by 40%. “Supporting farmers with the right tools transforms communities while advancing climate goals,” Dávila emphasized, underlining that impactful technology must be designed with, not just for, farmers.

A key discussion point arising from these insights is the need for startups and investors to collaborate with cooperatives, extension services, and local governments to design solutions that consider Brazil’s geographic and socioeconomic diversity while building viable business models for rural communities.

Integrating Technology Across the Supply Chain

Brazil’s agricultural supply chain is vast, complex, and costly, with logistics—including road and port expenses—accounting for 30–40% of the total cost of soybeans, according to a USP/Esalq study, with overall transport costs estimated to be 8–9 times higher than in the United States, significantly reducing competitiveness (Datamar News). Road transport, predominantly reliant on diesel trucks, forms the backbone of Brazil’s export logistics, leaving the sector heavily exposed to fuel price volatility and infrastructure bottlenecks.

Meanwhile, Brazil imports about 85% of its fertilizer needs, making input costs highly vulnerable to global price swings, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical disruptions (University of Navarra). During the World Agri-Tech South America Summit, Embrapa’s leadership emphasized that fostering local bioinput industries and expanding domestic fertilizer production are critical strategies to reduce Brazil’s vulnerability while promoting sustainability and climate resilience within the sector.

Otavio Lopes of EY argued for a paradigm shift: moving from a linear, reactive supply chain toward an interconnected, predictive ecosystem. “We need to transition from cost-focused to resilience-focused systems,” he noted, emphasizing the necessity for digital integration, real-time data visibility, and blockchain-enabled traceability across the supply chain to meet the evolving expectations of global markets and consumers demanding deforestation-free, ethically sourced products.

A critical insight is that technology integration must align with infrastructure development and policy frameworks, enabling supply chains to evolve into systems that are efficient, climate-resilient, and inclusive of smallholders, who collectively produce a significant share of Brazil’s coffee, fruits, vegetables, and dairy exports.

“Digitization in agriculture is not just about software adoption; it is about a cultural change within organizations. As an export leader, Brazil’s continued strength globally will depend on tech integration, digitalization, and innovation. With climate pressures, rising consumer expectations for quality, and tightening sustainability regulations globally, efficiency and traceability are not luxuries—they are prerequisites for remaining competitive.” (Victoria Moura, South America Representative at Agritecture).

Financing Innovation: The Role of Credit

Adopting technology and sustainability practices requires financing structures aligned with the realities of Brazil’s farmers. In its 2025/26 agricultural plan, the Brazilian government allocated a record R$78.2 billion to PRONAF, a 3% increase from the previous cycle. However, while credit lines for essential food production remain relatively low—around 2% for organic and 3% for staple crops—other lines, including some family-farming commodity and investment loans, now carry rates ranging from 5–6.5%, and even up to 8% in certain categories (Exame, 2025). These higher rates, introduced amid broader economic tightening, risk limiting access for low-income farmers who depend on affordable credit to modernize, invest in sustainable practices, and adopt new technologies.

Brazil’s rural credit system remains heavily dependent on public policy, but private financial institutions are increasingly stepping in to complement these efforts. As Bradesco’s Head of Agribusiness, Nadege Saad, emphasized during the summit, “credit is a tool, but without guidance and data, it becomes a burden rather than a solution.” This reflects a key point raised during the event: credit accessibility must be paired with technical assistance and digital tools to ensure effective capital allocation, improve productivity, and reduce default risks.

IFC specialists in 2024 further underscored that integrating climate-smart criteria and fintech innovations into rural credit structures can create a virtuous cycle of sustainability and financial resilience. This includes redesigning credit lines to incentivize eco-friendly practices—such as offering preferential rates or rebates for farmers adopting drought-resistant crops or efficient irrigation systems—and leveraging digital farm management and risk assessment platforms, enabling lenders to track crop conditions and climate risks in real time for improved credit decisions (World Bank Blogs).

Additionally, IFC and its partners are exploring carbon credit integration within rural credit programs, allowing farmers who adopt regenerative practices to generate tradable carbon credits that can supplement loan repayments or farm income, making sustainable investments more financially attractive (World Bank Blogs, Agreena). These blended approaches—linking financial incentives, digital monitoring, and carbon markets—can accelerate the adoption of sustainable practices while lowering the risk profile of loans by enhancing farm resilience and diversification.

This signals an opportunity for agritech startups and financial institutions in Brazil to collaborate on embedded fintech solutions, offering credit products tied to technology adoption for irrigation, bioinputs, precision tools, and renewable energy systems.

Automation and the Workforce: A Brazilian Perspective

Although Brazil has historically benefited from affordable and abundant rural labor, the reality is shifting. The rural population declined from 15.3% in 2012 to 12.7% in 2022 (IBGE, 2023), driven by rural-to-urban migration and aging demographics, with over 33% of farmers now above the age of 55 (MAPA, 2024). The lack of generational renewal is evident, with young people discouraged by legal restrictions on youth labor, limited infrastructure in rural areas, and a desire for urban employment opportunities. According to IPEA (2024), this trend risks a 12% reduction in Brazil’s agricultural workforce over the next decade if interventions are not made.

Furthermore, the high cost of formal employment due to CLT labor laws and taxes means hiring a worker can cost employers 100-150% more than the nominal wage (CNA, 2023). This structural burden pressures producers, making automation an increasingly attractive option.

Automation in agriculture is not about replacing labor—it’s about enhancing it. According to McKinsey (2024), automation can increase productivity by 25% while reducing operational costs by 15-20%, allowing workers to shift to higher-value roles such as farm oversight, data analysis, and precision operations management.

“Automation allows us to manage complexity, reduce human error, and optimize decision-making in a way that manual processes simply can’t match,” said Marcelo Batistella of BASF during the summit, emphasizing that automation is not a threat but a tool to improve efficiency, quality, and competitiveness.

An additional dimension is that precision agriculture and site-specific management practices, enabled by automation, are crucial for scaling regenerative agriculture across Brazil’s large farming areas while maintaining environmental stewardship, as variable-rate irrigation and nutrient management can reduce input use by 20-30% while improving yields (CGEE, 2024).

Regenerative Practices, Bioinputs, and Climate Goals

Latin America holds 31% of the world's freshwater resources and 40% of the world’s biodiversity (along the Caribbean). Comprising almost half of South America's territory (47.3%), Brazil is positioned at the frontline of climate action within agriculture. Regenerative agriculture practices, including no-till farming, cover cropping, integrated crop-livestock systems, and bioinputs, are central to building climate resilience while supporting soil health and carbon sequestration.

Brazil’s National Bioeconomy Strategy aims to reduce dependence on imported synthetic fertilizers and promote the use of bioinputs, with Embrapa reporting that biological nitrogen fixation in soybeans alone saves Brazilian farmers approximately US$15 billion annually while reducing greenhouse gas emissions (Embrapa, 2024). “Bioinputs are not just environmentally sound; they’re economically smart, reducing reliance on imports and building resilience,” emphasized Alessandro Cruvinel of the Ministry of Agriculture.

Adopting regenerative practices also aligns with market trends, as global buyers increasingly demand deforestation-free, low-carbon supply chains. In fact, studies have found that sustainability certifications often translate into sizable price uplifts – e.g. coffee farmers under Fairtrade or organic standards have earned 20–30% higher prices than conventional growers (MDPI, 2024).

Key discussion points include the need for scalable models that align regenerative practices with credit incentives and digital monitoring tools to measure soil health and carbon sequestration for carbon credit programs.

SAF and Brazil’s Potential as a Sustainable Fuel Hub

A particularly insightful discussion during the summit centered on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), underscoring Brazil’s potential to become a global SAF leader. Brazil’s experience with ethanol and biofuel leadership positions it well to align energy, food, and climate strategies efficiently.

Brazil has officially moved to raise the mandatory ethanol blend in gasoline from 27% to 30% (E27 to E30) as of August 2025 (Reuters, 2025). Approved by the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE), this policy is framed as a step toward cleaner energy and reduced fossil-fuel dependence. According to the Brazilian government, increasing the ethanol content “eliminates [fuel] imports, reduces emissions, [and] strengthens national biofuel production” (gov.br). Practically, the E30 mandate is expected to drive over R$10 billion in new investments and create more than 50,000 jobs as biofuel supply expands (gov.br), underscoring Brazil’s commitment to sustainable energy transitions while also supporting domestic agriculture and benefiting sugarcane and corn ethanol producers (Reuters, 2025).

In the aviation sector, global demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to soar to 449–500 billion liters annually by 2050, aligning with the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) net-zero carbon goals and representing about 65% of total aviation fuel needs by mid-century (AirInsight, LH Consulting). This surge in demand offers a significant export opportunity for biofuel-producing nations like Brazil. Analysts note Brazil’s SAF production potential could exceed its domestic jet-fuel consumption, positioning it as a major SAF exporter if scalability challenges are addressed (Sustainable Aviation Futures). One study found Brazil could produce around 9 billion liters of SAF from residual feedstocks alone—enough to meet the country’s annual jet fuel demand of 7.8 billion liters while generating a surplus for export (Revista Pesquisa FAPESP). Leveraging its abundant sugarcane, corn, and other biomass resources, Brazil has a competitive advantage in SAF production.

However, realizing this potential will require investment in new biorefineries, supportive policies, and technological scale-up to bring down costs. Panelists in the Sustainable Fuels: Scaling Biofuels and Tapping into Carbon Markets for Sustainable Growth session at the summit emphasized the need for blended finance models, clear policy frameworks, and stable demand signals to build investor confidence in SAF infrastructure, alongside supply chain integration to secure consistent biomass supply without disrupting food production. This points to a broader insight: the future of sustainable fuels must intersect with food systems planning to ensure synergies rather than trade-offs.

A Well-Rounded Event Fostering Connection and Collaboration

The World Agri-Tech South America Summit was a comprehensive gathering of stakeholders shaping the future of agriculture. The event brought together C-suite leaders, cooperative heads, startup CEOs, policymakers, and research institutions such as Embrapa and the Ministry of Agriculture, creating a platform for collaboration across the sector’s most pressing challenges and opportunities.

Panel discussions explored critical topics from financing and bioinputs to regenerative practices, SAF production, and precision agriculture. The event also offered startup pitches, interactive roundtables, and targeted networking opportunities, including a Women in AgriTech brunch, facilitating deeper collaboration among participants. Networking moments—whether during pre-booked 1:1 sessions, over high-quality Brazilian meals, or at the lively closing party with live music—were invaluable for turning ideas into action and building enduring partnerships.

The June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to develop an electro-synthetic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) facility in Jesup, Georgia, marks a pivotal shift for RYAM—from a traditional cellulose producer to a leader in carbon-negative infrastructure. While the partnership's immediate focus is on decarbonization and renewable fuel production, its long-term potential as an overlooked “AI-infrastructure play” lies in its ability to leverage emerging technologies to optimize energy systems. Here's why investors should take notice.

The Strategic Pivot: From Cellulose to Carbon Capture

RYAM's collaboration with Verso Energy targets three interconnected projects at its Jesup, Georgia, site:

1. Biogenic CO₂ Capture and Storage (CCS): RYAM's existing manufacturing processes produce biogenic CO₂, a byproduct of its cellulose production. The CCS project aims to capture this CO₂, which is carbon-neutral due to its origin from biomass, and store it permanently.

2. Renewable Hydrogen Production: A green hydrogen unit will use renewable energy (likely solar or wind) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. This hydrogen will serve as a critical feedstock for the e-SAF production process.

3. e-Fuel Synthesis: The final facility will convert captured CO₂ and green hydrogen into e-SAF via Power-to-Liquid technology. This fuel, with lifecycle emissions 90% lower than conventional jet fuel, could meet growing demand from airlines and governments under EU ReFuelEU and U.S. tax incentive frameworks.

The project's genius lies in its use of RYAM's existing infrastructure—a $1.6 billion asset base—as a launchpad for these new ventures. By repurposing its Jesup site, RYAM avoids costly greenfield construction and taps into a steady supply of biogenic CO₂, turning waste into revenue.

The AI-Infrastructure Angle: A Subtle but Strategic Edge

While the MoU does not explicitly mention artificial intelligence, the broader trend in energy infrastructure increasingly relies on smart systems to optimize efficiency, predict maintenance needs, and manage complex supply chains. For instance:

- Process Optimization: AI-driven algorithms could refine the electrolysis process for hydrogen production or fine-tune CO₂ capture efficiency.

- Grid Management: As renewable energy sources power the plant, AI could balance energy demand and storage to minimize grid strain.

- Carbon Accounting: Blockchain and AI could enable real-time tracking of carbon credits, a critical feature for compliance with global emissions targets.

RYAM's pivot to infrastructure—where scalability and operational precision are paramount—positions it to integrate such tools as the market matures. This could give it an edge over competitors still reliant on static, legacy systems.

Market Catalysts and Risks

RYAM's stock has lagged behind broader markets, trading at a valuation that ignores its clean energy potential. Key catalysts include:

- Feasibility Study Results (2025–2026): A positive outcome could trigger a final investment decision (FID) by early 2027, unlocking a potential 50–100% upside as CO₂ monetization begins.

- Regulatory Tailwinds: The EU's ReFuelEU mandate, which requires 2% SAF blending by 2028, and U.S. tax incentives for SAF producers create a $15–20 billion market opportunity by 2030.

Risks remain, however:

- Capital Costs: The project's estimated €1–2 billion price tag requires securing financing amid a volatile credit market.

- Technology Scaling: While Power-to-Liquid is proven in labs, industrial-scale deployment faces hurdles like hydrogen storage and grid integration.

Investment Thesis: A Hidden Gem in the Energy Transition

RYAM's undervalued stock and strategic foresight make it a compelling play on clean energy infrastructure. Investors should:

1. Buy on dips below $15/share: Current valuation does not reflect the CO₂ monetization opportunity or the scalability of Jesup's model.

2. Watch for FID announcements: A green light by early 2027 could catalyze a re-rating.

3. Consider ESG-focused ETFs: Pair RYAM with broader energy transition plays like NIO or Plug Power (PLUG) for diversification.

Conclusion: RYAM's Quiet Revolution

Rayonier Advanced Materials is not just a cellulose supplier—it's a pioneer in repurposing legacy infrastructure for the green economy. While AI may not yet be part of its toolkit, its strategic bet on carbon-negative energy systems aligns with the broader trend toward smart, data-driven infrastructure. Investors who recognize this shift early could benefit as RYAM transitions from a overlooked mid-cap stock to a cornerstone of the $1 trillion sustainable fuels market.

Sees new opportunities in Malaysia for growth in life sciences and healthcare as well as new energy

DHL is well-positioned to support Malaysia’s trade and logistics ambitions with expanded investments and capabilities

KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA – Media OutReach Newswire – 9 July 2025 – DHL, the world’s leading logistics provider, has reaffirmed its commitment to Malaysia through Strategy 2030, a five-year roadmap aimed at accelerating sustainable growth with an expanded focus on high-value sectors. The country is a vital link in DHL’s network, poised to capitalize on opportunities as a leading hub for trade and an emerging destination for supply chain diversification.

Malaysia has long been strategically important for DHL and hosts four of DHL Group’s globally operating divisions, which together command a portfolio of solutions encompassing domestic delivery, e-commerce shipping and fulfilment, road, air, and sea freight, international express, and industrial supply chain management. These are underpinned by an IT data centre and regional shared services that drive backend functions for DHL’s cross-border presence.

Since the company established its roots here in 1968, it has grown in tandem with a vibrant economy that is now the fifth-largest in Southeast Asia. Across the four divisions, DHL employs a workforce of over 4,500. Continued investments in infrastructure and capabilities reflect confidence in Malaysia as an attractive destination for facilitating global trade and logistics.

Recognizing Malaysia’s competitive advantages and business potential, DHL plans to further enhance its product offerings and operational capabilities in the local market, focusing on several key drivers.

Geographic Tailwinds

Emerging geographical and economic developments continue to have profound effects on companies’ supply chain diversification strategy, omnishoring as well as domestic and foreign direct investment. To help businesses capitalize on these developments, DHL will build on its strong global footprint and local expertise. DHL has identified Malaysia as one of the 20 high-growth markets that could stand to benefit the most from these changes. This is solidified by Malaysia’s record of a historic high of RM378.5 billion in approved investments in 2024. FDI accounted for 45 percent of the figure, led by the United States, Germany, China, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

In fact, DHL has long contributed to such foreign inflows through its partnership with the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA). In May, both parties signed a renewed memorandum of understanding, building on joint efforts since 2023 that have yielded significant investment outcomes in key priority sectors across eight states: Kedah, Penang, Perak, Johor, Melaka, Sabah, Sarawak, and Selangor.

In recent years, DHL has consistently invested ahead of the curve to support the growing needs of businesses expanding their operations in Malaysia. These investments include:

A new Kuala Lumpur Gateway in 2024, the largest local DHL Express investment to date at EUR60 million (MYR300 million)

EUR131 million (MYR655 million) investment by DHL Supply Chain allocated until 2028 towards expanding warehousing capacity, staff, and sustainability activities. These include the new Penang Logistics Hub 5 and South Region Hub opened earlier this year, with one more planned for Penang and another in the Central region

Julian Neo, Managing Director of DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei, said: “Trade has remained resilient across the region, boosted by shifting attention to these parts of the world for manufacturing and sourcing operations. Thanks to our forward-looking approach, we are in a strong position to respond with the timely and strategic improvements we made. With a presence that spans more than 220 countries and territories, we retain a crucial role in connecting businesses seamlessly to international value chains.”

Life sciences and healthcare (LSHC)

The biopharma, cell and gene, and clinical trials market is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) exceeding 10 percent until 2030. DHL is well-positioned to address these shifts, with its track record of over 30 years in specialized pharma logistics. In 2025, the company acquired specialty courier CRYOPDP and announced an investment of EUR 500 million (approximately MYR 2.4 billion) to enhance its LSH capacity in the Asia Pacific region. Currently, DHL has 300,000 square metres of fully compliant warehousing space in 15 countries across the region.

Christopher Lim, Managing Director of DHL Global Forwarding Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei said: “Today, 10 of the world’s top medical device companies have established operations here, elevating Malaysia into the league of global medical device hubs. These MNCs are driving innovation, diversifying the nation’s export portfolio and shifting the focus beyond glove production to high-value advanced devices manufacturing. We are ready to support Malaysia’s ambitions to grow this sector, backed by our team of trained life sciences specialists, a globally validated IT platform, and stringent operational protocols, we ensure the integrity and compliance of every shipment.”

In Malaysia, these cover end-to-end solutions including cold chain management for DHL Supply Chain’s customers, the latest being a global medical device manufacturer. DHL Global Forwarding also has a cold room at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the only one of its kind on the premises, compliant with Good Distribution Practice and World Health Organization standards. DHL Express extends its Medical Express service (otherwise known as WMX) locally, achieving speed and reliability for research, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Leveraging their expertise in parcel delivery and returns, DHL eCommerce is a partner to a local healthtech company, Esyms, where DHL enables safe and timely delivery of medications from hospitals and clinics to patients’ doorsteps.

New energy and auto-mobility

New Energy is a key growth sector under DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, where the Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage system, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen.

In Malaysia, dedicated logistics solutions are increasing in demand with the transformation of the renewable energy and auto-mobility sectors, bolstered by positive momentum in the country’s EV agenda. This can be attributed to favourable government initiatives, including the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021–2030, the National Automotive Policy 2020, and the National Energy Transition Roadmap. DHL is a leader in the local automotive industry from freight solutions to being an MNC pioneer in the 3PL (third-party logistics) space, offering a comprehensive range of services from spare parts fulfillment to setup and management of regional distribution centers.

Mario Lorenz, Managing Director for DHL Supply Chain Malaysia, said: “Last year, Malaysia’s vehicle market hit a record high of more than 800,000 units sold[1], so it is still a high-growth segment for us. However, we are not just focusing on internal combustion engines; we have developed solutions for the industry of the future – electric vehicles. Our expertise in managing the movement of spare parts, service logistics, and handling regional distribution is transferable to EVs. Malaysia is also in the pipeline for a DHL EV Centre of Excellence, joining a network of similar facilities in 10 countries that cover capital equipment for new EV-related factories, inbound-to-manufacturing (I2M), finished vehicles, and aftermarket logistics.”

E-commerce

B2C and B2B digital sales continue to be a steady contributor to profitability for DHL. Malaysia’s e-commerce market maintains a bullish outlook with a projected CAGR of 11.25 percent until 2029[2]. The company has long been an ecosystem partner for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, with an eye on increasing their share of national exports.

To this end, DHL developed the GoTrade program to equip entrepreneurs with practical knowledge and resources to navigate the complexities of shipping abroad and accessing overseas consumers. Since its inception in 2020, the initiative has trained over 9,100 SMEs across the United States, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia Pacific. Locally, DHL has partnered the Malaysia External Trade Development Corp (MATRADE), reaching more than 2,000 participants through 18 workshops from 2023 to 2024.

Saurabh Kumar, Managing Director of DHL eCommerce Malaysia, said, “As online shopping continues to shape the way we live and work, we are perfectly equipped to help homegrown B2B and B2C brands thrive in the digital marketplace through innovation and best-in-class delivery services. We currently work with a diverse range of customers from global names to local brands across industries. This breadth of experience reflects our ability to meet the evolving needs of the domestic e-commerce ecosystem.”

Leading the way in sustainable logistics

In recognizing the heightened importance that logistics plays in global trade, equal attention must be given to its adverse effects on the climate. The industry as a whole generates an estimated 3.4 billion[3] tons of CO2e annually, with DHL contributing one percent of the total. The company became the first logistics business to pledge to a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050, and is pursuing measurable goals to decarbonize its operations towards 2030 interim milestones. With Strategy 2030, DHL added a fourth bottom line, “Green Logistics of Choice”, to the existing “Employer of Choice,” “Provider of Choice”, and “Investment of Choice”.

In Malaysia, the pursuit of more sustainable logistics operations took shape in 2022 with the introduction of six electric vans as DHL Express became the first company in the country to implement EVs for logistics use. The number has since risen to 74 electric vans and nine electric scooters. This puts the local division squarely on track to achieve the groupwide target of electrifying two-thirds of the pickup and delivery fleet by 2030.

DHL Express and DHL Global Forwarding also support customers in reducing their Scope 3 emissions via GoGreen Plus service, utilizing sustainable aviation fuel and sustainable marine fuel. To date, more than 90,000 customers in Asia Pacific have used the service for their time-definite international shipments, while 180,000 tons of TtW-CO2e on Full Container Load and Less than Container Load shipping have been mitigated.

India can potentially manufacture 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, which positions it as a key player in shaping a greener, more resilient aviation future. Let’s understand SAF and its key environmental benefits.

SAF for reducing airline emissions

Aircraft emit water vapour, soot, sulfur aerosols, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which contribute to the formation of contrails – clouds that form when water vapour condenses and freezes around small particles (aerosols) in aircraft exhaust. All of these factors have additional warming effects on the atmosphere.

Moreover, aviation’s share in global emissions is expected to increase due to two key reasons. Currently, less than 10 per cent of the global population relies on air travel. But this number is projected to more than double in the coming decades. Second, unlike aviation, other high-emission sectors such as electricity, cement, and steel production are gradually moving to greener alternatives.

In this context, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), also known as aviation biofuel, has emerged as a credible alternative with the potential to reduce aviation-related emissions. SAF is made from sustainable sources and has characteristics similar to Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), but with a significantly lesser carbon footprint. It is a ‘drop in’ fuel, meaning it can be blended with ATF without requiring any change in the existing machinery of aircraft.

SAF can be derived from a range of materials, including

— Oils and fats such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO), oil-rich seeds from plants, algae oils, animal fats

— Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)

— Agricultural and forestry residues such as wood waste, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, husks and straw, sugars and starches.

There are various methods to produce SAF, with each using different combinations of raw materials. For SAF to be truly sustainable, it is important that the feedstock used in its production does not compete with food production, cause deforestation, or harm biodiversity.

Toward net-negative emissions

SAF offers multiple benefits. The primary advantage is its ability to significantly reduce emissions and its compatibility with the current global aircraft fleet. It means SAF can be used without modifications to existing planes, engines, or fueling infrastructure. It is estimated that SAF has the potential to reduce GHG emissions in air travel by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

In addition to SAF, there are other innovations like Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origins (RFNBOs). It is produced using renewable electricity through Power to Liquid PtL technology that combines Green Hydrogen with Carbon captured from atmospheric CO₂. It offers the potential for even net negative emissions. SAF combustion produces far less harmful gases and particulate matter, contributing to cleaner skies.

The adoption of these biofuels can lead to new demand for feedstock and open new revenue streams in agriculture and waste management. In addition, diversification of fuel sources in the aviation sector can help reduce import dependence and protect the sector from global oil price volatility. This, in turn, could lead to a more stable aviation sector, possibly making air travel accessible to larger sections of society. Moreover, SAF adoption will also generate employment opportunities in the sustainability sector.

However, despite these benefits, there are a few barriers to the widespread adoption of SAF. First, the cost of producing these biofuels, which is more than double that of conventional fuels, makes its large-scale adoption difficult for airlines without passing the burden onto consumers.

The production, storage, blending, and transportation of SAF require the development of new infrastructure, which would add significantly to the initial cost of adoption. Another key issue is the availability and sustainability of feedstock required for SAF production. The characteristics and variety of necessary feedstock mean that there is no guarantee of year-round supply.

Further, there is a significant risk that the production process can have adverse environmental impacts if not managed properly. For SAF to be considered truly sustainable and to ensure a significant reduction in GHG emissions, it is crucial to ensure that its production does not have negative social or environmental impacts.

How SAF reshapes global and Indian aviation

Notably, there is now a global push to increase the blending of SAF in commercial aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) – the UN’s specialised agency for the development of air transport – has established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). It mandates that international airlines must offset their emissions growth post-2020, and the use of SAF is incentivised as a compliance mechanism.

Similarly, the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative has introduced binding SAF blending targets, aiming for 2 per cent SAF by 2025, 6 per cent by 2030, and 70 per cent by 2050, with sub-mandates for synthetic fuels. Another innovative mechanism is the World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, which has set the blending target of 10 per cent SAF by 2030. It also seeks to address the high cost of SAF through innovative financing and supportive policy frameworks.

However, India has a nuanced and pragmatic approach to SAF, advocating for nationally determined targets rather than binding international mandates. India’s position is based on the twin goals of prioritising energy security and food security, and seeking to balance sustainability goals with passenger demand. Despite these reservations, India is a party to the CORSIA and is positioning itself to be a key player in the global SAF landscape. Notably, the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) was launched by India during the G20 Summit in New Delhi in 2023 with the aim to expedite the worldwide adoption of biofuels, including SAF.

India has also set SAF blending targets of 1 per cent for domestic airlines by 2025 and 1-2 per cent for international flights by 2027-2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 and the potential to scale up to 15 per cent by 2040. The abundant supply of agricultural residues bolsters India’s goal of becoming SAF exporter. However, challenges like high costs and underdeveloped supply chains need to be taken care of.

To address such issues, policies like tax incentives and public-private partnerships have been proposed. SAF presents a near-term, drop-in solution to reduce emissions from the aviation sector while longer term decarbonisation technologies continue to evolve. Despite existing challenges, the international consensus to push for SAF through initiatives like the CORSIA and ReFuelEU offers hope for overcoming barriers to large-scale adoption. For India, SAF provides an opportunity to leverage its resources to be a market leader in the sector and make meaningful contributions to global decarbonisation efforts, while also keeping local realities and national priorities in mind.

The usually diesel-fueled smoke pod will also switch to a biofuel based on vegetable oil.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been trialed by the Royal Air Force since 2020, when the Ministry of Defence’s aviation fuel standards were updated to permit its use in defence aircraft. Blends of conventional fuel and SAF have since been used to fill Typhoon fighter aircraft, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, and C-130 transports (retired 2023) – including delivery through air to air refueling. A 100% sustainable fuel flight took place in November 2022 utilising an A330 Voyager from RAF Brize Norton.

SAF can reduce the carbon emissions generated by an aircraft by around 80%. It is produced from agricultural and industrial byproducts, including waste cooking oils, animal fats, and even municipal solid waste. While helping to fulfil government and service objectives related to combating climate change, SAF also provides a way to reduce reliance on foreign supplies of crude oil and general fossil fuel products. It is designed to blend with conventional fuel to allow mixed supplies, easing logistical burdens, and offer the opportunity of a gradual introduction.

The Red Arrows’ planned full display powered by sustainable fuel at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), the UK’s largest airshow, follows a successful flypast conducted over London in June using a SAF blend.

Squadron Leader Andy King, Senior Engineering Officer for the Red Arrows team, said “At the heart of the Royal International Air Tattoo is a mission to inspire future generations of aviators – a goal shared by the Red Arrows.”

“This makes this year’s Air Tattoo an ideal occasion to showcase the Red Arrows’ ground-breaking, world-leading move to more sustainable fuels – powering a display that has the same thrilling, entertaining and exciting aerobatics and teamwork that has captivated millions of enthusiasts at the show across the decades.”

Three displays will be flown at RIAT using sustainable fuel, along with a number of formation flypasts over the weekend. The Royal Air Force Typhoon display team will also use a SAF blend, mirroring their first use of the fuel during last years’ display. At that time, Air Vice-Marshal Shaun Harris remarked that “As well as contributing to reduced carbon emissions as part of the Defence Aviation Net Zero Strategy, our ability to use new fuels ensures that the Royal Air Force can continue to operate anywhere we are needed globally.”

In addition to using SAF to power the aircraft, the Red Arrows’ signature red, white, and blue smoke will also be generated using sustainable Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) fuel. This fuel is carried in a pod underneath the teams’ Hawk T1 aircraft, and is injected into the engine exhaust through three small pipes. The instant vaporization of the fuel creates a thick white smoke trail – dye is added to two of the three tanks inside the belly pod to create the red and blue trails. Each aircraft can generate five minutes of white smoke, and one minute each of red and blue.

Making the smoke trails ‘green’ has been an aim for the team since at least 2022, as part of the Royal Air Force’s overall aim to be a net-zero force by 2040. As stated above, this strategy is important both from a climate perspective as well as from a national security one.

Sustainable fuels in other forces

The Royal Air Force is not alone in seeking the expansion in use of sustainable fuels. The U.S. Department of Defense has issued a number of contracts seeking development work in this area, eyeing similar goals to the RAF in reducing reliance on singular fuel sources. It’s additionally noted that SAF could be a safer option, able to be produced at airfields themselves essentially on demand and reducing the need for extremely vulnerable fuel transport trucks.

Lockheed Martin cleared the F-35 Lightning II for synthetic fuels in January of this year, with Norway becoming the first operator of the aircraft to utilize the fuel in their aircraft.

Commercial aviation is also investing in sustainable fuels. Virgin Atlantic completed their first transatlantic flight with SAF in 2023, using a Boeing 787 flying a routine service between London Heathrow Airport and New York John F. Kennedy Airport. The flight took place in cooperation with the UK Government and with support from aircraft and engine manufacturers Boeing and Rolls-Royce.",https://theaviationist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RedArrowsSAF_1-706x397.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 13:22:18.688499

The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits.
Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBB), which significantly rolls back many of the core tax incentives that clean energy projects have relied on since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Under the new law, tax credits for wind and solar projects phase out much sooner. To qualify, these projects must either be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction within the next 12 months. This compressed timeline will likely force developers to accelerate their project schedules or risk losing critical tax credits. In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.

However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, and limited to electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing tax credits, these “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules have now been expanded under the OBBB to cover virtually all tax credits. The expanded FEOC rules deny credits to projects that are owned or controlled by certain foreign entities — or that purchase components from or make payment to these foreign entities. Notably, the list of FEOCs includes all companies owned or controlled by the Chinese government or its citizens.

Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects face a shorter window to qualify for tax credits. Projects that were under construction by the end of 2024 are largely unaffected by the new law. Projects first starting construction in 2025 must generally comply with the FEOC ownership requirements, and projects beginning construction in 2026 or later must navigate a complex set of FEOC sourcing and payment rules, including proving that an increasing share of components are sourced outside of China.

Going forward, a key factor for most clean energy projects will be the date they begin construction, as this will determine both their eligibility for tax credits and the extent to which they must comply with the FEOC rules. Over the past 12 years, the IRS has issued a series of notices that define what it means for a project to be “under construction” along with related rules on transfers and completion deadlines. The OBBB clarifies that this existing guidance continues to apply for purposes of the effective date of the “material assistance” FEOC rules described below.

However, the Trump administration issued an executive order on July 7, 2026, directing the US Treasury department to revisit the begun construction rules with respect to solar and wind facilities within 45 days, including by “restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” These guidelines (and the extent to which they are changed for solar and wind) are now likely to become central to how developers assess the value of their pipelines and plan future investments. Many in the industry will now rely on these IRS rules to guide investment decisions and accelerate project timelines, as construction start dates become a critical factor in securing favorable tax treatment under the new law.

This Client Alert provides a detailed description of the OBBB’s changes to the tax credits across different technologies and the FEOC rules.

Solar and Wind ITC and PTC

Projects that began construction before 2025 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. Projects that start construction in 2025 or later are eligible under existing law for tax credits that are similar to the investment tax credit (ITC) or production tax credit (PTC) and referred to as “technology neutral credits.” Most of the restrictions in the new law related to renewables are aimed at curtailing these technology neutral credits.

Despite the technology neutral focus of existing law, solar and wind are subject to different — and harsher — treatment under the OBBB than other technologies. Projects have to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. Under pre-OBBB law, projects beginning construction in 2025 or 2026 would have until the end of 2029 or the end of 2030, respectively, to be placed in service, or else their developers must demonstrate that work is continuous based on the facts.

Solar and wind projects, as well as other projects eligible for technology neutral tax credits, will also become subject to the FEOC requirements, which are described in further detail below.

Helpfully, the OBBB does not affect eligibility for tax credit adders (e.g., for projects located in an energy community or that meet domestic content requirements), eligibility for accelerated depreciation, the ability to transfer tax credits to third parties for cash, or place restrictions on residential solar leasing. Restrictions on the latter three had been proposed in prior iterations of the bill. The final bill focuses the leasing restriction on solar water heating property or small wind energy property.

Although the domestic content tax credit bonus is retained, the OBBB fixes an apparent glitch from the Inflation Reduction Act that would have increased the qualification threshold to up to 55% over time for PTC projects but left the ITC threshold static at 40%. ITC projects that began construction before June 16, 2025, can still rely on a 40% threshold, but projects seeking to claim a domestic content adder that began construction after that date must meet a domestic content threshold of 45%, with increasing annual thresholds that match the PTC version thereafter.

Storage and Other Technologies Eligible for the ITC and PTC

Non-solar and wind technologies (e.g., storage, hydropower, and geothermal) fare much better under the OBBB. Tax credits for these projects are subject to a phase-down schedule that begins for projects that commence construction after 2033. Projects beginning construction in 2034 and 2035 will still qualify for tax credits but with a 75% and 50% haircut, respectively. These projects must meet the traditional continuity test, which requires placement in service by the end of the fourth year after the end of the year in which construction starts, or else demonstrate that construction was continuous based on the facts.

Fuel cells (including linear generators) were added as a special category of ITC-eligible technology. Fuel cell projects generally involve some level of greenhouse gas emissions, which would make them ineligible for the technology neutral ITC pre-OBBB. They are newly eligible for a 30% ITC without regard to emissions and are also exempt from prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. They cannot qualify for tax credit adders. Eligibility begins for projects that start construction after 2025.

Clean Fuels

The OBBB significantly modifies the section 45Z PTC for clean transportation fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is extended by two years to cover fuel sold through December 31, 2029, but reduces the value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon beginning for fuel produced after 2025. The OBBB also eliminates the excise tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel with respect to any sale or use after September 30, 2025, and prohibits double counting by barring 45Z credits on any fuel produced from fuel that would have qualified for 45Z credits on its own. Fuel feedstock will have to come from the United States, Mexico, or Canada to qualify for a credit.

The new law forecloses the possibility of claiming additional 45Z credits based on “negative emissions.” The credit amount is calculated according to the “emissions factor” of the fuel, with a floor of 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU to qualify. The greater the emissions rate, the smaller the emissions factor and the smaller the tax credit. Conversely, if the emissions rate is negative, prior law appears to allow taxpayers to claim a credit above $1.00 for clean fuel and above $1.75 for sustainable aviation fuel. The OBBB prevents this result.

The OBBB also restores the expired tax credit under section 40A for small agri-biodiesel producers through 2026 and increases the credit amount from 10 cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon. The tax credit will be newly eligible to be sold to third parties for cash.

As described in further detail below, projects intending to claim 45Z credits will become subject to FEOC ownership restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture receives relatively favorable treatment under the OBBB compared to other credits. The credit is available for carbon dioxide that is captured and then permanently sequestered, used in enhanced oil recovery, or put to another commercial use. The credit amount had been higher for a sequestration use case compared to the others on the theory that sequestration is uneconomic without the tax incentive. The OBBB puts all use cases on equal footing so that both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for a credit of up to $85 per metric ton (or more in the case of direct air capture).

Similar to the 45Z tax credit for clean fuels, projects will become subject to the ownership-related FEOC restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit

The OBBB makes numerous changes to the section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which provides a tax credit for the production and sale of certain solar, wind, and battery components, as well as the production and purification of certain critical minerals. Among other changes, the OBBB:

terminates the tax credit for wind components sold after 2027;

creates a new category of eligible critical minerals for “metallurgical coal”;

begins phasing out tax credits for critical mineral production (other than metallurgical coal, which terminates after 2029) after 2030, with termination after 2033;

subjects manufacturers to similar FEOC rules as those that apply to the technology neutral ITC and PTC; and

requires battery modules to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment,” as a condition for tax credit eligibility.

Metallurgical coal is unique compared to the other critical minerals in that it is allowed to be produced outside of the United States. Federal tax credit eligibility in general, even outside of the critical minerals context, usually requires the activity being subsidized to occur in the United States. However, the credit is only worth 2.5% of the cost compared to 10% with respect to other critical minerals. The coal must be suitable for use in the production of steel.

Notably, the OBBB does not fully restrict the sale of integrated components, which had been proposed in the initial Senate bill. The initial Senate bill would have essentially prevented manufacturers of multiple components that are integrated into an end product from claiming credits on each individual component. Instead, the OBBB permits the stacking of credits provided that the components that are integrated together are produced in the same facility, the end product is sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65% of the direct material costs of the underlying components are attributable to US mining, production, or manufacturing.

Foreign Entities of Concern

The OBBB imposes important new restrictions limiting the ability of projects to generate tax credits if certain FEOCs are involved. These restrictions fall into two categories: (1) those relating to ownership or control, and (2) those relating to assistance during construction. To the extent an FEOC restriction contains a beginning of construction concept, the OBBB memorializes long-standing IRS guidance that allows a project owner to begin construction by either incurring 5% of project costs or else beginning physical work of a significant nature.

1. FEOC — Ownership Restrictions

The first FEOC restriction generally prohibits a project owner from claiming technology neutral tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, clean fuel production tax credits, and tax credits for carbon sequestration for any tax year in which the person otherwise generating the tax credit is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign influenced entity.” These restrictions generally apply to tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, though the restrictions relating to foreign-influenced entities do not restrict clean fuel production tax credits until tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Specified foreign entities should be relatively easy to identify. These include entities owned by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia; entities owned by citizens of those countries or otherwise organized or having a principal place of business in one of those countries; certain battery manufacturers; and certain other similar entities.

An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if: a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint board members or officers; a single specified entity owns more than 25% of the entity; one or more specified foreign entities owns an aggregate of 40% of the entity; or at least 15% of the entity’s debt is held by specified foreign entities (in the aggregate).

An entity is also a foreign-influenced entity if during the prior taxable year the entity made payments to a specified foreign entity pursuant to an arrangement that allowed the specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a project (in the case of technology neutral tax credits) or production of any components (in the case of advanced manufacturing tax credits). The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits. Because effective control requires examination of payments made in the prior taxable year, project owners should closely scrutinize any contract that requires a payment, or any payments recently made, which could provide a contractual counterparty with any specific authority over production of components, energy generation, or energy storage.

Contractual rights that allow a counterparty to determine the amount or timing of production, restrict access to data relating to production, determine the purchase of power output, or maintain or otherwise operate a project on an exclusive basis can create effective control. Effective control can also be granted by licensing arrangements that specify or direct material or other components in a project, allow the licensor to direct the operation of the project, limit the taxpayer’s use of the licensed property, provide a right to royalties for more than 10 years, or otherwise require the project owner to hire a project operator for more than two years at the licensor’s direction.

Finally, for projects claiming the technology neutral ITC, the OBBB imposes a recapture of 100% of the tax credit value if payments conveying effective control are made within 10 years of the project being placed in service.

2. FEOC — Material Assistance Rules

The second set of FEOC restrictions prohibits project owners from claiming technology neutral tax credits if construction on the project started after December 31, 2025, and the project receives material assistance from a specified foreign entity. A similar prohibition limits project owners from claiming advanced manufacturing tax credits for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2025, if the owner received material assistance from a specified foreign entity.

An entity receives material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity if the material assistance cost ratio applicable either to the power generation project or the manufacturing project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The applicable threshold percentages are shown in Exhibit A (below), which can be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury in the case of the applicable threshold relating to critical minerals.

The material assistance cost ratio for a power plant or battery is generally the difference between the total direct costs for manufactured products less the direct costs attributable to a specified foreign entity, divided by the total direct costs. This effectively examines the “good” costs over the total costs. The material assistance cost ratio for a manufactured component is the “good” material costs over the total material costs.

The OBBB directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue safe harbor tables applying a methodology similar to that adopted with respect to the calculation of domestic content under Notice 2025-08 for material assistance. Before these tables are issued, taxpayers can rely on Notice 2025-08 along with a supplier certification, though this has an obvious shortcoming in that Notice 2025-08 has tables for a limited subset of power production technologies. Developers of other technologies will have to rely on actual labor and materials costs to run the calculations.

Other Changes

The clean hydrogen PTC terminates for projects that begin construction after 2027. Prior iterations of the bill in both the House and Senate would have terminated the credit if construction did not begin by the end of 2025.

Bonus depreciation — the ability to write off 100% of the cost of certain business property, including renewables projects, as a depreciation deduction — is made permanent for property acquired after January 19, 2025. Bonus depreciation was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and was set to phase out after 2026 for most property. Taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation entirely or alternatively elect into a 40% bonus (or 60% bonus for property with a longer production period).

The PTC for nuclear facilities under 45U will become subject to the FEOC ownership restrictions.

Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026. The exact dates and mechanics vary by credit. Affected credits include the 30D clean vehicle credit, the 45W qualified commercial vehicles credit, the 30C credit for charging stations, and the residential clean energy credit under 25D.

There's just a fortnight to go until this year's Royal International Air Tattoo, and organisers have announced a 'world first' for the iconic Red Arrows.

It's as they'll be displaying Sustainable Aviation Fuel when they take to the skies above RAF Fairford.

More than 170,000 people are expected at RAF Fairford for the aviation showcase which is due to take place on Friday 18th, Saturday 19th and Sunday 20th July.

The Red Arrows’ performances across the weekend will be history-making for any national aerobatic team – using not only SAF for jet propulsion but also a renewable biofuel, known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), to produce its distinctive trademark vapour trails.

Joining the Red Arrows on SAF will be the RAF’s Typhoon display, which also completed its first routine on SAF at last year’s show in another world-first.

Kate McKinley, Director of People and Sustainability at Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises, said: “We are thrilled to have the Red Arrows performing on sustainable fuel at this year’s Royal International Air Tattoo.

“Their nine-ship team are known across the world, so we are delighted to be hosting this landmark display here at RAF Fairford.

“In 2024 we were lucky enough to secure the RAF Typhoon’s first public display on SAF and being able to continue the Typhoon for another year and add the Red Arrows is great for us as an event.”

The Red Arrows will be performing three times on the fuel, as well as featuring in various special formation flypasts across the weekend event.

The display comes after the team first publicly flew on the fuel last month as part of the celebrations for HM King Charles’ official birthday, in the skies above London.

However, the displays at the Royal International Air Tattoo will be the first ever aerobatic performances by the Red Arrows using both SAF and HVO.

Squadron Leader Andy King, the Red Arrows’ Senior Engineering Officer and who led the pioneering fuels project, said: “At the heart of the Royal International Air Tattoo is a mission to inspire future generations of aviators – a goal shared by the Red Arrows.

“This makes this year’s Air Tattoo an ideal occasion to showcase the Red Arrows’ ground-breaking, world-leading move to more sustainable fuels – powering a display that has the same thrilling, entertaining and exciting aerobatics and teamwork that has captivated millions of enthusiasts at the show across the decades.”

The flights have been made possible by Air Space Intelligence, Intel Foundry and Team Lewis, with HVO and fuel being supplied by Power Electrics and AFS Aviation respectively.",https://cdn.apollo.audio/one/media/686e/407a/3404/6f43/8820/69c7/RED-20240412-240-Zadar%20First%20Display%20Practice-158.jpg?quality=80&format=jpg,N,,2025-07-09 08:06:36.907355

The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.","The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) today trimmed further its outlook for domestic biomass-based diesel production in 2025 while raising its forecast for next year.

US renewable diesel production is expected to average 205,000 b/d in 2025, EIA said Tuesday in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. That was down by 1,000 b/d from its June estimate and a more than 30pc drop from the agency's initial outlook for this year's production.

EIA also cut its expectation for 2025 consumption of renewable diesel to 191,000 b/d, down by 5,000 b/d from the June outlook. The lower demand outlook coincides with EIA's cut to expected distillates demand because of muted economic growth.

The combined production and demand outlooks imply about 16,000 b/d of net renewable diesel exports this year compared with 34,000 b/d of US net imports last year. Foreign biofuels are no longer eligible this year for a federal tax credit, sharply reducing the incentive to import.

Biorefineries have run at lower rates this year because of thin margins and uncertainty about future blend mandates and tax credit policy, although the government has slowly provided more clarity on plans for future years.

In 2026, EIA expects 255,000 b/d of renewable diesel production, a 6,000 b/d hike from last month's outlook to what would be an all-time annual high after rapid growth leading up to this year. The agency predicts 234,000 b/d of renewable diesel consumption next year, a 1,000 b/d drop from last month's expectation.

Trends were similar for biodiesel, with the agency forecasting tougher economics this year but more output next year. The report now projects 90,000 b/d of US biodiesel production this year and 91,000 b/d of consumption, both down by 1,000 b/d from the June forecast. In 2026, EIA expects 103,000 b/d of biodiesel production, 4,000 b/d more than last month's forecast, with biodiesel consumption at 100,000 b/d, a 3,000 b/d increase from the June report.

EIA expectations for ""other biofuels"", which includes sustainable aviation fuel made through a similar hydroprocessing method as renewable diesel, have generally been more optimistic this year. The latest report keeps projections for this year steady at 38,000 b/d of production and 37,000 b/d of consumption.

The technology enables many sensing points just a few centimeters apart, each working as an individual temperature sensor.","Sensing technology has come a long way since the invention of the humble thermocouple and strain gauge. Many of these ‘classic’ sensors work by monitoring and measuring changes in wire components to calculate environmental conditions and forces such as temperatures and stress. But while this type of sensor continues to be the workhorse of many industries, including the highly demanding aerospace test environment, engineers are looking for more advanced sensors that provide single-point readings and surface-wide, high-speed data across a range of scenarios.

In a test environment, advanced sensors are required to ensure materials and components are fit for purpose, while in operational environments, they are necessary to monitor the performance of systems, including those using novel fuels and autonomous technologies.

Requirements continue to change. For example, the need to burn hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) changes the heat transfer properties of the combustion gases in aeroengines, necessitating redesigns and the validation of components. In addition, engineers and operators want more data. For instance, in terms of temperature sensing, they are interested in stable operating conditions and temperatures across an entire component rather than at one or two points, a limitation of thermocouples.

In response, innovative companies are developing new sensing solutions using the latest technology and materials to meet these monitoring needs.

PAINTING A PICTURE

A leading example of new sensor technology is Sensor Coating Systems’ (SCS) thermal history coatings (THC) and paint (THP), which remembers the highest temperature. “After operation, we shine a light on it and the luminescence afterglow, after calibration, tells us what the temperature was at every single point across the component. This provides entire temperature maps of components – something thermocouples can’t do,” explains Dr Jörg Feist, managing director of SCS and co-inventor of the technology.

“This is a small project with the potential to make a big impact” DAVID DEBNEY, HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY FOR WHOLE AIRCRAFT, ATI

The solution can be used on anything from combustion chambers to turbine blades and vanes, because it is manufactured similarly to traditional thermal barrier coatings. THC can endure long running intervals of tens or hundreds of hours at very high temperatures, while the paint variant, THP has already been proven to withstand more than 7,000 hours at temperatures below 550°C (1000°F).

The thermal mapping technology can also measure temperatures of up to and beyond 1,600°C (2,900°F) with an accuracy of ± 25°C (77°F). This was one of the main reasons it was awarded the UK Aerospace Technology Institute’s (ATI’s) “Making the Difference Award”.

“The project demonstrated that the thermal mapping technology can be used under multi-cycle test conditions where engine load conditions are changing,” says David Debney, head of technology for whole aircraft at the ATI, and chair of the award’s judging panel.

“Existing thermal paints and coatings today usually contain toxic materials. It’s therefore important to note that the solution developed in this project is also fully REACH compliant. This is a small project with the potential to make a big impact.”

UNDER PRESSURE

When it comes to pressure measurement, current strain gauge, piezoresistive and capacitive sensors can be limited by issues including thermal drift and degradation at high temperatures, vibration sensitivity causing inaccurate readings and limited dynamic range missing fast pressure changes.

Test and measurement technology provider HBK has developed new piezoelectric sensors which aim to overcome these challenges. “Our GaPO₄-based sensors solve these issues by operating beyond 700°C (1,300°F), where quartz and ceramics fail and by offering high-frequency response for precise combustion instability and shock wave measurement,” says Dr Christian Roethel, head of sales and product management at Piezocryst by HBK.

These sensors are suitable for environments such as jet engine and gas turbine combustion testing, where they can detect pressure pulsations and instability, and rocket engine development. They can measure dynamic pressure in extreme environments such as combustion chambers and fuel lines.

They can also support hypersonic and supersonic flow research, capturing transient pressure changes in wind tunnels, and structural health monitoring by identifying pressure-induced stress variations.

“As propulsion systems evolve toward cleaner combustion and higher efficiency, our sensors ensure safer, more precise and sustainable aerospace developments by optimizing engine performance, safety and emissions reduction through precise combustion analysis,” says Roethel.

The company continues to look for ways to advance its sensors. This includes by increasing the operating temperature limits. Hydrogen-based combustion happens at higher temperatures, increasing operating demands. Meanwhile research into miniaturization and advanced packaging is enabling the sensor’s use in compact, high-power-density turbines.

LASER VISION FOR AIR FLOW

Aerospace engineers at the University of Cincinnati (UC) in the USA have developed a laser-based system to visualize and measure airflow in unprecedented detail. Building on particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques, the system tracks microscopic particles seeded in the air using high-speed cameras and laser pulses, enabling researchers to calculate velocity by observing particle movement between frames, explains Daniel Cuppoletti, assistant professor of aerospace engineering at UC.

Unlike traditional methods such as pitot probes or hot-wire anemometry, which only provide single-point data, the laser-based technique offers high spatial and temporal resolution, producing full-field, image-based measurements at tens of thousands of frames per second. This enables researchers to capture complex, fast-changing aerodynamic phenomena like shock waves, vortices and noise-generating structures in supersonic and hypersonic flows.

“The timescales of these flows are incredibly short. This technique, operating at 50 to 100KHz, lets us resolve those very fast, transient phenomena,” Cuppoletti explains.

“Our sensors ensure safer, more precise and sustainable aerospace developments” DR CHRISTIAN ROETHEL, HEAD OF SALES AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT, PIEZOCRYST BY HBK

While the laser solution is being used in R&D environments, it is not yet a plug-and-play solution. Calibration and setup are complex processes, especially for high-fidelity measurement. However, the technique is playing a crucial role in validating computational models and refining aircraft components. Its ability to visualize coherent structures supports research into aeroacoustics, a vital aspect of electric aircraft and advanced air mobility solutions being developed to enter service over the next decade.

FROM GROUND TO AIR

It’s not just sensors for test environments that are being advanced – aerospace is also seeing exciting developments in sensor technology that is used in operational settings.

Late last year BAE Systems was awarded a US$12 million contract by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop a microelectronic sensor capable of high-bandwidth, high dynamic-range sensing at extreme temperatures, such as on hypersonic aircraft and missiles.

Current sensors are limited in that they can’t operate over 225°C (4,400°F) due to their materials, circuitry and/or packaging. BAE Systems is therefore designing a new pressure sensor module made of an integrated transducer and signal-conditioning microelectronics, capable of operating at 800°C (1,500°F).

“Applications such as jet engine prognostics and space exploration could benefit from the collection of real-time data using high temperature pressure sensors and circuitry through the High Operational Temperature Sensors program,” says Amrita Masurkar, technology development manager at BAE Systems’ FAST Labs R&D organization.

TAMING TURBULENCE

Elsewhere, researchers at the German Aerospace Centre’s (DLR) Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology are working on the optimal load-adaptive aircraft (oLAF) project. This aims to develop an intelligent load control system able to proactively respond to wind gusts and maneuvers by quickly adjusting control surfaces and flaps. This will enable the aircraft to better absorb turbulence and reduce material stress, making the plane more efficient and extending service life.

“Our accelerometers open the door to scalable deployment in precision applications” DAVID BLUMSTEIN, GENERAL MANAGER MOTION, SILICON MICROGRAVITY

The project uses laser systems and LiDAR to measure wind patterns and detect ongoing gusts earlier, enabling the aircraft to react even more precisely and proactively to external influences, explains the project’s manager Lars Reimer. The research has already shown that this solution can reduce fuel consumption by over seven percent, significantly decreasing CO emissions.

SMARTER AIRCRAFT

Another leading example of sensor innovation comes from Saab, which is using Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor technology in its overheat detection system (OHDS) for commercial aircraft. The technology enables many sensing points just a few centimeters apart, each working as an individual temperature sensor.

The key difference with the OHDS is that it is being installed into new aircraft rather than used during the development and testing of materials and systems. Sensing fibres distributed across the aircraft provide real-time monitoring of bleed air piping to detect hot air leakage, providing precise measurements that can be analyzed for trends and setting smart alarms.

Another innovative company in this space is Silicon Microgravity, which is making progress in the world of inertial sensing. Engineers here have developed a resonant micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometer that combines the performance of quartz with the scalability and efficiency of silicon.

While the sensor’s core concept isn’t new, Silicon Microgravity’s proprietary IP enables exceptional bias stability (<0.15 μg at 25g, 0.5 μg at 100g) and low temperature sensitivity, all while benefiting from the batch-fabrication advantages of silicon.

“The result is a silicon MEMS sensor that offers near-quartz performance at a fraction of the cost, size and power demand,” says David Blumstein, general manager, motion at Silicon Microgravity.

This breakthrough addresses a long-standing trade-off in sensor design, the choice between high accuracy or affordability.

“Our accelerometers close that gap, opening the door to scalable deployment in precision applications from GPS-denied aerospace navigation to missile guidance, advanced wearables and eventually mass-market autonomous systems,” Blumstein says.

“Our goal is to replace shoebox-sized Inertial Measurement Units that cost hundreds of thousands with something that costs a couple thousand and fits in a matchbox.”

With MEMS gyroscopes and custom ASICs also on its roadmap, Silicon Microgravity clearly aims to redefine what is possible in navigation, guidance and control.

SENSORS SHAPING THE SKY

As can be judged from these few examples, sensors are evolving from test instruments to design enablers and safety guardians, helping the aerospace industry to advance and push boundaries even further.

Sensor data is no longer just for reports. It is real-time, high-resolution and feeding live systems, which in turn is enabling aircraft to respond more quickly and efficiently, providing a myriad of benefits from passenger safety and comfort through to improving sustainability, efficiency, and even capabilities.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to sensor innovation, but it’s an exciting, fast-moving area that will continue to transform aerospace design, operations and performance in the years ahead.",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sensors-lead-pic.jpg.webp,N,,2025-07-09 07:11:16.368901

Considering the continuous growth of air traffic and the limited potential of other alternative fuels, switching to SAF is unavoidable for decarbonizing aviation.

In 2024, aviation accounted for approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2 emissions (~2.5% of global CO2 emissions). However, due to continuous air traffic growth, this sector could become a much larger contributor if transformative measures are not adopted.

The aviation sector is facing immense challenges to meet its commitment to achieve net-zero by 2050:

• Technology (e.g. new engine technologies) and operational improvements (e.g. green taxiing) will reduce CO2 emissions, but the identified levers have potential to reduce CO2 emissions by only ~15%. This reduction will be completely nullified by air traffic growth, that is expected to double by 2050

• Switching to low-carbon fuels is thus a mandatory step to decarbonize aviation and meet net-zero targets by 2050. IATA targets ~65% of CO2 emissions reduction due to the switch to low-carbon fuels.

• The remaining ~20% of CO2 emissions from the aviation sector will have to be offset (through reforestation projects for instance)

‍

‍

Exhibit 1: CO2 emissions from air traffic (world, in billions of tons) – IATA Net zero carbon 2050 resolution

‍

In terms of low-carbon fuel options, electricity is to date limited to small/regional aircraft due to battery weight.

Hydrogen has often been cited as a future alternative for decarbonizing aviation. However, its use as a direct fuel is constrained by technological (storage), infrastructure, and energy density limitations. Thus, current projects focus on small/regional aircraft as well.

- In 2022, Airbus launched a differentiated project (ZEROe) targeting an aircraft with more than 100 passengers and a range up to 3700km by 2035

- But Airbus recently scaled back its hydrogen-powered aircraft ambitions

Thus, among available options, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) stands out as the most viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation.

Exhibit 2: passengers’ capacity and range of current projects of hydrogen and electric aircraft compared to current aircraft

‍

2. SAF consumption is emerging with airline commitments and regulations

Airlines are already incorporating SAF in their fuel mix and regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation (which came into force since January 2025) will secure a growing demand for SAF.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is jet fuel produced from biomass or synthesized from renewable hydrogen (e-fuels) and captured CO2.

Its primary advantage is compatibility with existing engines and infrastructure, allowing for a drop-in replacement of fossil kerosene.

Also, the technology has been proven in commercial flights: Apart from a few flight tests conducted with 100% of SAF, many Airlines have started to incorporate a growing share of SAF (even if it is still very low) in their fuel mix.

For instance, Air France-KLM and IAG have already signed partnerships with SAF producers to secure SAF supply until 2030 and target 10% of SAF in their fuel mix by 2030 (which is greater than the 6% obligation from ReFuelEU Aviation):

- Air France-KLM reported 1.25% of SAF in their fuel mix in 2024 and signed several long-term offtake contracts with SAF producers (e.g. Engie, EDF, Elyse Energy, TotalEnergies, OMV, Raven, SAF+). Notably, the agreement with TotalEnergies represents 1.5Mt of SAF between 2025 and 2035.

- IAG reported 1.9% of SAF in their fuel mix in 2024. They signed long-term offtake contracts with SAF producers like BP, Neste, Repsol, LanzaJet, Gevo and have already reported more than $3.5 billion investment in future offtake.

‍

Exhibit 3: SAF consumption of AirFrance-KLM and IA

‍

In order to boost the development of SAF, several countries have defined SAF mandates imposing progressive blending mandates on fuel suppliers and airlines:

- Europe: Since January 2025, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation has come into force, imposing 2% of SAF in 2025, 6% in 2030 and 70% in 2050.

- UK: 2% of SAF in 2025, 10% of 2030 and for now 22% in 2040.

- Singapore has set an obligation of 1% of SAF in 2026 and is in the process of setting SAF mandates for 2030 (which are expected to be between 3% and 5%).

- Japan established a national objective of achieving 10% of SAF in 2030.

- USA has been very ambitious regarding SAF, with a national target of achieving 100% by 2050. The USA has also set strong financial mechanisms to support SAF production, especially with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to target a SAF production capacity of 9Mt/y in 2030 and 100Mt/y in 2050. The recent election of Donald Trump has, of course, put this trajectory at risk, with several measures from his administration aimed at freezing climate-related funding, including provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

‍

Exhibit 4: Overview of main SAF mandates and national objectives in the world

‍

SAF mandates are essential to ensure a secured demand trajectory and stimulate investment. For instance, in France, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative will establish a predictable SAF demand, growing from approximately 0.2 Mt in 2025 to around 11 Mt by 2050.

‍

Exhibit 5: ReFuelEU Aviation obligationfor jet fuel suppliers to include SAF in jet fuel supplied to French airports(in Mt)

3. First challenge to scale-up SAF production capacities is to reduce production costs, to have a viable economic equation

Future SAF technologies fall into two broad categories:

 Biomass-based pathways:

- HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids): the most mature technology, which consists of refining Used Cooking Oil (UCO). The refining process has the advantage of requiring limited investment to convert current refineries

- Alcohol-to-jet: while technologically viable, regulatory constraints on agricultural feedstocks mean local production is limited in Europe. Europe is thus expected to import SAF from Brazil for instance

- Gasification (e.g. process patented from Haffner Energy): this pathway can use a variety of biomass sources and is feedstock-agnostic. However, it generates CO2 as a by-product, which must be captured or offset.

 E-fuels using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: these rely on low-carbon hydrogen and CO2. It requires vast amounts of renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and infrastructure to capture CO2 and infrastructures to transport both hydrogen and CO2.

Technology maturity and feedstock availability represent strong barriers to SAF production today. The first barrier is the production cost: even HEFA, which is the most mature technology, is twice as expensive (~1.2 $/kg) as the current jet fuel price (~0.7 $/kg in average between 2019 and 2024). The ratio can even be greater than 4 for the Power-to-liquid process (depending on electricity price).

‍

Exhibit 6: SAF production processes and costs

4. 2nd challenge is the availability of domestic feedstock, to avoid reliance on imports. To date, France mainly produces SAF from UCO imported from Asia

HEFA is currently the most used process in France (and in the world), but it uses Used Cooking Oil (UCO), mostly imported (Europe imports ~80% of the UCO used) from China (~50% of total UCO imports).

Due to the lowest cost and higher level of maturity, almost all SAF produced in the world is with HEFA process. HEFA seems to be an attractive solution, but the potential is strongly limited due to the feedstock: Used Cooking Oil (UCO).

Indeed, UCO production and collection are very limited. In France, ~90kt is used per year. Even if it were to be used to produce SAF (it is also used to produce biofuels for road transportation), the volume would be negligible compared to the national demand for SAF: 0.2Mt in 2025 and 11Mt in 2050.

Thus, if the other technologies (Alcohol-to-jet, Gasification, Power-to-liquid) are not developed at an economic cost, France will have to continue to rely strongly on imports of UCO from Asia to produce SAF (which obviously limits the effect on the decarbonization of aviation).

‍

Exhibit 7: maturity of SAF production processes and feedstock availability

5. The groundwork to catalyze SAF production investment is in place, but the coming five years will be crucial to turn early initiatives into operational projects

To date, ~15 projects of SAF production based on these other technologies are reported in France. They represent a total SAF production capacity of ~1Mt per year by 2030 (which is greater than the need of 0.6 Mt per year to comply with ReFuelEU Aviation).

‍

Exhibit 8: list of announced projects of SAF production in France

But these projects will require massive financial investments: typical SAF production projects require more than €1 billion investment.

In total, France will need to invest around €28 billion by 2050 to build the 11 Mt of SAF production capacity required under ReFuelEU Aviation.

The groundwork to catalyse SAF production investment is in place:

 The international aviation industry has recognized the imperative to decarbonize and committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050

 SAF stands out as the most viable strategy for decarbonizing aviation

 Many countries have defined SAF mandates, which secures a predictable and growing SAF demand

Many airlines are starting to contract long-term offtake agreements with SAF suppliers (see examples from Air-France KLM and IAG on Exhibit 10), in order to secure SAF volumes up to 2030-2035, which is a very positive signal.

However, investment from infrastructure funds remains limited to date, with Hy24 and Mirova among the first in France: in 2024, they announced a €120m investment to support Elyse Energy’s SAF production projects in France (and Spain).

The next five years will be critical for the successful implementation of the ~15 SAF projects planned in France. Key priorities include:

 maturing the technology

 reducing production costs and demonstrating a viable business model

 developing a local feedstock supply chain. This will allow the shift towards SAF to become a national strategic advantage, rather than relying on used oil import from Asia

This transition to SAF also creates an opportunity for new entrants to challenge historical players (ex: TotalEnergies, BP, ExxonMobil):

 Companies from the hydrogen sector entering the field, such as Elyse Energy, H2V, Lhyfe, and Hy2gen,

 Technology providers like Haffner Energy,

 Major energy players like Engie seizing this opportunity to enter the emerging green fuels market.

The initiative, led by startup Arbor, aims to produce reliable power while capturing and storing carbon dioxide at competitive costs.

Arbor, founded by a former SpaceX engineer, is developing a facility near Louisiana’s Gulf Coast expected to be operational by 2028.

The project employs bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology, which converts forest thinnings into clean energy and sequesters the resultant CO₂ underground.

The Frontier coalition will acquire 116,000 carbon removal credits from the project, signalling growing confidence in BECCS solutions.

Microsoft, another active buyer in this sector, has already contracted nearly 10 million BECCS credits from various international projects this year.

Arbor’s approach introduces several advancements: biomass is gasified into a syngas mixture and combusted in pure oxygen, producing a high-purity CO₂ stream in a supercritical liquid state.

This method improves energy conversion efficiency by over 30% compared to conventional BECCS and reduces carbon capture costs due to cleaner exhaust gases.

While current costs exceed $350 per tonne of CO₂ removed, the coalition projects these could fall below $100 per tonne as the technology scales.

Arbor’s integrated capture and power generation design allows system scaling that greatly increases output without proportional cost rises.

Sustainability remains a core concern, as biomass sourcing has previously drawn criticism for impacting natural forests. Arbor’s project addresses this by using forest thinnings from commercial plantations - material typically left unused or burned - minimising ecological impact.

Our Uruguay project will be the first of many, serving as a model for how to build a vertically integrated, sustainable, and scalable platform for SAF production.
“We are proud to partner with Avalon Energy Group on their ambitious global rollout of SAF projects,” said Ilja Mikenberg, global head process solutions at Sulzer Chemtech.","Avalon Energy Group, a US-based developer of integrated sustainable energy projects, and Sulzer Chemtech have announced the signing of a new agreement to scale up the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Under the agreement, Avalon has selected BioFlux™ technology for its portfolio of SAF projects currently under development worldwide which will lead to a commercial technology licensing agreement with Sulzer.

The partnership’s first project will be Avalon’s flagship biorefinery in Uruguay. This pioneering facility is designed to be fully integrated, from the cultivation of dedicated non-edible oilseed crops to the production of low-carbon SAF. The project will utilise oil from Camelina sativa, a non-edible crop, as the primary feedstock, establishing a secure and sustainable supply chain that avoids impact on food resources.

“This strategic alliance with Sulzer is a major step forward in our mission to decarbonise the aviation industry,” said Irshad Ahmed, president & CEO of Avalon Energy Group.

“Sulzer’s BioFlux™ technology is a best-in-class, proven solution that will enable us to produce SAF efficiently and cost-effectively. Our Uruguay project will be the first of many, serving as a model for how to build a vertically integrated, sustainable, and scalable platform for SAF production.

“We are thrilled to partner with a world-class technology provider like Sulzer to bring our vision to life and meet the growing global demand for clean aviation fuel.”

Avalon is actively developing a pipeline of similar SAF projects in key locations, including India, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and Illinois, USA. The alliance with Sulzer provides a standardized, state-of-the-art technology framework that will accelerate the development and deployment of these facilities.

“We are proud to partner with Avalon Energy Group on their ambitious global rollout of SAF projects,” said Ilja Mikenberg, global head process solutions at Sulzer Chemtech. “Avalon’s innovative approach to integrating agriculture with biofuel production is a perfect match for our BioFlux™ technology, which is designed to process renewable feedstocks with high efficiency and reliability. The Uruguay project, with its use of Camelina sativa, is a landmark initiative that will showcase the immense potential for creating a truly sustainable aviation fuel value chain. We look forward to supporting Avalon as they set a new standard for the industry.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sulzer-and-Avalon-picBiofuel-8-7-38994010-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:57:48.634506

Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit) FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered.
EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.
Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit) FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered.
RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.","President Trump signed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (the “OBBB”) into law on July 4, 2025. Congress passed the legislation using the budget reconciliation process to avoid the 60-vote Senate filibuster. In addition to making many of the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, the bill makes significant changes to many of the clean energy credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Projects that began construction before 2025 and are planning on claiming production tax credits (“PTCs”) or investment tax credits (“ITCs”) under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. However, the OBBB is a mixed bag when it comes to the other energy tax credits that were introduced or extended by the IRA. The OBBB makes substantial cuts to the tech-neutral tax credits for solar and wind and eliminates certain other energy tax credits (e.g., those for hydrogen, EVs and homeowners), but other technologies and activities (e.g., geothermal, carbon capture, nuclear, clean fuel production) experienced fewer claw backs of the benefits provided by the IRA. The OBBB also adds foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions to the surviving energy tax credits. Finally, the OBBB expands the definition of “qualifying income” (“QI”) for master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) under section 7704(d)(1)(E).

While a prior version of the OBBB released by the Senate contained an excise tax on certain wind and solar facilities deemed to have received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (“PFE”), the tax was removed shortly before its passage by the Senate and is not included in the OBBB.

On July 7, 2025, President Trump also issued an Executive Order (Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources) (the “EO”) directing the Secretary of the Treasury to, within 45 days of enactment of the OBBB, “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” The EO specifically directs Treasury to issue new and revised guidance on “beginning of construction” (BOC), and notes that broad safe harbors should not apply “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” In the same 45-day window, Treasury is also directed to implement the FEOC restrictions in the OBBB.

Below is a summary of the key changes for the clean energy industry as a result of the enactment of the OBBB.

I. TAX CREDIT AND DEDUCTION MODIFICATIONS

1. Sections 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credits when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

PIS DEADLINE: Adds a placed in service (PIS) deadline for solar and wind facilities of December 31, 2027.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (i.e., more than 12 months after the enactment of OBBB).

Akin Note: Allowing construction to begin for up to one year after enactment was a late change to OBBB. However, taxpayers’ ability to take advantage of this window may be limited as a result of guidance to be issued by Treasury implementing the EO.]

Statute makes clear that batteries are not impacted by this change. Other facilities that qualify for credits under §§ 45Y and 48E (besides solar and wind facilities) are also not impacted.

[Akin Note: The language making clear that batteries are not impacted by this change is arguably not necessary in light of the Treasury position in regulations that energy storage technologies cannot be part of qualified facilities.]

LEASING DISALLOWANCE: Disallows credits for solar electric heating and small wind residential property if the taxpayer rents or leases the property.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after enactment of the OBBB).

[Akin Note: In earlier versions of OBBB, this rule also applied to residential photovoltaic solar systems. The final enacted version of OBBB does not disallow ITCs or PTCs for residential photovoltaic solar systems.]

PHASEOUT TIMELINE: Sets both §§ 45Y and 48E to begin phasing out in 2032.

Except for solar and wind facilities that have a special PIS deadline (see above), facilities that qualify for either §§ 45Y or 48E and:

BOC before 2034 can access the full credit;

BOC in 2034 can access 75% of the credit;

BOC 2035 can access 50% of the credit; and

BOC after 2035 cannot access either credit.

TAX OWNERSHIP OF GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS: For purposes of determining tax ownership geothermal heat pumps for depreciation and tax credit purposes, the fact that such property is not readily usable by anyone other than the lessee or offtaker is disregarded.

[Akin Note: This point removes a key obstacle to allowing geothermal heat pumps to be subject to “third party ownership” structures which more readily allows for tax equity financing.]

FUEL CELL FACILITIES (§ 48E (ITC) only): Removes requirement that the anticipated greenhouse gas emission rate not be greater than zero for fuel cell facilities.

Changes apply to facilities the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025.

Sets a 30% ITC rate without the ability to increase with adders and apparently without needing to satisfy Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship requirements.

NUCLEAR ENERGY COMMUNITY (§ 45Y (PTC) only): Creates an energy community adder based on local employment in nuclear facilities, nuclear R&D, and nuclear component manufacturing.

DOMESTIC CONTENT (§ 48E (ITC) only): Facilities that begin construction on and after June 16, 2025, are subject to the same domestic content thresholds for the ITC as the PTC.

Domestic content thresholds are 45% for BOC in 2025, 50% for BOC in 2026 and 55% for BOC in 2027+ (separate rates still apply for off-shore wind).

[Akin Note: This change corrects what has long been viewed as a typo or glitch in the statutory framework.]

Facilities that began construction before June 16, 2024, can utilize a 40% threshold.

2. Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT EXTENSION: Extends the deadline to sell eligible fuel from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2029.

EMISSIONS RATES: Disallows emissions rates from being negative, excludes indirect land use changes from the lifecycle analysis, and requires Treasury to provide emissions rates for each specific animal manure feedstock.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

[Akin Note: Many clean fuels producers were hoping to be able to generate multiples of the statutory credit rate as a result of their fuel having negative emissions rates. This change eliminates this possibility, which had previously been implied by other statutory language that contemplated negative emissions rates.]

FEEDSTOCK SOURCING: Requires feedstock to be produced or grown exclusively in the United Stated, Mexico or Canada.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

Disallows any feedstock sources that already generated a 45Z credit but includes a directive to Treasury to issue regulations or guidance to implement this anti-double counting rule.

RELATED PARTY SALES: Directs Treasury to expand the rule allowing sales between related parties prior to a sale to an unrelated party.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL: Eliminates the increased credit rate of $1.75/gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but the standard $1.00/gallon rate remains available for SAF.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.

Applies to fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB), and to fuel sold or used before such date if claims for the § 6426(k) excise tax credit have not been paid or allowed as of such date.

3. Section 45Q (Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT RATES: Equalizes the credit rate for all potential disposal pathways (g., EOR, secure geologic storage and utilization) to $17/MT (indexed for inflation after 2026).

Rate is $36/MT for direct air capture.

Applies to facilities PIS after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after the date of the enactment of OBBB).

4. Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

SALE OF INTEGRATED COMPONENTS: No credit for the sale of integrated components unless certain requirements are satisfied.

Applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

To the extent an eligible component (called a “primary component”) is incorporated into another eligible component (called a “secondary component”) prior to sale to an unrelated person, a 45X credit is allowed with respect to the primary component only if:

The secondary component is produced in the same manufacturing facility as the primary component; and

At least 65% of the total direct material costs of the secondary component are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States.

PHASEOUT FOR WIND ENERGY COMPONENTS: Wind energy components, sold after December 31, 2027, no longer generate a 45X credit.

PHASEOUT FOR CRITICAL MINERALS: Adds a phaseout for applicable critical minerals produced after 2030 based on timing of production.

ADDITION OF METALLURGICAL COAL: Metallurgical coal added as an applicable critical mineral.

Defined as “metallurgical coal which is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the notice published by the Department of Energy entitled ‘Critical Material list; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking’ (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))), regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.”

Generates credit at a special rate of 2.5% of costs (as opposed to 10% for other critical minerals).

Applies only to metallurgical coal produced before December 31, 2029.

REVISED DEFINITION OF BATTERY MODULE: Definition of “battery module” is updated to include a requirement for the module to include “all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.”

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., taxable years beginning after the enactment of OBBB).

5. Section 45U (Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT TERMINATION: Terminates credit for electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2032.

6. Terminated Credits and Deductions

SECTION 45V (CLEAN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT): The deadline for beginning construction under §45V is moved up to December 31, 2027 (instead of December 31, 2032).

EV RELATED CREDITS: Credits for EVs and EV charging property are eliminated.

The deadlines for acquiring an eligible vehicle under §§ 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit), 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), and 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit) are moved up to September 30, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

The deadline for PIS under § 30C (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property) is moved up to June 30, 2026 (instead of December 31, 2032).

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.

The PIS deadline for residential clean energy property under § 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit) of December 31, 2034, is replaced with a deadline for incurring expenditures of December 31, 2025.

The deadline for PIS for energy efficiency improvements, residential energy property expenditures and home energy audits under § 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) is December 31, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

REPEAL OF 5-YEAR MACRS: Removes the ability to utilize 5-year MACRS schedules under § 168 for “energy property” described in § 48.

Property eligible for a credit under §§ 45Y and 48E would remain eligible for 5-year MACRS.

ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS DEDUCTION: Deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings is eliminated by adding a new BOC deadline of June 30, 2026.

For purposes of this definition, “control” means, (i) in the case of a corporation, ownership (by vote or value) of more than 50% of the stock of such corporation, (ii) in the case of a partnership, ownership of more than 50% of the profits interests or capital interests in such partnership, or (iii) in any other case, ownership of more than 50% of the beneficial interests in the entity.

For purposes of this definition, “covered nation” has the same meaning given such term under 10 U.S.C. 4872(f)(2) (i.e., means the Democratic People’s republic of North Korea, the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the Islamic Republic of Iran).

FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITY (“FIE”):

Other than certain publicly traded entities, an entity with respect to which, during the taxable year,

A specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer of such entity,

“Covered Officer” means, with respect to an entity: (i) a member of the board of directors, board of supervisors, or equivalent governing body; (ii) an executive-level officer, including the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, or senior vice president; or (iii) an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or members described in the foregoing bullets.

Which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity (or an entity related to such specified foreign entity) to exercise effective control over:

Any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), or

With respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (i) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (ii) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

The term “taxpayer” for purposes of the FIE rules includes any person related to the taxpayer.

ATTRIBUTION RULE: For purposes of the definition of a PFE (and the subsidiary definitions), ownership is determined by taking into account the attribution rules under § 318(a)(2) for purposes of determining ownership of stock in a corporation and with similar principles being applied for non-corporate entities.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL:

“Effective Control” means one or more agreements or arrangements similar to those described in the following bullets (relating to determination prior to the issuance of guidance and licensing arrangements) which provide one or more contractual counterparties of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held which are described in the definition of “foreign-influenced entity”.

During any period prior to the date that guidance has been issued by Treasury, the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to:

Determine the quantity determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;

Determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer or the storage of electrical energy in energy storage technology of the taxpayer;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer that produces eligible components;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer;

Restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty; or

With respect to a licensing agreement for the provision of intellectual property (or any other contract, agreement or other arrangement entered into with a contractual counterparty related to such licensing agreement) with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible component:

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to specify or otherwise direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized in a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct the operation of any qualified facility, any energy storage technology, or any production unit that produces an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to limit the taxpayer’s utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar agreement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions thereof);

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions thereof);

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or a specified foreign entity; or

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

BEGINNING OF CONSTRUCTION (BOC):

Generally, determined pursuant to rules similar to rules under IRS Notice 2013-29 and IRS Notice 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.

Treasury is directed to prescribed regulations and guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent circumvention of the subparagraph relating to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, including the prevention of any evasion with respect to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio “where the fact demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.”

2. Credit Disallowance

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITIES AND FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITIES: Prevents “Specified Foreign Entities” and “Foreign-Influenced Entities” from claiming the credit.

SFE restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

Credits Impacted: §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Z, 45Q, 45X, and 45U.

FIE restriction applies to:

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB) for §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Q, and 45X.

“Effective Control” is carved out from the FIE restriction for §§ 45Y, 48E and 45X.

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 for §§ 45Z and 45U.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL: Prevents taxpayers subject to “effective control” by a “specified foreign entity” for a given taxable year from claiming credits if the effective control determination was made with respect to a qualified facility, an energy storage technology, or an eligible component (as applicable).

Applies to §§ 45Y, 48E, and 45X for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., enactment of the OBBB).

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Credits under §§ 45X ,45Y and 48E are disallowed if the taxpayer receives material assistance from a PFE.

Applies to facilities that BOC after December 31, 2025, for §§ 45Y and 48E.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, for § 45X.

Determination of whether the taxpay received “material assistance” is discussed below in Section II.3.

APPLICABLE PAYMENTS: For any ITC allowed in a taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 (i.e., after two years following the enactment of OBBB), recapture of 100% of any allowed ITC is required if an “applicable payment” (defined by cross-reference to payments that trigger “effective control”) is made to a “Prohibited Foreign Entity” within 10-years of placement in service of the facility.

3. Material Assistance

CALCULATION OF RATIO: Requires calculation of a percentage, the numerator of which is direct costs not attributable to PFEs and the denominator of which is all direct costs.

For Qualifying Facilities and Energy Storage Technologies under §§ 45Y and 48E, the calculation focuses on Manufactured Products (including components) and can be expressed as:

For eligible components under § 45X, the calculation focuses on direct material costs related to the production of eligible components and can be expressed as:

QUALIFIED FACILITIES AND ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY (§45Y/§48E): Requires an increasing amount of a facility’s manufactured products NOT to be manufactured by PFEs based on the beginning of construction date of the qualified facility or energy storage technology. This calculation is called the “Material Assistance Cost Ratio”.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

Material Assistance Cost Ratio calculations include qualified interconnection property (as defined in §48E(b)(4)).

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Qualified Facilities:

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Energy Storage Technology:

ELIGIBLE COMPONENTS (§45X): Requires an increasing amount of an eligible component’s direct material costs NOT to be mined, produced, or manufactured by PFEs based on the year the eligible component is sold.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.i after the enactment of OBBB).

Solar Energy Components:

Wind Energy Components:

Battery Components:

Critical Minerals*:

*Subject to increase by Treasury no later than December 31, 2027, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs and national security concerns

GUIDANCE ON CALCULATION: Prior to promulgation of new guidance from Treasury (required by December 31, 2026), for purposes of calculating the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, the statute permits reliance on:

IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to certain safe harbors for domestic content adder calculations), but scope of such reliance is not yet clear; and

[Akin Note: This guidance only applies to §§ 45Y and 48E projects, and thus there is no current guidance for calculation of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio in the context of § 45X credits. Further, it is also not clear the extent to which IRS Notice 2025-08 may be relied upon for these purposes. For example, it is not clear whether the universe of manufactured products that must be tested limited to the manufactured products and components thereof identified in IRS Notice 2025-08 or whether “production costs” can be included if all of the MPCs for an APCs are not manufactured by a PFE.]

Supplier certifications are required to be made in a manner consistent with Treas. Reg. § 1.45X-4(c)(4)(i) and contain:

the supplier’s EIN or similar identification number issued by a foreign government;

be signed under penalties of perjury;

be retained by the supplier and the taxpayer for a period of not less than six years and provided to the IRS upon request; and

be made from the supplier from which the taxpayer purchased any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents stating:

One Saturday morning in May 2025 in the city of Melaka, volunteers in green T-shirts rushed over as Ms Adibah Rahim and her husband drove into the central square, eager to unpack, weigh and register her consignment of used cooking oil (UCO) – the “liquid gold” in European and Asian plans to ramp up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ms Rahim, a housewife, told The Straits Times it was her first time selling used oil, which she had collected over five to six months. She left the collection point RM90 (S$27) richer: At RM3 per liter of oil, it is a welcome boost to her family’s household budget.

“We usually collect UCO from around 200 members of the public,” said Mr Michael Andrew, sales manager for Evergreen Oil & Feed, the company running the Melaka collection with the local council. Evergreen, which runs similar collection drives elsewhere in Malaysia, supplies leading European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell and Finland’s Neste, the operator of SAF refineries in Europe and Singapore.

READ: Southeast Asia seen to boost green aviation fuel industry

The aviation industry and many governments, including Singapore’s, are pinning their hopes on SAF as a way to cut the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are set to increase as demand for flying grows.

And fuel suppliers around the world are scrambling for raw materials to meet new legal SAF blending quotas in Europe and growing demand elsewhere.

When it is made from waste such as UCO, rather than agricultural commodities such as soya or palm oil, SAF purportedly has up to 80 per cent less planet-heating emissions than kerosene jet fuel. And repurposing waste cooking oil avoids using land that would otherwise be used for food crops, or fuelling forest destruction.

But behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks – raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

READ: PH wants partnership with Norway on sustainable aviation fuel

The concern is that barely used and virgin palm oil – the latter is not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO that traders supply to fuel companies, experts and industry operators said.

The investigation focused on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, the EU’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers – oil and gas giant Repsol.

The investigation was funded by Journalismfund Europe.

Fried in Spain?

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Repsol chief executive Josu Jon Imaz held up his company’s new €250 million (S$369 million) plant for renewable fuels, including SAF, near the historic Spanish port town of Cartagena as an example of how Europe can pursue a fair green transition.

Repsol, which aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, started large-scale production of biodiesel and jet fuel – with its SAF mainly made from UCO – at the plant early in 2024.

Contrasting this with electric vehicles, many of them imported from China, Dr Imaz said the raw material for Repsol’s renewable fuels “comes from the Spanish farms and from the Spanish rural economy”.

In a promotional video for those fuels, Spanish celebrity chef Susi Diaz is seen dispensing advice to young cooks in the kitchen of her La Finca restaurant. Olive oil is then poured out of a pan into steel jugs as a voiceover explains how the waste cooking residue will be sent to the Repsol biofuel refinery.

The company is also promoting the recycling of UCO from Spanish households – of which it says only 5 per cent is currently collected – at its fuel stations across the country.

Spain’s restaurants and homes, however, are not the main source of Repsol’s UCO.

In 2024, more than 126,000 tonnes of UCO from Asia – enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools – arrived in the Spanish region of Murcia, where Repsol’s flagship biofuel plant is located, according to trade data published by Spain’s tax agency.

Nearly two-thirds came from Malaysia, whose UCO exports to the region saw a tenfold rise in the same year that the energy heavyweight fired up its Cartagena SAF refinery.

The figures do not specify who provided or bought the raw material. But trade data shows that Repsol purchased at least 53,000 tonnes of UCO from five Malaysian companies, including Evergreen Oil & Feed, in 2024. That amount represents 18 percent of the UCO the Repsol plant in Cartagena uses annually.

This is based on an analysis of Customs records provided by investigative consultancy Data Desk, which provided Climate Home News with a list of shipments of UCO certified for the European market, sourced from Malaysia by Repsol’s trading unit in Singapore.

No incidents of fraudulent UCO were detected in Repsol’s supply chain, with imports meeting EU rules on green certification.

Repsol told Climate Home News it “complements with imports when necessary” and receives raw material shipments from more than 20 countries. It declined to provide more details about the imports for “competitive reasons”.

Repsol’s heavy reliance on Malaysian supplies exposes it to fraud risks that raise wider questions about global assertions over the sustainability of SAF.

Asked what steps it takes to fight fraud, Repsol said it operates a rigorous supplier monitoring system to ensure the sustainability and integrity of its SAF production. A “very strong” compliance process means dubious raw materials and suppliers suspected of misconduct are quickly weeded out, it added.

“Any type of fraud distorts the market and undermines the confidence in the system, so it must be fought with all possible legal means,” the company said in e-mailed comments.

Shrinking air travel’s carbon footprint

Europe’s green aviation fuel refineries are boosting output because of new requirements by the EU for planes to use more SAF in the coming decades. From the start of 2025, fuel supplied to airports across Europe needs to contain at least 2 percent of SAF, with targets rising to 70 percent by 2050.

A million tonnes of SAF is needed to hit the EU’s 2025 mandate, and this will rise to 2.7 million tonnes a year by 2030 to meet the 6 per cent mandate.

SAF is crucial for shrinking aviation’s carbon footprint, according to industry body the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and is expected to account for 65 per cent of emissions reductions by 2050, when the sector has committed to reaching net zero.

In 2023, emissions from international plane travel accounted for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions. As air travel increases, and other sectors are more easily able to decarbonize, that share is set to grow.

One of the reasons SAF is so attractive is that it is a drop-in fuel for planes, requiring no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Repsol’s Dr Imaz told financial analysts early in 2024 that emissions-cutting alternatives to SAF – such as restricting short-haul flights – would represent “a drop in the ocean”.

Repsol’s plant uses 300,000 tonnes of UCO to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable fuels, including SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil.

But surging demand for UCO, SAF’s feedstock of choice, and a far-from-perfect global certification system based on self-declaration at the start of the supply chain are encouraging fraud that undermines the new fuel’s green credentials.

‘Ridiculous’ export statistics

This investigation found that by the time Asia-based traders ship UCO supplies overseas to refineries for processing into SAF, guaranteeing their environmental integrity is virtually impossible – despite the certification system on which fuel companies and airlines rely.

A source at a leading Malaysian UCO supplier to companies including Repsol told ST that he suspects that both UCO collectors and restaurants are committing fraud by providing oil that does not qualify as used, although it is difficult to prove.

In Malaysia, which is among the world’s leading suppliers of UCO and virgin palm oil, government-subsidized cooking oil is cheaper than UCO – providing a clear incentive for fraud. Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.

In a 2024 report, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) cited figures showing that Malaysia already exports about three times as much UCO as it is estimated to collect domestically and import, raising concern about where that oil is coming from – and what it consists of.

In 2023, 458,000 tonnes of UCO originating in Malaysia were registered with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), the leading certification scheme recognized by the European Commission to demonstrate compliance with its biofuel sustainability criteria.

In absolute terms, that puts Malaysia second only to China, which registered 1.65 million tonnes. Malaysia’s UCO volume, if indeed collected from its population, works out to 15.2 litres per person – the highest worldwide by far.

This figure is “ridiculous”, said Mr Cian Delaney, campaign coordinator at T&E, adding that for it to be feasible, Malaysia would need to be “a world-leading collection and refining system – which it isn’t”.

In comparison, China collected 1.4 liters per capita, while the figure is 0.9 liter in Indonesia and 3.8 litres in Spain.

Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin has previously acknowledged there is fraud in the country’s UCO supply chain. He told Reuters in February 2025 that the government would crack down on this to uphold the country’s “reputation as a responsible exporter”.

In a response to questions from ST, he said: “To maintain supply chain integrity, various measures are in place, including traceability systems, certification requirements, and stringent export documentation. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board, in collaboration with other regulatory bodies, is actively monitoring the industry to prevent fraudulent activities.”

He also said the government was strengthening enforcement mechanisms to uphold industry credibility.

Opaque supply chain

The waste ingredients from which SAF is made change hands multiple times in a largely opaque system. To verify their sustainability, European regulators rely on checks by private auditors and agencies that issue green certificates based on their findings.

But there is a systemic blind spot: The restaurants, street stalls, households and factories from which the UCO is pooled self-declare the origin of their contributions. Aside from ad hoc spot checks and sampling, there is no way of knowing that all of these providers are telling the truth.

“The opportunity… of fraud is very high,” said Mr Vasu R. Vasuthewan, former Malaysia head for the ISCC.

The Malaysian authorities recently uncovered criminal syndicates that had pocketed thousands of dollars a day by getting hold of large amounts of subsidized cooking oil, mixing it in with UCO, and then selling it on to industrial UCO traders.

Sources within the industry told Climate Home News and ST that many households and restaurants are motivated to replace cooking oil after a single use – contrary to the standard practice of three to five times – and then sell it on as UCO. Cooking oil is considered waste when it is no longer fit for frying.

“Restaurant compliance (with sustainability standards) may be very low,” said Mr Vasuthewan, who now runs his own UCO import and export business. “Many will fake their declaration, hoping they won’t get caught.”

Mr Delaney of T&E said it is difficult for auditors to physically check the origin of the oil, since hundreds of restaurants can supply the same collection point, making it a “notable blind spot”.

Singapore, a global SAF hub in the making

Singapore is a key part of the global SAF supply chain and is positioning itself as a leader in the production and usage of such fuel. The Republic is home to the world’s largest SAF refinery by capacity: Neste’s biofuel refinery in Tuas. Its SAF production capacity is one million tonnes a year.

Government trade data shows that Singapore is a major importer of UCO from China and Malaysia; this is most likely for the Neste refinery. The Republic also has a licensing framework for local UCO collectors, who pick up UCO mainly from restaurants, hotels and commercial kitchens, with about 19,000 tonnes collected annually from 2021 to 2024, according to the National Environment Agency.

The Government regards SAF as a critical tool to reduce aviation emissions while allowing the industry to keep expanding and Changi Airport, one of the world’s busiest, to keep growing.

To ramp up SAF usage, from 2026, all flights departing Singapore’s two civilian airports must use 1 percent SAF. The goal is to reach 3 percent to 5 percent SAF use by 2030.

Fraud is a concern for the authorities and the industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) told ST that it recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and integrity in SAF feedstocks.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain. We share the same concerns as these pose risks to market confidence, fair trading and development of a nascent SAF market,” said CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

He said the authority is working with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection to develop “harmonised standards for feedstock verification to prevent further fraudulent practices”.

Neste told ST, in response to questions: “Neste sources traceable UCO and other renewable raw materials globally from carefully selected suppliers. Neste evaluates its suppliers and accepts renewable raw materials only from those suppliers that are able to meet strict criteria for sustainability.”

The Singapore Airlines Group said it works closely with its partners to ensure supplies meet internationally recognized standards such as the ISCC, and comply with regulatory requirements in jurisdictions with SAF mandates.

Spot checks, patchy audits

There is a system in place to keep fraudulent stocks out of the supply chain. Buyers and regulators in Europe rely on audit companies to trace the raw materials used in SAF and prove their green credentials.

Those audits are verified by authorised certification systems like the ISCC – which is led by the biofuel industry and, according to one source, enjoys “a kind of monopoly” in the sector. It then issues sustainability certificates to commodities traders and fuel suppliers.

According to the ISCC, its certification supports “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”.

While in some cases auditors conduct random field checks, that happens less often in countries outside the EU, industry experts say.

According to Mr James Cogan, compliance and markets lead at Irish biofuel firm ClonBio, it is far easier for fraud to occur outside the EU where “it’s much less visible to us”.

A 2024 analysis by T&E in China, for example, showed that sampling of points of origin happened in less than 10 per cent of the ISCC-approved audits, whereas in the EU, it was about 30 per cent.

Mr Adam Kirby, ISCC’s senior sustainability manager, told Climate Home News that auditors monitor volumes going in and out of collection points for any suspicious behaviour, in addition to carrying out spot checks. He added that the ISCC follows the requirements established by regulators like the European Commission.

In 2024, the ISCC also conducted 79 special “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. In a third of the cases, it found violations of its certification requirements, including an inability to demonstrate the traceability of products, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Long paper trail

Under the current system, the entire SAF supply chain relies on a long paper trail rooted in those self-declarations and sporadic inspections at the points where UCO is collected.

In Malaysia, Evergreen’s owner C.K. Lau told ST that the company follows the proper processes in its collection based on the requirements established by the ISCC. He added that the documentation is critical as, otherwise, the company would not be able to export its UCO.

Repsol, for its part, said it requires “suppliers to be certified under European Commission-recognized voluntary regimes”.

In turn, airline companies that buy from Repsol, such as the International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and Level – rely on documentation they get from it and other jet fuel providers, to show that the SAF they are paying for has green certification.

In exceptional cases, IAG has sent its own staff to carry out checks on the ground, as with a Shanghai-based Chinese supplier in 2024. It told Climate Home News the outcome of that audit – which included supply, record-keeping, environmental and health and safety standards – was “positive”.

Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry. “You’ll see a race to the top… on sustainability, and it will, in a way, be self-regulated,” he added.

SAF certification faces EU scrutiny

In the meantime, following a string of fraud allegations about the authenticity of UCO-derived biofuels imported from China, the EU has been trying to ascertain whether the certification system that governments and businesses rely on is fit for purpose.

The EU authorities have been in talks to strengthen that system, leading to speculation that the ISCC could be suspended for failing to catch cases of biodiesel fraud. The ISCC denied in a statement that regulators had considered halting automatic EU-wide acceptance of its certificates, adding that its relationship with the European Commission remained constructive.

“There are always bad actors, there are always bad people, and there’s only a certain amount of policing that can be done in any industry,” said Mr Kirby. “We at ISCC have done, I think, an incredible job.”

The ISCC did not respond to follow-up questions from Climate Home News on whether it has full confidence in the current system, including self-declaration.

A European Commission spokeswoman said the bloc’s executive arm was closely monitoring the SAF market “to detect and prevent fraud, which risks undermining the EU’s ambition to effectively decarbonise air transport”.

Demand for UCO sizzles

Demand for SAF and UCO is only expected to increase as usage in Europe, Asia and elsewhere grows and as new refineries are completed in China, South Korea and Malaysia.

In 2024, Malaysia’s state energy firm Petronas, Italy’s Enilive, and Euglena of Japan announced they would develop a biorefinery at Petronas’ Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor. Due for completion in 2028, it would produce SAF and other biofuels.

Malaysia plans to mandate SAF usage by 2027, with the initial goal of blending it into aviation fuel at a 1 per cent rate.

Leading European refiners like Repsol are pushing for a level global playing field as well as more public funding to bring down costs and help develop the nascent sector on the continent.

Iata warned earlier in June that the European mandates had caused the SAF price paid by airlines to double because of hefty compliance fees being charged by producers.

Repsol’s aviation head Carlos Suarez Cubillo warned that fuel producers in parts of the world with laxer rules could produce SAF “with less regulation and less control of the feedstock… and here in Europe that could de-incentivise the production, the construction of new facilities”.

In Brazil, for example, an emerging SAF industry is gearing up to use crop-based feedstocks that are commonly linked to deforestation – and are therefore banned in Europe – such as soya and palm oil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol, which has been linked to labour abuses and modern slavery.

An investigation by Climate Home News’ partner in Brazil, InfoAmazonia, found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region – billed as Brazil’s first SAF project – is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

Iata hopes its efforts to put in place a global registry for SAF, launched in April as a voluntary initiative, will boost transparency around feedstocks and their greenhouse gas savings – and enable airlines to have some level of visibility and comparability between countries, fuel providers and airports.

SAF producers and airlines are also looking to other waste-based materials to meet rising mandates – especially as more advanced fuels made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, known as e-SAF, are still being developed and tested.

Repsol, for example, recently closed a deal with US vegetable oils giant Bunge to source camelina and safflower – non-food crops that can grow on poor land – to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil for biodiesel and SAF.

In January, it also announced it would invest more than €800 million in Europe’s first plant in the Catalan city of Tarragona to produce renewable methanol from organic urban waste, for use in maritime, road and aviation transport from 2029.

But in the meantime, Europe’s overwhelming reliance on UCO means it will continue to import supplies from Asia – despite the concerns over fraud, said Ms Sophie Byron, global head of biofuels pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“That trade flow is not going away any time soon,” she said. /dl",https://globalnation.inquirer.net/files/2025/07/bf363599bb4b95835d1058df082bbdc39e2450d9730aed9912858986ccc73a65.jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 23:02:18.496132

This new financing model unlocks developer access to DEVCAP with lender repayment guarantee that eliminates perceived investor risk for pre-construction funding.

SEATTLE, July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels (NWABF), the developer of one of the United States' largest woody biomass sustainable synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) facilities, announced today a breakthrough financing structure that removes a long-standing barrier in the renewables industry in the United States: access to Engineering Services Development Capital (DEVCAP). This monumental pathway will allow for widescale use of nationally and internationally mandated Sustainable Synthetic Aviation Fuel (SAF) by airlines who fly across the globe.

Historically, major infrastructure and institutional investment funds have been prohibited by their charters from funding DEVCAP, leaving dozens of renewable infrastructure projects whose purpose is to create SAF for airlines on hold. To address this, NWABF has partnered with a global insurance underwriter to create an insurance-backed repayment guarantee that completely de-risks pre-construction working capital.

Under this structure, the investor or lender is named as the insured party and beneficiary and is insured against all defaults of principal and interest payments from the borrower. thereby removing 100% of the risk for financiers.

""This solution was born from our own roadblocks,"" said Dave Smoot, Managing Partner and Founder of Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels. ""Despite having one of the industry's strongest offtake agreements, from one of the industry's strongest airlines, top-tier engineering and technology partners, commitments for the project's required feedstock and the best site available in the Pacific Northwest, securing DEVCAP funding has been a challenge due to legacy financing policies. Now, with this insurance-backed guarantee, similar in nature to Corporate Surety Bonds currently and readily available in Europe and Asia, we're opening the door for all developers across the SAF and renewable energy industry. Someone had to do it.""

This financial breakthrough will lead to a variety of benefits for not just companies in need of DEVCAP across the nation, but also airline partners who will use NWABF's earth-friendly SAF and the state of Washington where thousands of jobs will be created.

What This Means for Airlines

""With this insurance-backed guarantee, similar in nature to Corporate Surety Bonds currently and readily available in Europe and Asia, we're opening the door for all developers across the SAF and renewable energy industry,"" said Dave Smoot, Founder of Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels.

New environmentally friendly regulations are requiring the airline industry to use 10% of SAF by 2029, and 100% by 2050. Once fully operational in 2029, NWABF will be producing 60+ million gallons of SAF that will allow its airline partner to decrease CO₂ emissions by up to 80% as they fly across the globe. Purchase agreements with companies like NWABF will also allow equity access to fuel supply as opposed to reliance on a volatile oil market.

What This Means for the Environment

""There is currently woody biomass and waste at up to 4-feet tall across much of the forests in Washington,"" said Smoot. ""We will be providing the outlet for clearing this out by the tons to use for creation of our SAF"". With wood leaking methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere this alone will be of great benefit to the environment through NWABF's production and manufacturing of SAF.

What This Means for the State of Washington

""We will create approximately 2,000 Jobs during construction, in addition to 200+ full-time positions as well as ancillary jobs (such as agriculture, waste collection and transport, housing, hotels and restaurants) as a result of this facility on the Columbia River,"" said Smoot. NWABF also plans to create feed stock preparation sites that will employ dozens of other Washington State residents.

NWABF is currently raising funds for its Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) Study, while concurrently developing a state-of-the-art SAF production facility along the Columbia River in Washington State, using woody biomass waste as feedstock. The site is currently being secured under a long-term lease agreement and the feedstock providers have agreed to execute long-term supply contracts. The project boasts a long-term offtake agreement with a prominent U.S. airline and is scheduled to begin production in 2029, once construction is completed, and will produce over 60+ million gallons of SAF per year.

""This structure provides a scalable financing solution for developers in SAF, biofuels and clean infrastructure sectors. It's a powerful tool that can unlock billions of dollars in delayed projects, and benefits many of the airlines who currently can't find this fuel, for use now and in the future,"" said Smoot. ""Our CFO, Bernie Asher, and the Insurance Representative have done a wonderful job road mapping a solution to this outdated industry paradigm, creating a winning solution that will benefit many project developers, technology and engineering companies, feedstock suppliers, barge companies, local communities, etc.""

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step toward carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Illinois engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering in the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural & biological engineering in the Grainger College of Engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

“There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.”

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Illinois, the researchers used HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab.

“Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

“We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

“There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.” Yang said. “I’m optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.”

Hydrogen (H2) offers significant potential as a sustainable fuel, with anticipated zero to low carbon emissions. This study develops a methodological framework that integrates on-site electrolytic H2 production, storage, and transportation for airport applications. For the first time, the techno-economic feasibility of supplying clean liquid hydrogen (LH2) to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to support its transition toward sustainable operations by 2050 is comprehensively analyzed. The results underscore the critical role of integrating long-term H2 storage and short-term battery storage solutions to establish a reliable, self-sustained microgrid system at LAX. The estimated levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) ranges from $6.77 to $7.10 per kilogram of H2 in 2030, decreasing significantly to approximately $3.78 per kilogram of H2 by 2050, showing the viability of deploying clean H2 at LAX. Additionally, this study, for the first time, quantifies the global warming potential (GWP) of clean H2 supply pathways for airport applications, revealing a range of 0.29 to 0.35 kg CO2-eq/kg H2 by 2050, with H2 venting from electrolysis identified as the dominant contributor. The findings emphasize the feasibility of H2 as a sustainable aviation fuel and provide actionable strategies for its implementation at LAX. This work advances the hydrogen aviation field by bridging the gap between the general clean H2 supply chain strategies and the specific needs of the aviation sector, thereby contributing to California's ambitious climate goals. Future research is recommended to address limitations in cost optimization, lifecycle impacts, policy incentives, and safety innovations, enabling the scalable and practical implementation of H2 as a sustainable aviation fuel at airports.",Not Available,https://escholarship.org/images/escholarship-facebook2.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 21:59:39.088586

It’s gonna take time

Whole lot of precious time

It’s gonna take patience and time, mmm

To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it, to do it

To do it right, child

Two stories, in particular, show why some SAF projects quietly advance while others stall in the valley of good intentions.

Over at Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels

First, the team at Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels (NWABF) has unveiled what may be the most consequential SAF financing innovation in years: an insurance-backed guarantee to de-risk the engineering development capital (DEVCAP) phase that has kept so many renewable fuel ventures from getting off the launch pad. It sounds arcane, but it’s foundational.

For decades, major infrastructure lenders have been prohibited from funding pre-construction engineering and design. Projects would get tantalizingly close to reality—feedstock secured, offtake agreements inked, sites selected—but they’d stall for want of the working capital needed to finalize engineering and secure final investment decisions. NWABF, in classic Pacific Northwest style, didn’t make a lot of noise about it. They just worked the problem.

The company partnered with a global insurance underwriter to create a repayment guarantee instrument that effectively eliminates default risk for DEVCAP financiers. Lenders can now fund early engineering work with confidence that if something goes wrong, their principal and interest are insured. The implications are enormous: billions of dollars of delayed SAF projects—some languishing for years—can now clear the runway.

As NWABF’s Dave Smoot put it, “Someone had to do it.”.

This is the kind of GTESI-inflected persistence that matters. When you look across decades of advanced biofuels, you find that it’s not necessarily the most glamorous technologies that survive. It’s the teams that align incentives for all stakeholders. In this case, NWABF aligned risk tolerance, return expectations, and policy mandates into a coherent financing architecture.

Contrast that to projects that have faltered. Too often, companies expect financiers to bear outsized technical and regulatory risks without meaningful protection, or they fail to anticipate the timing mismatch between capital cycles and policy incentives. That’s when you see the press releases fade, the websites stop updating, and the same projects resurface five years later with a new logo and the same structural weaknesses.

Over at Avalon

Consider the Avalon project in Uruguay. If it feels like déjà vu, it’s because Camelina has been on the radar a long time. Back in March 2010, our team published a comprehensive report titled Camelina Aviation Biofuels: Market Opportunity and Renewable Energy Report. Even then, Camelina was identified as an oilseed crop from the mustard family that thrives in semi-arid temperate regions, possessing numerous traits that made it a high-potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

The promise was real:

Camelina proved in yield trials to be a hardy, low-input crop, requiring far less fertilizer and irrigation than soybeans or canola.

It performed well on marginal land, germinated in near-freezing temperatures, and offered agronomic benefits as a rotation crop.

Lifecycle modeling estimated GHG reductions of 75% or more versus petroleum—a figure that has largely held up.

Yet the report also underscored challenges rarely acknowledged in headlines:

Camelina was “relatively novel” in North America, with limited breeding and no large-scale seed supply chains.

Crushing and refining capacity simply didn’t exist at the necessary scale; capital costs for drop-in jet fuel far exceeded those of biodiesel.

Even as field trials expanded across more than a dozen states, contracts and guaranteed offtake commitments lagged behind.

The report concluded that “millions of acres of Camelina, and 100 million gallons per year of Camelina fuel, is still years away.”

In other words, you can’t skip the developmental rhythm. It takes time to scale seed genetics, prove yields, and build the logistics backbone. Rushing the oven doesn’t help. As any baker knows, turning up the heat just scorches the crust and leaves the middle raw.

All of this context is why Avalon’s work today is so significant. It isn’t just a fresh licensing agreement—it’s the culmination of fifteen years of patient progress: breeding improvements, policy development, and supply-chain experiments that laid the groundwork for this moment.

It also highlights a broader lesson running through both Avalon and NWABF’s projects. Whether it’s a novel financing structure to unlock engineering capital, or a new technology platform to process Camelina oil efficiently, success has required a willingness to do the quiet, unglamorous work for as long as it takes.

Looking at these projects through the GTESI persistence lens

In a GTESI frame, it’s a classic example of evolutionary persistence. While hype cycles around algae and miscanthus came and went, Camelina retained a clear value proposition: a low-carbon oilseed that could be grown without displacing food crops. Now, with Sulzer’s BioFlux technology—a proprietary liquid-full reactor that optimizes hydrogenation without vapor recirculation—the process economics have finally matured into something bankable.

It’s worth underscoring that this isn’t merely an incremental tweak. BioFlux significantly improves yield, extends catalyst life, and cuts costs. That’s how you get from “promising pilot” to real project finance.

And again, it circles back to the song refrain:

It’s gonna take patience and time to do it right.

Consider the through-line between NWABF and Avalon. Both teams recognized that no amount of technology hype can paper over weak fundamentals. You need feedstock security, robust engineering, de-risked financing, and credible offtake. You need alignment across growers, processors, airlines, and investors—and the humility to keep building while the spotlight drifts elsewhere.

If there’s a cautionary note this week, it comes in the proliferation of partial measures and symbolic gestures. We’re seeing airlines adopt tiny SAF blends—1% here, 2% there—and while every molecule matters, the question remains: what’s the pathway to 10%, 50%, or 100%?

The same goes for carbon capture pilots at airports and domestic SAF supply announcements. These are good steps, but the industry must guard against the illusion of progress. When partial measures get over-celebrated, they risk crowding out the full-stack efforts that can actually scale.

So how do you tell the difference? Which SAF efforts will persist and reshape the industry, and which will fade into footnotes?

GTESI suggests four questions worth asking:

Is the feedstock strategy resilient and scalable? Camelina, woody biomass, waste oils—these are credible, proven resources.

Is the process technology mature and differentiated? BioFlux is a great example of how core innovation can unlock cost and yield advantages.

Is the financing architecture robust? NWABF’s insurance-backed DEVCAP model removes a structural bottleneck.

Is there a clear path to offtake at meaningful volumes? Without buyers committing long-term, everything else is theory.

When you find projects answering all four, pay attention. That’s where persistence lives.

If this week proves anything, it’s that the path to sustainable aviation fuel is a slow train coming—but it is coming. Whether in the forests of Washington, the fields of Uruguay, or the labs in Dublin, the pattern holds:

It’s gonna take money.

And patience.

And time.

But when all three line up, the industry moves forward. No amount of hype can substitute for that alignment.",,N,,2025-07-08 18:06:31.669670

The company announced a multi-year service agreement with China Airlines and reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance. Investors are optimistic about continued growth in service revenue and pricing momentum ahead of the company's second-quarter earnings report.

GE Aerospace Inc. (GE) has experienced a significant stock performance boost this year, climbing over 46% year-to-date. The robust growth can be attributed to several factors, including strong aerospace demand, operational efficiency gains, and tariff-driven pricing strategies. The company's stock is currently trading near $244, well above its 50-day moving average of around $235, and approaching its 52-week high of $260.55 [1].

A key development contributing to this performance was the announcement of a multi-year service, repair, and overhaul (MRO) agreement with China Airlines. This agreement covers GE9X engines for China Airlines' 14 Boeing 777X aircraft, reinforcing a partnership that dates back to 1999. The GE9X engine, known for its 10% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor and full compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), has been a significant driver of the company's growth [3].

In the first quarter of 2025, GE Aerospace reported strong results, with revenue rising 11% year over year to $9.94 billion. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 60% to $1.49, beating the consensus estimate of $1.26. The company reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, forecasting low double-digit revenue growth and EPS between $5.10 and $5.45 [1].

The market is looking ahead to GE Aerospace’s second-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating continued growth in service revenue and further pricing momentum tied to tariff pass-throughs. In June, RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating on GE Aerospace and raised its price forecast to $275 [1].

For broader exposure to the sector, investors may consider the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) and Gabelli Commercial Aerospace & Defense ETF (GCAD) [1].
