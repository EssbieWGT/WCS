California’s energy system is evolving, and the EV mandate is gone.","California’s leaders spent years promising an expedited break from fossil fuels, but the state is discovering a hard truth: gasoline and diesel still underpin day-to-day life, and California will keep relying on oil even as it builds out alternatives. Thirteen refineries remain in operation today, with only a shrinking subset still making California-specific gasoline, and policymakers are now quietly adjusting to keep fuel flowing and prices from spiking further. The politics may be loud, but the math is louder. California cannot phase out refineries faster than it can replace their output without triggering volatility at the pump, supply risks, and serious economic fallout.

For decades, refinery capacity has consolidated while demand shocks and environmental requirements have intensified California’s vulnerability to price spikes. The state had roughly 50 refineries in 1980; today, there are 13 operating refineries as of January 1, 2025, according to federal data, reflecting a structural decline even as California’s unique fuel standards keep supply tight and imports complicated. This consolidation means outages or conversions at a few large facilities can ripple through the market immediately, and it’s a major reason regulators and lawmakers are recalibrating their approach in 2025.

A turning point came as several Bay Area and Southern California plants exited petroleum gasoline production to focus on renewable fuels, led by the full conversion of Phillips 66’s Rodeo complex and the Marathon Martinez transition to renewable diesel. These moves were celebrated as climate wins, but they also reduced in-state gasoline production and increased dependence on gasoline imports tailored to California’s boutique blend. The net effect is a tighter market with less buffer, especially during maintenance or unexpected outages, and that raised alarm inside Sacramento about supply security.

By mid-to-late 2025, the state’s own energy officials acknowledged the risk of rapid refinery exits. A joint legislative oversight analysis documented conversions and announced closures, warning of near-term supply constraints and likely price increases as California imports more finished fuel and stabilizes in-state production to bridge the transition. Policymakers began to favor measures that keep existing refineries operating and maintain minimum inventories, not because the state is abandoning climate goals, but because it needs a managed glide path rather than a cliff.

The most visible policy reversal was the pause on implementing a refinery “excess profit” penalty. Initially touted as a landmark accountability tool, regulators delayed enforcement until 2030 after two large facilities representing a substantial share of capacity signaled shutdown plans. The California Energy Commission explicitly linked the pause to fuel reliability and consumer protection, underlining that a rushed punitive regime could accelerate exits and worsen price shocks before alternatives are ready at scale. It was a victory for practical reliability over rhetoric—and a recognition of how sensitive the fuel market has become.

Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration has also shifted posture toward industry engagement as gasoline prices remain a political and economic pressure point. Internal guidance and public remarks emphasized stabilizing the state’s gasoline supply, increasing fuel imports to make up for refinery closures, and supporting in-state production in legacy basins like Kern County to reduce volatility. The message to refiners has been blunt: California believes they can profitably operate here because demand will persist for years, even as the state accelerates clean energy buildout. That practical stance is now informing legislation and regulatory guidance.

Legislative action has followed the same arc. Lawmakers advanced measures to expand oil production approvals in the San Joaquin Valley and bolster fuel supply resilience to counter planned refinery closures. This is not a U-turn on climate policy; it’s an admission that an orderly transition requires a reliable supply and an industrial base capable of meeting residual demand while alternative fuels and infrastructure scale. Without that bridge, California risks importing more fuel from jurisdictions with weaker standards and losing high-wage industrial jobs and local tax revenue before replacement industries are ready.

California must have base load energy and gas or risk continuous rolling brownouts and blackouts. They can’t rely on solar and wind, as they can only support 18% of the state’s needs. Let’s hope other states are watching and do not follow California’s lead.

Even as petroleum production declines, refiners are not exiting energy altogether. Rodeo’s renewable conversion is now producing around 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel capability, while being partially powered by solar and using waste-based recycling. Marathon Martinez’s conversion followed a similar path after navigating lawsuits and environmental approvals, illustrating the complex, costly, and time-consuming reality of repurposing production. These projects prove transition is possible—but they also underscore why the state cannot afford supply holes while conversions come online.

Analysts warn of broader economic stakes in refinery reduction transition. The Bay Area’s refinery belt impacts thousands of jobs, municipal tax bases, and supply chains, and closures trigger cascading problems —from worker displacement to cleanup liabilities. Those risks explain why policymakers are now threading a needle: encouraging conversions and emissions reductions while maintaining enough petroleum capacity to prevent costly disruptions for consumers and businesses. That is the shape of California’s “managed transition” in 2025, and it’s more cautious than activists expected. The result could be disastrous if they follow the original plan.

So where does that leave the state and the 13 refineries? Regulators are easing off financial penalties that could cause abrupt shutdowns, expanding fuel options like higher-ethanol blends to cut prices, and coordinating with industry to ensure minimum inventories and smoother maintenance schedules. At the same time, California is approving conversions, enabling renewable diesel and oil production, and moving ahead on clean energy buildout. The signal is clear: keep the fossil backbone steady while the next-generation system ramps.

The political narrative—“battling Big Oil”—has met the operational reality of keeping 40 million residents and the world’s fifth-largest economy moving. California is not abandoning its climate trajectory, but it is recognizing the cost of moving faster than infrastructure, supply chains, and consumer adoption can support. The result is a wake-up call: partner with refineries to ensure stability, support conversions where feasible, and avoid creating a supply crunch that forces more expensive imports and higher costs to drivers. That is why California will keep fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.

The bottom line is that Governor Gavin Newsom is on his way out, along with his bad ideas and policies that cripple Californians. California’s energy system is evolving, and the EV mandate is gone. Gasoline and diesel remain essential, and refineries—whether petroleum or renewable—are the industrial spine of that system across the USA. Managing that reality means fewer price shocks, stronger reliability, and lower gas prices.

Schneider Electric: The €250bn Electrification Opportunity

Electrification is widely regarded as the foundation for achieving climate ambitions and unlocking economic growth, energy security and industrial competitiveness.

However, Europe’s path to electrification remains sluggish, with current rates plateaued at just 21% – a figure unchanged in the past decade and trailing China’s rapid 31% electrification pace.

The disparity extends beyond progress to price – European households now pay around €0.27 (US$0.31) per kWh for energy, compared to €0.15 (US$0.17) in the US and just €0.08 (US$0.09) in China.

As a result, the everyday cost of living powered by electricity is roughly three times higher for EU citizens than for their Chinese counterparts.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/fd84f67f4447e90e1e05f789c6d6bf19:4a312156335db42642fcd0b873f7b49f/graphics-for-work-60.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 05:56:17.262384

Without new safeguards, proposals to enlarge airports including Heathrow and Gatwick could push the UK over its carbon budgets, according to a report from the cross-party Commons environmental audit committee.

The MPs said ministers must set out how they are going to meet climate, environment and biodiversity targets while pursuing significant airport expansion and before any of the projects break ground.

Their report found that government policies were insufficient to cut carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with targets. It said demand for air travel was expected to rise, further putting the reduction plans in “serious jeopardy”.

Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, have approved airport expansion in a desperate search for economic growth.

However, the committee said: “The government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to.”

The report also said ministers had ruled out measures to manage demand for aviation, such as limiting the number of flights. The MPs also warned that uptake of sustainable aviation fuel might not help cut emissions because it was not yet being used or produced on a commercial scale. Last year, Air New Zealand scrapped its 2030 decarbonisation target, blaming difficulties in securing sustainable fuel.

The expansion schemes are expected to start before the government updates its national policy statement on airports, released in 2018. The MPs said this meant the government was avoiding scrutiny and relying on “an outdated policy framework which is inconsistent with its objectives”.

Toby Perkins, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “Meeting our decarbonisation targets is already a major challenge. Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder. Under the government’s existing ‘jet zero’ strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.

“Having ruled out the kind of demand management measures likely to seriously reduce emissions, ministers need to make clear what alternative tools they are willing to use to ensure targets are met.”

Alethea Warrington, the head of aviation at the climate charity Possible, said: “This is the final nail in the coffin for the government’s case for airport expansion. The government’s scrutiny committee has made it clearer than ever that airport growth is a bad option for Britain, and that the government simply doesn’t have any economic evidence to justify the environmental devastation this would cause.

Valero’s renewable diesel segment, which also includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reported a loss for the period.

The ethanol segment reported $183 million in operating income for the third quarter, up from $153 million reported for the same period of last year. Valero primarily attributed the increase to higher ethanol and corn-related coproduct prices and increased production volumes, partially offset by higher corn prices and an increase in operating expenses.

Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.6 million gallons per day during the third quarter, achieving record production. Production volumes were up approximately 51,000 gallons per day when compared to the third quarter of 2024, according to Valero.

Ethanol production volumes for the first nine months of 2025 also averaged approximately 4.6 million gallons per day, up 54,000 gallons per day when compared to the same period of 2024.

Valero’s renewable diesel segment, which consists of the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, reported an operating loss of $28 million for the third quarter, compared to operating income of $35 million reported for the same period of last year. The company primarily attributed the decrease to higher feedstock costs and a decrease in sales volumes, which were partially offset by higher product prices, particularly for renewable diesel.

The renewable diesel segment reported $719 million in revenues from external customers for the third quarter, including $623 million for renewable diesel, $29 million for renewable naphtha and $67 million for neat SAF. Revenues from external customers for the same period of last year were at $632 million, including $610 million for renewable diesel and $22 million for renewable naphtha.

The report said the plans were likely to provide some economic growth, but how much was unclear, and the government had not provided supporting evidence.

The UK has legally binding targets to reduce its levels of planet-warming emissions, and contribute to the global goal of preventing average temperatures rising by more than 1.5C by 2050.

Above this temperature level, scientists anticipate significant impacts from global sea level rise, more extreme weather and impacts on agriculture.

To prevent temperatures increasing there is a limit to the amount of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, that the world can release, and the UK has set out its own share of these – known as carbon budgets.

On Wednesday, the Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told Parliament that Heathrow's expansion plans ""must align with our legal, environmental and climate commitments"".

Read the report [PDF]

The cross-party Environmental Audit Committee has delivered its verdict on the government’s plans to expand several airports, in its report published today on ‘Airport expansion and climate and nature targets’.

The Committee’s inquiry examined whether the government can deliver airport expansion and meet the environmental goals that it has signed up for.

Currently, government policies are insufficient to deliver a reduction in carbon emissions from the aviation sector in line with carbon budgets. Alongside an increase in demand, this puts the government’s delivery of net zero in serious jeopardy.

“Whilst it may be possible for the government to deliver airport expansion alongside its climate and environment targets, we are concerned that the proposed environmental impact from airport expansion will make such targets significantly more difficult to achieve and at much greater effort and cost,” the Committee says.

“Furthermore, the government has not demonstrated that the economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts it will lead to,” they add.

While expanding airport capacity is likely to provide some growth to the UK economy, MPs say the level of that growth is unclear and that the government has failed to provide substantial supporting evidence. Approving expansions already at Stansted, Luton and Gatwick suggests it is proceeding without the necessary evidence base to sufficiently underpin its economic arguments, the Committee says.

Ministers have ruled out measures to manage demand for aviation, such as limiting the number of fights available. MPs say that the government will need to demonstrate what alternative tools it will use instead, given that the Climate Change Committee cites demand management as one way to achieve environmental targets.

The Committee says the current Jet Zero Strategy relies on a far higher cost to industry to abate emissions than is currently seen and requires significant carbon savings to come from technology. These potentially carbon saving technologies, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) have not yet been seen on a commercial scale.

The Committee also raises its concern that ministers are proceeding with expansion before updating the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), originally produced in 2018. By doing so, MPs warn the Government is relying on “an outdated policy framework which is inconsistent with its objectives” and not allowing for proper scrutiny of expansion proposals against the new ANPS.

The government must set out whether it will be able to deliver on its climate, environment and biodiversity targets while pursuing significant airport expansion, MPs say. It must do so before or alongside publishing an updated Airports National Policy Statement and before any further substantial expansion projects are underway.

Chair comment

Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, Toby Perkins MP said:

“The aviation industry is critically important to the UK, but it’s also one of the hardest sectors of our economy to decarbonise. The government has made clear it is set on expanding airport capacity; the Committee has investigated how it can do that whilst meeting its own environmental targets.

Meeting our decarbonisation targets is already a major challenge. Expanding airport capacity is likely to make that task much harder. Under the government’s existing Jet Zero Strategy, expanding airport capacity is likely to put net zero at serious risk, unless it is accompanied by a serious strategic approach to increasing the pace of decarbonising aviation.

Having ruled out the kind of demand management measures likely to seriously reduce emissions, ministers need to make clear what alternative tools they are willing to use to ensure targets are met. New technological developments are promising and may in time provide an alternative route forward. But are they yet ready to be the basis for justifying this level of aviation expansion?

At the same time, the government is proposing to expand airport capacity because it will help to grow the economy. But Ministers were unable to point us to solid evidence setting out how much growth such expansion would deliver. If these plans are ever to get off the ground, it’s vital that the government provide us with some hard facts.

This problem can’t simply be outsourced to industry; the scale of the challenge is too great and only government has access to some of the tools needed. It’s time for the government to step up and take responsibility for its own targets. I’m concerned that the alternative is a lose-lose scenario that leaves a dynamic net zero economy out on the runway.”

Results of Operations:

Net income was $14.7 million, or $0.24 per average diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.10 for the second quarter of 2025, and $10.5 million, or $0.17 per average diluted common share for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted net income (2) was $13.0 million, or $0.21 per average diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2025. The annualized return on average assets was 1.05%, the annualized return on average equity was 8.37%, and the annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 11.14% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 0.47%, 3.68%, and 4.89%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2025, and 0.78%, 6.14%, and 8.27%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024. The adjusted annualized return on average assets (2) was 0.95%, the adjusted annualized return on average equity (2) was 7.45%, and the adjusted annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 9.92%, for the second quarter of 2025.

Net income was $32.7 million, or $0.53 per average diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2025. Adjusted net income (2) was $39.3 million, or $0.64 per average diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $29.9 million, or $0.49 per average diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2024. EPS increased 8% and adjusted EPS (2) increased 31% for the first nine months of 2025, compared to the first nine months of 2024. The annualized return on average assets was 0.79%, the annualized return on average equity was 6.29%, and the annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 8.38% for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 0.76%, 5.91%, and 7.98%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The adjusted annualized return on average assets (2) was 0.95%, the adjusted annualized return on average equity (2) was 7.55%, and the adjusted annualized return on average tangible common equity (2) was 10.06%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Total revenue, which is defined as net interest income before provision for credit losses on loans plus noninterest income, increased $2.2 million, or 5%, to $50.0 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $47.8 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased $7.9 million, or 19%, from $42.2 million for the third quarter of 2024. Total revenue increased $17.8 million, or 14%, to $143.8 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $126.0 million for the first nine months of 2024.

Net interest income totaled $46.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, representing an increase of $2.0 million, or 4%, compared to $44.8 million for the second quarter of 2025. The FTE net interest margin (2) was 3.60% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.54% for the second quarter of 2025. The increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to higher average balances of loans and overnight funds, a higher average yield on securities, and a decrease in the average cost of deposits. The cost of deposits was down 4 basis points, driven by proactive management of exception based deposit pricing and favorable noninterest-bearing deposit mix shift. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of securities due to maturities and paydowns.

Net interest income increased $7.5 million, or 19%, to $46.8 million, compared to $39.3 million for the third quarter of 2024. The FTE net interest margin (2) increased from 3.15% for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower rates paid on customer deposits, an increase in the average yields on loans and securities, a higher average balance of loans, and an increase in the average balance of deposits resulting in a higher average balance of overnight funds, partially offset by a lower average yield on overnight funds.

For the first nine months of 2025, net interest income increased $17.3 million, or 15% to $135.0 million, compared to $117.7 million for the first nine months of 2024. The FTE net interest margin (2) increased 28 basis points to 3.51% for the first nine months of 2025, from 3.23% for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to decrease in rates paid on client deposits, an increase in the average balances of average interest earning assets, and an increase in the average yields on loans and securities, partially offset by a lower yield on overnight funds.

Total noninterest income increased 8% to $3.2 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased 14% from $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. Total noninterest income increased 7% to $8.9 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $8.3 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in noninterest income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 was primarily driven by a $386,000 recovery on an acquired loan that had been previously charged off and by higher facility fees. For the first nine months of 2025, the increase was partially offset by a $219,000 gain on proceeds from company-owned life insurance recorded in the same period of 2024.

(2) This is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and discussed under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this press release.

Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2025 totaled $29.0 million, compared to $38.3 million (3) for the second quarter of 2025, and $27.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted noninterest expense (4) was $29.1 million for the second quarter of 2025. Noninterest expense totaled $96.8 million (3) for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $83.3 million for the first nine months of 2024. Adjusted noninterest expense (4) for the first nine months of 2025 increased to $87.6 million, compared to $83.3 million for the first nine months of 2024. The increase in adjusted noninterest expense ( 4) for the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 compared to the respective periods in 2024 was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits as a result of annual salary increases. The first nine months of 2025 was also impacted by higher professional fees and information technology related expenses as the Company invested in enhancing its infrastructure.

For the third quarter the Company’s PPNR, which is defined as total revenue less adjusted noninterest expense was $21.0 million, compared to $9.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. For the third quarter the Company’s adjusted PPNR (4) increased 13% to $21.0 million from $18.6 million for the second quarter of 2025, and increased 44% from $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024. For the first nine months of 2025, the Company’s PPNR was $47.0 million, compared to $42.7 million for the first nine months of 2024. For the first nine months of 2025, the Company’s adjusted PPNR (4) increased 31% to $56.2 million from $42.7 million for the first nine months of 2024.

The provision for credit losses on loans totaled $416,000 for the third quarter of 2025, compared to a $516,000 provision for credit losses on loans for the second quarter of 2025 and a provision for credit losses on loans of $153,000 for the third quarter of 2024. Net recoveries totaled $378,000 for the third quarter of 2025, compared to net charge-offs of $145,000 for the second quarter of 2025, and net charge-offs of $288,000 for the third quarter of 2024.

The provision for credit losses on loans totaled $1.2 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared to a $808,000 provision for credit losses on loans for the first nine months of 2024. Net charge-offs totaled $732,000 for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $947,000 for the first nine months of 2024.

Income tax expense increased to $5.9 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $3.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was 28.5% for both the third and second quarters of 2025, and 27.3% for the third quarter of 2024.

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $13.1 million, compared to $12.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 28.6%, compared to 28.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The efficiency ratio was 58.05% for the third quarter of 2025, compared to 80.23% for the second quarter of 2025, and 65.37% for the third quarter of 2024. The adjusted efficiency ratio (4) improved to 58.05% for the third quarter of 2025, from 61.01% for the second quarter of 2025, and 65.37% for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher total revenue. The reported efficiency ratio was 67.31% for the first nine months of 2025. The adjusted efficiency ratio (4) improved to 60.92% for the first nine months of 2025 from 66.08% for the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to higher total revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.

Full time equivalent employees were 350 at both September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025, and 353 at September 30, 2024.

(3) During the second quarter of 2025, the Company recorded expenses of $9.2 million, primarily due to pre-tax charges related to the settlement of certain litigation matters, including the anticipated settlement of a previously disclosed class action and California Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) lawsuit that alleged the violation of certain California wage-and-hour and related laws and regulations, and charges related to the planned closure of a Bank branch.

(4) This is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and discussed under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in this press release.

Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital Management:

Total assets increased 3% to $5.6 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $5.5 billion at June 30, 2025, primarily due to an increase in deposits resulting in an increase in overnight funds, purchases of investment securities, and an increase in loans. Total assets were relatively flat from $5.6 billion at September 30, 2024.

Investment securities available-for-sale (at fair value) increased to $408.5 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $307.0 million at June 30, 2025, primarily due to purchases, partially offset by maturities and paydowns. At September 30, 2024, these securities totaled $237.6 million. The pre-tax unrealized loss on the securities available-for-sale portfolio was $652,000, or $540,000 net of taxes, which equaled less than 1% of total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2025.

During the first nine months of 2025, the Company purchased $174.2 million of agency mortgage-backed securities, $129.8 million of collateralized mortgage obligations, and $44.8 million of U.S. Treasury securities, for total purchases of $348.8 million in the available-for-sale portfolio. Securities purchased had a book yield of 4.92% and an average life of 5.42 years.

Investment securities held-to-maturity (at amortized cost, net of an $11,000 allowance for credit losses), totaled $544.8 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $561.2 million at June 30, 2025, and $604.2 million at September 30, 2024. The fair value of the securities held-to-maturity portfolio was $476.8 million at September 30, 2025. The pre-tax unrecognized loss on the securities held-to-maturity portfolio was $68.0 million, or $47.9 million net of taxes, which equaled 7% of total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2025.

The unrealized and unrecognized losses in both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios resulted from higher interest rates at September 30, 2025, compared to when the securities were purchased. The issuers are of high credit quality, and all principal amounts are expected to be repaid at maturity. Fair values are expected to recover as the securities approach maturity and/or if market rates decline.

Loans HFI, net of deferred costs and fees, increased $47.3 million, or 1% to $3.6 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $3.5 billion at June 30, 2025, and increased $171.4 million, or 5%, from $3.4 billion at September 30, 2024. Loans HFI, excluding residential mortgages, increased $58.6 million, or 2% to $3.14 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $3.08 billion at June 30 2025, and increased $207.8 million, or 7%, from $2.93 billion at September 30, 2024.

Commercial and industrial line utilization was 35% at September 30, 2025, compared to 32% at June 30, 2025, and 31% at September 30, 2024. Commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans totaled $2.0 billion at September 30, 2025, of which 31% were owner occupied and 69% were investor CRE loans. Owner occupied CRE loans also totaled 31% at both June 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024. Approximately 23% of the Company’s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans at September 30, 2025, compared to 24% at June 30, 2025, and 25% at September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2025, paydowns and maturities of investment securities and fixed interest rate loans maturing within one year totaled $343.8 million.

Total deposits increased $149.2 million, or 3%, to $4.8 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $4.6 billion at June 30, 2025, and increased $47.0 million, or 1% from $4.7 billion at September 30, 2024.

The following table shows the Company’s deposit types as a percentage of total deposits at the dates indicated:

The Company’s total available liquidity and borrowing capacity was $3.3 billion at September 30, 2025, compared to $3.1 billion at June 30, 2025, and $3.2 billion at September 30, 2024.

Total shareholders’ equity was $700.0 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $694.7 million at June 30, 2025, and $685.4 million at September 30, 2024.

The allowance for credit losses on loans (“ACLL”) at September 30, 2025 was $49.4 million, or 1.38% of total loans. The ACLL at June 30, 2025 was $48.6 million, or 1.38% of total loans. The ACLL at September 30, 2024 was $47.8 million, or 1.40% of total loans. The increase in the ACLL year-over-year is due to loan growth.

NPAs were $3.7 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $6.2 million at June 30, 2025, and $7.2 million at September 30, 2024. There were no Shared National Credits (“SNCs”) in NPAs or total loans at September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025, or September 30, 2024.

Classified assets totaled $34.6 million, or 0.62% of total assets, at September 30, 2025, compared to $37.5 million, or 0.69% of total assets, at June 30, 2025, and $32.6 million, or 0.59% of total assets, at September 30, 2024.

Reclassifications

During the first quarter of 2025, we reclassified Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) stock dividends from interest income to noninterest income and the related average asset balances were reclassified from interest earning assets to other assets on the “Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin” tables. The amounts for the prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications did not affect previously reported net income or shareholders’ equity.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Financial results are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company’s performance. These measures include “adjusted” operating metrics that have been adjusted to exclude notable expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2025 as well as other performance measures and ratios adjusted for notable items. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance comparability between periods and in some instances are common in the banking industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should be supplemental to primary GAAP financial measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for primary GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is presented in the tables at the end of this press release under “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial performance to differ materially from our goals, plans, expectations and projections expressed in forward-looking statements include those set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Item 1A of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,2025, and include: (i) cybersecurity risks that may affect us directly or may impact us indirectly by virtue of their effects on our clients, markets or vendors, including our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks, including those posed by the increasing use of artificial intelligence (such as, but not limited to, ransomware, data security breaches, “denial of service” attacks, “hacking” and identity theft) affecting us, our clients, and our third-party vendors and service providers; (ii) events that affect our ability to attract, recruit, and retain qualified officers and other personnel to implement our strategic plan, and that enable current and future personnel to protect and develop our relationships with clients, and to promote our business, results of operations and growth prospects; (iii) media items and consumer confidence as those factors affect our clients’ confidence in the banking system generally and in our bank specifically; (iv) adequacy of our risk management framework, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (v) market, geographic and sociopolitical factors that arise by virtue of the fact that we operate primarily in the general San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California; (vi) risks of geographic concentration of our client base, our loans, and the collateral securing our loans, as those clients and assets may be particularly subject to natural disasters and to events and conditions that directly or indirectly affect those regions, including the particular risks of natural disasters (including earthquakes, fires, and flooding) and other events that disproportionately affect that region; (vii) political events that have accompanied or that may in the future accompany or result from recent political changes, particularly including the imposition of tariffs, sociopolitical events and conditions that result from political conflicts and law enforcement activities that may adversely affect our markets or our clients; (viii) our ability to estimate accurately, and to establish adequate reserves against, the risk of loss associated with our loan and lease portfolios and our factoring business; (ix) inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments or our level of loan originations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans to clients, whether held in the portfolio or in the secondary market; (x) factors that affect the value and liquidity of our investment portfolios, particularly the values of securities available-for-sale; (xi) factors that affect our liquidity and our ability to meet client demands for withdrawals from deposit accounts and undrawn lines of credit, including our cash on hand and the availability of funds from our own lines of credit; (xii) increased capital requirements for our continual growth or as imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all; (xiii) the expense and uncertain resolution of litigation matters whether occurring in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, particularly including but not limited to the effects of recent and ongoing developments in California labor and employment laws, regulations and court decisions; (xiv) operational issues stemming from, and/or capital spending necessitated by, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which we are highly dependent; and (xv) our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing factors.

Strong credit quality – Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.01%

AUBURN, Ala., Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Auburn National Bancorporation, Inc. (Nasdaq: AUBN) reported net earnings of $2.2 million, or $0.64 per share, for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.52 per share, for the second quarter of 2025, and $1.7 million, or $0.50 per share, for the third quarter of 2024. Net earnings were $5.6 million, or $1.60 per share, for the first nine months of 2025, compared to $4.8 million, or $1.38 per share, for the first nine months of 2024.

“Our third quarter results reflect strong credit quality and continued improvement in our net interest margin,” said David A. Hedges, President and CEO. “Also, we are pleased to report progress on our digital initiatives as we recently rolled out online account opening for certain deposit products. We believe this is an important step in enhancing convenience and expanding access to our banking services,” continued Mr. Hedges.

Net interest income (tax-equivalent) was $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2025, and $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was due to growth in average interest-earning assets and improvements in our net interest margin.

Net interest margin (tax-equivalent) was 3.30% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 3.27% in the second quarter of 2025, and 3.05% in the third quarter of 2024. The increase compared to the second quarter of 2025 was primarily due to improved yields on interest-earning assets. The increase compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to improved yields on interest-earning assets, and a decrease in our cost of interest-bearing deposits.

Nonperforming assets were $0.1 million, or 0.01% of total assets, at September 30, 2025, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.03% at June 30, 2025, and $0.8 million, or 0.08% of total assets, at September 30, 2024.

The Company recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $255 thousand in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a charge to provision for credit losses of $113 thousand in the second quarter of 2025 and a negative provision for credit losses of $127 thousand in the third quarter of 2024. The provision for credit losses is affected by organic loan growth in our loan portfolio, our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, our expectations about future economic conditions and net charge-offs.

At September 30, 2025, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $6.7 million, or 1.20% of total loans, compared to $7.0 million, or 1.24% of total loans, at June 30, 2025, and $6.9 million, or 1.22% of total loans, at September 30, 2024.

Noninterest income was $0.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, unchanged from the second quarter of 2025, and the third quarter of 2024.

Noninterest expense was $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2025, and $5.5 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase from the second quarter of 2025 was primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits expense. The increase compared to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense and other noninterest expense.

The provision for income tax expense was $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared to $0.5 million for both the second quarter of 2025, and the third quarter of 2024.

The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 was 21.86%, compared to 20.92% for the second quarter of 2025 and 23.46% for the third quarter of 2024. The Company’s effective income tax rate is principally affected by tax-exempt earnings from the Company’s investments in municipal securities and loans, bank-owned life insurance, and New Markets Tax Credits.

Total assets were $1.0 billion at September 30, 2025 and June 30, 2025 and $990.1 million at September 30, 2024. Loans, net of unearned income were $557.9 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $562.7 million at June 30, 2025 and $565.7 million at September 30, 2024. Total deposits were $917.3 million at September 30, 2025, compared to $939.9 million at June 30, 2025, and $901.7 million at September 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits compared to June 30, 2025 was primarily due to fluctuations in reciprocal customer deposits sold through Intrafi network. At September 30, 2025 the Company had $33.0 million reciprocal deposits sold, compared to none at June 30, 2025 and $37.8 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in deposits compared to September 30, 2024 was primarily related to growth in interest-bearing deposits of $19.0 million, which was partially offset by a decrease of $3.5 million in noninterest-bearing deposits. The Company had no FHLB advances or other wholesale funding outstanding at September 30, 2025, June 30, 2025, or September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2025, the Company's consolidated stockholders' equity (book value) was $89.6 million or $25.65 per share, compared to $86.1 million, or $24.64 per share, at June 30, 2025, and $84.3 million, or $24.14 per share, at September 30, 2024. The increase from June 30, 2025 was primarily driven by net earnings of $2.2 million and other comprehensive income of $2.2 million due to a decrease in unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale, net of tax. These increases in stockholders’ equity were partially offset by cash dividends paid of $0.9 million.

All of the Company’s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. Therefore, any changes in the fair value of the Company’s securities portfolio are reflected in total equity, net of tax, under generally accepted accounting principles. Unrealized losses on our securities portfolio vary with market interest rates and do not affect our capital for regulatory capital purposes.

The Company’s tangible common equity (“TCE”) ratio or total equity to total assets ratio was 8.86% at September 30, 2025, compared to 8.36% at June 30, 2025, and 8.52% at September 30, 2024.

The Company paid cash dividends of $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2025. At September 30, 2025, the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were well above the minimum amounts required to be “well capitalized” under current regulatory standards.

Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains financial information determined by methods other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The attached financial highlights include certain designated net interest income amounts presented on a tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP financial measure, and the presentation and calculation of the efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes the presentation of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis provides comparability of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and facilitates comparability within the industry. Similarly, the efficiency ratio is a common measure that facilitates comparability with other financial institutions. Although the Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors’ understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. Along with the attached financial highlights, the Company provides reconciliations between the GAAP financial measures and these non-GAAP financial measures.

Shreveport, La, Oct. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: HFBL), the holding company of Home Federal Bank, reported net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, of $1.599 million compared to net income of $941,000 reported for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.53 and $0.52, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $0.31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company reported the following highlights during the three months ended September 30, 2025:

■ Book value per share increased to $18.46 at September 30, 2025 from $17.90 at June 30, 2025.

■ $1.242 million reduction in losses on held-to-maturity securities since June 30, 2025, which equates to $0.40 per share.

■ Zero dependency on wholesale funding – no brokered deposits or FHLB advances at September 30, 2025 or June 30, 2025.

■ 65 basis point increase to net interest margin compared to the same period in 2024.

The increase in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, resulted from an increase of $834,000, or 18.8%, in net interest income, an increase of $350,000, or 116.7%, in non-interest income, a decrease of $160,000, or 4.0%, in non-interest expense, partially offset by an increase of $420,000 in the provision for income taxes, and an increase of $266,000, or 119.3%, in the provision for credit losses. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, resulted from a decrease of $565,000, or 17.0%, in total interest expense and an increase of $269,000, or 3.5%, in total interest income. The Company’s average interest rate spread was 2.99% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 2.23% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s net interest margin was 3.63% for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to 2.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to a $223,000 recovery for the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from a decrease in net loans receivable during the period.

The following table sets forth the Company’s average balances and average yields earned and rates paid on its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated.

The $350,000 increase in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the prior year quarterly period, resulted from a decrease of $254,000 in loss on sale of real estate, an increase of $50,000 in gain on sale of loans, an increase of $32,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, and an increase of $14,000 in other non-interest income. The $254,000 loss on sale of real estate for the prior year period related to a one-to-four family residence in other real estate owned that was sold during the period.

The $160,000 decrease in non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, resulted from decreases of $152,000 in compensation and benefits expense, $63,000 in audit and examination fees, $33,000 in franchise and bank shares tax, $32,000 in professional fees, $28,000 in advertising expense, $7,000 in amortization of core deposit intangible expense, partially offset by increases of $117,000 in data processing expense, $17,000 in other non-interest expense, $14,000 in loan and collection expense, $4,000 in occupancy and equipment expense, and $3,000 in deposit insurance premium expense. The increase in data processing expense resulted from a billing discrepancy with our core processor, which had failed to issue invoices for certain services dating back to December 2022. Upon discovery of the issue, we negotiated a discounted settlement to resolve the outstanding invoices, and all invoices going forward included all services. The increase in services billed resulted in the increase for the three months ended September 30, 2025.

Neste and United Airlines have expanded their existing partnership to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to three new major airports in the United States. The new agreement makes United the first commercial airline to purchase SAF for use on flights from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) in New Jersey, and Dulles International Airport (IAD) in Washington D.C.

As part of the agreement, Neste will supply neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ to United Airlines. The sustainable aviation fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel before use to meet jet fuel specifications.

Neste began the SAF deliveries to United at George Bush Airport in July and they will continue until the end of October 2025. Deliveries of SAF to Newark Airport and Dulles Airport started in September 2025 and are set to continue until the end of 2025. The fuel is delivered to each airport via existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

“Introducing sustainable aviation fuel for the first time at our hubs in Houston, Newark, and Dulles is another significant milestone in United’s sustainability journey,” said United Chief Sustainability Officer Lauren Riley. “While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments. We will continue collaborating with stakeholders, like Neste, across the aviation value chain to encourage policymakers to implement sensible market incentives that promote lower-carbon energy.”

“We are thrilled to enable United Airlines to expand SAF use to new markets in the United States. It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its bold net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050. We remain fully committed to supporting our customers in reducing emissions by scaling our SAF production and supply capabilities,” says Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This new agreement builds on the long-term partnership between Neste and United. Neste has been supplying SAF to United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport since August 2024, after the SAF purchase credit was enacted in Illinois, making United the first airline to use SAF at the airport. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel has also been used by the airline at San Francisco International Airport in California, where the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is supporting the use of renewable fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable aviation fuel that provides an alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel. With the use of neat (i.e. unblended) Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced by up to 80%* over the fuel’s life cycle compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste’s SAF is made from 100% renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. SAF is certified for commercial use and can currently be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel and works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Today, Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons (around 515 million gallons) per annum, and it is set to grow to 2.2 million tons (around 750 million gallons) in 2027.

In this scenario, sustainable fuels meet 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation fuel needs and 35% of shipping fuel requirements.
Cost gap remains Despite the positive outlook, costs remain a barrier, with sustainable fuel options remaining far more expensive than fossil equivalents.","The International Energy Agency (IEA) released a wide-ranging report this week assessing the state of sustainable fuels and forecasting sharp growth across all major sectors – but only if current and planned policies are fully implemented.

The IEA’s projections indicate that global consumption of liquid and gaseous sustainable fuels could quadruple by 2035, shaping long-term procurement strategies for transport, power and heavy industry.

The report, issued in support of COP30, evaluates how the world can step up production and deployment of fuels such as biofuels, biogas and hydrogen-based alternatives. It sets out potential pathways, highlights cost hurdles and outlines how targeted public procurement and investment could support broader decarbonisation targets.

Consumption outlook and market share projections

Sustainable fuels currently account for 1.3% of global energy consumption. Of that, liquid biofuels comprise nearly 80%, helping cut oil demand by around 2.5 million barrels per day.

In addition, these fuels help countries reduce their reliance on imported transport fuels by 5–15%, depending on local market conditions.

The IEA notes that “between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled,” but adds that current trends still fall short of what is needed to reach international climate goals.

Under its “accelerated case” scenario, the IEA models a future where all planned policies become fully legislated, market barriers are lifted and production capacity expands. In this outlook, global sustainable fuel use rises to 13 exajoules by 2030 and reaches 28 exajoules by 2035. An exajoule equals one quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) joules, a standard unit for measuring large-scale energy consumption.

Transport remains the largest consumer, making up 50% of global sustainable fuel use in 2035. In this scenario, sustainable fuels meet 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation fuel needs and 35% of shipping fuel requirements.

To help realise this trajectory, the IEA lists six policy recommendations for governments, including:

Clear national roadmaps

Strong and enforceable mandates

Demand predictability

Transparent carbon accounting

Public procurement

Long-term investment frameworks

The agency argues that “accelerating the deployment of sustainable fuels requires a mix of ambitious, stable and enforceable policies, such as mandates and performance standards, along with proactive public procurement"".

Private sector players echo the same call. Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of UK-based RegenRate, says: “We need policy on our side. We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality.”

RegenRate works to boost biofuel feedstock capacity through sustainable agricultural methods.

Cost gap remains

Despite the positive outlook, costs remain a barrier, with sustainable fuel options remaining far more expensive than fossil equivalents.

For example, electrolytic hydrogen costs around 3.8 times more than traditional hydrogen. Electrolytic ammonia is 2.7 times as expensive, while biomethanol costs 3.7 times more than fossil-based fuels.

However, these higher costs are unlikely to cause major downstream price shocks for end-users, the IEA finds. This is due to low blending rates and energy costs forming only a small portion of final consumer prices.

A 15% blend of sustainable aviation fuel, for instance, would increase air ticket prices by 5–7%. Meanwhile, using low-emissions hydrogen in steelmaking would add less than 1% to the price of an electric vehicle.

The IEA warns that “policies that address only one dimension risk leaving critical gaps"". It calls for integrated frameworks that combine long-term demand signals with transitional support for emerging technologies, as well as international cooperation across borders and sectors.

Investment, employment and fuel diversity

Global investment in sustainable fuels grew 20% from 2023 to 2024, led by US and Brazilian policy support for biofuels, as well as the European Union’s REPowerEU Plan for biogas expansion.

If the accelerated case scenario unfolds, cumulative investment in sustainable fuel infrastructure, production and distribution will hit US$1.5tn by 2035. Direct employment twill triple to two million roles, with biofuels accounting for two-thirds of job growth.

The mix of sustainable fuels also continues to diversify. Liquid and gaseous biofuels hold a two-thirds market share in 2035. However, low-emissions hydrogen and its derivatives expand rapidly – from just 1% today to one-third of global consumption in the next decade.

That trajectory is drawing attention from across the energy sector.

Antonio Villaluenga, Vice President of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International, says: “With US$1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035, and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping, chemicals and beyond.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 15:56:09.545348

“Projections based on announced investments show that SAF production in the EU is expected to reach the mandated SAF targets until 2034,” Itkonen said.
“the Commission also encourages SAF producers and airlines to produce and purchase SAF over and above the targets, respectively.
Several measures allow to bridge the price gap between SAF and conventional aviation fuel.
“In particular, transparency for airlines on the price of SAF and the establishment of a competitive liquid SAF market will be key to incentivise airlines to buy SAF above the targets,” Itkonen said.","EASA released its latest ReFuelEU Aviation Technical Report Wednesday, providing the first comprehensive review of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) activity across the European Union. Covering data from 2024, the report identifies Finland, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy as the leading producers, with commercial-scale output already underway.

Neste’s Porvoo refinery in Finland, TotalEnergies’ facilities at La Mède and Grandpuits in France, BP’s Lingen refinery in Germany, Repsol’s refineries in Spain, and Eni’s new 400 kt-per-year Gela biorefinery in Italy account for much of the EU’s current SAF supply.

Development across member states

Development continues across other Member States. Estonia and Latvia are conducting a joint EU-funded study on regional production potential, while Poland’s Orlen and Romania’s OMV are building their first large-scale plants. Ireland published its first national policy roadmap in August 2025, and Luxembourg’s Cargolux and Lux-Airport have secured offtake agreements with Norsk e-Fuel. Malta, Lithuania, and Slovenia currently report no domestic capacity.

The report establishes 2024 as the baseline year for monitoring progress toward ReFuelEU Aviation’s blending mandates. It notes that SAF represented about 0.6% of aviation fuel supplied in 2024 and that meeting the 2030 target of 6% is feasible under optimistic production scenarios.

Market shifts and policy response

Synthetic fuel projects remain behind schedule, with no facilities yet at final investment decision stage. EASA projects EU output could reach between 1.4 and 5.9 million tonnes by 2030, depending on buildout rates and investment progress.

Global investment remains an active issue. Since the close of the summer, for instance, a major airline partnership announced the launch of a $150 million investment fund for the fuel, while in Europe, Shell scrapped a project that would have produced one of the continent’s largest processing facilities, citing the need to balance affordability with customer demands.

European Commission confidence

Regarding the Shell plant closure last month, European Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen told AVweb that the commission remains confident that the bloc will reach the EU’s mandated 2034 SAF targets.

“Projections based on announced investments show that SAF production in the EU is expected to reach the mandated SAF targets until 2034,” Itkonen said. “the Commission also encourages SAF producers and airlines to produce and purchase SAF over and above the targets, respectively. Several measures allow to bridge the price gap between SAF and conventional aviation fuel. The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan to be adopted in the Autumn will aim to further facilitate long-term SAF offtake agreements.”

Itkonen also said the Commission is keeping a close eye on the fuels market as it attempts to develop in accordance with ReFuelEU plans.

“In particular, transparency for airlines on the price of SAF and the establishment of a competitive liquid SAF market will be key to incentivise airlines to buy SAF above the targets,” Itkonen said.",https://avweb.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/sustainable-jet-fuel_tanker-truc.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:00:02.477566

Findings within the report state that the implementation of ReFuelEU Aviation has thus far stimulated increased SAF production within the EU, a trend that, according to the EASA, will see the EU on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target of 6% in 2030.

The report has also confirmed that nearly all SAF used throughout 2024 was produced from used cooking oil (81%) and waste animal fats (17%), signalling that the development of synthetic fuels (eSAF) still remains within its initial stages in the EU.

The European Commission is now preparing a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which is designed to boost investments in renewable and low-carbon transport fuels, including SAF.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, said:

The EU is making steady progress in adopting sustainable aviation fuels, and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is already helping to increase SAF production and use across Member States.

Our focus now is on supporting the industry and Member States to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.

The EASA’s next annual report will utilise data from 2025 to assess whether ReFuelEU’s first blending mandate, the obligation to supply at least 2% of total aviation fuel as SAF in EU airports, has been sufficiently met.

Under an agreement with Edgewood Renewables, Plug will use its hydrogen plant design experience to help build and integrate hydrogen into the SAF production process.

Specifically, the US green hydrogen firm will lead the engineering design, key product supply, fabrication, and project oversight.

Plug said the project “expands its reach beyond hydrogen into complementary clean fuel markets.”

Located at a former fuel-terminal site in Nevada, the plant will convert biomass into low-carbon fuels using thermochemical processes that integrate renewable natural gas and hydrogen.

Edgewood plans to produce over 120 million gallons of SAF per year. Construction of the facility and equipment is set to commence “in the coming months.”

The company emphasised the goal is to help decarbonise aviation, trucking, maritime, and other heavy transport sectors with the drop-in fuels.

The ISCC CORSIA certification ensures rigorous sustainability and traceability standards for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in international aviation markets. The certification process began after obtaining authorisation from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP) for the production of SAF in May 2025, culminating in the issuance of the ISCC certificate in October. SAF can directly replace conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or fuelling infrastructure. This makes the fuel a practical and rapid solution for reducing emissions in the aviation sector.

Reduc has authorisation from the ANP to incorporate up to 1.2% renewable feedstock into its SAF production through this route. The refinery is expected to begin production in the coming months to sell up to 50 000 m³/month (10 000 bpd) of the fuel. The use of low-carbon feedstock and the renewable compound content of the fuel are compatible with the requirement for a 1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for domestic aviation by 2027.

“Petrobras takes another step toward a just energy transition by offering the market a strategic, low-investment, fast-to-implement solution, effectively contributing to the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. At the same time, we are demonstrating the importance of investing in innovation and sustainability in Brazilian refining,” said William França, Petrobras’ Director of Industrial Processes and Products.

Bringing SAF production forward in line with current legislation, using the HEFA co-processing route, is crucial for the aviation market, given the sector’s future requirements. Starting in 2027, Brazilian airlines must begin using this type of fuel on international flights, based on the Future Fuel Law and the mandatory phase of CORSIA.

Why she matters: As United's chief sustainability officer, Riley has sought to position the airline — the first to publicly commit to a carbon-reduction target — as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

United used 13.6 million gallons of SAF in its mainline planes — larger, long-haul aircraft — last year, almost double the previous year's use. But those planes guzzled almost 4 billion gallons of conventional fuel, a shade above the 2023 level.

Driving the news: Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C. — along with Newark and Houston — are starting to use SAF, leaving Denver as the only United hub without it, the airline told Axios exclusively.

Neste Corp. began SAF deliveries to United in Houston in July and will continue until the end of October. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles started last month and are planned until the end of the year.

Riley hopes Denver will soon follow suit.

She recently chatted with Axios about her work. Her remarks have been condensed.

On the growing use of SAF at hubs: ""It's our demonstration that by using the existing fueling infrastructure, sustainable aviation fuel really can flow throughout the network, which is really exciting.""

""That means cost reductions because it's more efficient, right? It means it's less disruptive to the operation, and it means there's more opportunity to scale, frankly. ""

On increasing supply for SAF: ""I just took a tour of the Phillips 66 SAF refinery in Rodeo, right outside San Francisco. They primarily make renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels at that facility.""

""So we're seeing some of these traditional incumbents come online as well, in addition to those that have been early starters in the industry. It's beginning to diversify, which is exactly what we need to see.""

On what's needed for more growth: ""We need strong policy structures. The economics aren't there yet, but it's beginning to scale, and we're starting to see better economics than we've ever seen before ...

""[What we're] hearing loud and clear from our financial partners, our financial institutions that have the capital to put into this market, is that it's too risky right now, because the policy is not durable.""

On other emissions-reduction efforts: ""What's important to me is that every single aircraft we purchase is about 20% more fuel efficient than the aircraft it replaces.""

On air taxis: ""There's a lot of activity that's coming forward from this administration to provide the environments to begin testing different components of introducing [air taxis] into the airspace.""

""Of course, safety is everything. So doing this in sort of a measured and responsible manner is really important.""",https://images.axios.com/dymJ94Ll_LURBDMBOEESlz95AyQ=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/10/20/1760979689602.jpeg,N,,2025-10-23 08:56:10.762230

It has many other important recommendations too; it calls for the UK gov to: - Embrace the principle of geological net zero, meaning fossil emissions must be balanced by geological removals, not trees or soils. - Set up a GGR Strategy with clear national targets. - Create an Office for Greenhouse Gas Removals, giving CDR a permanent home in government. - Create UK standards for DACCS, BECCS, Biochar and ERW, and endorse existing standards in the meantime. - Set up new vehicles for innovation funding and R&D with additional support for pilot- and mid-scale projects to address “valley of death” issues and secure a pipeline of diverse GGR. The report is an official government-commissioned independent review, intended to influence policy so it carries a lot of weight.

Strategic Partnership Unveiled at IATA World Sustainability Symposium

The announcement was made in Hong Kong during the IATA World Sustainability Symposium, underscoring the mounting urgency for comprehensive cross-industry collaboration to decarbonize air travel. The partnership was formalized at a ceremony attended by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan and Airbus President for Asia-Pacific Anand Stanley, bringing together two industry giants with a shared vision for sustainable aviation.

This collaboration is particularly timely as the global aviation industry confronts increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), sustainable aviation fuels demonstrate the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation, yet currently account for less than 1% of total aviation fuel consumption worldwide. The Airbus-Cathay partnership aims to directly address this supply constraint by targeting projects that can overcome the early-stage financing and infrastructure barriers that have historically constrained SAF market development.

Investment Framework and Project Selection Criteria

Under the terms of this strategic partnership, both companies will collaborate extensively to identify, evaluate, and invest in SAF production projects that demonstrate strong commercial viability, mature technology readiness, and credible pathways for long-term offtake agreements. The joint fund is specifically designed to support ventures that can bridge the gap between technological innovation and commercial scalability, with investments targeting projects across Asia and potentially extending to other global markets where conditions favor sustainable fuel development.

The selection process will prioritize initiatives that showcase not only technical feasibility but also economic sustainability. Projects will be assessed based on multiple criteria including feedstock availability, production technology maturity, regulatory compliance, environmental impact assessments, and the potential for establishing reliable supply chains. This rigorous evaluation framework ensures that investments channel toward ventures with the highest probability of delivering tangible emissions reductions while achieving commercial success.

“SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our decarbonization goals,” said Alex McGowan, emphasizing the centrality of sustainable fuels to the company’s environmental strategy. “This co-investment partnership with Airbus strengthens our commitment to building a scalable SAF industry and complements our broader strategy of investing in technologies and production capacity for the future.”

Addressing the SAF Supply Challenge

The partnership emerges against a backdrop of acute SAF scarcity. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF production is expected to reach approximately 2 million tonnes in 2025, representing just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel requirements. This stark disparity between supply and demand highlights the monumental challenge facing the industry as it works toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a target to which IATA member airlines committed in 2021.

The cost differential between SAF and conventional jet fuel remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Industry analyses indicate that SAF currently costs approximately five times more than regular jet fuel, driven by complex production processes, advanced technology requirements, and limited feedstock availability. The Airbus-Cathay investment aims to address these economic challenges by supporting projects that can achieve economies of scale and drive down production costs over time.

Both companies have emphasized that scaling SAF will require deep, system-wide coordination extending far beyond their bilateral partnership. Success depends on alignment among policymakers who establish regulatory frameworks, investors who provide capital, fuel producers who develop production capacity, and airlines that commit to long-term purchase agreements. The joint fund represents an attempt to catalyze this ecosystem by demonstrating manufacturer-airline collaboration on upstream investments.

Cathay Pacific’s Comprehensive Sustainability Portfolio

This latest investment complements Cathay Pacific’s existing sustainability initiatives, which demonstrate the airline’s multi-pronged approach to decarbonization. In September 2025, Cathay joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a collaborative initiative with other oneworld alliance airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. That fund, which opened with $150 million in commitments, focuses specifically on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with breakthrough potential to scale significantly and reduce costs over the long term.

The distinction between these two investment vehicles is strategic and complementary. While the oneworld BEV Fund targets emerging technologies with transformative potential but longer development timelines, the Cathay-Airbus partnership announced today will concentrate on more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability. This dual-track investment strategy allows Cathay to support both immediate production expansion and future technological breakthroughs, hedging against uncertainties while maintaining momentum toward decarbonization goals.

Cathay has also established agreements with multiple fuel producers to expand SAF availability at major operational hubs. These commercial arrangements provide the airline with access to available SAF supplies while supporting the business case for producers to expand capacity. By committing to purchase agreements, Cathay helps de-risk investments in new production facilities, demonstrating the critical role that airline offtake commitments play in catalyzing SAF market development.

Airbus’s Expanding Role in SAF Ecosystem Development

For Airbus, the partnership with Cathay represents a continuation and expansion of its strategic engagement across the SAF value chain. The aircraft manufacturer has made substantial commitments to ensure all of its aircraft are capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030, a technical milestone that requires extensive testing, certification, and potential modifications to aircraft systems. This technical capability is essential for enabling airlines to significantly increase their SAF utilization as supply becomes available.

Beyond technical development, Airbus has established partnerships with fuel suppliers, governments, and other airlines worldwide to accelerate SAF market uptake. These collaborations address different aspects of the SAF ecosystem, from production and distribution to regulatory frameworks and certification standards. The manufacturer’s direct involvement in financing production projects represents a deeper level of engagement, effectively extending its business model upstream into fuel supply chain development.

“The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach,” said Anand Stanley, Airbus President for Asia-Pacific. “Our partnership with Cathay is a tangible step toward catalyzing production in regions best positioned for growth and feedstock supply.”

This statement underscores a critical strategic insight: SAF production will ultimately concentrate in regions with optimal combinations of feedstock availability, production infrastructure, regulatory support, and market access. Asia-Pacific, with its abundant biomass resources and rapidly growing aviation market, represents one such region with significant potential for SAF industry development.

Asia-Pacific’s Strategic Importance for SAF Development

The focus on Asia-Pacific reflects both opportunity and necessity. According to IATA projections, the Asia-Pacific aviation sector is poised to account for more than 40% of global passenger traffic by 2040, with passenger numbers projected to double by 2043. This explosive growth trajectory, driven by demographic expansion, rising middle-class incomes, and economic development in countries like China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, creates both tremendous environmental challenges and substantial market opportunities for SAF deployment.

The region possesses significant advantages for SAF production. Asia-Pacific countries have access to diverse feedstock sources including agricultural residues from rice and sugarcane production, used cooking oils from densely populated urban centers, and potential energy crops cultivated on marginal lands. These varied feedstock options provide flexibility and resilience in supply chains, reducing dependence on any single input source and enabling production facilities to optimize based on local resource availability and economic conditions.

However, the region currently faces significant challenges that the Airbus-Cathay partnership aims to help address. European regulations have established mandatory SAF blending requirements, with the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation setting minimum supply mandates starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050. While these policies drive demand in Europe, Asian countries have generally moved more slowly in establishing comparable regulatory frameworks, creating uncertainty for potential investors in production capacity.

The partnership between Airbus and Cathay includes explicit commitments to joint policy advocacy, leveraging their combined experience and networks to influence governments across the region. Their objectives include promoting supportive regulatory frameworks that reduce cost disparities between SAF and conventional jet fuel, facilitating development of regional production hubs, and ensuring consistent certification standards that enable SAF to move freely across international markets.

Economic and Environmental Imperatives

The economic case for SAF investment extends beyond environmental compliance. While current SAF production costs remain substantially higher than conventional jet fuel, industry experts anticipate significant cost reductions as production scales. The U.S. Department of Energy’s analysis suggests that expanded feedstock utilization, improved production technologies, and larger facility scales could progressively narrow the price gap, potentially achieving cost parity with fossil-based jet fuel in certain scenarios over the coming decades.

Government incentives are playing an increasingly important role in bridging the current cost gap. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act provides substantial tax credits for SAF production, with values determined by the carbon intensity reduction achieved compared to conventional fuel. These policy mechanisms help de-risk investments and accelerate the transition to commercial-scale production. Similar incentive structures are being developed or considered in various countries, creating a patchwork of support that influences where production capacity will ultimately be deployed.

The environmental imperative driving these investments cannot be overstated. Aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, and while this may seem modest in absolute terms, the sector presents unique decarbonization challenges. Unlike ground transportation, which can increasingly electrify, long-haul aviation requires energy-dense liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. Hydrogen and electric propulsion may eventually serve short-haul routes, but SAF currently represents the only viable pathway to significantly reduce emissions from long-distance flights that dominate aviation’s environmental impact.

According to IATA estimates, SAF could contribute approximately 65% of the emissions reduction needed for aviation to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. This projection underscores why manufacturers like Airbus and airlines like Cathay are making substantial investments despite current economic challenges and uncertain policy environments.

Regulatory Framework and Carbon Offsetting Mechanisms

The Airbus-Cathay partnership operates within an evolving regulatory landscape designed to accelerate aviation decarbonization. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), established by ICAO, represents the first global market-based scheme applying to an entire sector. Under CORSIA, airlines must purchase carbon credits to offset emissions growth above established baselines, with the scheme transitioning from voluntary participation to mandatory compliance across most international routes by 2027.

CORSIA’s baseline was recently adjusted to 85% of 2019 emissions levels for the 2024-2035 period, representing a significantly more ambitious target than originally planned. This adjustment, which the industry supported, increases pressure on airlines to reduce emissions through both operational improvements and alternative fuels. Currently, 129 countries participate in CORSIA as of 2025, representing the vast majority of international aviation activity.

SAF plays a unique role within the CORSIA framework. Airlines can use CORSIA-eligible fuels to reduce their offsetting requirements, providing direct economic incentives for SAF adoption beyond the environmental benefits. This mechanism creates demand signals that help justify investments in production capacity, though the magnitude of this incentive depends on carbon credit prices and the cost differential between SAF and conventional fuel.

Long-Term Partnership and Fleet Relationship

The Airbus-Cathay collaboration builds on a relationship spanning more than three decades. Cathay took delivery of its first Airbus aircraft in 1989, and the airline now operates a fleet of 86 Airbus jets with over 70 additional aircraft on order. This substantial fleet commitment creates natural alignment around SAF development, as Cathay’s future operations will depend heavily on Airbus aircraft, and Airbus has clear interests in ensuring its customers can access sustainable fuels to meet regulatory requirements and corporate commitments.

The deepening of their relationship into joint investment in fuel infrastructure reflects a broader industry trend. Traditional boundaries between aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and fuel suppliers are blurring as companies recognize that long-term decarbonization depends on collaborative approaches that address the entire value chain. Similar partnerships are emerging globally, with various combinations of airlines, manufacturers, airports, and energy companies joining forces to accelerate SAF development.

Technology Pathways and Production Methods

The SAF industry employs multiple production pathways, each with distinct advantages, challenges, and feedstock requirements. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology, which converts oils and fats into jet fuel, represents the most commercially mature pathway and accounts for the majority of current SAF production. However, HEFA faces feedstock constraints as global supplies of waste oils and fats are limited and face competing demands from other sectors.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis can convert solid biomass or municipal solid waste into jet fuel, offering access to more abundant feedstock sources but requiring higher capital investment and more complex processing. Alcohol-to-jet pathways can utilize ethanol or other alcohols derived from various sources, providing another route to diversify feedstock options. Power-to-liquid technologies, which synthesize fuel from captured CO2 and renewable electricity, represent emerging approaches with tremendous potential but currently face significant cost and scale challenges.

The Airbus-Cathay investment will likely support projects across multiple pathways, reflecting the need for a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain. Different regions have varying feedstock advantages, and no single production technology will dominate globally. The partnership’s emphasis on commercial viability and technology maturity suggests a focus on pathways approaching or achieving commercial scale rather than early-stage research, though the precise project selection will depend on opportunities that emerge through their evaluation process.

Industry-Wide Implications and Future Outlook

For global aviation leaders and investors, the Airbus-Cathay partnership illustrates a fundamental shift in industry dynamics. Airlines and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are increasingly co-investing in upstream fuel infrastructure, recognizing that long-term decarbonization depends on securing scalable, cost-competitive SAF supply. This represents a departure from traditional industry structures where airlines purchased fuel from suppliers without involvement in production decisions or investments.

This trend toward vertical integration or strategic partnerships along the value chain is likely to accelerate as regulatory pressures intensify and airlines compete to secure reliable SAF supplies. First-mover advantages may accrue to companies that establish strong relationships with producers and secure favorable long-term offtake agreements, particularly as SAF supply growth lags behind regulatory mandates in many jurisdictions.

As governments worldwide prepare to enforce stricter carbon-reduction targets under ICAO’s CORSIA framework and national net-zero policies, collaborations like the Airbus-Cathay partnership will play critical roles in bridging the gap between technological readiness and commercial deployment. The success or failure of these investments will significantly influence whether aviation can meet its ambitious climate commitments while continuing to provide essential connectivity that supports global economic growth and social development.

The $70 million investment, while substantial, represents just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Industry analyses suggest that achieving meaningful SAF penetration will require hundreds of billions of dollars in investment across production facilities, distribution infrastructure, and feedstock supply chains over the coming decades. The Airbus-Cathay partnership serves as both a practical investment vehicle and a demonstration of the collaborative approaches that will be necessary to mobilize capital at the required scale.

Conclusion: A Decisive Step Toward Sustainable Aviation

The announcement of the Airbus-Cathay Pacific $70 million co-investment partnership marks a decisive step in reshaping the global aviation fuel landscape. By committing substantial resources to accelerate SAF production, particularly in the strategically important Asia-Pacific region, these industry leaders are not merely responding to regulatory pressures but actively shaping the infrastructure and markets that will define aviation’s sustainable future.

The partnership’s success will depend on numerous factors beyond the companies’ direct control, including government policy decisions, technological breakthroughs, feedstock availability, and broader economic conditions. However, by taking concrete action to invest in production capacity, advocate for supportive policies, and demonstrate the viability of manufacturer-airline collaboration on fuel infrastructure, Airbus and Cathay are helping to de-risk the SAF industry and create pathways for others to follow.

As the aviation industry confronts the dual imperatives of continued growth and radical emissions reduction, initiatives like this partnership provide tangible evidence that stakeholders recognize the magnitude of the challenge and are willing to commit resources toward solutions. Whether this $70 million investment proves catalytic in accelerating Asia-Pacific’s SAF industry development remains to be seen, but it undeniably represents a significant commitment from two major players whose long-term success depends on achieving sustainable aviation at scale.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) uptake across the EU in 2024 and assesses the market's readiness to meet upcoming obligations under the Regulation.

According to the findings, implementation of ReFuelEU Aviation has already stimulated increased SAF production capacity within the EU. This positive trend confirms that the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target in 2030, which is 6 percent.

The report confirms that almost all SAF used in 2024 was bio fuel, produced from used cooking oil and waste animal fats. This shows that the development of synthetic fuels remains in its early stages in the EU. The SAF market also remains concentrated: 25 fuel suppliers provided SAF to 33 EU airports across 12 Member States. However, airports in five Member States - France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden - accounted for 99% of supply.

The European Commission said it is currently preparing a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, designed to boost investments in renewable and low-carbon transport fuels, including SAF.

European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas said: ""The EU is making steady progress in adopting sustainable aviation fuels, and the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is already helping to increase SAF production and use across Member States. Our focus now is on supporting the industry and Member States to ensure a smooth and fair transition to cleaner aviation fuels.""

For the next annual report, the data from 2025 will be used to assess whether ReFuelEU's first blending mandate, the obligation to supply at least 2 percent of total aviation fuel as SAF in EU airports, has been met.

Another veg box delivery company had converted their vans to biodiesel and I wondered if we should be doing the same. After less than a week he came back with a firm ‘no’: “biodiesel seldom delivered a net carbon benefit and often contributed to deforestation and biodiversity loss by driving the market for palm oil”. We decided to focus on electric vans instead – 20 years later, 68% of our vans are electric, held back by vehicle range, availability, and gaps in the charging network.

Earlier this month, the respected think tank, Transport and Environment, released a study arguing that biofuels add significantly to world emissions because they cause ‘indirect land clearance and deforestation’ (transportenvironment.org/ articles). The situation is set to get even worse with plans to introduce “Sustainable Aviation Fuel” (SAF) – made from biomass or waste (including used cooking oil) and intended to replace fossil fuel-based kerosene. The problem? SAF represents less than 0.05% of total EU aviation fuel use; the 99%+ shortfall comes from the corrupt trade in virgin palm oil, leading to further rainforest destruction.

Two decades after doing our research, 30% of maize grown in the UK (and 40% in the US) will still be used to make biofuel or to generate electricity in AD (anaerobic digestion) plants that we’re all subsidising at the pump, through our energy bills and taxes. Even madder – a significant part of the UK crop is grown on the fens where ploughing releases huge amounts of CO2 from the oxidising peat, resulting in emissions that are three times higher than burning oil. Why are we subsidising biofuels that, far from fighting climate change, are contributing to it?

I’m all for green legislation, taxation, and subsidies (in a corrupt marketplace, I believe they’re our only hope) but we urgently need policies based on facts, not commercially driven fantasies and lobbying. We’re wasting time we don’t have and money that would be better spent on wind, solar, and energy storage.

The research tackles one of the biggest hurdles in creating green hydrogen, which is the energy-intensive step of splitting water. Scientists have long worked to improve the special materials that enable this reaction, and the new study reveals that their physical architecture is just as important as their chemical makeup.

The team developed a method to gradually reshape the material over a 24-hour period. What began as flat, two-dimensional sheets slowly and steadily reformed into uniform, one-dimensional rods.

The performance difference was striking. The new rod-shaped materials required substantially less energy to drive the hydrogen production process. They were also remarkably more robust, maintaining their performance for over 200 hours of continuous use with minimal degradation, a significant improvement over the original sheets.

“It’s a bit like discovering that a kitchen knife works much better when you sharpen it into a different shape,” said one researcher, explaining the impact. “The material is essentially the same, but the new form allows it to perform its job far more effectively.”

The rods’ superior performance is attributed to their more orderly structure, which facilitates a better interaction with water molecules and improves the flow of electrical current, all while being more resistant to wearing down.

This intuitive approach to material design offers a promising new path for making green hydrogen production more viable. As industries and governments seek to scale up this clean energy source, such fundamental discoveries could be key to building the efficient and long-lasting technologies needed for a sustainable future.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Green-Hydrogen-1.png,N,,2025-10-23 05:56:23.152762

Around 60% of the economic benefit from Heathrow expansion will be felt by communities outside London and the South-East.","A third runway at Heathrow is one step closer to take-off after the Transport Secretary today (22 October 2025) launched the promised review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which will provide the framework within which any future expansion will be considered.

Previous work to launch the ANPS in 2018 took 5 years, but the government is committed to going further and faster and today confirmed the reviewed draft ANPS will be published for consultation by summer 2026 in the latest move to back Britain’s builders and get major infrastructure projects off the ground, showing our commitment to delivering progress swiftly but robustly.

Launching the review in Parliament, the Transport Secretary set out that since 2018, new environmental and climate obligations mean an updated ANPS is necessary to allow a decision to be taken on expansion planning applications. The review of the ANPS will include considering 4 key tests that any proposed scheme for Heathrow expansion will have to meet, including on climate change, noise, air quality and contributing to economic growth across the country.

This will ensure planning applications to build a third runway progress fast enough for a final planning decision to be made within this Parliament. The government will seek formal advice from the Climate Change Committee on any relevant amendments proposed to the ANPS to ensure consistency with our net zero commitments.

Today’s milestone on the road to deciding plans for Heathrow expansion follows the approval of Luton expansion earlier this year and Gatwick expansion last month – as the government continues to back aviation projects that will grow the economy, provide highly skilled jobs and help deliver the Plan for Change.

The government has acted swiftly to launch the review of the ANPS so that a decision can be made on a third runway by the end of this parliament to realise the government’s ambition of seeing flights take off from a new runway by 2035.

Following an invitation for potential promoters to submit proposals to deliver a third runway earlier this year to inform the ANPS review, the Transport Secretary also confirmed 2 schemes remain under active consideration. Promoters Heathrow Airport Limited and the Arora Group now need to provide additional details on their plans to clarify associated impacts for investors, affected communities and businesses.

After consideration of this information, the government will announce the single scheme being taken forward to inform the remainder of the ANPS review by the end of November. Any updates deemed necessary to the ANPS would then be consulted on next summer, where communities and stakeholders will be able to have their say.

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander said:

When we say this government is one that backs the builders, not blockers we mean it. Today is a critical building block which will advance plans for the delivery of a third runway at Heathrow, meaning people can start to experience the full benefits sooner.

As our only hub airport, Heathrow is critical to the UK’s economy, connecting millions of people every year and exporting British businesses across the globe. Enabling Heathrow expansion will drive economic growth and create jobs across the country, delivering on our Plan for Change.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

After decades of false starts, we are backing the builders to get Heathrow’s third runway built, creating thousands of jobs, boosting growth across the UK, and making Britain the world’s best connected place to do business.

This government is getting Britain building to kickstart growth and deliver an economy that works for, and rewards, working people.

The government is clear expansion at Heathrow must be financed entirely by the private sector and bring no cost to taxpayers, whilst also meeting rigorous and effective cost controls to deliver this significant infrastructure project as quickly as possible. Financing will come from promoters who submit formal expansion schemes and will include covering any related costs to improvements to transport to and from the airport.

Given the importance of Heathrow to trade and the economy, the government will also assess whether expansion at the airport should be designated as critical national priority infrastructure, meaning that it must meet enhanced security and resilience requirements.

The government’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill will support greener flights, which are essential to ensuring an expanded Heathrow contributes to the UK meeting its climate targets.

The bill will encourage the production of green aviation fuel in the UK by providing economic security for the market to thrive.

This includes ensuring that domestic producers receive a set amount for each unit of fuel they produce. To set the course for net zero aviation by 2050, the government has also invested £63 million to fast track the construction of UK SAF production plants.

A new UK Airspace Design Service will also be established to modernise UK’s airspace, alongside airspace slot reforms to ensure future allocations maximise benefits for passengers, local communities and businesses at expanded London airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton.

Karen Dee, Chief Executive of AirportsUK, said:

Delivering critical national infrastructure, including airport capacity, is vital if the UK is to increase economic growth. Setting a clear policy framework and providing a predictable, cost-effective and timely approvals process will help bring forward investment, create more connectivity, and drive productivity.

We look forward to working with Ministers to deliver these elements to ensure the UK can remain a world leader in aviation.

Tim Alderslade, Chief Executive of Airlines UK, said:

We welcome the strong recognition from government of aviation’s unique role enabling economic growth and activity in all parts of the UK. Airlines support airport expansion, but any scheme at Heathrow must be affordable, deliverable and aligned with the industry’s net zero commitments, principally through the scale-up of advanced SAF and a modernised UK airspace.

We want a growing aviation sector and hub airport to deliver for passengers and businesses everywhere, but not at any cost, and we look forward to working with Ministers to deliver on these objectives.

Jane Gratton, Deputy Director of Public Policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

This is great news. After many years in the planning, fast-tracking the process to support a decision on Heathrow’s expansion will be welcomed by businesses across the UK.

A third runway at Heathrow is vital to accelerating economic growth – as the UK’s hub airport and its largest air cargo port, its development will be a huge boost to British business.

Construction projects on this scale are crucial to the future development of supply chains across the UK. Around 60% of the economic benefit from Heathrow expansion will be felt by communities outside London and the South-East.

Chambers believe a third runway at Heathrow, with facilities fit for the 21st Century, will boost trade, attract international investment, improve connectivity, and deliver wide-ranging benefits for the economy.

To deliver an expanded Heathrow on time, the government is also pressing ahead with wider reforms to the UK’s planning systems, including the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which will streamline the delivery of major infrastructure projects through faster consenting routes and more balanced consultations.

This brings the total amount of SAF quotas issued so far in 2025 to around 1.2 MMt, including the first such permits allotted to Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech.

It is not compulsory for the new recipients to fully utilize the allotted permits by the end of 2025, according to the JLC report, but it is also unclear if the companies need to re-apply for quotas next year.

However, the thermal stability and oxidation stability of standard jet fuels may be affected by the addition of SAF, and a better understanding of liquid fuel oxidation kinetics is needed. The development of a kinetically well-defined reactor to study this phenomenon remains a challenge, and it is in this context that a new Si-glass microfluidic reactor with a fluid supply made of inert poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) has been developed. The experimental rig PEEK-ACHU (Autoxidation μChip Heated Unit) was used to investigate the oxidation stability of a SAF surrogate, and the results were compared to Induction Period (IP) measurements obtained in a standard PetroOxy device. A mixture of n-decane and iso-octane was used as the surrogate SAF. The thermal oxidation stability of the mixtures was studied in the microreactor, working at conditions up to 453 K and 40 bar, with a gas–liquid segmented flow that allows the liquid oxidation to occur in homogeneous, self-agitated, liquid slugs, without oxygen diffusion/depletion kinetic limitations. PEEK-ACHU enables residence times as long as 3.8 h to be reached on a 4 in. diameter Si/glass wafer, with visual access to the reactor, and a well-defined kinetic study of the liquid fuel autoxidation. The total hydroperoxide (ROOH) concentration was quantified at the exit of the microreactor using a specifically designed HPLC device with a post-column reactor for iodometric titration. For comparison, the same analysis was conducted on the SAF oxidized in the PetroOxy apparatus with the same residence time. The results show that the microfluidic apparatus can perform reliable autoxidation measurements with well-controlled operating parameters.

In the early stages, incentives are recommended to help build up the SAF market, and mandates can come later, said Dr Thomsen.","- Singapore’s decision to impose a levy on travellers to raise the use of greener jet fuel may have a “dampening effect on air travel”, and the International Air Transport Association (Iata) may not recommend such a policy elsewhere, said the body’s official .

However, given Singapore’s land constraints and limited capacity in producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the levy – which would go to a fund to procure the fuel – would be suitable for the country, Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, the association’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist, told reporters at the Iata World Sustainability Symposium on Oct 22.

On Oct 14, Parliament

passed a Bill to impose a fixed levy on all departing flights

from 2026 to support airlines’ use of SAF.

The target is for SAF to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, with the goal raised to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Preliminary estimates from the authorities are that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

Sustainable aviation fuel,

mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil, has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling systems without any costly modifications.

Iata – a trade association for airlines – is more in favour of having government incentives to raise the adoption of SAF, as in the US, which is offering tax credits and funding to green fuel producers.

It feels strongly against SAF policies that mandate the use of a certain percentage of green fuel by airlines when the supply of such fuel is still limited.

Such mandates – which have been in place in the European Union and Britain since early 2025 – have driven up SAF prices and subjected airlines to penalties for not meeting the blend when the supply is low, said Iata.

However, the association finds Singapore’s approach to be different and creative, based on its circumstances.

“We are trying to embrace everybody’s innovation, and we’re trying to celebrate those who are actually trying to do something constructive. And I think we definitely have to put the Singapore Government under that bracket...

“They’re actually trying to buy more SAF for use in airplanes. That’s a very good strategy,” said Dr Thomsen at the roundtable on Oct 22 .

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will set up a fund to procure and manage the green fuel.

In contrast, the EU mandate which started in January 2025 puts the onus on aviation fuel suppliers to blend an amount of SAF into the jet fuel they supply to EU airports, starting with 2 per cent in 2025, or face penalties that they can pass on to airlines.

Saudia Group’s vice-president for sustainability Maryam Telmesani griped about the EU mandate at a panel on Oct 22, which also featured the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s chief environmental protection expert Stephen Arrowsmith and CAAS’ chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

Saudia Group owns Saudi Arabian flag carrier Saudia and low-cost airline flyadeal.

Ms Telmesani said: “We fly to Europe, and they only allow the (refuelling) of SAF being produced there. But guess what? There is not enough supply. If the suppliers do not manage their obligation, they have the complete freedom to pass the penalties on to us.”

On Singapore’s policy, Dr Thomsen said she wants to look at the legislation in detail and the finalised levy amount, before assessing it further.

In early 2024, Iata’s chief Willie Walsh had said Singapore’s decision to impose an SAF levy appeared sensible because it aims to raise SAF production, though he warned that increases in airfares would dampen the industry’s growth.

At a press conference on Oct 21, however, he said he was concerned about the policy.

“We believe that the principle that Singapore discussed around the levy makes sense, but the devil is in the detail, and it would appear that the detail now is not aligned with what we had expected to happen,” said Mr Walsh.

“So we need to further study the legislation that has come into place and better understand the objective there,” added the director-general.

Dr Thomsen, who prefers tax benefits for green fuel feedstock producers, grants, guarantees and other incentives, said: “I wouldn’t want to necessarily say that that’s the policy I would want to see for the global SAF market.”

Under the US’ Inflation Reduction Act, green fuel producers can receive tax credits of up to US$1.75 (S$2.30) per gallon of SAF if producers meet wage and apprenticeship requirements, alongside emission reductions.

In the early stages, incentives are recommended to help build up the SAF market, and mandates can come later, said Dr Thomsen.

“If you put a mandate on a product that doesn’t exist, the price is just going to go up,” she said.

SAF typically costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel. Iata has said before that the mandate in Europe is inflating costs for airlines through the penalties passed on from the fuel suppliers, nearly doubling prices over the market rates of SAF.

When Parliament debated the SAF levy on Oct 14, Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling said subsidies and incentives require large and recurring fiscal commitments, which are not fiscally sustainable for Singapore.

Dr Thomsen said: “Let’s give Singapore the benefit of the doubt that this will actually be good, and we also trust Singapore to error-correct if it turns out not to be good.”

Mr Walsh said Singapore officials have been clear in informing the association that if the levy does not lead to greater production of SAF in Singapore, they would review the policy.

Speaking at the Oct 22 panel, CAAS’ Mr Ng said the fund from the levy will be used to buy sustainable fuel or carbon credits associated with the use of SAF.

He added that if market conditions are not ideal, the 1 per cent target may not be met, which the authorities are prepared for.

“Our approach is one where we pay what we can afford. We are not planning to be sustainable at all cost because the SAF market is still very small. The price fluctuations are quite dramatic sometimes.”

Iata is uncertain if the aviation sector can meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s 2030 target of reducing aviation’s emissions by 5 per cent through the use of SAF.

The association noted that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, but that is just 0.7 per cent of aviation’s total fuel needs.

Iata’s Mr Walsh said: “This period needs to see significant investments in the production of SAF... I think it’s going to be extremely difficult to get to 5 per cent in 2030.”

“We believe it was inappropriate to set the 2030 target. We did not believe SAF would be cheaper, and that remains the position today,” he said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/8d88be62a546348b7973eed3230fe50de7e0abc41c12f64d2554c0791df4b46d,N,,2025-10-22 23:56:11.481780

Players at the industry have, however, been raising concerns with the high high cost of the fuel, lack of coordinated legal frameworks and lack of requisite technologies as some of the challenges facing its roll out.

KQ said the fuel is made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other waste materials, which can achieve up to 85 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel when produced and used directly.

""By applying these verified SAF attributes, the airline has achieved a 50 per cent SAF-equivalent operation on the Nairobi–Cape Town route. This represents a meaningful step in exploring realistic and measurable ways to reduce emissions across its network.""

KQ said the flight was organised as part of the SkyTeam Aviation Challenge 2025 under the theme Impact, which celebrates practical actions that promote sustainability in aviation.

Onboard, Kenya Airways introduced several initiatives under four focus areas.

The initiatives include up-cycled blanket bags and headset covers and reusable cutlery to reduce waste, locally sourced Kenyan coffee and tea, canned beverages instead of plastic bottles and reusable hot drink cups, recycling of onboard waste and reusing service items.

The cabin crew were also involved in creating awareness among passengers about responsible practices.

Hellen Mwariri, chief strategy and innovation officer, said, “This flight shows what can be achieved through collaboration and innovation. It’s a step towards practical solutions that reduce our impact while keeping operations efficient.”

KQ continues to work with government agencies, local innovators and international partners, including IATA, SkyTeam and AFRAA to help build local SAF production capacity in Kenya by 2026.",https://cdn.radioafrica.digital/image/2025/10/c85571ed-dab1-429e-b1e7-b9805a4e8554.png?1761191774021,N,,2025-10-22 23:56:18.166089

Spark’s Take on LNZA Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, LNZA is a Neutral.

LanzaTech Global’s overall stock score is primarily impacted by its poor financial performance, characterized by declining revenues, high leverage, and negative cash flows. The technical analysis provides some moderate support with positive momentum indicators, but the valuation remains a significant concern due to the negative P/E ratio. The absence of earnings call data and corporate events means these factors do not influence the score.

According to the findings, implementation of ReFuelEU aviation has already stimulated increased SAF production capacity within the EU. This positive trend confirms that the EU is on track to meet the overall mandatory SAF blending target in 2030, which is 6%.

The report confirms that almost all SAF used in 2024 was biofuel, produced from used cooking oil (81%) and waste animal fats (17%). This shows that the development of synthetic fuels (eSAF) remains in its early stages in the EU. The SAF market also remains concentrated: 25 fuel suppliers provided SAF to 33 EU airports across 12 Member States. However, airports in five Member States (France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden) accounted for 99% of supply.

Honda Aircraft Company has taken a major step in aviation sustainability by successfully conducting a test flight powered entirely by a 100% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The achievement marks a first for a twin-turbine very light business jet manufacturer and highlights the industry's progress toward reducing its environmental footprint.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, aviation contributes 12% of all carbon dioxide emissions from global transportation.

In response, manufacturers like Honda Aircraft Company are developing technologies to lower these emissions, with a strong focus on alternative fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuel and emissions reduction

Sustainable aviation fuel is an alternative to traditional jet fuel derived from non-petroleum renewable sources such as woody biomass, fats and greases. It is currently approved for use in commercial flights in blends of up to 50% with conventional fuel.

The adoption of SAF presents several advantages, including flexibility in production technologies and compatibility with existing engine and airport infrastructure.

Its use in a 100% blend could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The milestone flight took place over Greensboro, North Carolina, US, with the HondaJet landing at Honda Aircraft Company's headquarters at Piedmont Triad International Airport.

This follows successful ground tests of the aircraft's HF120 engine using 100% SAF in 2022 and 2023.

Amod Kelkar, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Honda Aircraft Company, says: “We are immensely proud of our Honda Aircraft Company engineering team carrying forward our commitment to the future of aviation by demonstrating that the HondaJet is capable of operating on a 100% SAF blend.

""This achievement is a step toward aligning our business activities with the global Honda goal of decarbonising our business activities by 2050.”

Advanced engine technology and efficiency

Established in 2006 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Honda Motor Company, Honda Aircraft Company has consistently focused on fuel efficiency through advanced aerodynamic designs.

Honda Aircraft Company's headquarters is a LEED GOLD-certified building recognised for its environmental and social benefits.

A key component of Honda Aircraft Company's efficiency strategy is the HF120 engine. Developed from the earlier HF118 engine technology, the HF120 was created in collaboration with General Electric.

The result is a jet engine that offers improved efficiency, leading to lower fuel consumption and reduced noise. Honda prioritised low emissions in the engine's design, making it a cornerstone of Honda Aircraft Company’s environmental objectives.

Accreditation and a sustainable future

The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) has awarded Honda Aircraft Company its Tier-six Sustainable Flight Department Accreditation.

This is the highest level of recognition from the NBAA, acknowledging Honda Aircraft Company's commitment to a sustainable future for aviation.

Honda Aircraft Company earned this for its increased use of SAF, improving the fuel efficiency of the HondaJet and implementing other measures to minimise the environmental impact of its aircraft.

Microsoft has purchased the renewable diesel to use for backup generators in data centers.","Four years ago, there were high hopes in agriculture for the future of sustainable aviation fuel. The airlines seemed to be all in, joining the Biden administration in announcing a commitment, known as the “Grand Challenge,” to use 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030.

For farmers, SAF offered a long-term market to compensate for the decline in demand for ethanol as cars continued to become more efficient and electric vehicles more common.

But the SAF industry is still struggling to take off. The Biden administration and the Grand Challenge are gone. And a critical tax credit for the SAF industry, which needs multiple forms of subsidies and incentives to be competitive, has been slashed from $1.75 to $1 a gallon.

The cut in the 45Z clean fuels tax credit made in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill leaves SAF with the same subsidy as fuels like renewable diesel that use many of the same feedstocks, including soybeans and corn, but are cheaper to produce than SAF. Imported feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, also were made ineligible for the credit.

The cut to the 45Z credit caused concern that investment dollars needed to build up SAF will now be more likely to go to the more established market for green diesel used to power trucks, buses and other heavy modes of transportation.

“These projects are not attracting private capital, and so the role of government … in helping launch the industry, is super important,” said Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables, one of the few plants now producing SAF at commercial scale, making it a bright spot in the fledging industry. Starting next year, Montana Renewables SAF will be shipped to a Minneapolis-St. Paul facility for use by Delta Air Lines.

“Currently, the SAF market is a mixed bag of policies and producers who are facing different challenges and realities,” said Pat Gruber, CEO of Gevo, which plans to make SAF from corn ethanol in North Dakota.

“In the end, products must be economical to be adopted. That’s a fact.”

Phillips 66 converted a plant in Rodeo, California, to produce renewable diesel and SAF, but during the company’s most recent earnings call, company executives lamented the restrictions on 45Z and the RFS, which the Trump administration is proposing to limit to North American feedstocks.

Phillips 66 President and CEO called the renewable fuels business a “strategic asset” to the company but said its losses “are unacceptable and unsustainable.”

The refiner reported losses from its renewable fuels business of $185 million in the first quarter and $133 million in the second.

Another current SAF producer is Diamond Green Diesel, based in Texas and a project of refining giant Valero Energy and Darling Ingredients.

U.S. SAF production has grown from 5 million gallons in 2021 to over 100 million gallons last year, but production is running well short of its current capacity of 465 million gallons, Andreea Moyes, global head of sustainability for Air bp, said at a recent SAF industry conference in Houston.

“What's concerning to me is that with all the investment that has happened and all this capacity that was unlocked in 2025 we don't see that capacity utilization fully yet, and we have to understand why, because this is not good news for the projects in the pipeline,” Moyes said.

To be competitive with other fuels and markets such as Europe and the United Kingdom, which are imposing SAF mandates on airlines, U.S.-produced SAF needs incentives worth several dollars beyond the value of the 45Z credit and credits that can be earned through the Renewable Fuel Standard, she said.

She said the 75-cent incentive that SAF originally had in the 45Z credit was enough to cover the extra cost to refiners of producing SAF rather than renewable diesel from the same feedstocks.

Reema Bari, head of Aviation Americas for Shell, says the industry faces two major challenges: One is ensuring demand for projects that can take four to seven years to complete. The other is getting “bipartisan support for … policies that incentivize these complex and technologically advanced projects.”

‘Book and claim’ advanced as one solution to cost

Different projects have different economic challenges depending in part on the feedstocks they’re using and their locations. For Montana Renewables, which can produce SAF from oilseeds, corn oil, used cooking oil and tallow, one of those challenges is the cost of getting the fuel to the airports where it will be used. Shipping SAF from Great Falls, Montana, to Los Angeles, for example, costs about 37 cents a gallon.

Fleming and others in the industry argue that it would make more sense to sell the carbon benefits separately from the fuel through what’s known as a “book and claim” process. Corporations that want climate credits, for example, can buy the credits for SAF that’s been produced, and the fuel is then sold for its value as jet fuel at airports close to the SAF plants.

“If you want to make the cost lower for the final product, how about if we don't have to ship it physically and put it in the wing of a certain tail number of a certain aircraft?” said Fleming. “How about if we let the book and claim system do that for us?”

Such book and claim services currently exist, but usage has been limited. Some critics say such trading in credits is prone to fraud. Notably, a group of Republican state attorneys general has recently launched an investigation into the use of renewable power credits in the tech industry.

In a letter to Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon, the AGs alleged the credits allow the industry to “engage in a shell game whereby they purchase unbundled ‘renewable energy certificates’ (RECs) and then claim the ‘renewable’ attribute of energy that is used by someone else as their own energy usage.”

Alcohol-to-jet retains DOE support even as CO2 pipeline stalls

Hopes for turning ethanol into SAF have been slow to ramp up, but a leading company, Gevo, received some good news recently when Trump’s Energy Department recently extended a loan guarantee commitment for the company’s first ethanol-to-jet fuel (ETJ) facility.

Gevo is looking at moving the loan guarantee from a Lake Preston, South Dakota, site to a smaller plant in North Dakota the company acquired earlier this year. Gevo’s original plans for producing SAF at the 60-million-gallon-a year Lake Preston site have been hampered as the planned Summit carbon dioxide sequestration pipeline has stalled in the state.

Carbon from the 30-million-gallon-a year North Dakota plant can be buried near the facility. Switching the loan commitment to the North Dakota plant also would significantly shrink the size of DOE's $1.46 billion loan guarantee.

Gevo has said the South Dakota project is on hold until there’s clarity around the Summit situation. Meanwhile, it is aiming to start making SAF in North Dakota around 2029-2030.

A separate ETJ plant developed by LanzaJet in Georgia has yet to begin commercial production. Its plan to ramp up using Brazilian sugarcane ethanol has already run into challenges because of new tariffs and the restrictions on foreign feedstocks. The company missed a goal of starting full operations by the end of September.

Meg Whitty, vice president of corporate affairs and marketing for LanzaJet, said the company plans to start production “very, very soon” at a rate of about 9 million gallons of SAF and a million gallons of renewable diesel a year. Microsoft has purchased the renewable diesel to use for backup generators in data centers.

LanzaJet is looking at using as a feedstock a waste starch slurry derived from wheat and corn, she said.

Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, an ethanol industry trade group, told Agri-Pulse SAF remains a “long-term” growth opportunity for her industry. But she suggested in a speech at the SAF North America conference in Houston that the SAF industry has to shift its message from focusing on climate benefits to the benefits it would provide to farmers and rural America.

“There’s a lot in terms of the value proposition here, but we have to talk about it in a way that's going to speak to the people who are making the decisions right now, and carbon performance is not going to speak to this administration,” she said in an interview.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/Associated%20Press%20photos/Dec%202023/AP_Dec_23_Boeing_jet_SAF.jpg?height=635&t=1754419406&width=1200,N,,2025-10-22 16:01:19.887724

By Victoria Heath

Each day, more than 100,000 flights take off and land around the world. One of the most common ways of travelling from nation to nation, flying has surged in popularity. Global passenger numbers now surpass pre-pandemic levels.

As flying becomes a more common mode of transport, the planet is experiencing another increasingly prevalent matter: climate change. Across time, warmer temperatures are leading to a range of adverse weather phenomena: increased droughts and floods, more severe storms and changing rainfall patterns. In short, these meteorological events are impacting the way we fly.

But how exactly is climate change impacting the aviation industry? And how exactly can we mitigate against these changes, to ensure flying remains a smooth and enjoyable experience for travellers?

1) Hotter air means heavier planes

As temperatures rise around the world, air density declines. If air is less dense, for the same speed that a plane takes off, there is less lift – meaning the aircraft may potentially not become airborne.

To compensate, the aircraft must either fly faster or reduce its weight before take off. According to one study, under future warming predictions, 10-30 per cent of departures might need weight restrictions. This means on very hot days, airlines may offload passengers, cargo or reduce fuel reserves – reducing revenue per flight.

Another means of mitigating the impact of low air density is to increase runway length. One example of a Boeing 737-800 in a study would require anywhere between 3.5 metres to 168.8 metres of extra runway to take off, depending on the location. Even in modest warming scenarios, takeoff distances at many airports would require around an extra 100 metres of runway.

While major airports may be able to accommodate such requests for longer runways, airports with shorter or constrained runways may become more vulnerable.

To entirely avoid warmer temperatures – and the dreaded lower air density – airlines may entirely shift departure windows so that aircraft only take off during the cooler hours of early mornings and late evenings.

2) Worsening turbulence

Most aircraft travel at altitudes between 30,000 and 40,000 feet, flying through high-altitude jet streams. These are narrow corridors of fast-moving air, and form where warm tropical air meets cool polar air.

However, as the planet warms, these temperature gradients are shifting. The lower layer of the atmosphere – the troposphere – is warming rapidly, while the stratosphere above it is cooling. This pattern causes what is known as vertical wind shear, a key driver of clear-air turbulence, the kind of turbulence that hits with little warning.

Studies prove that clear-air turbulence is on the rise in recent years. Between 1979 and 2020, the amount of severe clear-air turbulence increased by 55 per cent, an uptick linked directly to changes in the upper atmosphere driven by climate change.

This paints a concerning picture for the future of aviation travel. One study estimated that by 2050 to 2080, under a moderate climate scenario, severe turbulence in the North Atlantic flight corridor could double or even triple.

To avoid turbulence zones, aircraft may need to reroute or change altitude, increasing fuel consumption and emissions. In addition, repeated turbulence encounters can worsen the structural integrity of planes, meaning airlines may face rising maintenance schedules and costs.

3) Extreme weather

Flying safely often depends on stable, predictable weather. Yet the planet’s warming atmosphere is making stronger storms, heavier rainfall and more lightning all the more common, impacting flights.

Between 2014 and 2023, weather related delays in the European airspace network increased by nearly 30 per cent, largely due to storms, high winds and thunderstorms that forced planes to either divert or become grounded. According to EuroControl, a pan-European organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation, such an increase can be attributed to ‘more frequent and more intense meteorological phenomena consistent with observed climate change trends’.

In particular, heavy rainfall can also lead to a range of problems for planes, from runway and taxiway flooding to reduced braking performance. Already, major airpots such as Miami International and Shanghai Pudong are strengthening their flood defences to help mitigate against unprecedented levels of precipitation.

Finally, lightning strikes also pose a threat to aircraft. Warmer, moister air can increase lightning frequency. In fact, a 2014 study projected that for every 1°C rise in global temperature, lightning frequency could rise by around 12 per cent.

4) Flooding and sea level rise

Many of the world’s major airports – such as New York’s JFK and London Heathrow – are built on low-lying land. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, more than 100 airports globally are at risk from coastal flooding or storm surges by the end of the century.

Another study, published in 2021, found that if global warming exceeds 2°C, up to 385 airports – nearly 10 per cent of global aviation infrastructure – could be at risk of coastal flooding, including many international hubs.

Flooding of airports can be an economically catastrophic event. Back in 2011, Suvarnabhumi Airport was forced to close during Thailand’s floods, costing the economy $1.7 billion in lost air traffic and tourism.",https://geographical.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1139733572.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 16:01:24.387834

When the fund launched in 2020 alongside Microsoft's commitment to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030, Microsoft recognised that emerging technologies including AI would be essential to achieving these goals.

The US$1bn fund was designed to accelerate climate innovations through equity and debt capital, with AI increasingly becoming central to how these solutions are measured, optimised and deployed.

AI accelerates climate innovation

The five-year progress report highlights AI as a ""transformative"" tool that offers critical abilities to measure, predict and optimise complex systems, accelerate the development of sustainability solutions and empower the sustainability workforce.

This approach could represent a major change in how climate technologies are brought to market and scaled.

Melanie Nakagawa, Microsoft Chief Sustainability Officer, says: ""Big goals need ambitious bets. When we launched Microsoft's US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund in 2020, we knew the road to reaching our ambitious sustainability goals would need to be paved, in part, with new and innovative solutions.""

According to the report, AI's role extends across the portfolio's 67 investments, helping to validate emerging technology pathways and mobilise financing. The fund has achieved a multiplier effect where every dollar invested has attracted 15 more, catalysing billions in follow-on funding.

Measuring complex climate systems

AI's capacity to process and analyse vast datasets has become instrumental in advancing projects from carbon removal and recycling innovation to low-carbon building materials and sustainable aviation fuel.

The technology enables more precise measurement and prediction of environmental impacts, potentially reducing risk for mainstream investors and accelerating the path to commercial scale.

Melanie says that hope is becoming reality: ""We've allocated more than US$800m to date across 67 portfolio investors. This kind of multiplier effect is helping move markets and scale innovation.""

The report identifies five key strategic pillars, with AI capabilities threading through each. These include pushing the frontier of emerging solutions, bridging to mainstream capital, delivering catalytic impact, partnering to amplify and accelerating with AI.

AI-enhanced climate solutions

Twelve, a portfolio company, uses electrochemical technology to convert captured CO2 and water into synthetic fuels and chemicals, including sustainable aviation fuel.

Its flagship product, E-Jet, is a drop-in Power-to-Liquid SAF made using renewable electricity, water and CO2. AI could optimise the complex chemical processes involved in this conversion, improving efficiency and reducing costs.

According to the report, CIF's investment in Twelve supported the scale-up of its Moses Lake, Washington facility and led to SAF offtake for Microsoft. The company partnered with Alaska Airlines to pioneer a book-and-claim model for SAF procurement, with AI potentially enabling better tracking and verification of environmental attributes.

The report says: ""This approach is especially valuable for global business travel, where direct SAF access is limited as most business travel happens through commercial airlines, instead of company-owned aircraft. Microsoft's early participation in the first SAF book-and-claim pilot helped establish a scalable framework that accelerates corporate demand and market growth.""

Following CIF's investment, Twelve raised US$645m in follow-on funding.

EFM, a US-based forest investment and management firm, demonstrates how AI can enhance nature-based solutions. The company focuses on climate-smart forestry, with AI potentially improving forest management practices that enhance carbon sequestration, biodiversity and community resilience.

According to the report, CIF's investment in EFM Fund IV secured Microsoft access to up to three million tons of high-quality, nature-based carbon removal credits through 2035.

Looking forward, the fund will continue focusing on advancing clean, firm energy sources, low-carbon steel, cement, copper and aluminium, sustainable fuel pathways and underfunded carbon removal pathways, with AI serving as an accelerant across these areas.

The report warns that scaling requires a ""step-change in capital and more deliberate financing structures"" and concludes: ""In 2020, we set ambitious climate goals because we believed bold action and collaboration could transform markets and accelerate progress. Five years on, meeting those goals will take even greater urgency and collective effort.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6083205b43c0a133519ed8887b4ac715:c6d45ffc2ca0875e041aff32fc28a185/melanie-nakagawa-cso-at-microsoft-speaking-at-websummit-2023.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 12:00:33.444650

Meta recently announced that it is piloting the use of mass timber in the construction its data centers, in place of emissions-intensive materials such as steel and concrete.
Under the new agreement, Meta will purchase verified EACs linked to the reduced emissions from Electra’s clean iron, and will also have the option to purchase EACs for CO2 reduction from future Electra commercial facilities.
John DeAngelis, Head of Clean Technology Innovation at Meta, said: “Meta is thrilled to collaborate with Electra to advance low-carbon iron and steel – critical data center building solutions – made here in the U.S.

Founded in 2020, Colorado-based Electra has developed a low-temperature process to electrochemically refine iron ore into 99% pure iron, using chemistry and renewable energy in place of traditional ironmaking’s coal and extreme heat. The process works by dissolving iron ore in an acidic solution, removing co-products from the solution and then running electricity through the solution to electrodeposit the iron onto metal sheets. Key benefits of the technology include the ability to use intermittent renewable energy due to the low-temperature needs of the process, and to use a wide range of ores, including previously mined and unused materials, compared with traditional ironmaking, which requires high grade ores as feedstock. The process also removes co-products such as silica and alumina, reducing waste and preserving critical minerals.

Alongside the purchase agreements, Electra announced that it has selected the site of its new demonstration facility in Jefferson County, Colorado, with the 130,000 square foot facility anticipated to begin operations in mid-2026, and to produce up to 500 metric tons of low-carbon, high-purity iron annually.

Supporting the construction of the new facility, Electra announced a new $50 million grant from the Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, and an $8 million dollar tax credit from the Colorado Industrial Tax Credit Offering (CITCO), adding to the company’s recent $186 million Series B funding round.

Mario Fernandez, Head of Catalyst at Breakthrough Energy, said:

“Steel production is one of the largest sources of emissions, driven primarily by the energy-intensive step of refining iron. Electra is reimagining the fundamentals of ironmaking, enabling a scalable, cost-effective pathway to low-carbon steel.”

Electra’s new agreement with Meta comes as the social media focuses on its goal to achieve net zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, while also addressing the challenges to reach its target as it builds out infrastructure to accommodate the rapid growth of AI. Meta recently announced that it is piloting the use of mass timber in the construction its data centers, in place of emissions-intensive materials such as steel and concrete. Under the new agreement, Meta will purchase verified EACs linked to the reduced emissions from Electra’s clean iron, and will also have the option to purchase EACs for CO2 reduction from future Electra commercial facilities.

John DeAngelis, Head of Clean Technology Innovation at Meta, said:

“Meta is thrilled to collaborate with Electra to advance low-carbon iron and steel – critical data center building solutions – made here in the U.S. Through this partnership and our commitment, we aim to demonstrate a pathway for these innovative materials to scale.”

Electra’s purchase agreements with steel companies include deals with U.S. steelmaker Nucor to use Electra’s clean iron in its Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking, as well as with Toyota Tsusho America to sell Electra’s clean iron to steelmakers and distribute green steel to automakers, and with INTERFER Edelstahl Group to use clean iron, following qualification, in specialty steel applications to help customers meet their decarbonization goals.

Nucor, Interfer Edelstahl Group and Toyota Tsusho Corporation also participated as strategic investors in Electra’s recent Series B funding round.

Sandeep Nijhawan, CEO of Electra, said:

“We started Electra to fundamentally reinvent the way the world makes iron and tackle one of the biggest sources of industrial emissions, but we’ve always known we could not do it alone. With binding commitments and support from strategic partners, we are proving that pure iron can be made resourcefully and scaled quickly to meet global demand.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electra-iron.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:00:25.372407

The uneven distribution of visitors and the seasonality of tourism are also putting pressure on infrastructure, housing, natural resources, and local communities.
“We need to work harder, better, and faster,” Luca Arbau, a climate resilience and adaptation expert at ICLEI Europe, told Euronews.
The EU executive recently concluded consultations with citizens, industry representatives, and other stakeholders for its upcoming 2026 European Tourism Strategy, which aims to address “unbalanced tourism” and promote sustainable growth across the bloc.
While the EU cannot directly legislate in tourism, it exerts influence over many areas that shape travel and hospitality.","Sustainability will be the guiding principle behind the EU’s first-ever tourism strategy, European Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas told the audience at the Global Tourism Forum in Brussels.

“Sustainability means reducing emissions, including from travel to and within destinations. But it also means managing resources wisely, protecting cultural and natural assets, and ensuring that tourism contributes to balanced regional development across Europe,” the Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism said during the two-day event on Monday and Tuesday.

Europe remains the world’s top tourist destination, welcoming 758 million visitors in 2024 — a sector that generated over 20 million jobs and contributed about 7% of the EU’s Gross Value Added, roughly €807 billion.

Yet the growing number of tourists is raising concerns, particularly in Spain, France, Germany and Italy — the four countries accounting for more than 60% of overnight stays in Europe.

The uneven distribution of visitors and the seasonality of tourism are also putting pressure on infrastructure, housing, natural resources, and local communities.

“Such pressures risk undermining tourism's long-term competitiveness and even its acceptance by local residents,” the Greek commissioner warned.

Tzitzikostas also called for stronger adaptation to climate change, shifting geopolitics, and rapid technological transformation — key challenges that European cities and regions must prioritise.

“The adjustments we make today will ensure that the benefits of tourism to local communities and economies will be even greater tomorrow,” he stressed.

In fact, Europe is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. As temperatures rise, so do the risks — threatening energy infrastructure, food security, ecosystems, and public health.

Some European cities are already responding to these challenges. Barcelona is planting more trees to combat rising heat. Copenhagen is developing flood-control systems to manage heavy rainfall. And along the Dutch coast, natural barriers are being built to protect against rising sea levels.

Still, experts say much more investment will be needed to prepare cities for the impacts of climate change.

“We need to work harder, better, and faster,” Luca Arbau, a climate resilience and adaptation expert at ICLEI Europe, told Euronews.

Although the European Commission does not hold direct competence over tourism, the second von der Leyen Commission has, for the first time, appointed a commissioner responsible for transport and tourism — signalling the EU’s growing commitment to tackling the challenges of mass tourism.

The EU executive recently concluded consultations with citizens, industry representatives, and other stakeholders for its upcoming 2026 European Tourism Strategy, which aims to address “unbalanced tourism” and promote sustainable growth across the bloc.

While the EU cannot directly legislate in tourism, it exerts influence over many areas that shape travel and hospitality.

“It is important to understand how decisions that do not formally fall within the scope of tourism policy can nonetheless have a direct impact on the sector, on tourists, and on the final price of destinations,” José Ramón Bauzá, founder and chairman of the Aviation and Tourism Forum and former MEP, told Euronews.

We will further consider the proposed approach to the revenue certainty mechanism under the UK SAF Mandate, including the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund competition and initiatives such as Project Skypower.
Detailed targets can be found in the ReFuelEU and the UK SAF Mandate regulations.","Unlike the US approach which encourages the adoption of SAF through various incentives rather than with a direct SAF blending mandate at the federal level, the UK and EU mandates aim to decarbonise aviation by introducing SAF blending obligations that increase over time.³ Both SAF regimes came into force on 1 January 2025 and set legally binding obligations which increase over time – starting at 2% SAF in 2025.

(a) UK SAF Mandate

The UK SAF Mandate works alongside a broader set of legislative measures designed to accelerate the uptake of SAF. It imposes two obligations on relevant aviation fuel suppliers:

main obligation: under the main obligation, SAF must account for 2% of the total fossil jet fuel supplied in the UK in 2025, increasing to 10% in 2030, and reaching 22% by 2040. This 22% target will remain stable and be revised once there is greater certainty on future SAF supply; and

power-to-liquid obligation: this obligation will only come into force from 2028, starting at 0.2% of total jet fuel demand and will increase to 0.5% by 2030 and 3.5% in 2040. The PtL approach is similar to the ReFuelEU approach, which has a separate minimum percentage for e-kerosene to encourage demand for this SAF category. PtL certificates may be used to meet the requirements of either the SAF obligation or the PtL obligation.

To demonstrate compliance with the obligations, relevant suppliers must register with the Administrator (the Department for Transport) within 28 days of supplying fuel for use in aircrafts, and either apply for SAF Certificates or pay the buy-out price:

(1) Application for SAF Certificates

Suppliers must apply for these no later than 14 May after the end of an obligation period (which runs from 1 January – 31 December). To do so, they must submit satisfactory evidence to the administrator that the fuel is both eligible and sustainable. All aviation fuels must be approved by a third-party verifier (chosen by the supplier from the administrator’s approved list) tasked with confirming the fuel contains correct proportions of non-SAF and SAF.

At the outset there is no limit to the percentage of HEFA-derived fuels that can be present in SAF, but a cap of 92% will be imposed in 2027, which will decrease to 74.7% by 2030, and fall to 42% by 2040. Unlike ReFuelEU, the UK SAF Mandate does not distinguish between biofuel SAF and eSAF and no further differentiation is envisaged in the SAF Bill that was introduced to the UK Parliament in May 2025. The SAF Bill had its first reading in the UK House of Lords on 20 October 2025, with the date of its second reading to be announced shortly.

Its purpose is to support the production of SAF by establishing a revenue certainty mechanism. Given the higher number of UK biofuel projects currently in development and the high capital and operating costs of eSAF, there is a concern that without ring-fenced funding, support for biofuel projects may come at the cost of advancing eSAF initiatives.

SAF Certificates are characterised as either “Relevant HEFA SAF Certificate”, “Main SAF Certificate” or “PtL SAF Certificate”:

Type of feedstock and/or fuelSAF certificate categorySubject to HEFA cap?Can be used for PtL fuel obligation? HEFA feedstockRelevant HEFA SAF CertificatesYesNo All other SAF (e.g., biofuels from wastes)Main SAF CertificatesNoNo PtLPtL SAF CertificatesNoYes

Suppliers can carry their SAF Certificates forwards to meet up to 25% of their obligation in the following year and they can also transfer them to another party’s account, with the commercial matters of the transfer to be decided between the relevant parties. Whether carried forward or transferred, SAF Certificates will maintain their labels and will only count towards meeting that respective cap or obligation. Suppliers must redeem their SAF Certificates by 15 September following the relevant obligation period.

(2) Paying the buy-out price

Each SAF Certificate discharges 34 megajoules of the obligation. Where a supplier fails to redeem enough SAF Certificates to meet its obligation for any calendar year, it must pay a buy-out price of £0.137 per megajoule required to meet the main obligation and £0.145 per megajoule required to meet the PtL obligation. This differs from ReFuelEU, which does not allow buy-outs and instead imposes penalties on suppliers who are tasked with having to make up for their non-compliance the following year.

(b) ReFuelEU

In 2021, the EU released its ‘Fit for 55’ framework which aims to reduce its net GHG emissions by 55% by 2030. ReFuelEU is part of this regulatory framework and specifically promotes the increased use of SAF as the single most powerful tool to decrease aviation carbon dioxide emissions.

Compared to the UK SAF Mandate, ReFuelEU is broader in scope, applying not only to aviation fuel suppliers, but also to aircraft operators operating more than 500 commercial passenger flights departing from an EU airport per year, and to Union airports where passenger traffic is greater than 800,000 passengers, or where freight traffic is higher than 100,000 tonnes in the previous reporting period. However, Union airports falling below these thresholds have the possibility of opting into the scope of ReFuelEU and thus being treated as Union airports for the purpose of the regulation. ReFuelEU only applies to EU Member States.

(i) Obligations on aviation fuel suppliers

ReFuelEU sets more ambitious long-term targets than the UK SAF Mandate, imposing an obligation on suppliers to supply fuel that contain a minimum of 2% SAF in 2025, escalating incrementally to reach 70% by 2050. It also mirrors the UK SAF Mandate’s PtL obligation by including a synthetic fuels sub-mandate of 1.2% in 2030, increasing to 35% by 2050, ensuring a portion of the SAF used comes from high-potential, low-emission synthetic sources, considered crucial for long-term aviation decarbonisation. Suppliers must also comply with certain reporting requirements by 14 February of each reporting year.

3.5% in 2040

Suppliers who fail to meet their SAF obligations face financial penalties which will be determined by individual EU Member States; however these penalties should be “effective, proportionate, and dissuasive”. ReFuelEU imposes a minimum penalty of at least twice the price difference between SAF and conventional jet fuel, and fuel suppliers will then also be required to supply any unmet fuel obligations in subsequent reporting periods.

CriteriaReFuelEUUK SAF Mandate Penalty StructureEU imposes a penalty to pay at least twice the price difference between kerosene and SAF for failure to meet SAF quotas.The UK uses a buy-out mechanism per litre of shortfall of SAF. Estimated PenaltiesSAF: ~€2,700 per tonne

eSAF: ~€13,992 per tonne (sub-mandate does not begin until 2030)SAF: £4.70/litre (~£5,880/tonne)

PtL: £5/litre (~£6,250/tonne)

(ii) Obligations on aircraft operators

Airlines must refuel at least 90% of their fuel requirements at their departure airport in the EU to prevent circumvention of SAF obligations via tankering (carrying excess fuel from airports outside the EU without such SAF regulations)[1]. There is currently no such equivalent anti-tankering provision under the UK regime. Operators can apply to the competent authority of the relevant EU Member State for temporary exemptions from the obligation to refuel ahead of departure for specific routes. Aircraft operators must also comply with certain reporting requirements by 31 March of each reporting year.

(iii) Obligations on Union airports and their managing bodies

Union airports and their managing bodies must ensure aircraft operators facilitate access to the necessary infrastructure and access to fuel suppliers to meet their SAF obligations under ReFuelEU. Under ReFuelEU, SAF is categorised based on production methods and feedstock sources. These categories are designed to uphold high sustainability standards and promote innovation in low-carbon aviation fuels. Unlike the UK SAF Mandate (under which eligible SAF may be made from discarded crop waste), the EU strictly bans crop-based fuels, except for a limited group of advanced biofuels with a focus on advanced and synthetic eSAF. This ban was reinforced by the EU General Court in 2025.

4. SAF in 2025

Whilst there has been widespread support for the push for SAF in principle, in practice it seems unlikely that the production targets will be met. Meeting a 5% SAF share of global jet fuel demand by 2030 would entail a 15-fold increase in production levels from 2024.⁶ Key hurdles to this include the reluctance of offtakers to sign up to long-term offtake contracts for HEFA derived SAF at 2-7 times the cost of conventional kerosene, let alone to long-term contracts for PtL or eSAF at up to eight times the cost of conventional kerosene. Offtakers argue that prices may come down significantly well before long-term offtake contracts have come to an end and therefore will become uncompetitive.

There also are lingering concerns about some of the technology required for PtL or eSAF production plants. As a result, we are seeing a limited number of projects progressing to Final Investment Decision (“FID”) stage and almost none on the PtL or eSAF segment. No large-scale eSAF plants have reached FID and in recent months we have seen the likes of Shell cancel plans for a large-scale plant in Rotterdam. European airlines have also raised concerns about their ability to compete with airlines that will operate long-haul routes which avoid connections in the EU and therefore avoid the obligation to refuel with a SAF blend.

In the next article of the series, we will examine the interaction between the mandates and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, the respective emissions trading systems in the UK and EU, and proposals to unlock the investment required into production plants in the UK and EU. We will further consider the proposed approach to the revenue certainty mechanism under the UK SAF Mandate, including the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund competition and initiatives such as Project Skypower.

The US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund uses equity and debt capital to develop suppliers and technologies that did not previously exist at commercial scale.

The company's five-year progress report reveals how procurement-led investment can create viable supplier markets and drive value chain transformation.

Procurement strategy demands market creation

Melanie Nakagawa, Microsoft Chief Sustainability Officer, explains the procurement challenge the business faced when establishing the fund.

""Big goals need bold bets,"" she says. ""When we launched Microsoft's US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund in 2020, we knew the road to reaching our ambitious sustainability goals would need to be paved, in part, with new and innovative solutions.

""We needed to invest in technologies that weren't yet at commercial scale or, in some cases, didn't yet exist.""

The procurement approach aims to stimulate supplier development and create competitive markets for emerging climate technologies.

Investment catalyses supplier ecosystem development

The fund has allocated more than US$800m across 67 portfolio investments, according to Melanie.

""On average, every dollar we've invested has attracted 15 more, catalysing billions in follow-on funding,"" she says. ""This kind of multiplier effect is helping move markets and scale innovation.""

The procurement investments span carbon removal technologies, recycling innovation, low-carbon building materials and sustainable aviation fuel, creating viable supplier options across Microsoft's supply chain.

Five procurement principles emerge

The report identifies five strategic approaches that could guide procurement professionals managing sustainability transitions.

Push the frontier: Corporations can expand supplier markets by prioritising technologies based on critical market gaps. Early procurement validates emerging solutions and mobilises financing to accelerate market maturity.

Bridge to mainstream capital: Catalytic procurement investments help create bankable supplier propositions, enabling follow-on investment from traditional financiers and reducing supply risk.

Deliver catalytic impact: Transforming supply chains requires prioritising investments that create systemic change across value chains, demanding procurement approaches that consider both financial and sustainability outcomes.

Partner to amplify: Collaborative procurement involving non-profits, accelerators, peer corporations and policymakers can close critical supplier gaps whilst engaging internal stakeholders.

Accelerate with AI: Artificial intelligence offers procurement professionals enhanced abilities to measure and optimise complex supply chains and accelerate supplier development.

Securing aviation fuel supply

The report highlights how procurement-led investment has secured strategic supplies, including sustainable aviation fuel through supplier Twelve.

Twelve's electrochemical technology converts captured CO2 and water into synthetic fuels and chemicals. Its E-Jet product is a drop-in Power-to-Liquid sustainable aviation fuel made using renewable electricity, water and CO2.

The Climate Innovation Fund's investment supported scaling of Twelve's Moses Lake, Washington facility whilst securing offtake arrangements for Microsoft using book-and-claim accounting.

Microsoft partnered with Alaska Airlines to pioneer this procurement model for sustainable aviation fuel.

""This approach is especially valuable for global business travel, where direct SAF access is limited as most business travel happens through commercial airlines, instead of company-owned aircraft,"" the report says.

Following the Climate Innovation Fund investment, Twelve raised US$645m in follow-on funding, demonstrating how procurement commitments can strengthen supplier viability.

Contracting secures carbon credits

The fund's investment in EFM, a forest investment and management firm, secured long-term supply of carbon removal credits through innovative contracting.

Through EFM Fund IV, the company acquires and transitions forestland in the Western US to improved forest management practices that enhance carbon sequestration, biodiversity and community resilience.

""CIF's investment in EFM Fund IV secured Microsoft access to up to three million tons of high-quality, nature-based carbon removal credits through 2035,"" the report says.

The fund's 15:1 leverage ratio exemplifies how corporate capital can mobilise mainstream financial markets to accelerate decarbonisation at scale.

Catalysing mainstream climate investment

The multiplier effect achieved by Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund could signal a change in how climate technologies access capital markets.

According to the five-year progress report, the company allocated more than US$800m across 67 portfolio investors, with every dollar invested attracting 15 more in follow-on funding.

Melanie Nakagawa, Microsoft Chief Sustainability Officer, says: ""This kind of multiplier effect is helping move markets and scale innovation.""

The report identifies catalytic investors as key to early projects, thanks to their ability to create bankable, scalable ventures.

This enables follow-on investment from mainstream financiers, unlocking lower-cost capital, reducing risk and accelerating scale.

The fund bridges a critical gap between early-stage climate technologies and traditional financial institutions, which typically require proven business models before committing capital.

Microsoft's approach prioritises investments that create change across value chains and industries, requiring an investment approach, team structure and governance model that considers both financial and non-financial outcomes.

The company collaborates with non-profits, accelerators, other corporations and policymakers to close critical gaps in climate finance infrastructure.

Expanding climate technology markets

The Climate Innovation Fund is designed to accelerate the development and deployment of emerging climate innovations through equity and debt capital.

Launched in 2020 alongside Microsoft's sustainability goals to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030, the US$1bn fund targets technologies that are not yet at commercial scale or do not yet exist.

Melanie says: ""Big goals need ambitious bets. When we launched Microsoft's US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund in 2020, we knew the road to reaching our ambitious sustainability goals would need to be paved, in part, with new and innovative solutions.""

The fund's strategy centres on pushing the frontier of climate solutions by prioritising target technologies based on critical and addressable market gaps.

Microsoft acts as an early buyer and mobilises financing to help pull emerging solutions into commercial markets. This approach validates technology pathways that might otherwise struggle to attract capital from risk-averse institutional investors.

The report highlights artificial intelligence as an accelerant for bringing climate solutions online. According to Microsoft, widespread AI availability offers capabilities to measure, predict and optimise complex systems, accelerate the development of sustainability solutions and empower the sustainability workforce.

Scaling innovation through strategic procurement

Microsoft's investment strategy extends beyond capital deployment to include innovative procurement models that create market demand.

The company's investment in Twelve, which uses electrochemical technology to convert captured CO2 and water into synthetic fuels and chemicals, demonstrates this approach.

The Climate Innovation Fund's investment in Twelve supports the scale-up of its Moses Lake, Washington facility and leads to sustainable aviation fuel offtake for Microsoft. The offtake includes book-and-claim accounting, enabling Microsoft to report lower emissions from sustainable aviation fuel use without physical delivery.

Microsoft partners with Alaska Airlines to pioneer the book-and-claim model for sustainable aviation fuel procurement.

CIF was launched in 2020 when Microsoft set groundbreaking sustainability goals to become a carbon negative, water positive and zero waste company by 2030 and to protect land and ecosystems.

The US$1bn CIF was designed to accelerate the development and deployment of emerging climate innovations through equity and debt capital.

Microsoft has now published its five-year progress report, saying it underscores its “core belief that Microsoft’s business thrives when the world thrives.

‘Big goals need bold bets’

Melanie Nakagawa, Microsoft Chief Sustainability Officer, says the business had to bet on things it could not yet see when it launched CIF.

She says: “Big goals need bold bets.

“When we launched Microsoft’s US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund in 2020, we knew the road to reaching our ambitious sustainability goals would need to be paved, in part, with new and innovative solutions.

“We needed to invest in technologies that weren't yet at commercial scale or, in some cases, didn’t yet exist.

“Our hope was that these early investments would spark broader interest and that momentum would help launch and scale solutions the world needs.”

Five clear conclusions

Alongside showcasing the level and success of the investment, the report comes up with five key points that underpin its strategy and guide the coming years.

Push the frontier

It says: “Corporations can help expand the market for emerging solutions by prioritising target technologies based on the most critical and addressable market gaps with relevance to our business. We can validate emerging technology pathways, act as an early buyer, and mobilise financing to help pull these solutions into the market.”

Bridge to mainstream capital

Catalytic investors are key to early projects, thanks to their ability to create bankable, scalable ventures. The report says: “This enables follow-on investment from mainstream financiers – unlocking lower-cost capital, reducing risk and accelerating scale.”

Deliver catalytic impact

Transforming markets requires prioritising investments that create “change across value chains and industries.

“This calls for an investment approach, team structure, and governance model that considers both financial and nonfinancial outcomes.”

Partner to amplify

This includes collaborating with non-profits, accelerators, other corporations and policymakers to close critical gaps, as well as engaging across Microsoft’s product, research and commercial teams.

Turning air into sustainable aviation fuel

The report includes a host of examples of global climate technology projects that have been catalysed by Microsoft’s CIF.

Twelve

Twelve electrochemical technology to convert captured CO2 and water into synthetic fuels and chemicals, including SAF.

Its flagship product, E-Jet, is a drop-in Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF made using renewable electricity, water and CO2.

CIF’s investment in Twelve supported the scale-up of its Moses Lake, Washington facility and led to SAF offtake for Microsoft.

The offtake included book-and-claim accounting, enabling Microsoft to report lower emissions from SAF use without physical delivery.

Microsoft partnered with Alaska Airlines to pioneer the book-and-claim model for SAF procurement.

The report says: “This approach is especially valuable for global business travel, where direct SAF access is limited as most business travel happens through commercial airlines, instead of company-owned aircraft.

“Microsoft’s early participation in the first SAF book-and-claim pilot helped establish a scalable framework that accelerates corporate demand and market growth.”

Following CIF’s investment, Twelve went on to raise US$645m in follow-on funding.

EFM

EFM is a US-based forest investment and management firm focused on climate-smart forestry.

Through its fourth fund, EFM Fund IV, the company aims to buy and transition forestland in the Western US to improved forest management practices that enhance carbon sequestration, biodiversity and community resilience.

The report says: “CIF’s investment in EFM Fund IV secured Microsoft access to up to three million tons of high-quality, nature-based carbon removal credits through 2035.

New business model in plain language

The platform is free to join and deploy, with farmers receiving overarching health status views at no cost. Users only pay when requesting detailed diagnostic reports, eliminating fixed monthly subscription fees that often deter adoption.

""It's a new business model that's out there where it's free to join, free to deploy, free to get an overarching view of what's going on, and only have to pay if and when you want detailed insights,"" he said.

The platform employs large language models to convert complex data into plain-language summaries.

""You could just get a simple statement that says, it's this farm, it's this barn, it kicked off yesterday afternoon. Put it on your radar. That is really quick and efficient and in a world and a language I can understand,” Speller said.

Currently operational in 23 countries across broiler, layer and breeder sectors — as well as swine — Optifarm is actively expanding its U.S. presence while seeking collaborations with equipment manufacturers and health service providers. The insurance sector, for instance, uses the platform to monitor disease pressure globally, offering premium discounts to farms that share their data — similar to black box systems in auto insurance.

“We have aligned the two networks in a better way, freeing up 737s in Norwegian so we can put that capacity into summer leisure destinations,” CEO Geir Karlsen said during the company’s Q3 results presentation.

During Q3, Norwegian increased capacity by 2% and Wideroe by 3%. However, Norwegian is reducing monthly capacity by 25% to 40% heading into the winter 2025-26 season—about a 5% year-on-year cut—to align with lower demand, while bookings are currently ahead of 2024 levels.

Beyond Norway, Norwegian is expanding its footprint in Denmark, where it announced 10 new routes from Billund for summer 2026, including services to Barcelona, Chania, Edinburgh, Rome, Gran Canaria, Malta, Milan Bergamo, Naples, Nice and Porto. The network expansion builds on existing routes to Alicante, London, Malaga, Oslo and Palma de Mallorca.

The carrier has also won a Danish government tender to operate the Aalborg-Copenhagen route using aircraft fueled with at least 40% sustainable aviation fuel from spring 2026. Refueling will take place at Aalborg Airport in cooperation with AFSN, DCC and Shell Aviation, and the initiative is expected to cut lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by about 6,700 metric tons annually.

Elsewhere in the region, Norwegian is building a presence in the Baltic market through a new base at Riga Airport, opened in April 2024. The base is currently home to two 737-8 aircraft.

Karlsen said the Riga operation has quickly expanded beyond Nordic routes. “We started flying mainly into the Nordics,” he said. “But today we’re also flying to other destinations in Europe from Riga. AirBaltic is moving more into a wet-lease role, so this is a market we’re very much looking into, and hopefully we can grow the base into other European markets as well.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-10-22 12:01:28.131992

Two panels closed out the morning general sessions with discussions on advanced vehicle compatibility and infrastructure requirements and ethanol applications in marine fuel — policy, technology and feasibility.

“There are more than 100 million tons of ethanol produced every year, and maritime will double or triple that need in the future,” said Zoltan Szabo, secretary general for the Climate Ethanol Alliance. “Maritime needs fuels that are low carbon, available, scalable and low cost — ethanol ticks all of those boxes.”

The afternoon began with flash talks from experts about scaling proven SAF solutions through ethanol-to-jet pathways.

The conference continued with a panel discussion featuring airline experts speaking to the industry collaboration around SAF.

“SAF is a market opportunity for the agriculture sector,” said Tom Michels, director of government affairs at United Airlines. “The US uses about 22 billion gallons of jet fuel a year, and right now, less than 1% of that is SAF. Every bit of that 22 billion gallons is something that the ethanol industry could eventually serve.”

Joint Commitment to Decarbonizing Aviation

Airbus and the Cathay Group have entered a co-investment partnership worth up to US$70 million to accelerate the development and scale-up of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, with a particular focus on Asia’s growing aviation sector. The announcement was made in Hong Kong during the IATA World Sustainability Symposium, underscoring the increasing urgency for cross-industry collaboration to decarbonize air travel.

The partnership, formalised at a ceremony attended by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan and Airbus President for Asia-Pacific Anand Stanley, will fund SAF projects that demonstrate strong commercial viability, mature technology readiness, and credible pathways for long-term offtake.

Building a Scalable SAF Value Chain

Both companies emphasised that scaling SAF will require deep, system-wide coordination — from policymakers and investors to fuel producers and airlines. The joint fund is designed to target projects that can overcome early-stage financing and infrastructure barriers that have constrained the global SAF market, which currently accounts for less than 1% of total aviation fuel use.

“SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our decarbonization goals,” said McGowan. “This co-investment partnership with Airbus strengthens our commitment to building a scalable SAF industry and complements our broader strategy of investing in technologies and production capacity for the future.”

Cathay’s existing initiatives include participation in the oneworld alliance’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Fund and agreements with multiple fuel producers to expand SAF availability at major hubs.

Airbus Expands Industry Collaboration

For Airbus, the partnership represents a continuation of its SAF-focused collaborations with airlines and energy companies worldwide. The aircraft manufacturer has committed to ensuring all of its aircraft are capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030 and has established partnerships with fuel suppliers and governments to accelerate market uptake.

“The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach,” said Stanley. “Our partnership with Cathay is a tangible step toward catalysing production in regions best positioned for growth and feedstock supply.”

RELATED ARTICLE: Airbus and LanzaJet to Collaborate on Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production

Strengthening Asia’s Role in SAF Production

Beyond financing projects, Airbus and Cathay plan to jointly advocate for supportive policy frameworks that strengthen both SAF supply and demand across Asia. The region’s abundant feedstock potential — from agricultural residues to waste oils — and rapidly expanding aviation market make it a critical frontier for SAF deployment.

By leveraging their combined experience and networks, the two companies intend to influence policies that reduce cost disparities between SAF and conventional jet fuel, promote regional production hubs, and ensure consistent certification standards.

Asia’s aviation industry is projected to account for more than 40% of global passenger traffic by 2040, according to IATA. However, limited SAF supply and uneven regulatory support remain major challenges. The Airbus-Cathay initiative could serve as a blueprint for other regional partnerships linking airlines, manufacturers, and investors.

Longstanding Partnership and Future Outlook

The collaboration builds on a relationship that spans more than three decades. Cathay took delivery of its first Airbus aircraft in 1989 and now operates a fleet of 86 Airbus jets, with over 70 more on order. Their shared investment in SAF reflects a deepening alignment between the manufacturer and one of Asia’s leading carriers on climate transition priorities.

For global aviation leaders and investors, the move illustrates a shifting dynamic: airlines and OEMs are increasingly co-investing in upstream fuel infrastructure, recognising that long-term decarbonisation depends on securing scalable, cost-competitive SAF supply.

As governments prepare to enforce tighter carbon-reduction targets under ICAO’s CORSIA framework and national net-zero policies, collaborations like the Airbus-Cathay partnership will play a critical role in bridging the gap between technological readiness and commercial deployment — a decisive step in reshaping the global aviation fuel landscape.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/airbus.webp,N,,2025-10-22 12:01:37.528329

It builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Their second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: “We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, said: “We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF—sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials—into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe. Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialization will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.”

Nathalie Stubler, Safran Chief Sustainability Officer comments: “At Safran, we are committed to advancing the decarbonization of aviation. In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.”

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: “OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors, we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.”

Dr Robert Trezona, Partner, Cleantech at IP Group, said: “This round is a significant milestone, not just for the Company, but for the sector – significant capital being put to work from established industry actors on a credible path to fully decarbonise aviation. OXCCU showcases the UK’s ability to lead in climate innovation, turning world-class science into global solutions, while generating jobs and lasting impact. We’re proud to continue to support the company as it scales its compelling single-step technology.”

OXCCU’s solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

“This is a critical time for climate tech, as the urgency continues to increase” added Symes. “Aviation needs a solution, and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.”",https://ethicalmarketingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-twitter-logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 12:56:25.406345

When the U.S. government launched the ""Grand Challenge"" in 2021, promising to help airlines use 3billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030, farmers saw a future beyond traditional ethanol. But those ambitions are now facing headwinds. The Biden-era program is gone, and a key SAF tax credit has been cut from $1.75 to $1 per gallon under President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"", placing SAF on equal footing with renewable diesel-a cheaper and more established fuel.

This change to the 45Z clean fuels tax credit has rattled investors and producers. Without enhanced incentives, capital may flow to renewable diesel rather than SAF, which is more expensive to produce. Imported feedstocks, like used cooking oil, were also excluded from the credit, further tightening margins.

""These projects are not attracting private capital, and so the role of government in helping launch the industry is super important,"" said Bruce Fleming, CEO of Montana Renewables, one of the few facilities producing SAF at commercial scale. His company plans to ship fuel to Minneapolis-St. Paul for Delta Air Lines, but scaling up remains difficult.

""Currently, the SAF market is a mixed bag of policies and producers who are facing different challenges and realities,"" added Pat Gruber, CEO of Gevo, which intends to produce SAF from corn ethanol in North Dakota. ""In the end, products must be economical to be adopted.""

The financial strain is already showing. Phillips66 reported $185million in renewable fuels losses in Q1 and $133million in Q2, blaming restrictive credit rules and new limitations on foreign feedstocks. U.S. SAF production reached over 100million gallons in 2024, up from 5million in 2021, but still far below its 465million-gallon capacity. ""With all the investment that has happened, we don't see capacity utilization fully yet, and that's not good news,"" said Andreea Moyes of Airbp.

Incentives remain a sticking point. Moyes noted that the original 75-cent SAF credit covered the cost gap between renewable diesel and SAF. With that now gone, U.S. producers struggle to compete with Europe and the U.K., where mandates guarantee demand. Industry leaders argue they need several additional dollars per gallon in incentives to make SAF viable long term.

Beyond economics, policy uncertainty is also clouding investment. Reema Bari of Shell Aviation warned that long project timelines-four to seven years-require bipartisan policy backing to secure financing. At Montana Renewables, logistical costs alone-like shipping fuel to Los Angeles-add 37 cents per gallon, further eroding margins.

Some producers are exploring ""book and claim"" credit systems, which allow corporations to buy SAF carbon credits without physically moving the fuel. Fleming argues this could lower costs, but the system faces scrutiny after investigations into fraud involving renewable energy certificates.

There are still bright spots. Gevo recently received a loan guarantee extension from the U.S. Department of Energy, shifting its first ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) facility to North Dakota, where carbon can be stored nearby. LanzaJet's Georgia project is also close to starting production, though tariffs on Brazilian sugarcane ethanol have caused delays.

For farmers and ethanol producers, SAF still represents a potential new demand driver at a time when electric vehicles and efficient engines are eroding ethanol's role in gasoline. But as Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, warned at the SAF North America conference, the industry's messaging may need to shift away from climate rhetoric. ""There's a lot in terms of the value proposition here,"" she said. ""But carbon performance is not going to speak to this administration. We need to talk about what this means for farmers and rural America.""

Airbus and the Cathay Group have launched a joint co investment fund of up to seventy million United States dollars dedicated to expanding the production of sustainable aviation fuel known as SAF. The fund will seek Asian projects with the best potential to deliver large volumes before 2030 and then replicate successful models worldwide. Both companies will review candidate plants for commercial viability, technology readiness and long term offtake potential, ensuring every dollar supports solutions that can scale rapidly.

Why Asia Is Central

Asia enjoys abundant feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste and surplus ethanol. Combined with rising regional passenger growth, this makes the continent an ideal proving ground for SAF. Airbus brings decades of engineering knowledge and a vast airline customer base, while Cathay contributes regional market intelligence and an immediate appetite for fuel. Together they can provide offtake agreements that give producers predictable revenue, a key ingredient that unlocks third party investment.

The Non-Obvious Advantage

One often overlooked lever is policy advocacy. By working side by side, an aircraft manufacturer and an airline can present a united voice to governments. Past studies show that when both supply and demand stakeholders jointly request incentives, decision makers respond forty percent faster on average than when they lobby separately. This partnership therefore magnifies influence and could shorten regulatory timelines for new plants, saving precious years in the decarbonisation journey.

What Happens Next

In addition to scouting projects, the partners will promote supportive measures such as feedstock certification schemes and import duty relief for early volumes. They will also share lessons from their investment vehicle with peers, aiming to spark a multiplier effect across the broader industry.

-- The Cathay Group and Airbus have announced a joint investment agreement of up to US$70 million (HK$545 million) to accelerate the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in Asia and globally.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium at a ceremony hosted by Cathay Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific Anand Stanley.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers. This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Cathay’s Alex McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organisations.”

Airbus’s Anand Stanley said: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia. With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

Last month, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate investment firm founded by Bill Gates. That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs. Complementing this, the Cathay–Airbus partnership announced today will target more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability.

Cathay and Airbus have a long-standing partnership dating back to 1989, when the airline placed its first order for Airbus aircraft. Today, the Cathay Group operates more than 85 Airbus aircraft, with an outstanding order for over 70 more to be delivered.

Stockholm Arlanda Airport implements Established on RNP, allowing more curved approaches, reducing emissions, increasing landing efficiency, and supporting airlines’ transition to sustainable aviation fuel.

Swedavia and Luftfartsverket (LFV) have become the first in Europe to introduce a new air traffic approach concept, known as Established on RNP (EoR), at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. The innovation enables aircraft to perform more curved approaches than before, marking a major step towards improving air traffic capacity, efficiency, and sustainability.

“For us, it is of course gratifying that Swedavia will be the first in Europe to apply the new concept for managing arrivals. Enabling more curved approaches is also the most effective way to support airlines in their transition work, in addition to facilitating increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” said Susanne Norman, Director of Operations at Swedavia.

The new approach method allows more flexible and efficient arrivals by increasing the number of aircraft that can land per hour while reducing overall emissions. Aircraft flying the curved approach follow shorter flight paths, while reduced congestion on the main arrival runway cuts fuel burn and delays. Airlines, however, must have a special permit from their National Supervisory Authority to conduct these procedures.

Anna Granberg, Director of Operations at Luftfartsverket, said: “The modernisation of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation. The traffic flow into Stockholm Arlanda Airport becomes more efficient during peak hours, and arriving aircraft have shorter flight paths with reduced emissions.”

Airlines have also welcomed the initiative. Charlotte Holmbergh, Country Director Corporate Affairs at Norwegian, said: “We are very pleased with the initiative from Swedavia and the Swedish Air Traffic Control Provider (LFV) to implement new procedures that will increase the number of curved approaches (RNP AR – Required Navigation Performance, Authorisation Required) at Arlanda. Shorter approaches result in lower fuel burn and reduced emissions. Our goal is to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2030, and more efficient flight operations like this are among our top priorities, alongside increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continuous fleet renewal.”

Similarly, SAS has praised the development. “SAS welcomes all initiatives that help reduce fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. The introduction of the new approach concept is a step in the right direction towards a more efficient and more sustainable airspace around Arlanda,” said Alexandra Lindgren Kaoukji, Head of External Communication and PR at SAS.

The EoR technique requires specially equipped aircraft, trained pilots, and authorisation from the relevant authority. Alongside its environmental benefits, the new system encourages airlines to invest in technology that enables curved approaches, helping to further minimise overflight of noise-sensitive areas.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/air-traffic-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 07:56:12.061207

The ISCC CORSIA certification ensures rigorous sustainability and traceability standards for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in international aviation markets. The certification process began after obtaining authorisation from the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP) for the production of SAF in May 2025, culminating in the issuance of the ISCC certificate in October. SAF can directly replace conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or fuelling infrastructure. This makes the fuel a practical and rapid solution for reducing emissions in the aviation sector.

Reduc has authorisation from the ANP to incorporate up to 1.2% renewable feedstock into its SAF production through this route. The refinery is expected to begin production in the coming months to sell up to 50 000 m³/month (10 000 bpd) of the fuel. The use of low-carbon feedstock and the renewable compound content of the fuel are compatible with the requirement for a 1% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for domestic aviation by 2027.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum renewable feedstocks including woody biomass and fats and greases.

Currently, SAF can be used in blends between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and its production.

Using SAF offers many benefits, including more flexibility in production technologies, compatibility with engines and infrastructure and fewer emissions.

SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% if used in a 100% blend, compared with traditional jet fuel.

100% SAF: Honda’s mission

Honda Aircraft Company has become the first twin-turbine very light business jet manufacturer to successfully fuel a flight running a 100% blend of sustainable aviation fuels.

The HondaJet model flew over the Greensboro area of North Carolina, US before landing at the company’s global headquarters at Piedmont Triad International Airport.

The company previously produced early demonstrations of 100% SAF use in 2022 and 2023, with tests of its HF120 engine on the ground.

Amod Kelkar, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Honda Aircraft Company, says: “We are immensely proud of our Honda Aircraft Company engineering team carrying forward our commitment to the future of aviation by demonstrating that the HondaJet is capable of operating on a 100% SAF blend.

“This achievement is a step toward aligning our business activities with the global Honda goal of decarbonising our business activities by 2050.”

Suppliers provided 32.1 million tonnes of aviation fuel overall to EU airports but only 192,700t was sustainable.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency gave the figure in a report detailing findings for 2024, the first year of ReFuelEU Aviation implementation.

EASA states that two-thirds of 123 obligated fuel suppliers complied with the requirement to submit reports.

“This somewhat lower compliance rate can largely be attributed to the fact that the primary obligation to supply a minimum share of [sustainable aviation fuel] was not yet applicable,” it says.

EASA also suggests the “first-time nature” of the 2024 period probably kept reporting rates low. But the data nevertheless has been valuable, it adds, serving as a “dry run” and offering insights into the preparedness of stakeholders.

According to the fuel suppliers’ submissions, almost the entirety of sustainable fuel provided to EU airports – about 98% – comprised aviation biofuels, with those obtained from cooking oil feedstock accounting for 81%.

While the quantity of sustainable fuel supplied was low, EASA says it reduced carbon emissions by 91% compared with the conventional fuel it replaced.

Aircraft operators purchased about 358,000t of sustainable fuel last year – about 0.81% of the total uplifted fuel at EU airports.

EASA found a “notable increase” in the number of EU countries hosting sustainable fuel production activity – listing 17 in total, up from 12 the previous year.

It forecasts three scenarios for sustainable fuel production in 2030, estimating available capacity at between 1.4 million and 5.2 million tonnes depending on progress with facilities. The most optimistic scenario would also provide a further 700,000t made up of synthetic aviation fuel.

China Airlines Ltd (CAL) yesterday morning joined SkyTeam’s Aviation Challenge for the fourth time, operating a demonstration flight for “net zero carbon emissions” from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to Bangkok.

The flight used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at a ratio of up to 40 percent, the highest proportion CAL has achieved to date, the nation’s largest carrier said.

Since April, SAF has become available to Taiwanese international carriers at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport), Kaohsiung International Airport and Taoyuan airport.

In previous challenges, CAL operated “net zero carbon emission flights” to Singapore and Japan.

At a ceremony at Taoyuan airport, China Airlines chief sustainability officer Ren Cheng (鄭智仁) said the Taoyuan-Bangkok flight, CI831, used a 40 percent blend of SAF supplied by CPC Corp, Taiwan, reducing carbon emissions by nearly 20 tonnes for the round trip.

The remaining carbon emissions would be offset through purchases from a globally recognized environmental, social and corporate governance-compliant carbon offset program, Cheng said.

The Taipei-Bangkok flight had about 7.7 tonnes of SAF added to the standard fuel, the airline said.

For the return flight, CI832, SAF was purchased from Thailand’s PTT Oil and Retail Business and blended at 1 percent, it said.

Apart from using SAF, the demonstration flight offered eco-friendly onboard services, including digital menus in all cabins, it said.

Utensils in the economy-class section were made of recycled stainless steel, while lids for meals, plastic cups, pillowcases, headrest covers and restroom supply containers were made of recycled polyethylene terephthalate, CAL said, adding that passengers were given forest stewardship council-certified paper cups and biodegradable dental floss sticks.

Plastic wraps for blankets were replaced with paper rings and each passenger was given an eco-friendly ballpoint pen made of cork as a souvenir, it said.

The airline also worked with Little Tree Food (小小樹食), a Taipei-based Michelin Green Star restaurant, to provide vegetarian cuisine on the CI831 flight, it said.

The vegetarian meals were Thai cuisine made with plant-based meat, with Thai rice and pandan coconut jelly as dessert, the airline said.

In addition to its partnerships with CPC, CAL in July signed a memorandum of understanding with Formosa Petrochemical Corp to procure more than 10,000 tonnes of SAF over the next three years.",https://img.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/10/22/p03-251022-009.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 07:56:31.071261

This roughly translates to a cost of almost US$35 per passenger per year, a figure five times higher than the approximately US$7 the airline industry makes on average per year with every passenger it carries.
“If the levies don’t lead to significant increases in SAF production, then they are not achieving what they were intended to do, and a new design is needed,” Walsh stated.
Walsh said IATA had raised this issue in Brussels with European regulators and legislators, as airlines sought ways to prevent this practice.
While admitting the matter required further assessment, he specifically highlighted Singapore’s SAF mandate plan, noting that, even if it contained some interesting elements, initial analysis suggested it could encounter similar problems to the European approach, particularly its inability to effectively encourage SAF production.","Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed concern about the way airlines are made to carry most of the burden of the European Union’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate.

Speaking at the 3rd IATA World Sustainability Symposium, which is taking place in Hong Kong, October 21-22, 2025, Walsh stated that, while the airline industry remains committed to decarbonization, some elements of the current mandate design are not fit for purpose.

According to the airline executive, rather than leading to a boost in SAF production, as was intended by regulators, the mandate, which sets minimum SAF procurement requirements for airlines over time, has led to price hikes for airlines while production remains way below expectations.

Walsh, who was joined on stage by IATA’s VP Sustainability & Chief Economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, quantified the cost of the airline industry’s transition to net zero at US$174 billion per year. This roughly translates to a cost of almost US$35 per passenger per year, a figure five times higher than the approximately US$7 the airline industry makes on average per year with every passenger it carries.

Both Walsh and Owens Thomsen dismissed comments from industry figures critical of the industry’s net zero goals. Ryanair’s CEO Michael O’Leary has notoriously stated that the “net zero agenda is dead.” However, while both defended the decarbonization drive as necessary over the long term, they called for a different approach.

“If the levies don’t lead to significant increases in SAF production, then they are not achieving what they were intended to do, and a new design is needed,” Walsh stated.

In this regard, Walsh highlighted the United States’ approach in providing incentives as having yielded more tangible results than the European one. This difference in approach is often referred to in the industry as the “carrot vs. stick” debate.

The airline executive, who is known in the industry for being outspoken, also denounced that the lion’s share of the SAF mandate costs have fallen on the airlines, while other operators had been benefiting from them.

In particular Walsh was critical of fuel suppliers, which, he said, had raised prices well above the expected differential between SAF and conventional fuel, linking this markup to a “compliance surcharge”. Walsh said IATA had raised this issue in Brussels with European regulators and legislators, as airlines sought ways to prevent this practice.

At this point, Owens Thomsen noted that, despite its fundamental role in society and the broader economy, commercial aviation had historically been a low margin, low profit industry, with net margins never surpassing 5% on average for the ensemble of carriers. She contraposed this to the much larger profit margins enjoyed by the oil and gas industry.

Replying to questions by journalists from the Asia-Pacific region, Walsh issued a note of caution regarding the steps other countries are taking to follow the European example.

While admitting the matter required further assessment, he specifically highlighted Singapore’s SAF mandate plan, noting that, even if it contained some interesting elements, initial analysis suggested it could encounter similar problems to the European approach, particularly its inability to effectively encourage SAF production.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, with lifecycle GHG emissions substantially lower than conventional fuels. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, however, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

“SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to building a stronger, more scalable SAF industry.”

Through the new agreement, the two companies will jointly identify and fund SAF projects that demonstrate commercial promise, technological readiness and potential for long-term supply arrangements in a bid to increase production capacity and ultimately help the aviation sector reduce its carbon footprint in the coming decade.

Anand Stanley, President of Asia Pacific at Airbus, said:

“This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference.

Camelina oil is also increasingly being used as a cooking oil.","The evidence-based review, Oil based cover crops for aviation fuel in Scotland - question and answer report, explores the options for growing oil producing oil seed plants in Scotland to produce aviation fuel. Undertaking this review was one of the key recommendations for Government emanating from the recent Project Willow report, a joint UK and Scottish Government feasibility study that explored low-carbon industrial alternatives for Scotland's Grangemouth site.

The primary option is camelina, which is already grown in several other countries for aviation fuel and is also grown in the UK for the health food market. It is seen as a possible alternative, along with oil seed rape, due to the quality of its oil.

A further project will now investigate how camelina will grow in Scottish conditions and how it could fit into Scotland’s agricultural rotations, as well as the potential impacts, positive and negative, on the environment through a series of small field trials.

“Camelina, particularly winter grown camelina, is a relatively novel crop for Scotland” said Dr Tracy Valentine, senior research scientist at the Hutton, who will lead the field trials project. “By growing over winter, we hope to fit in with the main spring cropping season. Initially we will be looking at frost tolerance, growth rates, pests and fertiliser requirements, and ease of crop agronomy for farmers. This work will help to understand the potential for camelina to be grown as a biofuel crop in Scotland. Camelina is an oil seed plant, similar to oil seed rape and is part of the Brassicaceae (commonly known as mustard) plant family. It is widely grown across north America and Europe and is used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production due to its high oil content and ultra-low carbon intensity compared to other alternative crops.”

One tonne of camelina seeds can be converted into approximately 200-230 litres of aviation fuel though this amount varies depending on factors like the seed's oil content, which is typically 38-47 percent. A light aircraft burns, on average, 22 to 45 litres of fuel per hour.

Camelina oil is also increasingly being used as a cooking oil. It is rich in vitamin E and omega fatty acids and has a higher smoking point than most other cooking oils.

The Hutton offers world-leading scientific solutions to the challenges posed by the climate and nature crises and is well-placed to contribute to the Scottish Government’s ambitious target of 2045 for Scotland to reach net zero emissions for all greenhouse gases.

SRUC is committed to tackling some of the major challenges facing the world, including climate change, biodiversity loss and food security.

“At current market prices, economic viability would have to be considered, as its production is currently less competitive than other main crops in Scotland” added Dr Shailesh Shrestha, an agricultural economist at SRUC.

2025 is a landmark year for the UK’s aviation industry as it continues to make the transition to net zero. Recognised as a carbon-intensive sector, aviation faces a steep challenge to cut emissions. Yet meeting those objectives in lockstep with increasing global demand represents a significant opportunity for UK aerospace, which continues to be at the cutting edge of engine technology, wing production, aerostructures and design.

The truth is that the transition to net zero will be met by a cocktail of solutions. The global aircraft fleet is already 80% more fuel efficient than it was half a century ago, while each new generation of aircraft is 15-25% more fuel efficient than the preceding model.

That said, if more efficient and quieter aircraft are one solution, are there others? Airspace modernisation and contrail avoidance will go some way to reducing emissions. Disruptive technologies such as hydrogen and battery-powered aircraft will also support the transition. But hydrogen-powered aircraft for long-haul flights are not likely to arrive before 2050, and electric aircraft will serve a different purpose, operating at a smaller, regional scale.

Perhaps the most significant near-term solution, more efficient aircraft notwithstanding, is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF reduces greenhouse gases by 70% on a lifecycle basis compared to kerosene. Further, in being compatible with existing infrastructure and technology, SAF represents an ideal alternative.

2025 is a big year for SAF in the UK. At the start of this year, a SAF Mandate was introduced, requiring fuel suppliers to use SAF for 2% of the fuel blend this year. This increases linearly to 10% by 2030, setting a guaranteed level of demand and supporting increased SAF production.

Sustainable aviation fuel policy priorities

The UK Government expects industry to require approximately 286 million litres of SAF this year to meet the mandate. But industry is already delivering above and beyond expectations, with provisional statistics from the Department for Transport revealing that 330 million litres were supplied to the UK last year alone. For the first time, the statistics also showed that the UK took delivery of 2 million litres of second-generation SAF, that is to say, organic municipal solid waste and sewage sludge.

With that said, almost all the SAF being supplied to the UK is derived from vegetable oils, fatty acids and waste cooking oils. While that represents the cheapest and most plentiful SAF, policies must be introduced to support advanced SAFs, which do not draw on valuable feedstocks. Action is also required to drive domestic SAF production, ensuring the UK does not miss out on a prized economic opportunity. Contextually, the Department for Transport estimates that SAF production could support up to 10,000 jobs by 2035 and generate £1.8 billion gross value added every year.

That is why Parliament is currently considering a Bill to introduce a Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM). This will give industry the confidence it needs to invest in SAF production by setting a General Strike Price, the same mechanism used to incentivise investment in renewable energy through the Contracts for Difference Scheme.

The aviation and aerospace sectors warmly welcome this initiative. Access to a reliable, affordable stream of SAF will be critical in the years ahead. However, the UK is competing in a global market where other nations are also standing up their own SAF industries.

It is, therefore, disappointing that the RCM will be funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers when the sector already pays for sustainability initiatives through the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The UK also levies the highest rate of air passenger duty in Europe by a considerable margin. While we accept the ‘polluter pays’ principle, industry levies can only be used a few times before the UK’s international competitiveness is fundamentally compromised.

In internationalised sectors like aerospace and aviation, companies are highly mobile and operate out of those countries with favourable tax regimes and business environments. The UK should not risk future competitiveness by assuming industry has boundless scope to fund sustainability initiatives.

The single biggest thing the Government must do, however, is pass the Bill quickly. Currently, the Government have committed that the Bill will be enacted by the end of 2026. However, this leaves too little time for industry to respond before the SAF Mandate’s Power to Liquid obligation comes into force in 2028. Given the scale of a SAF plant, it is doubtful that the industry can navigate the planning process, complete construction, and operationalise in such a short period.

Succeeding in the global race to supply the SAF industry

The window of time for getting this right is narrow and closing quickly. While we are encouraged that the UK Government’s policy direction of travel is the right one, there is no time to waste if we are going to succeed in the global race to supply the SAF industry’s needs to meet its obligations.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-2206887611.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 04:56:12.012718

Cutting costs. That’s the name of the game in agriculture these days.

The Propane Education & Research Council is investing directly in farmers to advance clean, reliable energy on the farm. Through its Propane Farm Research Program, PERC offers growers the chance to offset costs of converting ag equipment to propane while contributing real-world data to help guide future propane technology.

The program applies to a wide range of equipment — from irrigation engines and building heat to power generation.

At Husker Harvest Days in September, Mike Newland, PERC’s director of agriculture business development, discussed the council rebate offers, which cover up to 25% of the cost — or $10,000 per unit — with participants eligible for rebates in each product category. Details are available at propane.com/pfrp.

Rather than hiring outside research firms, PERC compensates farmers to report back on their experiences using new propane technologies.

“We’re paying people to report their experience with a new piece of equipment and fuel,” Newland explained. Instead of hiring third-party researchers, real customers generate the data.

As electricity demand grows, propane offers a dependable and sustainable alternative. A Department of Energy study released in July highlighted ongoing grid instability. As a naturally clean energy source, propane offers a solution to this problem.

“We think this is one great way that we can help to get some of that demand off of the grid and onto a very clean, sustainable fuel source of propane,” Newland said.

At HHD, PERC showcased three propane irrigation engines — two from Industrial Irrigation in Hastings, Neb. — demonstrating how propane continues to power efficient irrigation.

Livestock industry

In livestock production, propane remains critical for both heat and backup power. Reserved as an emergency resource, this backup fuel tends to sit for a while.

However, when an emergency takes place, that fuel needs to be ready to go. Unlike diesel, which can degrade when stored, propane stays ready for emergencies.

“You have to be paying attention to diesel — you have to be conditioning it from time to time,” Newland said. “Propane doesn’t have those fuel quality issues.”

He went on to discuss the balanced goals in the agricultural industry and the influence that clean energy brings to the table. “I think in agriculture, we're all about being efficient, but also about being environmentally sound as well,” Newland explained.

Agriculture functions are the harmony of meeting a bottom line while also being conscious of the environment, which is the source of the industry.

Operators of heavy equipment know the battle with pollutant cleansing systems, such as DEF, all too well. The constant expense, compounded by reduced fuel economy, creates an ongoing operational challenge.

However, propane is officially recognized by the federal government as a clean alternative energy, simplifying operations and eliminating after-treatment systems. Moreover, as a viable resource in all climates, users don’t have to worry about temperature-related issues either.

Market dynamics and supply

As a leading producer in propane, the U.S. consumes only about 40% of these energy supplies domestically, with roughly 60% exported overseas. That balance has kept prices stable. But it raises questions about supply during heavy-use seasons.

Although the impact that tariffs have on the industry affects parts and component suppliers to some extent, Newland described the security within the industry. “Fuel prices have been very stable for a lot of years here,” he said.

With the grain-drying season, Newland urged producers to plan early.

To help growers estimate their propane needs, PERC offers an online grain drying calculator at propane.com. Farmers can enter acreage, yield and moisture data to get a rough estimate for planning.

“It’ll give you a rough calculation,” Newland explained. “It’s close enough that you can take that information to your supplier, have an initial conversation and get started on the planning.”

He cautioned against last-minute calls. “I know people who make that first call from the combine seat on the way to the first cornfield,” Newland said.

He encouraged producers to give their local suppliers time to consider personal situations and aid in developing the best, personalized plan for each operation.

PERC is backing new agricultural uses for propane, including a soil-injection technology that sterilizes seeds and controls nematodes. “It’s replacing a soil fumigant that isn’t great from an environmental standpoint,” Newland said. “This process is organic, and those acres will be qualified for organic production.”

The council is also researching renewable propane, created as a byproduct of sustainable aviation fuel. The renewable form has the same chemical structure but a lower carbon intensity.

“Any sustainable aviation fuel that’s created has a stream of propane that comes off that process,” Newland said. “It is renewable propane that would be used just like conventional propane.”

While renewable propane will likely reach on-road markets first because of pricing incentives, agriculture will eventually benefit.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltdd0fb129a84008d6/68f25e6a8363acd4b1fde75a/1020W1-1463A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-22 07:57:02.879633

Supersonic flight burns more fuel than subsonic flight.
Supersonic flight will remain a niche product for those willing to pay premium prices for time savings.","FREEHOLD- A company called FlyConcorde Ltd. is planning to bring back supersonic passenger flights, nearly 20 years after the original Concorde retired. The new aircraft could start service as early as 2026, though significant challenges remain before that becomes a reality.

The original Concorde stopped flying in 2003 after 27 years of service. High operating costs, limited routes, and a fatal crash in 2000 led to its retirement. Now, new technology and changed regulations are making another attempt possible.

Is Concorde to Make A Return?

The biggest change happened in the United States in June 2025. Congress passed legislation lifting the ban on supersonic flight over land. This ban had severely restricted where Concorde could fly. The aircraft could only go supersonic over oceans, limiting its route options and commercial viability.

Without this restriction, supersonic aircraft can operate more routes profitably. London to New York remains the obvious choice, but now domestic U.S. routes are becoming possible. Los Angeles to Washington could work, so could transcontinental routes across Europe or Asia.

Technology has also advanced significantly since Concorde’s era. The new design reportedly weighs 50 percent less than the original. It will use sustainable aviation fuel instead of conventional jet fuel.

The new aircraft design will allow it to cruise at altitudes up to 60,000 feet. This is way higher than the original Concorde’s typical cruising altitude.

Most importantly, engineers claim the new design produces much less sonic boom. The original Concorde’s loud sonic boom was a major problem. It damaged the aircraft’s public image and led to the overland flight bans. Reducing this noise is critical for any supersonic comeback.

Flight Time Reductions

The appeal of supersonic travel is obvious — dramatically shorter flight times. London to New York currently takes about 7 hours on today’s commercial aircraft. The new supersonic plane could cut that to 2-3 hours. Los Angeles to Washington drops from 5-6 hours to around 2 hours.

For business travelers, this time savings matters significantly. However, industry experts caution that this won’t be for everyone. It’s unlikely to appeal to average holidaymakers. The tickets will be expensive. The aircraft will be small, carrying far fewer passengers than modern widebody jets.

Airports need modifications to handle supersonic operations. Air traffic control systems must adapt. Ground handling procedures differ from conventional aircraft. All this requires investment and coordination.

What Challenges Remain?

Economic viability is the first major question. The original Concorde never made money for British Airways or Air France. Operating costs were extremely high. Ticket prices had to match those costs, limiting the potential customer base to wealthy business travelers and celebrities.

The new aircraft will be more efficient but still expensive to operate. Supersonic flight burns more fuel than subsonic flight. Even with sustainable aviation fuel, costs shall remain high. The small passenger capacity means each ticket needs to generate significant revenue.

Sonic boom concerns haven’t completely disappeared. While the new design reduces noise, it doesn’t eliminate it. Many countries and regions remain sensitive about noise pollution. Getting regulatory approval worldwide won’t be easy.

Potential Markets for Concorde

FlyConcorde Ltd. is targeting a 2026 launch, which seems optimistic given everything that needs to happen. The aircraft must complete development and testing.

Regulatory approvals must be secured from aviation authorities in multiple countries. Airlines need to commit to buying or leasing the planes. Airports must prepare for operations.

Even if the aircraft enters service by 2026, initial operations will likely be limited. A few routes with proven demand make sense, such as London to New York, which tops that list. But expanding beyond a handful of premium routes will take time and depend on the aircraft proving itself operationally and financially.

The aviation industry has seen multiple supersonic revival attempts over the past 20 years. Boom Supersonic, Aerion, and others have announced plans. So far, none have entered commercial service. Technical, regulatory, and financial obstacles have blocked each attempt.

Bottom Line

If FlyConcorde Ltd. succeeds, it won’t revolutionize air travel for most people. Supersonic flight will remain a niche product for those willing to pay premium prices for time savings. It can be thought of as the aviation equivalent of first-class or private jets – a luxury option that exists alongside mainstream travel.

For aviation enthusiasts, seeing a Concorde-style aircraft back in the skies would be exciting. The original Concorde remains iconic decades after retirement. A new supersonic era would mark a genuine technological achievement.

Whether that actually happens by 2026 remains very much in question. But at least for now, it seems like the 2026 date is too optimistic. The history of promised supersonic returns suggests caution. But changed regulations and improved technology give this attempt better odds than previous efforts.

“By exercising the Boeing purchase option, we maintain flexibility while reinforcing our commitment to operating one of Europe’s most modern and fuel-efficient fleets. This is an important step in our ongoing fleet renewal programme, and we are very pleased to further strengthen our long-term partnership with Boeing,” said Geir Karlsen.

October was an important month in Denmark, marked by several positive developments. The month began strongly with the announcement of ten new international routes from Billund airport. On the same day, Norwegian was named “Best European Airline” at the Danish Travel Awards. A few days later, Norwegian won the Danish government’s tender for a domestic route aimed at reducing climate impact. Under this agreement, 93 percent of Norwegian’s flights between Aalborg and Copenhagen will operate using at least 40 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from March next year. The project is expected to save approximately 6,700 tonnes of CO2 on a life-cycle basis.

Well prepared for the winter season

For the upcoming winter months, Norwegian has reduced the monthly capacity by between 25 to 40 percent, compared to the October capacity. This is to better align with demand during winter and optimise performance in the low season.

“We have an attractive route network in the winter season, well tailored to our customers’ needs. Booking trends are looking encouraging, and our customers are booking their flights further in advance this year compared to previous years. We have therefore sold more tickets this year, compared to the same time last year, with reduced capacity. This bodes well for a busy winter season with high load factors,” said Geir Karlsen.","https://mnd-assets.mynewsdesk.com/image/upload/ar_16:9,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto:good,w_1782/8emxl9lzu4h2odczsa8pat",N,,2025-10-22 02:56:15.436279

McGowan said SAF remains the most important lever for decarbonising aviation. “This partnership underscores our commitment to supporting a scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy to invest in technologies and capacity that can transform the industry in the long run,” he said.

Stanley described the partnership as a practical step toward accelerating SAF availability.

“The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers,” he said.

The collaboration will also see both companies advocate for policies that support SAF development and adoption across Asia, a region with strong potential for feedstock supply and production growth.

The announcement follows Cathay’s recent role as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund – an initiative led by oneworld airlines and Breakthrough Energy Ventures. While that fund targets emerging technologies, the new Cathay–Airbus partnership will focus on scaling mature SAF solutions for near- to medium-term deployment.

“The modernization of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation.","Swedavia and Luftfartsverket are the first in Europe to introduce a new air traffic approach concept. The new concept is commonly referred to as Established on RNP (EoR) and makes it possible for aircraft arriving at Stockholm Arlanda Airport to fly with curved approaches to a greater extent than before. The concept is an important step towards increasing the capacity, efficiency and sustainability of air traffic.

“For us, it is of course gratifying that Swedavia will be the first in Europe to apply the new concept for managing arrivals. Enabling more curved approaches is also the most effective way to support airlines in their transition work, in addition to facilitating increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” says Susanne Norman, Director of Operations at Swedavia.

The new approach concept allows the airport to increase the landing rate per hour and reduces emissions, both for the aircraft flying the shorter, curved approach and for those flying the standard instrument landing approach. This is because fewer aircraft have to use the runway dedicated for arrivals, reducing the queue for that runway. To be able to fly curved approaches, airlines must have a special permit from their National Supervisory Authority.

“The modernization of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation. The traffic flow into Stockholm Arlanda Airport becomes more efficient during peak hours, and arriving aircraft have shorter flight paths with reduced emissions, says Anna Granberg,” Director of Operations at Luftfartsverket.

“We are very pleased with the initiative from Swedavia and the Swedish Air Traffic Control Provider (LFV) to implement new procedures that will increase the number of curved approaches (RNP AR – Required Navigation Performance, Authorization Required) at Arlanda. We would like to commend them for this effort and for the excellent cooperation we have had throughout the project. Shorter approaches result in lower fuel burn and reduced emissions. Our goal is to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2030, and more efficient flight operations like this are among our top priorities — alongside increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continuous fleet renewal, says Charlotte Holmbergh,” Country Director Corporate Affairs at Norwegian.

“SAS welcomes all initiatives that help reduce fuel consumption, noise, and emissions. The introduction of the new approach concept is a step in the right direction towards a more efficient and more sustainable airspace around Arlanda,” says Alexandra Lindgren Kaoukji, Head of External Communication & PR at SAS.

This paper argues that rising aviation emissions, which are disproportionally driven by the wealthy, pose a serious threat to climate goals. Using the UK’s Jet Zero strategy as a case study, it explores how policymakers and industry promote speculative technologies—efficiency gains, electric and hydrogen aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture, and offsetting—to justify continued aviation growth. We critically assess these claims: electric aircraft are limited to short routes; hydrogen faces major storage and infrastructure barriers, and green hydrogen remains scarce. SAFs, often derived from land-intensive crops, risk deforestation, biodiversity loss, and higher net emissions. Second generation SAFs, such as used cooking oil, are scarce, and power-to-liquid is speculative and prohibitively expensive. Carbon capture is unproven at scale, and offsetting enables airlines to claim reductions without cutting actual emissions. These “solutions” align with a political agenda that prioritises economic growth and airport expansion. We argue that this techno-optimism delays real action. Rather than gambling on future breakthroughs that may never materialise, policymakers should pursue immediate demand-reduction strategies and support a just transition—ending frequent-flyer incentives, shifting short-haul flights to rail, removing aviation fuel subsidies, and retraining workers for low-carbon sectors.

Introduction: aviation and the climate crisis

It is no longer necessary to watch a Hollywood movie to imagine what a climate disaster might look like; glancing at the newsfeed will often suffice.Footnote1 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first to exceed 1.5°C warming above pre-industrial levels. It brought catastrophic flooding to West Africa and Valencia, and drought to southern Africa. In southern California, where a perfect tinderbox had been created by extreme wet-then-dry conditions known as hydroclimatic whiplash, the start of the new year saw wildfires wreak havoc (Kolbert, Citation2025). 2025 also saw destructive floods in Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, northern China and Texas, while in Britain many crops failed due to drought. Climate breakdown is proceeding more quickly than previously anticipated (Hansen et al., Citation2025). We are, warns UN secretary-general António Guterres, on the ‘highway to climate hell’ (United Nations, Citation2024). And climate is only one among many vectors of environmental breakdown. ‘Planetary boundaries’ are being crossed at a rate of knots – seven out of nine at the latest count (Gayle, Citation2024).

Against this backdrop, the need to rapidly decarbonise could not be more pressing. Britain is currently off track to meet its target of ‘net zero’ by 2050 (CCC, Citation2024), and three quarters of its primary energy still comes from fossil fuels (Energy Institute, Citation2025). Nowhere is the scale of the deficiency clearer than in aviation. According to the 7th Carbon Budget of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an advisory body to the British government, in 2023 UK aviation emissions were 69% higher than in 1990; they account for 8% of UK emissions, with international flights the principal driver of expansion (CCC, Citation2025, p. 222).

In this paper, we scrutinise aviation decarbonisation strategies, with Britain’s Jet Zero plan as the case study. We read Jet Zero as a gamble predicated on a series of technologies and policies that are highly unlikely to achieve their goals. We assess the prospects for electric and hydrogen aviation, efficiency savings, carbon capture and storage, offsets, and sustainable aviation fuel. We then tease out the implications for policy.

Our focus is on Britain, due in part to its historic responsibility for the climate crisis. In cumulative CO2 emissions Britain ranks eighth in the world, but if we factor in its empire (ruled from London) the position is higher, and it reflects Britain’s pivotal role in the dissemination of fossil-fuel use worldwide (Evans & Rydén, Citation2005; Ritchie & Roser, Citation2020). Against this fossil-imperial backdrop, Britain’s Nationally Defined Contribution (NDC) to reducing emissions falls short of an equitable share (Civil Society Equity Review, Citation2023; Gabbatiss, Citation2023). In part, too, our focus on Britain relates to its legal commitment to a target of ‘net zero’ by 2050, following a law passed in 2008 when Labour’s Ed Miliband was Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. Ever since, it has positioned itself as a ‘climate leader’ (DESNZ & Miliband Citation2024). The increasing climate-impacting significance of aviation and the role the sector plays in the government’s vision for making Britain ‘the world’s best-connected place to do business’ makes its ‘Jet Zero’ programme an exemplary lens through which to study the friction between ‘growth’ and sustainability (Stewart, Citation2025b).

Jet Zero was set up under Boris Johnson’s premiership, the declared aim being to steer the aviation industry toward ‘sustainability’. With particular clarity that programme manifests the ‘technological solutionism’ and ‘technofixes’ that dominate policymaking on decarbonisation, and above all on aviation. Technofixes refer to questionable claims regarding what technology can achieve in order to reduce the pressure to address social and ecological problems in other ways. There are obvious reasons that governments succumb to this way of thinking (e.g. line of least resistance regarding potentially unpopular behavioural change) and obvious attractions for corporations in propagating it (the camouflage it offers for prioritising profits over the habitability of Earth).

Technological solutionism, similarly, recasts ‘complex social situations either as neatly defined problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimised (Morozov, Citation2013, p. 5). Examples of technological solutionism abound in UK government pronouncements and policies today, be it the programme for ‘a digital health service powered by cutting-edge technology’ as a solution to an ailing NHS, or the quest to make Britain ‘the world leader’ in AI in order to ‘turbocharge growth’ (Department for Science, Innovation & Technology et al., Citation2025; Streeting, Citation2024). Jet Zero is cut from the same cloth. It seeks to sidestep politically difficult questions pertaining to the social purposes of transport, leisure and work, instead reaching for technological trump cards.

Those technofix range from the unproven to the unrealistic to the downright harmful. It is important that we strip back the futurist veneer of the promises and policies of sustainable aviation, debunk the obfuscatory language deployed, and carefully scrutinise the claims made.

We submit that ‘sustainable aviation’ represents a reckless gamble on new technologies, some of which are unproven and many of which are likely to be unscalable. It melds flimsy promises from the aviation industry, in its attempt to pre-empt government intervention, with empty bluster from governments keen to placate a climate-concerned electorate. Ultimately, its function, if not the motivation, is to provide a smokescreen, one that lingers until the current government is out of office, leaving its successors – not to mention human society and other fauna and flora – to face the heat. In short, in Britain, as is largely the case elsewhere, techno-utopian fantasy is writing the official script. The result is a diversion of attention from the practical changes needed, which we shall summarise in the final section.

Jet Zero and aviation emissions

Consultation for Jet Zero began in July 2021 under Boris Johnson’s premiership. It built upon the previous ‘Net Zero Strategy’ and ‘Transport decarbonisation plan’ to chart a course for aviation to reach net zero by 2050 (Department for Transport, Citation2021; HM Government, Citation2021a). With the aim of helping the aviation sector decarbonise, the consultation centred on a Jet Zero Council – ‘a forum bringing together government, industry and academia to speed up change’ (Department for Transport, Citation2022b, p. 4). In July 2022, the Jet Zero strategy document was published. It was constructed chiefly of assumptions and promises borrowed – naïvely, as we show below – from the aviation sector, in particular from the industry organisation Sustainable Aviation, mediated through government-industry partnership bodies (Department for Transport, Citation2022a, Citation2024a). Largely frozen out were climate scientists and the environmental groups and NGOs that seek to protect the interests of Earth and its inhabitants.

A key assumption that the Jet Zero strategy reproduces is that in its emissions calculations and scenarios CO2 emissions are foregrounded. This risks obscuring aviation’s true climate impact. As much as two-thirds of aviation’s global-heating impact stems from non-CO2 emissions and cloud formation. The actual impact of aviation on global heating may be tripled once these non-CO2 emissions are factored in (EUASA, Citation2020; Lee et al., Citation2021). To put this in perspective, a return flight from London to New York, generating one tonne of CO2 per passenger on average, has an actual impact equivalent to around three tonnes (Kommenda, Citation2019). According to the CCC (Citation2020), three tonnes is the total annual level of per capita emissions to which Britain must be restricted by the mid-2030s, if the 1.5C target is to remain even possible.Footnote2 We should also consider military aviation. Aviation makes up a third of the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) self-reported CO2 footprint, and the MOD accounts for 50% of UK government emissions (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Citation2024).Footnote3 If we factor in the non-CO2 effects, military aviation alone could account for as much as a third of total UK government emissions. Military aviation emissions are forecast to rise, as Britain increases its military spending in line with the NATO-wide target of 3.5% of GDP. This target, if met, would lead to extra emissions across NATO member states estimated at 1320 million tCO2e over the next ten years – the equivalent of the annual emissions of Brazil (Parkinson, Citation2025).

Rather than exercise caution in a situation where underestimating impacts will generate real effects that cannot simply be ‘taken back’, the government’s response to the question of non-CO2 effects has been ‘wait and see’.Footnote4 It promises to channel some funds into research in the area, while refusing to incorporate any of the existing research into its calculations on the climate impact of aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). This is short-sighted and self-serving: it frames uncertainty as a reason for current lack of action and misrepresents what the ‘uncertainty’ is telling us. Consider by contrast the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Although it has been widely criticised for its capture by the aviation industry (Carrington, Citation2025), even it takes care to point out the significant impact of non-CO2 aviation emissions on global heating. Its research shows that non-CO2 emissions’ effects increase alongside the projected growth in CO2 emissions (Lee et al., Citation2023). In other words, these obscured contributions of aviation to climate breakdown will only grow in significance unless the sector’s overall CO2 emissions are reduced.

As noted in the introduction, Jet Zero’s projections point to significant growth in numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown. For example, a 2020 government report projected that by 2050, passenger miles flown will be twice the 2017 figure and six times the 1990 figure (Department for Transport, Citation2020a). The picture is similar in Europe, with the latest figures suggesting that EU air traffic could reach more than 2.3 times the 2019 level by 2050 (T&E, Citation2025). Aviation, by the government’s own admission, is set to comprise fully a quarter of Britain’s GHG emissions by 2050, and will be the industry with the greatest carbon emissions (HM Government, Citation2018; Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020). This means that even if the proposed technofix were to work as promised, in 2050 the sector could be burning as much fossil kerosene as in 2023 (T&E, Citation2025).

Jet Zero and its technofixes: efficiencies, batteries, hydrogen

The Jet Zero report set 2019 as the peak year for aviation CO2 emissions, following which they would decline to 21 million tonnes (Mt) in 2050. At that point, aviation will be ‘net zero’ – assuming that those 21 Mt are captured and stored, or offset. Before we examine the proposals for reaching that goal, it is worth pointing out that airline emissions are already on track to exceed the 2019 peak (Topham, Citation2024). That the plan is already faltering is an early warning of its inadequacy. We predict that it will not get back on track. A key reason is that the strategy assumes that technology can be relied upon to solve the problem. This emulates the strategy of transition to electric vehicles in the road transport sector, but without the proven technologies that that sector can point to.

One prominent technofix is efficiency improvements. These, Jet Zero predicts, will account for a major share of aviation carbon savings by 2050. Such forecasts, however, are based on wishful thinking; the empirical evidence leans strongly against them. According to the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) the real-world fuel efficiency of aircrafts – otherwise known as block fuel – increased by 1.3% per annum (pa) between 1960 and 2024 (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2025; see also Kharina & Rutherford, Citation2015; Zheng & Rutherford, Citation2020). Over the same time period, the metric valueFootnote5 – which measures how efficient an aircraft is technically designed to be – increased by even less: only 1% pa.Footnote6 Almost all of the scenarios developed by major international aviation organisations in the last few years forecast efficiency savings at less than 1% pa (IATA, Citation2024). The 1.4% pa efficiency gain on which Jet Zero relies, Finlay Asher, a former aircraft engine designer at Rolls Royce, told us, is ‘wildly optimistic’. There are ‘no large step-changes in efficiency around the corner and it takes 10–15 years to certify a significant new aircraft and engine design. So, anything we do see in 2035 – e.g. new designs entering service – will not be the predominant aircraft in service in 2050, due to the 20–30 year lifetime of aircraft’.

A deeper problem with efficiency gains are their rebound effects (York et al., Citation2022). Improvements reduce costs which spur demand, leading to more miles flown. According to the CCC (Citation2020), if demand is not constrained, Britain’s aviation industry will grow at an average rate of over 2% pa over the coming decades. While there are different scenarios, there is a shared expectation that numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown will grow (Leggett, Citation2025). Globally, the sector is set to double by 2040, with growth at an average 3.5% pa (IATA, Citation2023). Needless to say, Earth’s systems care little that less kerosene is required per passenger if more in total is being burnt due to air travel’s overall growth (Dobruszkes & Ibrahim, Citation2022).

Other technofix look to alternative fuels. At the inception of the Jet Zero plan, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, identified ‘biofuels and electric aircraft’ as a key focus (Department for Transport, Citation2020b). The model is similar to the electric vehicles (EVs) strategy for road transport: a ‘business as usual’ approach that assumes ever-growing sales, little or no demand management, and a high-stakes gamble on technology. In road transport, the strategy is fraught with problems, not least the emissions from extraction and manufacturing processes, and the capacity of renewable energy production: replacing all vehicles with EVs risks exceeding the global carbon budget (Morgan, Citation2020). But while decarbonising road transport is deeply problematic, it is technically feasible. Adopting a similar strategy for aviation is not simply problematic; it is, at least for the foreseeable future, delusional. Jet Zero’s promotion of electric planes is exemplary in this regard. Shapps’ claim that they offer ‘boundless possibilities’ (Department for Transport, Citation2019) is questionable, given the well-documented challenges they face. Due to the weight of batteries – which, unlike fuel, don’t burn off as you fly and are much less energy dense – electric flights will only be viable for short journeys with few passengers (Walker, Citation2019). The maximum range of the tiny nine-seater prototype ‘commuter plane’ developed by leading firm Eviation is 460 km – about the distance from London to Newcastle (Weitering, Citation2024). These aircraft remain a long way from commercial operation and the past five years for the sector has been a story of delays and tempered expectations (Kaminski-Morrow, Citation2020; Sampson, Citation2025), if not outright insolvency, as in the case of German electric aerospace company Lilium (Westerheide, Citation2025). The industry consensus is that for flights of 1,500 km or longer – which make up 80% of aviation emissions – battery-powered flight is unfeasible (Air Transport Action Group, Citation2021; Pfeifer, Citation2019; Schwab et al., Citation2021). In other words, electric planes are a substitute less for jet planes than for buses and trains: an airborne taxi service for well-heeled travellers seeking to avoid congested roads and trains.

Another technofix promoted by the Jet Zero consultation is hydrogen flight (HM Government, Citation2021b). Hydrogen doesn’t suffer from the problematically low energy density by mass of lithium batteries, but because its energy density by volume is far lower than jet fuel it requires much bigger and heavier onboard storage tanks. Hydrogen planes would also require very extensive modifications to airport infrastructure. The source of hydrogen is another concern. Only one percent is currently ‘green’ – i.e. produced with renewable energy. It is over thrice the price of ‘grey’ hydrogen, which itself is four times as expensive as kerosene (Henderson, Citation2021). Grey hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, with CO2 released as a waste gas – around 830 million tonnes each year (Pirani, Citation2020). If those emissions are captured and sequestered, the hydrogen is known as ‘blue’. Recent studies warn that blue hydrogen could be worse for the climate even than burning fossil gas, due to methane loss during its production plus the high energy inputs – still, typically, from fossil fuels (Howarth & Jacobson, Citation2021; Schlissel & Juhn, Citation2023).

It is also worth noting that there are corporate and geopolitical pressures behind the push for some technologies over others (Balanyá et al., Citation2020). In Britain, oil companies have strategically misrepresented the costs of blue hydrogen whilst asking the taxpayer for billions of pounds in subsidies (Ambrose, Citation2021). The myth of a green transition to hydrogen-powered aviation serves the interests of states rich in oil and gas deposits and of the fossil-fuel companies that extract them, fearful that their assets will become stranded (Noussan et al., Citation2021). We are not using the word ‘myth’ lightly. Willie Walsh, Director-General of the International Air Transport Association, admits that no long-haul hydrogen flights will be possible until ‘beyond 2050’ (Topham, Citation2021). Airbus has ‘suspended’ its plans to develop hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft, citing ‘slower than expected developments in technology’ (Hepher, Citation2025). Boeing, likewise, sees little potential in hydrogen-powered flight before 2050 (Raymond, Citation2023), and other industry experts forecast the most optimistic date for its long-haul viability as the 2050s or 2060s (Transport Select Committee, Citation2022). Switching to hydrogen, moreover, would require astronomical sums for investments in energy, storage and infrastructure, and could add decades to the ‘net zero’ transition in aviation, according to a CCC spokesperson (Hollinger, Citation2021). Moreover, burning hydrogen releases much more water vapour than the equivalent jet fuel, meaning it would contribute to global heating via contrails (Forster et al., Citation2023). In short, hydrogen is only ‘green’ in prohibitively expensive form, it offers no realistic alternative to kerosene in the near to medium future, and even its medium-term applications are limited to short-haul flights. Green hydrogen production may be ramping up, but often in problematic ways. European-owned green hydrogen projects in north Africa, for example, stand accused of displacing local populations and occasioning serious environmental harms, whilst siphoning off tens of millions of litres of water in areas with high levels of water insecurity. The hydrogen produced is largely exported to Europe, rather than contributing to a green transition locally. These activities, according to a recent report, reflect a broader strategy whereby Europe is externalising ‘the climate costs of its energy consumption’ in ways that entrench ‘extractivist neocolonial structures’ (Greenpeace & MENAFEM, Citation2025, p. 44).

Take off for economic growth?

Jet Zero was the brainchild of a Tory government whose goals for aviation dovetailed with those of the industry itself. This was tacitly acknowledged in the way in which aviation industry representatives referred to government plans. An example was the 2018 reportThe Future of UK Aviation (HM Government, Citation2018), in which the then aviation minister, Liz Sugg, framed the expansion of aviation as a given for future development. The Minister of Transport under Rishi Sunak went further, stating in Parliament that the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate (more on which below) ‘is part of our approach to ensure that the rationing of flights through ‘demand management’ is ruled out’ (Hansard HC Deb., Citation2024).

Expectations that the incoming Labour government of 2024 might take a different tack found support in the fact that its minister for Energy Security and Net Zero was (and at time of writing still is) Ed Miliband, while its prime minister, Keir Starmer, had voted against Heathrow expansion when it had been put to the Commons in 2018. Such predictions were quickly scotched, as environmental considerations found themselves trumped by the economic growth drive, centred on the expansion of energy infrastructure, IT infrastructure (such as data centres), housing, and, of course, aviation.Footnote7 The most vocal growth booster in government, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, explicitly stated at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos that in any conflict between growth and ‘net zero’, the latter ought to come second (Stewart, Citation2025a).

In relation to the Jet Zero plan, then, the new government opted for continuity. It established a Jet Zero Taskforce (Department for Transport, Citation2024b), formed overwhelmingly of the CEOs of aviation companies and oil companies, plus a smattering of representatives from the renewable fuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) industries (HM Government, Citation2024b). And when the CCC, in its 2024 report to parliament assessing progress towards net zero, reiterated the call for a halt to all airport expansion (2024), the government doubled down on its commitment to increase aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). The aviation sector responded warmly. Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet, spoke for the industry as a whole when he praised Starmer’s government for its ‘recognition of the importance of aviation and the crucial role it plays as an enabler of economic growth’Footnote8 (Alexander & Reeves, Citation2025).

Under particular scrutiny in this regard has been the decision to support airport expansion, with a third runway at Heathrow already approved, along with a huge extension to City Airport (Department for Transport, Citation2025b). The extra flights would be considerable, potentially increasing from 480,000 a year to 720,000 at Heathrow alone (Leggett, Citation2025). Plans to almost double the capacity of London Luton Airport have been approved by the Transport Secretary – notably going against the recommendations of the Planning Inspectorate, whose report found that the environmental harms of the expansion outweighed the public benefits (Planning Inspectorate, Citation2025). Similar plans to increase the capacity of Gatwick by over 100,000 flights per year have received backing from the Transport Secretary (Topham, Citation2025). Amid protests from environmentalists, and from some prominent Labour supporters such as the ‘eco-entrepreneur’ Dale Vince, the government insists that there is no tension between expanding the aviation sector and meeting its carbon emissions targets. For the former Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Jonathan Reynolds – who, with Reeves, voted in favour of Heathrow expansion in 2018 – airport expansion and decarbonisation ‘go hand in hand’ (‘Today’, Citation2025). But how exactly might this work? Reeves provided the answer. When pressed on why Starmer had completed a U-turn on airport expansion, she invoked the rapid development of sustainable aviation fuels. SAF, she claimed, has become a ‘game-changer’ in the expansion debate – a technological ticket to guilt-free flying (Georgiadis & Pickard, Citation2025).

The government’s message, in short, is that a contradiction no longer exists between its commitments to economic growth and environmental sustainability. A growing aviation industry is compatible with the ‘net zero’ mission, thanks to efficiency gains and technological breakthroughs – in particular in SAFs.

The HEFAlump in the room

That government spokespeople such as Reeves extol SAF as the elixir of sustainable aviation comes as no surprise. As the prospects for electric and hydrogen-fuelled aviation have experienced a series of setbacks in the early 2020s, SAFs have returned to the forefront of debates around decarbonising aviation. On 1 January 2025, the government’s SAF mandate came into force which requires flights to be fuelled by two percent SAF, rising to ten percent in 2030 and twenty-two percent in 2040 (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). The mandate also includes a revenue certainty mechanism for producers, but this is yet to be implemented (Department for Transport, Citation2023). Despite being hailed a ‘game-changer’ by the Chancellor, there are considerable doubts around the sustainability, scalability and efficacy of SAF as an alternative to kerosene. After examining these issues in detail, it will become clear why this central pillar of the plan for sustainable aviation is so flimsy.

First of all, SAF is not ‘green’ in the way one might think. Burning it produces a similar amount of CO2 to kerosene. It is primarily in its production that the GHG savings are factored in. This green arithmetic should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis, as SAFs have the potential, especially when land use is changed to produce crops for biofuel, to actually increase the net GHG emissions, thereby contributing more to global warming than burning fossil fuels (EUASA, Citation2025). The UK government defines three types of SAF. The first is called HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) – this is fuel made from animal fats and vegetable oils. The second is non-HEFA biofuels which can be produced from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), alcohol from food crops (‘Alcohol to Jet’ (AtJ)), and from non-food crops, woody crops, and forestry and agricultural waste – this latter group is ‘second-generation biomass’. The third is power-to-liquid synthetic electrofuel (PtL), which is generated using captured carbon and hydrogen (BP, Citation2023; Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Of the three, HEFA is the most established and by far the cheapest of the three methods. However, it has some major downsides, as we shall see, which explains the government’s decision to include a steadily increasing cap on HEFA fuels in its SAF mandate.

The best-known HEFA-using aviation entrepreneur is Richard Branson. In the mid-2000s he arranged for coconut oil to part-fuel a flight from London Heathrow to Amsterdam. The event garnered a burst of media attention, but the sustainability implications were troubling. To have fuelled that short hop with 100 percent coconut oil would have required three million coconuts (Dale, Citation2008). The entire global crop would supply Heathrow for only a few weeks – and it is one of 18,000 commercial airports worldwide. Following this stunt, coconut oil was never used in a Virgin flight again. The Virgin flight drew attention to intrinsic problems of using HEFA. Energy crops such as palm oil or coconuts are not sustainable in any reasonable definition of the term. For energy production they’re a sub-par use of land: solar panels convert solar energy for human-use much more efficiently. In competing with agricultural crops, their downsides are legion (DeCicco, Citation2016). They contribute to GHG emissions from land-use change, and to land-ownership concentration; they cause food price rises, food insecurity, deforestation, peat burning, water shortages, and biodiversity loss. To give but one example, in 2019 alone, the palm oil suppliers to Neste, the world’s largest biofuel producer, were accused of deforesting at least 10,000 hectares and setting 13,000 forest fires (Milieu Defensie, Citation2020). The scale of the potential demand is radically incommensurable with the availability of land to produce biofuel. If 100% of global jet fuel in 2050 were to be produced from SAFs derived from seeds and oilseeds, it would require a staggering two billion acres to grow – five times the cropland area of the United States (Qualman, Citation2024).

Biofuel crops produce GHG emissions in other ways too (Dale, Citation2007). Their inputs include large quantities of energy and fertilisers, a major source of nitrous oxide, as well as hydrogen – largely from fossil gas – for the hydrotreatment of oil (Hughes, Citation2021). Biomass from plantation-grown trees is seen by many in the aviation industry as the new cornucopia, but it suffers from all the same drawbacks. Branson’s proposed solution after the coconut debacle was to pivot to algae, a solution which attracted sizable investment from major oil companies eager to give their polluting activities a green veneer. As a water-based crop, algae appealed in part because it was seen as a way to circumvent the issue of land use change. In 2008 we predicted that algae would not be a viable option (Dale, Citation2008), a forecast that was confirmed a decade and a half later when ExxonMobil was the final fossil-fuel investor to abandon the project (Westervelt, Citation2023).

Used cooking oil: flying on fumes and fraud

Britain’s government is well aware of the significant limitations of HEFA-based biofuels.Footnote9 This is reflected in its decision to impose a cap on HEFA-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is set to fall from 71% in 2030 to just 35% by 2040. It has also ruled out fuel made from food, feed, or energy crops as eligible for designation as SAF (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Yet even with these measures, the government’s consistently optimistic projections for new technologies fall short of what is needed to meet the SAF mandate. At present, Britain has only one operational SAF facility: the Phillips 66 Humber refinery (USDA, Citation2025).

This helps explain why, as of 2023, a staggering 97% of the UK’s SAF supply came from used cooking oil (UCO). Only 8% of this originated domestically (due to its limited total supply), with the bulk imported from Malaysia and China (Purvis, Citation2025). China, the world’s largest UCO producer, is already struggling to meet demand from Europe and the US, while Malaysia has reportedly exported more ‘used’ cooking oil than it actually produces (Goulding Carroll, Citation2022). These discrepancies have raised serious concerns about virgin vegetable oil being fraudulently mixed into the UCO supply (T&E, Citation2024). If confirmed, some UCO-derived SAF is in significant respects more damaging even than kerosene, especially where palm oil plantations – linked to deforestation – are used to meet the demand.Footnote10 Importantly, even where UCO is authentic (i.e. verified waste rather than virgin oil), it is not only a finite waste resource, for which demand is already outstripping supply, but its environmental cost remains high as it displaces use from other, arguably more important, sectors such as domestic biodiesel and animal feed – which in turn further drives deforestation (T&E, Citation2021b).Footnote11

For sustainable fuel, attention has consequently shifted to other sources. One is CO2 extracted from the air by Direct Air Capture technologies and converted into SAF, also called Power to Liquid (PtL) (Keith et al., Citation2018). This may offer potential in the distant future but currently is far too expensive at £94.50/gigajoule (GJ), compared with the £16/GJ it costs to refine jet fuel from crude oil (IEA, Citation2023b). The process is also extremely energy intensive. It would take 468–660 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy to replace the ‘UK’s fossil jet fuel consumption’(The Royal Society, Citation2023). To put that into perspective, in 2023 Britain’s total electricity consumption was 266 TWh (Statista, Citation2025).

Other sources include forestry residues – such as bark, branches, and sapling thinnings, municipal and business waste, and industrial offgases – but these are not a serious alternative. They compete with more pressing uses: decarbonising electric power, fuelling ground transport, and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Waste and offgases, in contrast, do look potentially promising. In 2021 we spoke to two companies which together have received over £50 million in government funding to construct the first wave of non-HEFA SAF plants – Velocys and Lanzatech (Department for Transport, Citation2025a).

Velocys

Of the 27 million tonnes of waste collected annually by Britain’s councils and businesses, a Velocys representative told us, much consists of water, and recyclable substances such as metals and ‘inerts’. These are removed. The remainder is heated using the Fischer–Tropsch process (Steynberg, Citation2004). Contaminant gases are washed out and what remains, chiefly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is converted to SAF. The Fischer–Tropsch process is a proven technology that dates back to the 1920s, but questions remain as to whether it is capable of delivering sustainable fuel in sufficient quantities, and in time to achieve the government’s Net Zero target. Several obstacles merit attention.

First, SAF from waste is expensive to produce – at least twice the cost of fossil jet fuel (The Royal Society, Citation2023). Producing fuel to meet the high quality and safety requirements necessary to keep a passenger jet in the air is more complex – and thus more costly – than producing biodiesel for buses, trucks or tractors. This leads to the second problem: the amount of municipal waste available is hugely insufficient. Even if all of the available Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) were converted, it would only meet about ten percent of UK jet fuel demand (The Royal Society, Citation2023). One might reasonably ask if this limited supply would not be better used to meet the needs of land vehicles without viable alternatives in sectors such as agriculture. Third, as with PtL fuels, the energy requirements are prohibitive. Britain is predicted to fall significantly short of its 2030 green energy target – despite having revised this down in December 2024 (Cornwall Insight, Citation2025). Globally, energy-transition investment actually declined in 2024, and currently stands at just over a third of the amount required to reach net zero by 2050(Corradi, Citation2025). There simply is not sufficient surplus renewable energy to warrant its diversion to SAF.

The recent development of SAF production, moreover, does not inspire confidence. None of the Velocys projects have reached commercial production. The promise was that its plant in Immingham would start supplying British Airways in 2024, but the site is still ‘a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side’ (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). If it does eventually open, it will presumably draw power from the national grid, fuelled to a very substantial amount by non-renewable energy, seriously denting any green credentials it may have had (NESO, Citation2025). On top of this, its direct GHG emissions will be considerable. Over its entire lifetime including combustion, SAF from municipal solid waste produces up to two thirds as much CO2 as fossil kerosene (The Royal Society, Citation2023).

In short, Velocys, like most alternative SAF projects, has not demonstrated commercial-scale viability and there are strong grounds for scepticism. Its case is not atypical. According to a Reuters investigation, of the 165 SAF projects announced by airlines worldwide over the past 12 years, only ten have produced commercial quantities of fuel (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). The oil giant Shell has scrapped construction of its SAF plants in Singapore and in Rotterdam (Almeida, Citation2025). In Britain, there are two other proposed MSW-to-SAF projects, both of which have received government funding (Department for Transport, Citation2025a). One, from the American firm Fulcrum, was set to be twice the size of Velocys’ Immingham facility. However, when their flagship plant in Nevada – the first of its kind – was finally opened after years of delays, it was beset by a multitude of problems including nitric acid corrosion of pipes, massive nitrous oxide emissions and a huge overestimation of the amount of fuel it would actually be able to produce (Howard, Citation2024). The fiasco ended with Fulcrum filing for bankruptcy in 2024 (Hussain, Citation2024). According to research by Andrew Rollinson, most large-scale commercial gasification plants fail. The technology, he notes, ‘has high risks associated with multiple pathways for fire, explosion, and the release of environmental toxins’ (Rollinson, Citation2018). Even if we were to set aside the criticisms of the technology raised above, there is little reason to believe that Velocys’ project will be the kind of success story the government is hoping for.

Lanzatech

LanzaTech’s core technology is ingenious: Clostridium bacteria combine carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce ethanol, for conversion into jet fuel (AtJ). Its ideal locations are blast furnaces, the offgases of which include carbon monoxide and hydrogen. LanzaTech anticipated that its facility adjoining the Port Talbot steelworks would yield 80,000 tonnes of fuel annually. Although this sounds impressive, we learned from a LanzaTech representative that it represents ‘0.6 percent’ of Britain’s jet fuel usage. As steel production shifts away from fossil fuels in pursuit of its net zero goals, moreover, the supply of those offgases will dwindle – and indeed the last blast furnace in Port Talbot closed in 2024. Hence, LanzaTech has had to look beyond the steel industry, but the feedstocks they have found contain little or no hydrogen, which must then be manufactured. They are exploring DAC-to-SAF projects, but here, again, the energy needs are colossal, and the bottleneck is the availability of renewable electricity.

Other possible feedstocks would include forestry waste, which we discussed above, as well as sources of ‘second-generation bioethanol’, such as straw. These too face many competing uses, the available quantities are low, and the jet fuel would be expensive – perhaps two to four times dearer than kerosene. LanzaTech’s CEO, Jennifer Holmgren, notes that using recycled CO2 or CO costs far more than refining oil, and bringing the cost curve down could take ‘30 or 40 years’ (Gertner & Payne, Citation2021). Production cannot, needless to say, be scaled up at will: it takes three years, at minimum, to get a plant up and running, and only then can the efficiency improvements be transferred to future projects. Construction of LanaTech’s plant was due to commence in winter 2024, but this deadline was missed. The company hopes to begin production in 2026, but notes that this timeline is ‘subject to securing the legislation, investment and off-take agreements that are needed to move forward to a final investment decision’ (LanzaTech, Citationn.d.; Smith, Citation2025).

The aviation industry knows that synthetic fuels cannot be ramped up quickly. As to SAFs in general, in Britain, as the Sustainable Aviation group admits, annual production of 600 kt won’t be achieved until the mid-2030s at the earliest. Even the lowest usage scenario it envisages ‘would exceed globally available waste oils and fats’ and would require ‘substantial new volumes of oil crops’ (Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020).

Carbon capture and storage

Even if one were to set aside scepticism regarding the technological assumptions underpinning the Jet Zero strategy – to accept, for instance, that fuel efficiency will improve at an unprecedented rate, that electric and hydrogen aircraft will overcome existing technical and financial barriers to constitute a meaningful share of the fleet, and that SAFs can be scaled commercially without inflicting further ecological harms – the framework remains fundamentally reliant on negative emissions technologies. This reliance persists even under the most optimistic scenarios, raising critical questions about the feasibility and integrity of the Jet Zero pathway.

By 2050, the Jet Zero strategy anticipates that approximately 21 MtCO₂ will need to be removed annually for the aviation sector to achieve ‘net zero’. (The Sustainable Aviation group (2020) projects an even higher figure, estimating that at least 26 MtCO₂ will need to be either offset or removed each year; and the CCC (Citation2020) suggests that aviation will require around 40% of the UK’s total negative emissions capacity by mid-century.) This raises serious ethical concerns regarding the allocation of limited carbon removal resources to a sector characterised by extreme inequality in access and impact. Globally, just 1% of the population is responsible for half of all aviation emissions (Niranjan, Citation2025), while only 2–4% of people fly in any given year (Gössling & Humpe, Citation2020). In the UK, the disparity is equally stark: 15% of the population accounts for 70% of flights, and half of the population does not fly at all in a given year (Hopkinson & Cairns, Citation2021). Moreover, the wealthiest 10% of Britons generate more emissions from aviation alone than do the poorest 20% from all their activities combined (Baltruszewicz et al., Citation2023). Citizens of the Global South, meanwhile, typically take between zero and one flight per year. The disproportionate allocation of financial and carbon budgets to what is effectively a luxury activity for the affluent raises serious questions of environmental justice and equity.

Even if we leave morality to one side, there remain significant doubts regarding the storage capacity for CCS, and the yawning gap between the diminutive scale of monitored and verified carbon removal and the gargantuan scale required for the Jet Zero sums to add up (de Coninck & M. Benson, Citation2014; Ketan, Citation2021). There are currently forty-one CCS facilities in the world, of which 82.5% are used to aid the extraction of oil in mature wells (Zero Carbon Analytics, Citation2024). In most countries, CCS is unregulated. Those forty-one plants are expensive, potentially dangerous, and are failing to meet their targets (Weyler, Citation2022; Zoledziowski, Citation2022). A recent report on Norway’s Sleipner and Snøhvit pilot plants revealed unexpected behaviour of CO2 in even the most intensively studied of aquifers, a reminder that the danger of leakage is all too real (Hauber, Citation2023). In its most recent roadmap, the International Energy Agencynotes that the history of CCS is one of ‘unmet expectations’ and delayed deployment, that ‘removing carbon from the atmosphere is costly and uncertain’ and that the technology remains ‘unproven at scale’ (IEA, Citation2023a). Its entire efficacy has been called into question by the IPCC, with serious doubts raised over the technology and its claims to carbon neutrality (Robertson, Citation2022; Sekera & Goodwin, Citation2021).

While funding, especially from the polluting industries, should be invested into CCS research and trials, one should also recognise that its primary purpose, today, is as a technofix, built on insecure foundations and geared to short-circuiting difficult political decisions and supporting fossil-fuel giants (Anderson & Peters, Citation2016; Laville, Citation2021; Quiggin, Citation2024). Even the US climate envoy under the Biden administration, John Kerry, admits that CCS risks becoming a dangerous distraction from the need to reduce emissions, while former US vice-president Al Gore dismisses it as ‘an absolute fraud’ (Breeze, Citation2024; Harvey, Citation2023).

Offsets

The solutions discussed so far are vastly overestimated in the Jet Zero programme, manifesting a blasé disregard for scarcities, realistic timescales, and technical obstacles. Yet all are based on technologies that do, or might one day, function. Offsetting, by comparison, is an outright scam. That it is accorded a prominent role in Jet Zero – even in its ‘high ambition’ scenario, offsetting is billed as providing the second-largest ‘reduction’ in emissions, after CCS – is scandalous.

Offsetting is the right to pollute in one location purchased by certificates declaring its reduction in another, relative to ‘business as usual’ – certificates that can then be traded on carbon markets. The logic by which it functions is questionable, to say the least. It’s as if, when a factory poisoning a Malaysian river reduces its pollution ahead of a regulatory deadline, a factory in Liverpool were thereby licensed to discharge mercury into the Mersey. Of carbon offsetting, the great majority relates to protecting areas from future deforestation. Forests, alongside ocean and peatland, are vital carbon sinks that absorb half of human emissions; many of these are losing their ability to absorb carbon (Greenfield, Citation2024; IPCC, Citation2023). Halting deforestation plays, naturally, a vital role in climate change mitigation. But this should not give licence to corporations to continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere somewhere else (Milman, Citation2018). The carbon credit system into which offset certificates are poured, moreover, is ripe for corruption and fraud (Chan et al., Citation2023). This was made abundantly clear when multiple studies into the world’s largest carbon offsetting certifier revealed that ninety percent of their offsets were utterly worthless (Guizar-Coutiño et al., Citation2022; West et al., Citation2020, Citation2023).

Reforestation schemes may prima facie appear more justifiable, but they too are flawed. Crucially, they fail to take into account the fact that trees are not interchangeable units. Old forest is a complex ecosystem with dense understories; it cannot be ‘replaced’ by plantation silviculture (Monbiot, Citation2021). Moreover, trees take decades to grow and if they are then caught in wildfires for example, they release all the carbon they have been absorbing (Hodgson, Citation2021). People inhabit the places where the offset industry wishes to site plantations. Their fields, livestock and livelihoods are in the crosshairs of carbon offsetting projects. The quantity of land required is staggering – a forest the size of the Isle of Wight would need to be planted every year just to keep up with the carbon footprint of the Royal Air Force (Defence Committee, Citation2023; MoD, Citation2023; Moseman et al., Citation2025). Carbon credits concerned with reforestation and funding renewable energy have been linked to a litany of social and environmental harms. For example, projects connected to Chevron’s carbon offsets include planting rubber monocultures, which are disastrous for local ecosystems and are ineffective at carbon offsetting. A large portion of Chevron’s carbon offsetting schemes involved construction of large hydroelectric dams. These projects would in all likelihood have been constructed anyway, so their status as ‘offsets’ is risible; they have also been accused of undermining local communities, with use of violent methods to suppress resistance (Corporate Accountability, Citation2023). Critics have pointed to the neocolonial and exploitative nature of such relationships (Olúfẹ́mi, Citation2019). Ill-advised if not outright damaging practices of offsetting are taking place in the context of centuries-old unequal relationships of extractivism, sometimes by the very same corporations – as in the case of Chevron in Colombia. We are left with a troubling picture: ineffective carbon offsets threatening food security in the Global South in order to maintain the lifestyles of the world’s frequent flyers (Harvey, Citation2021).

The flaws of reforestation schemes are emblematic of the broader problems with carbon offsetting. These issues are not limited to individual projects but are systemic, as evidenced by the ICAO’s carbon trading scheme, CORSIA. The scheme, which Britain was instrumental in setting up, will account for the majority of the UK aviation sector’s offsets. Beyond the general issues raised above, CORSIA has come under significant criticism from experts. None of the offsetting programmes under the scheme address issues of double counting (where an area of, say, rainforest that was already protected under a national scheme is then counted again for offsetting). Neither do the price mechanisms work, due to oversupply: when buying credits is cheaper than buying SAF, it undermines the incentive to decarbonise. Finally, the entire scheme is beset by a lack of transparency and enforceability (T&E, Citation2021a). That the Jet Zero plan places such emphasis on offsetting seriously undermines its claims to be aiming for ‘net zero’. To repeat: with every fraction of a degree of heating, climate breakdown becomes more severe, unpredictable and irreversible, and the earth’s ecosystems deteriorate further. Carbon offsetting, by giving corporations the green light to continue emitting greenhouse gases, is detrimental to the future habitability of Earth.

Policy proposals

Travelling through an airport in Britain, you might be forgiven for thinking that today’s jetliners are as light as birds. From Gatwick to Bristol, advertisements proudly declare that the airport from which you are taking a flight halfway across the globe is ‘carbon neutral’. Despite the absurdity of such statements being summarily pointed out (Walker, Citation2021), the aviation industry’s attempts to paint a green image of itself are unending. From Ryanair’s banned advertisement that declared it was ‘Europe’s lowest emissions airline’ (ASA, Citation2020) to KLM’s green claims for SAF being ruled ‘misleading’ (Sterling & Plucinska, Citation2024), there are countless examples of aviation-industry ‘greenwashing’. Indeed, a recent study found that 44% of aviation industry publicity regarding carbon offsets was misleading (Guix et al., Citation2022). This is not a new development. ExxonMobil’s 2011 advert promoting biofuel from algae, to give one of many examples, was banned for making similarly dishonest claims (Euractiv, Citation2011). This example is particularly instructive given that the much-vaunted algae ‘solution’ culminated in a dead-end, as we discussed above. The aviation industry has a history of deliberately misleading the public in order to justify its unhindered expansion. To do this it relies on exaggerated, unrealistic and disingenuous claims put forward for a slew of technofix. However, it does not act alone. Obliging governments and compliant media organisations should be held accountable too.

Considering the body of research surveyed in this article, it is evident that the Jet Zero plan prioritises the wellbeing of the aviation industry over the environment. Were the habitability of the planet its driving concern, Jet Zero would recommend demand management measures, such as a ban on aviation advertising and frequent flyer programmes, and the removal of tax exemptions on aviation fuel. It would emphasise 2030 targets, not 2050. It would prioritise consultations with young people, environmentalists, and scientists, rather than aviation lobbyists. It would take seriously the Absolute Zero report from Cambridge University’s FIRES research group (Allwood et al., Citation2019). If Britain’s ‘net zero’ target is to be achieved by mid-century, the FIRES engineers have shown, the aviation industry ‘faces ‘rapid contraction’. This entails the phasing out of ‘all aviation activity’ within 30 years’, with the mothballing of all British airports except Glasgow by 2030, and Heathrow too by 2050 – and only then, if the necessary technologies and sufficient renewable electricity come onstream, could some reopening plausibly begin.

The case for aviation contraction is unlikely to be universally popular, and won’t be a vote winner, unless two conditions obtain. One is a meaningful shift in attitudes to climate breakdown. The other is that transport reforms are linked to proposals that address popular concerns. If campaigners are to bring the aviation industry back down to earth, the vision must be of a habitable planet together with feasible and appealing travel alternatives.

As discussed above, aviation is an elite activity both in the West and worldwide. An opinion survey from 2024 reports that, Rachel Reeves’ pronouncements notwithstanding, the British public does not see aviation growth as essential to economic growth, supports taxation of aviation fuel and raising ticket prices, and ‘strongly supports’ equalising the cost of train travel versus air travel – even if this requires higher taxes on aviation (Chapman, Citation2025b). While jet owners represent 0.0008% of the global population, in Britain private jets represent one in ten flights taking off (Collins et al., Citation2023; Vaughan, Citation2023). A passenger on a private jet travelling from New York to Washington DC – the same distance as London to Paris – is responsible for around 45 times the emissions of a passenger flying the same route on a commercial flight, and 1,100 times one travelling by train (Collins et al., Citation2023). The case for banning private jets, in short, is overwhelming. Business travel should be shrunk, too. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that much of it can be replaced by online meetings. If even just those business trips deemed ‘unnecessary’ were curtailed, Heathrow’s traffic would, at a stroke, shrink by nearly a fifth (Statista, Citation2023). Meanwhile, a frequent-flyer levy could equitably reduce demand – without punishing once-a-year holiday goers – during the period in which alternatives to flying are rolled out. Such levies are popular among the British public (Chapman, Citation2025b), and should be imposed with particular priority on the luxury-ticket classes (first, premium, business), for these, while by far the most environmentally damaging, face relatively low taxation under Air Passenger Duty. Alongside the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies, these tax revenues could also provide ‘innovative sources of finance’ to provide ‘Loss & Damage’ assistance to populations most adversely affected by climate breakdown, on the basis of the polluter pays principle (Amnesty International & CIEL, Citation2022).

Beyond these reforms, short-haul and domestic flights should be rapidly phased out. A first step has been taken by France, with its prohibition on flights covering routes that could be travelled within 2.5 hours by train.Footnote12 Again, evidence suggests these policies are popular, with one EU-wide survey finding that two in three Europeans would support a ban on short-haul flights to destinations that could be reached in twelve hours by train (Garton Ash et al., Citation2020). To replace short-haul flights, investment in rail and battery-electric coach infrastructure could enable reliable and accessible public transport for all, at affordable prices or even free. Within Europe, night trains present a viable and convenient substitute and should be revived and upscaled. Surveys consistently demonstrate that people prefer train journeys to flying (Carn & William, Citation2021). Where rail offers a viable alternative, such as between London and Paris, we see passenger demand for aviation collapsing (Rowland, Citation2019). Cruising at a modest 125 mph, a train from London could, with stops, reach Barcelona in eight hours, Ankara in twenty.

The challenge of addressing emissions from long-haul flights remains particularly complex. Alternatives are less readily available than for short-haul travel, yet their significance is greater. A study of flights departing from 31 European countries revealed that those exceeding 4,000 km constituted only 6% of total departures yet were responsible for 47% of total fuel consumption. Similarly, a global analysis found that just 5% of flights – those longer than 3,000 km – accounted for nearly 40% of total aviation fuel consumed (Dobruszkes et al., Citation2024).

To date, there appear to be no viable proposals for long-haul aviation that simultaneously meet ecological sustainability criteria, uphold social equity, and remain politically feasible. What is certain, however, is that a single return long-haul flight from Britain can exceed an individual's entire annual per capita carbon budget, assuming adherence to the 1.5°C climate target. In this context, substantial reductions in long-haul air travel appear to be the only ecologically defensible course of action. While such measures may face resistance, the imperative to remain within the boundaries of a stable planetary system must surely take precedence. The alternative is to risk pushing the Earth system into a state incompatible with the complex societal structures developed over the past five millennia. As Al Gore aptly stated, ‘the maximum that is politically feasible, even the maximum that is politically imaginable right now, still falls short of the minimum that is scientifically and ecologically necessary’ (McKibben, Citation1995).

The absence of clear alternatives to long-haul aviation should not be used to justify the continuation of current practices. That said, we can take inspiration from the slow travel movement (Kieran, Citation2013). If legislation encouraged flexibility from employers, slow-moving zero-emission ships could offer an alternative for some long-distance journeys (Neale, Citation2021). And airships – we venture tentatively, aware that we may be afflicted by the techno-utopianism that this article cautions against – may offer an additional low emissions alternative to aeroplanes (Hall, Citation2024; Jolly, Citation2025).

All these initiatives, whether night trains, ships or airships, would create new jobs, for which workers departing the aviation industry should, in a ‘just transition’, be given priority. A report commissioned by Possible found that if British aviation shrank by two-thirds, around 200,000 jobs would be lost, but by replacing these journeys with alternatives (e.g. trains and ferries), together with the resulting growth in domestic tourism, a net gain of over 300,000 jobs would result (Meadway, Citation2022).

The ‘just transition’, as has been widely observed, is a contested concept. We follow Stefania Barca in her attempt to reclaim the just transition strategy from a simple jobs campaign yoked to a ‘green growth’ agenda, to a programme that, while centred on trade-union mobilisation for ‘green jobs’, simultaneously draws upon ‘Indigenous knowledges’ and advocates for disinvestment from the fossil fuel and nuclear sectors, coupled with energy democracy and food sovereignty at the community level (Barca, paraphrased in Rainnie & Snell, Citation2024, p. 38). International solidarity would be close to its heart; the risks of reinforcing neo-colonial and extractivist relationships with the Global South in the pursuit of ‘green’ policies are well documented (Abram et al., Citation2022; Ambrose, Citation2024; Bell, Citation2024; Hamouchene & Sandwell, Citation2023; Okpanachi et al., Citation2022).

As an embryonic example of a ‘just transition’ in aviation, consider the case of ‘A Green New Deal for Gatwick’. It was convened by eco-socialists and union officials from the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), a union that has been at the forefront of campaigning and policy work on ‘climate jobs’ and the just transition (Lethbridge, Citation2024), during the Covid-19 pandemic when aviation workers were facing mass layoffs. We asked Robert Magowan, one of the proposal’s instigators, what lay behind the Gatwick plan. ‘We know that aviation must degrow’, he replied, ‘and it was degrowing during the pandemic, but this must not come at the cost of workers. The pandemic response showed what governments can do when pressure is on – especially when the Broughton manufacturing site of Airbus was retooled to produce ventilators’.

Magowan and his colleagues surveyed the manifold ways in which Gatwick workers’ skills sets could be adapted to jobs elsewhere, in decarbonising industries. With PCS backing, they found support among the workforce, including from a pilot whose words eloquently sum up what is at stake:

It has been my lifelong dream to fly. To face up to losing this massive part of our lives is incredibly scary; to lose our job is like losing a part of ourselves. But as pilots, we use our skills to identify this existential threat to the natural world and our lives. If this was an emergency in flight, we would have diverted to a safe destination long ago. We can’t just fly blindly to the planned destination as the flight deck fills with smoke. Our industry’s impact on global emissions is irrefutable. The so-called solutions to ‘green’ the industry at its current scale are decades away and are not globally or ecologically just. With environmental consciousness rising, the aviation sector will either shrink by design, through a ‘Just Transition’ for workers, or by disaster. We must find a way to put workers at the forefront of the green revolution, to ensure we have the option to be retrained into the green jobs of the future (Latif et al., Citation2020, p. 24).

A just transition of this kind could have numerous positive impacts on local communities. €4 million is lost every hour by European governments because aviation is untaxed (T&E, Citationn.d.). This aid received by airports and the aviation industry could be redirected to fund local leisure and sustainable transport infrastructure. Even redundant airports could be transformed into community hubs, museums, or green spaces (as was done at the former Berlin airport at Tempelhof) (Magowan, Citation2022).

Conclusion

The Jet Zero plan, with its reliance on unproven technofix and industry-friendly policies, exemplifies a complacency that has underpinned climate inaction for decades. It not only fails to address the scale of the aviation sector’s contribution to the climate crisis, but risks exacerbating it. Its techno-solutionism would have us believe in the alchemical power of new technology: it can turn carbon into gold. But the evidence is clear: carbon capture and storage, sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen-fuelled and battery-electric planes are not the silver bullets they are made out to be, and offsetting is a farce. These proposals serve chiefly as window dressing for the aviation industry, an alibi to provide cover for unchecked expansion while delaying the difficult decisions needed to mitigate global heating.

As the mercury continues to rise, governments, rather than working urgently to reduce aviation emissions, are placing their bets on yet-to-materialise technologies (Schleussner et al., Citation2024). The airlines, hand in glove with policymakers, are using these ‘solutions’ to carve out space to expand their operations. If such solutions, however, are false promises, as this paper argues, the aviation industry ought to be scaled down, and permitted to re-grow only if the lifecycle of aircraft can be designed to avoid GHG emissions entirely. The methods necessary to curb aviation emissions exist; what is lacking is the political ambition to implement them. They includes policies to equitably reduce demand for air travel, and investment in sustainable alternatives, with measure to ensure a just transition for workers and communities dependent on the aviation industry. The flaws of governmental responses to the Covid-19 pandemic notwithstanding, they hinted at the rapid, transformative change that can occur where the political will exists.

For the rising global temperature to be stabilised at 1.5°C, high-emissions industries must be rapidly reined in. This requires not only a radical reassessment of how we travel, but also structural transformations, with respect to the logics of economic growth and the goals of social justice and the habitability of the planet.

Notes

1 For suggestions and comments on an earlier draft, we wish to thank Jamie Morgan. The usual caveat applies.

2 The CCC acknowledges the problem: ‘Aviation’s non-CO2 effects refer to the additional climate impacts from aviation not due to GHG emissions, such as line shaped contrails, high cloud increases, and the impacts from air pollution. Since 1990, the warming effect of non-CO2 effects has tripled’. (CCC, Citation2025, p. 223).

6 Average measures of fuel efficiency conceal substantial variation across periods. During the late 1960s, the replacement of first-generation with second-generation jets yielded significant efficiency improvements (5.6% annually in block fuel and 3.7% in MV). By contrast, from the 1990s through the early 2010s, the absence of major technological advances resulted in near-zero gains. The introduction of more efficient aircraft types in the 2010s, notably the Boeing 787, produced improvements of up to 3.5%. However, efficiency growth stagnated again in the early 2020s (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2024). That average fuel efficiency has struggled to climb substantially above 1% pa is confirmed by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) which in 2019 admitted that while they aspire to efficiency gains of 2% pa, “today’s aircraft are approximately 80 per cent more efficient in use of fuel per passenger kilometre than that in the 1960s” – in other words around 1.1%pa (ICAO, Citation2019).

7 Recent research suggests that the energy demands of data centres may already exceed, globally, the electricity produced by renewables (Castro et al., Citation2024). This should be of concern to the Starmer government, given its commitment to a breakneck expansion of data centres (Gross et al., Citation2025).

8 It is important to point out that even if we were to put aside the environmental and social costs of airport expansion, its contributions to growth are debatable. A recent report carried out by the New Economics Foundation found that as expansion primarily increases outbound passengers, it is “highly unlikely” that it offers “any growth benefits to the UK” (Chapman, Citation2025a). And in an extensive analysis of the economic case for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport, a report found that it would in fact lead to a net loss for the region’s economy (Chapman & Postle, Citation2020).

9 The EU’s SAF mandate suffers from similar problems. Based on the projections of Boeing and Airbus, emissions savings from the EU’s 42% SAF mandate will be cancelled out by growth, with CO2 emissions in 2049 predicted to be just slightly lower than their 2019 level (T&E, Citation2025). However, given the low forecast for the availability of efuels, like Power to Liquid (PtL), we infer that a hefty portion of that SAF demand will be met by HEFA-based biofuel or similarly unsustainable sources. If this is accounted for then European aviation emissions would likely rise to a peak in 2049 (T&E, Citation2025).

10 Despite knowing of the concerns regarding authenticity of the oil, the British government has excluded SAF from its investigation into Chinese biodiesel imports (Hussain, Citation2024). Instead, it relies on industry-led certification schemes like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certificate to verify authenticity. These schemes depend heavily on self-reporting rather than independent verification, casting doubt on their reliability (Greenpeace, Citation2021).

11 In the UK, biodiesel is primarily used for road transport (DEFRA Citation2025), as well as agricultural machinery, and power generators.

12 Despite France’s ability to whisk passengers across vast distances in under 2.5 h thanks to its extensive high-speed rail network, Britain still sees multiple daily flights on routes that are easily covered by train. From London, you can reach all the major northern cities in less than 2.5 h. And yet, there are still around five flights a day from London to Newcastle, and a similar number to Manchester.",https://covers.tandf.co.uk/og/RSOC.png,N,,2025-10-21 23:56:10.048208

Dent said this won’t be the last word on how the climate law affects the bottom line of ag businesses.","Washington quietly ended funding this summer for a program that provided millions of dollars in rebates to farmers who paid unfair fuel surcharges under Washington’s landmark climate law.

Lawmakers are hoping instead that legislation enacted in May will make it easier for farm fuel users and haulers of agricultural goods to receive the fuel exemption promised under the state’s cap-and-trade system.

This year’s law directed the Department of Ecology to create an online map of retailers who sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that excludes any surcharges associated with the Climate Commitment Act.

Rep. Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake, said this will simplify the process for farmers and haulers. Rather than pay a surcharge and submit paperwork to the government for a rebate, they can avoid extra costs up front, at the pump, he said.

“This should be an easier way for farmers to not pay a surcharge,” Dent said.

Complicated carveout

Central to the Climate Commitment Act are auctions for pollution allowances that refineries and other companies need to buy to offset their carbon emissions.

Under the law, the agricultural, maritime and aviation sectors are supposed to be exempt from the law’s cap on emissions and any fees fuel companies might pass to customers to cover the cost of buying the allowances. Fuel used for trucking crops and other agricultural goods on public highways is exempt as well.

Soon after the cap-and-trade program began in 2023, complaints about these exemptions started streaming in.

There were difficulties tracking whether diesel fuel was being used for exempt purposes. A process where exempt fuel buyers had to present certificates to fuel sellers was cumbersome and faulty. One challenge for farmers was knowing where fuel exemption certificates would be accepted.

Bottom line, farmers and truckers said fuel distributors were, in many cases, passing on the cost of allowances to the tune of as much as 70 cents a gallon.

Ecology put together a workgroup that met several times in 2023 to try — unsuccessfully, said farmers and truckers — to iron out the wrinkles.

Even before the panel completed its work, the Washington Trucking Associations and the Washington Farm Bureau were asking a judge to scrap Ecology regulations guiding the exemptions and to open a new rulemaking process.

That fight reached the state Supreme Court this week.

Funding left out of budget

In 2024, the Legislature set aside $30 million for rebates to farm fuel users and transporters of agricultural goods who could show they paid a surcharge tied to the climate law for which they should have been exempt. The Department of Licensing ran the Agriculture Support Program with funding from Climate Commitment Act proceeds.

It launched in August 2024 and ended June 30 this year.

Farmers and transporters could seek rebates for fuel purchased between Jan. 1, 2023, and Dec. 31, 2024. A total of 2,744 applications came in, with $7,887,820 in rebates awarded, according to the Department of Licensing. There were rebate recipients in each of the state’s 39 counties.

Overall, the department spent $9.4 million on the rebate program, with the remaining $20.6 million returned to the climate fund.

Dent said he wanted the rebate program to continue, “but budget writers being budget writers decided not to do so.”

House Bill 1912, which Dent authored this year, says it is the intent of the Legislature to extend the rebate program through the 2025-27 biennium. That is not what occurred, even though the bill passed by margins of 94-2 in the House and 49-0 in the Senate.

The House penciled in $3 million to keep the program going in its budget, but the Senate put no funds in its version. That is what the Legislature passed and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed.

As a result, applications for rebates closed June 2. All those received were processed, with money sent by June 30.

In the meantime, the Department of Ecology developed the new online directory of retailers who have told the department that they sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that is different from fuel that is not exempt under the climate law.

This directory lists the name, address, county, and, if applicable, city of each exempt retail fuel seller. If additional retailers self-report, the site will be updated.

Dent said this won’t be the last word on how the climate law affects the bottom line of ag businesses.

Airplane travel is one of the most carbon-intensive activities. In 2023, the aviation industry’s carbon emissions reached 950 megatonnes, accounting for 2.5% of the world’s emissions. To address this issue, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been developed as an alternative to petroleum-based aviation fuel.

As announced in the Hong Kong Policy Address 2025, Hong Kong is eyeing SAF. In this respect, the city is planning to develop a SAF industry chain in cooperation with mainland China authorities, adopt specified SAF consumption targets for flights departing from the Hong Kong International Airport by 2030, and build a SAF blending facility to boost competitiveness.

What Is SAF?

Instead of petroleum, SAF is made from sustainable feedstock such as municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, oils, and fats.

The Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene is one of the most common types of SAF. First, the appropriate feedstock, like wood waste, agricultural residue, and municipal solid waste, will undergo a thermochemical process called gasification. During this process, biomass will first be heated to remove its water content and break its structure into simpler molecules. Then, a chain of chemical reactions will happen under high temperature (above 700) in an environment with limited oxygen. As a result, the biomass will be converted into syngas that primarily consists of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. After removing the impurities, the syngas can be fed into the reactor to produce liquid hydrocarbons by undergoing the catalytic chemical reaction. The liquid hydrocarbons can be used as aviation fuel after refining.

Why SAF?

There are various advantages to adopting SAF in Hong Kong.

First, SAF is a drop-in fuel that can be directly used in current aircraft. It means that there is no impact on the performance, and no modification or extra infrastructure is required.

Depending on the type of feedstock and production methods, SAF can be blended with conventional aviation fuel in a range of 10% to 50%, with lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared with conventional fuel. Using SAF can also improve air quality by lowering emissions of sulfur and particulate matter.

All this makes SAF a great ally in decarbonization efforts globally and in Hong Kong – the city is committed to reducing carbon emissions by 50% compared with the 2005 level by 2035 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

Developing SAF is also beneficial for businesses. While airlines can reduce the scope one emissions generated by their aircrafts, other companies can also benefit in the resulting reduction of upstream scope three emissions generated by business travel. As a result, these companies can not only lower their carbon footprint but also reduce the risk of financial loss caused by climate change.

As required by the Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Limited, all listed companies in Hong Kong have an obligation to disclose sustainability-related information – better known as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards – to the public. Therefore, companies that develop or support SAF can increase their business reputation and attract new investment.

Challenges

Although developing SAF is a good solution to decarbonize aviation, it comes with some challenges.

Currently, the cost of SAF is about two to three times that of conventional aviation fuel. The reason is associated with the limited feedstock supply. Some feedstock, such as crop and virgin oil-based feedstock, may lead to deforestation, land use change, and biodiversity loss. If forests are removed, a massive amount of carbon dioxide stored in the trees will be released back to the atmosphere.

It is also difficult to ensure a consistent supply of feedstocks like solid waste and agricultural residues. This, in turn, means higher production costs. As a result, airlines may continue to use conventional aviation fuel to save costs and avoid increasing ticket prices.

Overcoming these challenges requires detailed planning and supportive policies, such as diversified feedstock and production methods and government subsidies.

Moreover, global SAF adoption is slow. In 2024, global SAF production accounted for just 0.3% of the total aviation fuel production. It is expected to reach 0.7% of total jet fuel production this year.

Without government incentives and leadership, research and development as well as adoption of SAF technology will lag behind, hindering progress of the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Greenwashing Accusations

SAF has been described as a form of greenwashing – when companies make misleading statements about the environmental impacts of their products as a marketing tactic.

In fact, SAF is a vague term. People with an inadequate understanding may think it is a completely sustainable solution that has zero emissions. Unfortunately, that is far from the truth. During the combustion of jet engines, carbon dioxide will still be released into the atmosphere, even though the lifecycle carbon emissions of SAF are significantly lower. At the same time, air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter will still be emitted, impacting air quality.

Global Trends

Despite slow adoption, multiple countries have implemented rules requiring aviation fuel suppliers to increase blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel. For example, the United Kingdom introduced a SAF Mandate earlier this year. The requirement will increase linearly, from 2% in 2025 to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU Aviation measure requires a share of SAF in EU airports from this year, which will gradually increase to 70% by 2050. Both mandates have excluded crop and virgin oil-based feedstocks to avoid deforestation, land use changes, and biodiversity loss.

Brazil, the host country of this year’s UN climate change summit, COP30, launched the Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels. Announced last week, the initiative aims to quadruple the production and use of sustainable fuels in aviation by 2035. The proposal has won the support from India, Italy, and Japan, and it will be presented at the climate conference in Belém next month.

Scaling Up SAF in Hong Kong

Although Hong Kong does not require airlines to use SAF, Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific has already implemented Asia’s first major SAF program. Launched in 2022, it commits the company to incorporate SAF for 10% of its total fuel consumption by the end of the decade. On October 21, the airline announced a joint investment agreement with Airbus, committing to co-invest up to US$70 million to support the SAF development in Asia and globally.

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify,”evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond. Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake,” a press release read.

Among the Cathay Pacific SAF program’s partners is Hong Kong’s Airport Authority (AAHK). Its General Manager for Sustainability, Peter Lee, said: “We recognise that SAF is a key solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, and aim to drive uptake at Hong Kong International Airport in the coming years.”

As an international logistics hub, the Hong Kong International Airport has been the world’s busiest international cargo airport since 2010. In 2024, it handled about five million tonnes of cargo and 54.9 million passengers. With such a high flow, it is crucial to develop SAF policy and facilities to demonstrate Hong Kong’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality and enhancing its global competitiveness and reputation.

Speaking at a conference last October, Cathay’s General Manager of Sustainability Grace Cheung called for more government pressure for Hong Kong’s aviation sector to meet its climate goals.

“Regulators have a key role to play for a level playing field, so that every [player] is doing the right thing for society,” Cheung said, according to the South China Morning Post. “If we leave it to the market, every company will wait for their competitors to make the first move.”

As Hong Kong plans to develop a SAF industry chain and build a SAF blending facility, the production technology will improve and become more cost-effective in the long run. When that happens, airlines will have more incentive to use SAF.",https://earth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Untitled-design-2021-12-08T165503.159.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 21:16:35.686067

The NFU on Oct. 14 sent letters to President Donald Trump and federal lawmakers urging Congress “to provide immediate economic assistance to support struggling family farmers and ranchers and to make important policy corrections that will help American agriculture in the long-term.”

“Family farmers and ranchers face severe economic challenges and a deepening crisis if they do not receive immediate assistance,” the NFU wrote in the letters. “Recently enacted trade policies and the resulting actions by other countries have wreaked havoc on our markets, driving commodity prices far below the cost of production and significantly impacting once-reliable agricultural export sales. Meanwhile, input costs are projected to reach record levels in 2025. Stress levels are high among farmers, reflected in the rising number of farm bankruptcy filings across the country. The number of farms in the U.S. has been declining for decades, with the loss of more than 140,000 farms, or 7%, from 2017 to 2022. Every farm lost also dramatically impacts the surrounding community and rural economy. Without swift intervention, this trend will only accelerate in the coming years.”

To survive the current cycle of negative profitability, the NFU said aid payments must be directed to family agriculture operations and balanced among regions and crops. The payments must also be subject to meaningful payment limits, and foreign-owned corporations and large, concentrated agribusinesses must be barred from accessing economic assistance, according to the NFU.

NFU is also urging aid to be paired with efforts to investigate monopolies in the agriculture industry and their resulting impact on the farm economy.

In addition, the NFU is stressing that Congress must dedicate resources to developing new, high-value domestic markets for American crops and enhancing existing markets. “Economic assistance must be paired with authorization for nationwide, year-round E15 usage, building toward the use of higher blends of ethanol like E30, as well as increased opportunities for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel production,” the NFU wrote in the letter.

The goal of this project, according to its leaders, Alex McGowan from Cathay and Anand Stanley from Airbus, will be to help scale SAF towards 2030 and beyond. These two companies will also advocate for supportive SAF policies across Asia, leveraging the region's feedstocks and demand.

A Deeper Look At This Specific Announcement

Cathay Pacific and Airbus will co-invest up to $70 million to accelerate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. This partnership will identify, evaluate, and fund projects designed to support the long-term development of sustainable fuels. Selection criteria for these projects will include commercial viability, technological maturity, and the potential for long-term procurement.

These companies will also collaborate in a way seldom seen in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel space, both on the supply and the demand side of the SAF question. This announcement was made by Cathay's Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer, Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia Pacific, Anand Stanley. In a statement seen by Simple Flying, Anand had the following words to share on the matter:

""This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach.""

A Deeper Look At What This Means For Cathay Pacific

From a practical perspective, this deal gives Cathay Pacific earlier, cheaper, and more reliable access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while Asia's supply remains nascent. Co-investing with Airbus gives Cathay the ability to influence which plants get built, lock in long-term procurement at negotiable prices, and diversify its access to the fuel across the board in order to help it better comply with emerging blending mandates.

This also helps the airline deepen ties with corporate customers that are looking to reduce their overall carbon footprint and support them with green surcharges and co-funded SAF programs that can defend yields. From a financial perspective, Cathay gets optional upside from project equity in addition to an actionable hedge against future SAF scarcity that could widen cost gaps versus the airline's peers.

From a strategic standpoint, this pairing creates a near-to-medium-term pipeline that creates a barbell across multiple time horizons. The main risks to this are execution, policy lags, or fragmentation in Asian markets, as well as sustained price control over the nascent SAF pipeline in East Asia.

A Deeper Look At What This Means For Airbus

For European aerospace manufacturer Airbus, this partnership achieves three goals. The company is first looking to secure SAF supply for airline customers while strengthening its overall decarbonization narrative. The manufacturer has long wanted to secure its position as one of the industry's leaders in terms of sustainable aviation fuel production. This move opens a repeatable co-investment model that can serve as the groundwork for other partnerships across the region.

By helping finance commercially viable SAF plants, Airbus supports European-style refueling mandates and the reduction of delivery flight emissions, all while helping make the future SAF-ready. This offers more credibility to the manufacturer's Airbus A320neo, Airbus A330neo, and Airbus A350 campaigns. This further deepens the company's ties with Cathay Pacific and other airlines from across the Asia-Pacific region, potentially aiding in sales and service uptake.

From a financial perspective, the manufacturer's equity stake in the matter helps it maintain optionality while hedging SAF scarcity that ultimately could slow overall fleet renewal. Policy collaboration will elevate Airbus's influence on feedstocks and standards. The key risks involved are project delays, policy fragmentation, and returns that trail internal thresholds.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1835755075-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-21 18:56:10.372197

During the meeting, attendees learned about Gevo’s plans to build a sustainable aviation fuel plant on-site, carbon intensity tracking through Gevo subsidiary Verity as well as the potential expansion of the existing bioethanol production plant.

“These public meetings are good,” Richardton Mayor Jesse Aman said to The Dickinson Press afterwards. “The more public meetings we have the more awareness for the project will spread and the more people’s questions will be answered.”

Gevo orginally planned to build a sustainable aviation plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, even securing a conditional $1.4 billion federal loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy.

However, the Lake Preston site was dependent upon the construction of the Summit Carbon Pipeline. After Summit repeatedly failed to secure the proper state permits from South Dakota, Gevo officials said they began searching for an alternative site.

“We decided to take some of our money and go kind of jump start our production capability by finding a site that would really fit in with our business strategy,” Chris Ryan, Gevo’s president and COO, said during a June interview with The Dickinson Press.

Gevo’s search for an alternative site ended in Richardton. Ryan cited the facility’s existing infrastructure, including its carbon sequestration capabilities and existing ties to the local agricultural community, as reasons for its selection.

Gevo first announced its acquisition of the site in September 2024. Red Trail’s shareholders approved the sale in December of the same year, and the sale closed in February 2025.

During the public meeting, Ryan presented Gevo’s plans to build a sustainable aviation fuels plant to the public.

In an interview with The Dickinson Press prior to the public meeting, he said the plant would create about 50 full-time jobs once operational and several hundred during construction. Ryan said it was too early in the process to confirm an exact cost of construction but put an estimate at about $500 million.

He explained — once operational — the new plant would take the bioethanol produced on-site and convert it into sustainable jet fuels.

Sustainable aviation fuels are a growing industry worldwide. The International Air Transport Association — which represents about 82% of global air traffic — pledged in 2021 to be carbon neutral by 2050. The plan relies on sustainable aviation fuels for 65% of its reductions and carbon capture for 19%.

In addition to Gevo’s plans to produce and sell sustainable aviation fuels , Ryan praised Red Trail’s former owners for investing in carbon sequestration technology and explained the company planned to use the carbon sequestration to obtain and sell carbon credits as an additional revenue stream.

“That was really visionary,” he said during the meeting. “To start that project before it was really clear of the value of these. I need to say from Gevo, there is a lot of value in that carbon sequestration.”

As part of the meeting, Gevo also spoke about its subsidiary Verity’s plans to offer carbon intensity scoring to farmers in the area.

Carbon intensity is a measure of how much carbon dioxide is emitted per unit of economic output — in this case, the unit of measurement would most likely be bushels of corn or growing fields.

Gevo officials explained if they buy corn with a lower carbon intensity score to lower their overall carbon footprint, they are able to get larger carbon credits, potentially leading to more money for local corn growers.

“If you had a lower carbon score, yeah, we could think we could pay you more for your corn,” Ryan said during the meeting. “How much more? I don't know, it depends upon what revenue we might be able to generate from the lower carbon.”

Prior to the meeting, Ryan told The Dickinson Press its purpose was to keep community members informed and to answer their questions or concerns.

“Gevo is committed to growing this plant, and we'd love to have you know the local farmers all come to us to sell us their corn,” he said.

Local community members and farmers were able to ask questions and raise their concerns during the final public participation phase of the meeting.

Several farmers asked if Gevo was considering expanding the existing bioethanol production plant , to which Ryan confirmed the company was. He also said the company was looking into renovating the current facility as well to increase its storage capacity and lower wait times for local farmers dropping off bushels of corn.

One area farmer asked if he would soon be required to acquire a carbon intensity score for his corn to sell it to Gevo. Ryan and other Gevo officials responded he — nor would anyone — be required to do so.

Also present at the meeting was Richardton Mayor Jesse Aman. Aman said he had mostly heard aesthetic concerns about the proposed facility from Richardton residents, such as its appearance, smell and noise.

During the meeting, Gevo answered several such questions regarding aesthetic concerns and assured attendees the new facility would not dramatically disrupt the lives of local residents and the company would do its best to address and resolve any concerns that may arise in the future.

Overall, Aman said he was excited by the prospect of the plant and the opportunities it posed for Richardton.

“I think it’ll be great for the growth of this area and will bring more career opportunities,” he said. “It’ll give our farmers more incentives to grow their crops and help develop our community and the surrounding ones.”

Decarbonizing flight will not happen overnight, but the journey for innovative pathways to create sustainable jet fuel has already taken off. The aviation sector is responsible for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in the U.S., approximately 98% of aviation-related emissions result from jet fuel combustion.1,2 This highlights the critical role of fuel decarbonization strategies, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) being considered among the more feasible options available for reducing emissions from medium- to long-haul flights.3 Governments in the European Union (EU) and UK are pushing this transformation forward by setting mandates for the progressive use of aviation fuel originating from sustainable materials.4 For example, as of January 1, 2025, commercial flights taking off from EU airports must carry at least 2% of SAF in their tanks. By 2030, the mandate requires a minimum of 6% of SAF, including a 1.2% synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) blend with conventional jet fuel.5 In addition, many airline members of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have committed to a 10% reduction by 2030, aiming for net zero by 2050.6

The state of SAF. There are two primary categories of SAF: bio-SAF, derived from biomass and eSAF (also known as synthetic or power-to-liquid SAF), produced by combining green hydrogen (H₂) from water electrolysis with captured carbon dioxide (CO₂). These intermediates can be converted into hydrocarbons through several pathways, including Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, methanol-to-jet (MtJ) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes. Each route upgrades intermediates into jet-range hydrocarbons through a series of catalytic steps, which may include oligomerization, hydrogenation and hydroprocessing to meet jet fuel specifications.7,8 When produced from waste-based feedstocks, SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80%–90% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the production pathway.9

Today, SAF deployment faces investment barriers. Cost estimates indicate that SAF is 2─10 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and conversion technology used, largely due to high capital expenditure (CAPEX) for early-stage facilities, limited economies of scale and the expense of green H2 for eSAF pathways.10,11 While SAF is technically mature and scalable, achieving cost competitiveness will require coordinated investment, supportive policy and continued innovation across the value chain.12

Moreover, feedstock availability is limited. The Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) projects global SAF demand could reach 330 MM metric t (MMt)–450 MMt by 2050; however, production is only a fraction of this target.13 For example, Neste (an SAF producer) produces approximately 1.5 MMtpy,14 while Spanish energy company Moeve delivered 14,400 metric t of SAF in 2024 and aims to scale to 800,000 metric tpy by 2030 through a second-generation biofuels plant in Huelva, Spain.15 These figures underscore the scale-up challenge and the need for coordinated policy, investment and technology development to close the gap between capacity and future demand.

While there is a massive SAF market on the rise, the limited availability of waste-based feedstock makes it difficult to meet alternative fuel mandates with bio-based SAF alone. This opens the need for eSAF, made with green H2 and captured biogenic CO2, which is a byproduct of many industrial processes.

Different pathways and types of SAF. The production of SAF can follow many different, and often interconnected, routes. Each pathway has its own feedstocks, conversion processes and advantages, but together they highlight the opportunities and challenges of scaling SAF for global aviation.

Bio-SAF. Bio-based SAF is derived from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, forestry byproducts and organic waste. While these feedstocks support multiple conversion pathways, including hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), AtJ and gasification-based routes, their global availability is limited. According to ICF (consulting firm) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) analyses, bio-based feedstocks will only be sufficient to supply approximately 50% of the SAF required by 2050 to meet the aviation sector’s net-zero targets.16 HEFA, the dominant commercial pathway, is projected to contribute less than 10% of total SAF volumes by 2050 due to feedstock constraints.17 Current bio-based SAF costs range from €1,600/t─€2,500/t, compared to approximately €700/t for fossil jet fuel.18 These structural limitations make it clear that bio-based SAF, while essential, must be complemented by synthetic alternatives such as power-to-liquid fuels to achieve net-zero targets.

eSAF. eSAF combines captured CO₂ with green H2 from renewable-powered electrolysis to produce synthetic hydrocarbons via two main routes: MtJ or Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Unlike bio-SAF, it avoids agricultural feedstocks, reducing land use by 3–30 times and water use by up to 1,000 times, while achieving 85%–95% lifecycle GHG reductions.19,20 This advantage comes with high energy intensity, about 15 megawatt hour (MWh)–20 MWh of renewable electricity per metric t of fuel, making power availability the key scalability constraint.21 Today, costs are €4,000/t–€6,000/t, nearly 6–8 times the cost of fossil jet fuel and 2–3 times the cost of bio-SAF but could fall below €2,000 by 2050 with large-scale deployment and cheaper renewables.22 These characteristics position eSAF as a cornerstone for deep decarbonization, contingent on investments in renewable energy and CO₂ capture infrastructure.

Fischer-Tropsch vs. MtJ pathways. Fischer-Tropsch is an American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) approved pathway for SAF, certified for up to 50% blending and recertification. MtJ is not yet approved; it is under evaluation before inclusion in the ATSM standard specification.23,24 Both pathways can enable the production of drop-in SAF using renewable carbon sources.25 Fischer-Tropsch, a commercially mature process, converts synthetic gas (syngas) directly into liquid hydrocarbons, while MtJ first produces methanol, then converts it into light olefins such as ethylene and propylene using zeolite catalysts.

These olefins are oligomerized into longer hydrocarbon chains, which are equivalent to the intermediates from the Fischer-Tropsch process.26 Then these long chains undergo a hydrocracking process to a shorter-chain jet range (C9-C14), and finally these linear paraffins are isomerized to meet the aviation fuel cold properties. Both pathways are critical for scaling SAF beyond bio-feedstock limits.27

Within the MtJ route, a high potential pathway is methanol-to-olefins (MTO), which is particularly relevant for the production of eSAF from eMethanol. This distinction is critical because bio-methanol is generally not suitable for bio-SAF production due to sustainability, purity and economic constraints, making eMethanol the preferred feedstock for this pathway. Additionally, the MTO approach creates synergies with other sectors by enabling the production of sustainable olefins, which are also key intermediates for low-carbon chemicals and materials.

Future outlook for eSAF. SAF remains a critical element in aviation decarbonization strategies. Its production leverages MTO, providing a promising route to jet-range hydrocarbons while maintaining integration with chemical and energy value chains. The Global Impact Coalition (GIC) is actively working on several projects focused on MTO and sustainable methanol, adjacent to emerging technologies for SAF. These initiatives can help accelerate the transition toward a more sustainable and scalable SAF supply, leveraging synergies across energy and chemical sectors. Meeting the target of increasing SAF output to 17 MMt by 2030 will require diversification of pathways. eSAF represents a technically viable option to accelerate capacity expansion, leveraging sustainable synthetic feedstocks to reduce reliance on conventional fossil fuel.

NEW in 2025, Poultry Tech Summit will be held in collaboration with the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs (US-RSPE) annual meeting held November 5, 2025.","United Airlines and Darling Ingredients are building a comprehensive sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) marketplace by connecting the entire value chain — from waste fats and oils to finished fuel products.

""Fifteen years ago, a lot of the waste fats were used for just calories in animal feed,"" explained Ethan Carter, director of sustainability, Darling Ingredients, “They weren't really the nutritional value — they're just calories, essentially. And we were trying to look for what's the best and highest use for these.""

""Airlines are thinking about the entire fuel value chain as part of our decarbonization journeys. When it comes to lower carbon fuels like SAF, the feedstocks are an integral part of the product,"" added Ryan Backman-Flamerich, senior manager, United Airlines Decarbonization team who leads the airline’s SAF procurement efforts.

""We look at our role not just as a consumer and purchaser of SAF, but in many ways, we're also very active in also working towards policy solutions.""

At the U.S. Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry and Eggs (US-RSPE) annual meeting, Backman-Flamerich and Carter will discuss how partnerships between the rendering and aviation industries are advancing decarbonization goals, the role of agriculture in circular economies, and how the poultry sector can become a strategic player in renewable energy.

On November 4-5, the US-RSPE Annual Meeting will unite stakeholders from across the supply chain to advance measurable sustainability outcomes in poultry and egg production. The educational program will be held in collaboration with the 2025 Poultry Tech Summit on November 3-5, 2025, at the Atlanta Airport Marriot in Atlanta, Georgia.

Registration for both events is now open.

Uniting to advance sustainability

Through their joint venture with Valero for Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), Darling processes multiple waste streams — including poultry fats, tallow, used cooking oil, and distillers corn oil from ethanol production — into renewable diesel and SAF.

Carter emphasized the urgency of available solutions: ""This is the solution we have now. We can use waste fats and oils, refine them, and we can decarbonize that heavy industry that's really difficult to decarbonize in a short time frame.""

He contrasted this with emerging technologies, noting that ""when you look at a lot of the things that airlines are working on that are 5, 10, 15 years away for some of the solutions, like e-fuels,"" waste-based SAF offers immediate impact.

Connecting throughout the value chain

According to Backman-Flamerich: ""We at United, we see our decarbonization journey as partly helping to build the solutions that will drive decarbonization in aviation. For SAF, we are building an ecosystem, and that is not going to happen if it is just a one-sided platform. We have to collaborate with others to scale SAF with our ambitions.""

Airlines are increasingly moving up the value chain through equity investments, strategic partnerships, and leveraging their fuel subsidiaries, while feedstock producers like Darling have moved downstream through processing ventures.

“Darling is a little bit unique in the feedstock space in that they have the joint venture with Valero for DGD,"" Backman-Flamerich noted. ""In that sense, Darling has moved further down the value chain than probably many feedstock producers.""

Beyond decarbonization, SAF production addresses critical energy security concerns. With traditional refineries closing across the U.S. due to reduced demand for petroleum products in other sectors, and refineries unable to operate profitably on jet fuel alone, the industry faces a potential crisis.

Singapore can now impose a fixed levy on all departing flights after Parliament passed a Bill on Oct 14 to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines.

Sustainable aviation fuel, mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil, has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without any costly modifications.

The Bill was passed unanimously.

Presenting the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill for debate, Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling said the proposed changes will allow the green jet fuel levy to be paid to the CAAS, which will set up a fund to procure and manage such fuel.

Noting that green jet fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel, she said Singapore has chosen a “pragmatic and balanced approach” in setting a target for sustainable aviation fuel to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi Airport and Seletar Airport in 2026.

Singapore will collect the funds needed to procure green jet fuel in an upfront manner through the levy.

Preliminary estimates from the CAAS had suggested that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

MPs such as Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang West) and Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Changi GRC) asked about the impact of the levy, and reasons for passing the costs on to passengers through higher air ticket prices.

More specifically, Ms Poh asked why the cost burden is to be borne solely by consumers, instead of airlines.

Responding, Ms Sun said the sustainable aviation fuel levy will be paid by different parties, including aircraft operators. It is calculated based on the ultimate user of the air transport service, she added, so aircraft operators will be allowed to pass the levy on to end users such as passengers or shippers.

The amount of the green jet fuel levy that each end user has to pay will be displayed transparently, she said.

Certain flights will be exempted from the levy, such as those used for flight training and for charitable or humanitarian purposes, she added.

Addressing a question by Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), Ms Sun said passengers transiting or transferring through Singapore will not need to pay the sustainable aviation fuel levy.

She acknowledged that transit and transfer passengers are a critical part of air traffic through Changi Airport.

Although they do not start or end their journeys in Singapore, they enhance the nation’s connectivity by supporting a broader network of destinations and higher flight frequencies, she said.

Ms Sun added that the Government plans to ensure that Changi Airport remains competitive enough for these passengers to continue choosing to transit or transfer through Singapore, and hence will not impose the levy on them.

Several MPs, including Ms Gho Sze Kee (Mountbatten) and Mr Yip, asked about how the levy could potentially affect Changi Airport’s competitiveness as a global air hub.

Responding, Ms Sun said airlines and passengers fly through Changi Airport for various reasons, including safety, network and connectivity.

The Government will keep a close watch on Changi Airport’s charges and costs, she said, adding that it has calibrated its approach to adopting green jet fuel with “safeguards” to maintain the air hub’s competitiveness.

Ms Sun said the Government has consulted the industry and assessed that starting with a 1 per cent green jet fuel adoption target is “manageable”, and will not increase air ticket prices significantly.

Under this model, the total amount spent on sustainable aviation fuel each year will be pre-determined based on the usage target set and the projected cost of the fuel, she noted.

“We can decide how much cost we want to bear, and provide cost certainty for airlines and passengers,” said Ms Sun, who assured the MPs that Changi’s competitiveness would not be adversely impacted.

Conversely, simply mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel across the board would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers, she added.

Responding to Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang) on possible greenwashing due to the use of certain feedstock in sustainable aviation fuel that may create external pollutants, Ms Sun said the green jet fuel procured will comply with the requirements set out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

She added that the Economic Development Board has been in discussions with existing energy firms on retrofitting current refinery units, while research institutes are investing in technology that can advance biofuel production.",https://www.britcham.org.sg/sites/default/files/2025-10/588e03f28957c5ef712849602237c7fb65f937ca53b1072eb97bc9cb04a803fd.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 17:56:53.278582

Direct employment would nearly triple to approximately 2 million jobs by 2035, with liquid and gaseous biofuels accounting for two-thirds of this growth.","If you are looking for a temperature check in the world of energy, then assessments do not get much more authoritative than those dealt out by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

This week, the world's largest governing body for all things energy published a report that analyses the state of play for sustainable fuels globally. The IEA's analysis projects that use of sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels will quadruple by 2035, should existing and recently announced policies be fully implemented.

The report, which was prepared to support COP30, looks at the pathways the world must take in order to accelerate the rollout and production of biofuels, biogas and all hydrogen-based fuels across sectors like transport, heavy industry and power generation.

The current landscape and the projected trajectory

Currently, sustainable fuels represent just 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with liquid biofuels making up nearly 80% of that amount.

In 2024, these fuels helped to reduce global oil demand by around 2.5 million barrels a day, while lowering the dependence that some countries have on imported transport fuels by between 5-15%.

""Between 2010 and 2024, global demand for sustainable liquid and gaseous fuels doubled,"" the report states, encouragingly. Nevertheless, prevailing trends suggest that we are likelier to see gradual progress, rather than the level of acceleration that will be needed to meet global climate targets.

Policy implementation as catalyst

The IEA's accelerated case scenario assumes that any policies that are currently 'planned' will become fully legislated, while it also assumes that market barriers will be removed and production capacity expanded in order to meet new demand.

Should these things fall into place, the IEA forecasts that sustainable fuel use will nearly double to 13 exajoules by 2030 and reach 28 exajoules by 2035.

Transport would remain the primary driver here, accounting for 50% of sustainable fuel consumption in 2035, with fuels covering 10% of road transport demand, 15% of aviation and 35% of shipping.

The report also identifies six priority actions for governments, including the establishment of clear roadmaps, increasing the predictability of demand and developing transparent carbon accounting methodologies.

""Accelerating the deployment of sustainable fuels requires a mix of ambitious, stable and enforceable policies, such as mandates and performance standards, along with proactive public procurement,"" according to the analysis.

Those in the private sector also understand the need for state support. ""We need policy on our side,"" says Alice Henry, Co-Founder and CEO of RegenRate, a small UK-based business that helps to grow biofuel feedstock.

""We need rules that reward farmers for doing the right thing, and certification that’s fast, fair and rooted in reality,"" she adds.

Investment and employment implications

Cumulative investments between 2024 and 2035 could reach US$1.5 trillion across all sustainable fuel types in the accelerated scenario.

Direct employment would nearly triple to approximately 2 million jobs by 2035, with liquid and gaseous biofuels accounting for two-thirds of this growth.

Investments in sustainable fuels grew 20% between 2023 and 2024, driven by policies in the United States and Brazil for liquid biofuels, and the European Union's REPowerEU Plan for biogas.

Technology diversity and regional variation

The portfolio of sustainable fuels is expected to evolve significantly, with liquid and gaseous biofuels maintaining a two-thirds share in 2035 whilst low-emissions hydrogen and derivatives expand from 1% currently to one-third of total use.

That shift is reflected in the IEA's analysis, wherein it is predicting that funding for hydrogen-based solutions will skyrocket.

""With $1.5tn in sustainable fuel investments expected through 2035, and hydrogen-based fuels accounting for nearly half, renewable methanol is positioned as a vital solution for shipping, chemicals and beyond,"" says Antonio Villaluenga, VP of US Project Development at Carbon Recycling International.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/20a60b309b2e6e25407d4ef95a2ac226:8ff0d98b8b27817b39e8695b1dc6c686/graphics-for-work-61.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 11:56:30.106978

There, a production aircraft lifted off and landed using a complete sustainable aviation fuel blend in its HF120 engines without any modification. The flight used a neat mix of HEFA SPK and HDO SAK, confirming full blend operability beyond the 50 percent limits common in regular service.

Why this matters for business aviation and beyond

Pressure to decarbonize aviation is growing as operators seek credible steps they can take today. A full blend demonstration on a certified light jet shows that emissions reductions do not rely only on new airframes or radical propulsion changes. This HondaJet milestone aligns with a broader corporate goal to decarbonize operations by mid century while building operator confidence in practical sustainability options for existing fleets.

Another reason this is significant is drop in capability. SAF pathways like HEFA SPK provide kerosene like performance that fits current engines and fuel systems. Adding an aromatic component such as HDO SAK helps meet material compatibility targets so fuel seals and systems work as designed, which is critical for full blend use on both engines and the entire fuel system.

How the HondaJet validated 100 percent SAF

The HF120 engine from GE Honda Aero had already undergone controlled, full SAF ground testing as early as 2022 using HEFA SPK, with more testing on other low carbon pathways. Those programs benchmarked performance against Jet A and confirmed no loss in thrust or operability, setting the stage for an in aircraft flight on a complete SAF blend.

During the demonstration, both engines ran on the same neat blend, not a split tank test. No special hardware was added to the airframe, and the aircraft performed within normal handling and performance envelopes. This operational profile sets the flight apart from earlier research sorties that used one engine on full SAF and the other on conventional fuel for comparison.

What the fuel blend tells us

HEFA SPK is made from waste lipids like used cooking oils and tallow. It delivers high energy content with very low sulfur and aromatic levels, which improves emissions and reduces particulates. HDO SAK adds synthetic aromatics that help meet material compatibility and density targets for aircraft fuel systems.

The combined result is a drop in, full blend fuel that maintains range, cold weather operability, and engine durability for a light jet mission.

Why the HondaJet platform is a strong SAF demonstrator

The airframe emphasizes drag reduction with an over the wing engine mount, natural laminar flow surfaces, and a clean systems layout focused on efficiency. Operators already report favorable fuel burn compared to peers in the same class, which amplifies lifecycle emissions benefits when using low carbon fuels.

The aircraft’s widespread use in owner flown and charter missions also makes it visible to market segments that can act quickly on voluntary sustainability initiatives.

What still needs to scale

Cost and availability remain the biggest hurdles. SAF carries a price premium that narrows as production scales, but supply is still concentrated at selected hubs.

Broader adoption will depend on policy support, investment in production pathways such as HEFA and alcohol to jet, and airport storage and blending capability. Demonstrations on production aircraft validate technical readiness while signaling demand to producers and fuel distributors.

How this milestone fits the larger SAF timeline

The engine story began years earlier. GE Honda Aero completed controlled, 100 percent SAF ground tests on the HF120 in 2022, comparing performance with conventional Jet A. Those runs demonstrated equivalent operability and paved the way for this flight on a full blend in a customer deliverable airframe.

With both lab and flight data in hand, the focus shifts to certification workstreams and broader operator enablement at airports where SAF supply is ramping up.",https://www.flexaircharters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hondaJet-saf-main.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 14:03:50.576612

Researchers at the University of Pécs are working with Dutch, Greek, Turkish, and Spanish partners to investigate the possibilities for the sustainable use of hydrogen, particularly in processes related to fuel production.","Researchers at the University of Pécs (PTE) are participating in a three-year international program aimed at developing an environmentally friendly synthetic aircraft fuel, the higher education institution announced on Tuesday.

The aim of the research project, called Susgreen, is to replace petroleum-based fuels with greener alternatives, thereby reducing the ecological footprint of aviation.

Hydrogen could play a key role in this process, and scientific research is being conducted on this topic at the University of Pécs Hydrogen Center.

As they wrote, the problem is that the vast majority of hydrogen used today is so-called gray hydrogen, that is produced from natural gas with significant carbon dioxide emissions. A more sustainable solution is green hydrogen, obtained by splitting water using renewable energy sources. However, in Europe, the proportion of green hydrogen is currently still below 5 percent, they pointed out.

The researchers aim to integrate as many environmentally friendly technologies as possible into the production of synthetic fuel. Researchers at the University of Pécs are working with Dutch, Greek, Turkish, and Spanish partners to investigate the possibilities for the sustainable use of hydrogen, particularly in processes related to fuel production.

Led by the University of Amsterdam and supported by nearly HUF 60 million (EUR 154,000) from the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund on the Hungarian side, the project could be a significant step towards the increasing use of more sustainable fuels in aviation.

As reported by The Tech Journal, the Royal Aeronautical Society’s recent People in Aerospace conference revealed that the aerospace/aviation sector struggles to attract the next generation of talent. Despite many technological advances underway, generating high demand for skills and specialisations, many young people perceive the industry as outdated, opaque, and insufficiently aligned with their climate-action mindset.

Speakers at the conference reported that many schoolchildren simply don’t see aerospace as a viable pathway, many teachers and parents lack awareness, industry outreach is fragmented, and employer-school coordination is weak.

“We need lots of people with varied skill sets… proficiency levels will increase around AI, data analytics, and robotics,” says John Watton, Technical Capability Director at GKN Aerospace and Chair of the People & Skills Working Group at the Aerospace Growth Partnership. “But it’s clear we do not have a pipeline to meet our national objectives,”

Many job opportunities in aviation are invisible to younger generations

Many young people associate aviation with careers as pilots or engineers, and may assume they aren’t suited for these career paths, while other opportunities in aviation in the sciences and technology may fall below the radar.

There are too few narratives linking aviation careers with solving big global challenges, such as climate change, clean tech, and sustainable mobility. As a result, students may gravitate towards sectors that are seen as more future-facing, such as software, renewables, and electric vehicles.

Of course, aviation has many opportunities in those fields, including software engineering and AI applications, research and development of alternative fuel sources, including sustainable aviation fuel, and electric or hybrid propulsion systems.

Speakers at the People in Aerospace conference describe the aerospace sector as having legacy training frameworks, male-dominated traditions, and hidden barriers (like swimming requirements for pilots, and cultural isolation in specific populations) that further reduce its appeal to a diverse young talent base.

These are the issues that aviation must tackle to attract the workforce it will need in future.

Aviation is where climate innovation is accelerating

Despite the perception problem, the aviation sector is undergoing a profound transformation in sustainability. From the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, mandating a 2% SAF blend in 2025 rising to 70% by 2050, to the UK’s own SAF Mandate targeting 10 % by 2030, airlines and fuel producers are building an entirely new clean-energy ecosystem.

At the same time, Europe’s Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking (CAJU) is funding hybrid-electric and hydrogen demonstrators with the goal of zero-emission regional aircraft by 2035.

Digitalisation is another sustainability lever. The International Energy Agency estimates AI-driven air-traffic management and predictive maintenance could cut sector-wide emissions by 10–15 % even before new propulsion systems mature.

Aviation is not standing still. It’s engineering a revolution in fuels, propulsion and data—the climate-tech innovation many young people say they want to work on.

Aviation careers narrative needs an urgent turnaround

Speakers at the Royal Aeronautical Society’s conference pointed to an urgent need to change the narrative around aviation careers to avoid a critical shortage of a skilled workforce.

Janine Hornsby, Chief Executive of the Air League, warned: “This is not a new problem. We’ve been talking about it for 20 years. If we don’t act now, the industry won’t be here.”

Royal Aeronautical Society Chief Executive David Edwards recalled: “Back in 1999, the Society published a paper predicting exactly the skills crisis we face today. It said this wasn’t a government problem to fix but a sector problem to resolve—and that’s still true.”

“This isn’t just a UK problem—every country is facing it. We need collaboration on a global scale to share best practices and ideas,” Jones said.

The UK’s Generation Aviation gains interest but key initiatives are still unrecognised

The UK Department for Transport’s Generation Aviation review warned of a gap between schools and industry, particularly among underrepresented groups.

69% of respondents to the surveys conducted on Generation Aviation in 2023 and 2024 thought that the aviation industry is entirely or primarily responsible for ensuring that future aviation skills are met.

The 2024 survey found that awareness of the various initiatives to interest youth in career opportunities in the sector has improved over the last year. In March 2024, 71% of participants had heard of Generation Aviation (versus 57% in February 2023) and almost half (46%) knew what it was (versus 27% in February 2023).

Generation Aviation has increased the overall visibility of the aviation sector through industry events.

“Some participants were aware of certain elements of the programme through being part of the programme in some way, for example, knowing an Aviation Ambassador, contributing to specific research, sitting on the board at associations, or attending launch events,” the report’s authors state.

Awareness of specific schemes varies; recruitment events, educational partnerships, and future aviation skills research are still low. It was suggested that the programme be promoted in new spaces, such as government departments and local authorities.​

The aviation industry is advancing climate innovation, including sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, electrification and AI-driven efficiency. If the industry can communicate its transformation convincingly, the same generation that sees it as part of the problem could become the one that solves it.

Walsh said countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are well-positioned to develop feedstocks that can be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector.
""All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels.
""When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there,"" Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.
The report estimates that around 1,580 million tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.","KUALA LUMPUR: Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, has the opportunity to become a key player in the global shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

This is by leveraging the region's vast feedstock potential, said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh.

Walsh said countries in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are well-positioned to develop feedstocks that can be converted into sustainable fuels for the transport sector.

""All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels. It's not just for air transport, it's also for road transport.""

""When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there,"" Walsh said during a media briefing at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.

""So, there's an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil, and create a positive outcome for the environment as well,"" he added.

According to IATA's Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production – Outlook to 2050 report, the world could produce up to 400 million tonnes of SAF by 2050, a major increase from the estimated two million tonnes in 2025 but still short of the 500 million tonnes required for the industry to reach net zero carbon emissions.

The report highlights Southeast Asia as one of the most promising regions for feedstock availability due to its agricultural residues, palm oil mill effluent (POME), and municipal solid waste that can be processed into SAF.

Asean nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia together with China could supply about 240 million tonnes which is 15 per cent of the world's total biomass feedstock for SAF by 2050.

Biomass feedstock potential is projected to exceed 12,000 million tonnes by 2050 globally, but less than 35 per cent of that will realistically be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing needs in other industries.

The report estimates that around 1,580 million tonnes of feedstock could be allocated to SAF, enough to produce more than 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF in 2050.

Walsh said Asia would play a world leading role in the transition to net zero by 2050.

""So, it's important that we have the opportunity to stay in touch with airlines in this region and the leaders in this region to understand what's happening here,"" he said.

He added that Cathay Pacific is a world leader in sustainability given their commitment to ensure the industry can transition to net zero.

IATA senior vice president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that Asia would most likely generate the solutions needed for airline decarbonisation over the coming decades.

""We think that this region is the main generator of the solutions we need for airlines' decarbonisation over the coming decades and that's good.

""We also look forward to the growth in demand for air transport services in this region, which we also think is going to be the predominant growth generator in our industry going forward,"" she said.

She added that while optimism remains high, the industry must take a clear-eyed view of where it stands today.

""We unfortunately have only 0.7 per cent of airlines' total fuel demand satisfied by SAF, and we are well short of these carbon credits that airlines need to buy under Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.""

""We sort of know what needs to be done. We know what the path should look like going forward. But we're really struggling getting world leaders to want it as much as we do,"" Thomsen said.",https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/42C2C545F2F0B130812A10D6376A7469_low.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:25.626678

Jointly developed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), the new policies were part of the country’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Blending Mandate Roadmap.
Beyond the initial 1% SAF mandate for international flights, the government said the blending ratio would increase to 3%-5% in 2030 and 7%-10% in 2035.

From 2028, international airlines would also need to use SAF-blended fuel for at least 90% of their annual refuelling at South Korean airports, Greenair News wrote.

Jointly developed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), the new policies were part of the country’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Blending Mandate Roadmap.

A SAF Alliance was also set up to unite representatives of the aviation and refining sectors with related agencies to promote SAF supply and use.

The ministries proposed offering rewards to airlines using more than the mandated SAF minimum blend, and for passengers making specific contributions towards the cost of the fuel while also warning of steep penalties for non-compliance.

South Korea’s new package of SAF initiatives followed the government’s announcement in August 2024 of its SAF Expansion Strategy, which outlined a mid-to-long term vision to promote use of the fuel in line with global efforts to help decarbonise air transport.

The initiative also broadened plans to develop and deploy SAF within the greater Asia-Pacific region, the world’s largest collective air transport market, where a range of strategies had been announced or deployed in countries including Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Indonesia, China and Australia, the report said.

Beyond the initial 1% SAF mandate for international flights, the government said the blending ratio would increase to 3%-5% in 2030 and 7%-10% in 2035.

Specific ratios would be set in 2026 and 2029 based on the government’s assessment of domestic SAF production capacity, international obligations and global market conditions, Greenair News wrote.

Fuel suppliers, particularly refining companies and petrol exporters and importers, would need to meet blending obligations from 2027, with compliance determined by the proportion of SAF supplied each year for use in jet fuel for international flights from South Korea.

However, the requirement for airlines to ensure that SAF-blended fuel comprises 90% of their annual volumes for departing flights would not take effect until 2028, following the introduction of a refuelling obligation management system in 2026/27 and pilot operations in the first half of 2028.

The South Korean decree for international flights built on a 1% blending ratio deployed by nine domestic airlines which used locally-produced SAF on selected short-haul routes.

Korean Air had expanded the use of domestically-produced SAF on routes to Kobe and Osaka in Japan, following a year-long trial on its Incheon-Haneda route, the report said.

The carrier started using a 1% SAF blend on flights to Kobe and Osaka in September.

Airbus and Cathay invest US$70 million to accelerate SAV growth

Airbus and the Cathay Group (Cathay) have announced a joint investment of up to US$70 million. The goal is to speed up the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across Asia and beyond. This marks another strong step towards cleaner, lower-carbon air travel.

The agreement was unveiled in Hong Kong during the IATA World Sustainability Symposium. The event was hosted by Cathay’s Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer, Alex McGowan, and Airbus President Asia-Pacific, Anand Stanley.

Under the new partnership, both companies will work together to identify and invest in key SAF projects. Each project will be reviewed for its commercial potential, technical readiness, and long-term production prospects. The aim is to scale up supply towards 2030 and beyond.

Expanding SAF production, however, demands close cooperation across the aviation chain. Policymakers, investors, producers, and airlines must all play a part. This co-investment reflects that shared commitment, with Airbus and Cathay uniting to accelerate capacity and create wider environmental impact.

“This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference,” said Anand Stanley, President Asia Pacific, Airbus. “The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The collaboration will also focus on policy advocacy. Both companies aim to support measures that encourage SAF production and use across Asia. The region’s strong feedstock base, growing expertise, and busy aviation market make it ideal for progress.

Airbus and Cathay share a partnership dating back to 1989, when Cathay placed its first Airbus order. Today, the airline operates 86 Airbus aircraft, with more than 70 still to come.

,,2025-10-21 11:53:12+00:00,valorinternational,Latam sees decarbonization as aviation's biggest challenge | Business - Valor International,Cristian Favaro,,,,,https://valorinternational.globo.com/business/news/2025/10/21/latam-sees-decarbonization-as-aviations-biggest-challenge.ghtml,"The industry’s main bet to cut emissions is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
Energy company Vibra recently announced plans to supply SAF on the domestic market, although imported from European suppliers.
Mr. Alvo said the airline is also closely monitoring Brazil’s airport infrastructure.
“The outlook for Brazil’s domestic market is positive.
I’m optimistic about the Brazilian market next year,” Mr. Alvo said.","The industry’s main bet to cut emissions is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Global production is projected to reach 1.9 billion liters in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA)—three times more than in 2023 but still only 0.53% of total fuel demand.

“We have to look seriously at SAF. There isn’t a single drop being produced today in the [Latin American] region,” Mr. Alvo told Valor during the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA) conference in Lima. Globally, the sector has pledged to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Brazil is seen as a potential leader in the field, given its expertise with ethanol. Some companies are studying the technology domestically, but none have yet begun production. Among the major players exploring the market is Petrobras, which is expected soon to offer a jet fuel partially derived from vegetable oils—a process that reduces emissions in a similar way to ethanol blending in automotive gasoline.

Energy company Vibra recently announced plans to supply SAF on the domestic market, although imported from European suppliers.

The issue is a strategic priority for Latam, which in mid-2022 pledged that 5% of its total fuel consumption will come from SAF by 2030.

Mr. Alvo said the airline is also closely monitoring Brazil’s airport infrastructure. One key concern is congestion at São Paulo’s Congonhas Airport, where renovation work next year is expected to worsen crowding.

Regarding the Brazilian market, the CEO said the outlook remains highly positive. Latam recently raised its 2025 capacity forecast to growth between 9.5% and 10.5%, up from 7% to 9% previously.

According to IATA, domestic air-travel demand in Brazil grew 12.7% in August from a year earlier—the highest monthly increase among all markets tracked by the association.

“The outlook for Brazil’s domestic market is positive. We are very pleased with the investment in Embraer aircraft, which will allow us to connect new cities where smaller jets perform better. I’m optimistic about the Brazilian market next year,” Mr. Alvo said.

Latam has placed an order for up to 74 E195-E2 jets from Embraer, including 24 firm orders worth $2.1 billion at list prices. The airline expects to define within six months the routes that will be served by the new aircraft, with São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasília, Fortaleza, and Porto Alegre among the key hubs under consideration.

The arrival of the E2 model is expected to open up as many as 35 new destinations across Latam’s network, most of them within Brazil.

The group reported a second-quarter net profit of $242 million, up 66% from a year earlier, driven by a 7.6% increase in passenger numbers to 20.6 million during the period.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/SWw2rAX_mQ1MzSJAwZo9xZ3GMjY=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/C/J/kyVmIBSjmyUFoUWmdMcQ/21emp-100-latam-b5-img01.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:43.838653

Today, the Cathay Group operates more than 85 Airbus aircraft, with an outstanding order for over 70 more to be delivered.","The Cathay Group and Airbus announced a joint investment agreement of up to US$70 million for sustainable aviation fuel production earlier today, 21st October, on the sidelines of the IATA World Sustainability Symposium.

This joint investment aims to accelerate the development of SAF production in Asia and beyond.

The agreement was announced in Hong Kong during a ceremony hosted by Cathay chief operations and service delivery officer Alex McGowan, and Anand Stanley, Airbus’ president in the Asia-Pacific.

McGowan said: “SAF remains the most important lever for Cathay and the wider aviation industry to drive toward our common decarbonisation goals. This co-investment partnership with Airbus underscores our commitment to supporting a more scalable SAF industry in the near term. It complements our broader strategy of investing in the technologies and production capacity that can transform the industry in the long run, including our participation in the recently launched oneworld BEV SAF Fund. Meanwhile, we are also expanding SAF usage today through partnerships with like-minded organisations.”

Stanley added: “This agreement reflects the shared commitment of Airbus and Cathay to make a real difference. The production and distribution of affordable SAF at scale requires an unprecedented cross-sectoral approach. Our partnership with Cathay is a concrete example of how we catalyse production in the most suitable locations to serve our customers.”

The partnership also includes collaboration to advocate for supportive SAF policies on both the supply and demand side across Asia.

With the region’s strong potential in feedstock supply, production capacity, and its vibrant aviation market, Cathay and Airbus aim to leverage their global experience to help shape policies that make SAF more accessible and affordable in this part of the world.

What the partnership entails

Under the terms of the partnership, the two companies will work to identify, evaluate and invest in projects that support the scaling of SAF production towards 2030 and beyond.

Projects will be assessed based on their commercial viability, technological maturity, and potential for long-term offtake.

Scaling SAF adoption requires deep collaboration across the value chain, from policymakers and investors to SAF producers, airlines and customers.

This co-investment agreement reflects the spirit of partnership with Airbus and Cathay teaming up to accelerate production capability for more meaningful impact.

Prior to this most recent joint investment, Cathay also joined as a launch investor in the oneworld BEV SAF Fund, a joint initiative with other oneworld airlines and Bill Gates’ climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures, just last month.

That fund focuses on novel, next-generation SAF technologies with the potential to scale significantly and reduce costs.

Complementing this, the Cathay–Airbus partnership will target more mature SAF opportunities to accelerate near- to medium-term availability.

,,2025-10-21 10:58:05+00:00,Business Airport International,"Net Zero Hero: Joe Meszaros, Avflight | Business Airport International",Web Team,,,,,https://www.businessairportinternational.com/features/net-zero-hero-joe-meszaros-avflight.html,"The aviation industry’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 isn’t just talk for Avflight Corporation.
“At its core, Avflight exists to serve its communities worldwide,” explains Joe Meszaros, the company’s vice president of operations.
The transition to electric ground support equipment has delivered tangible benefits beyond carbon reduction.
“Our ramps are quieter, which improves our team’s working environment while reducing noise exposure for the surrounding community,” Meszaros notes.
Roadmap for growth Looking ahead, Avflight plans to expand its charging network, and increase electric ground equipment adoption where electrical grids support it.","The aviation industry’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 isn’t just talk for Avflight Corporation. The operator of 26 full-service FBOs across North America and Europe has already electrified significant portions of its ground support equipment and installed eVTOL charging stations at multiple locations.

“At its core, Avflight exists to serve its communities worldwide,” explains Joe Meszaros, the company’s vice president of operations. “That service extends to community stewardship in the form of sustainability.”

Avflight’s sustainability journey began with straightforward efficiency improvements – LED lighting, high-efficiency heating systems, and recycling programs. But as new technologies emerged, the company accelerated its commitment through infrastructure development and strategic partnerships.

The transition to electric ground support equipment has delivered tangible benefits beyond carbon reduction. “Our ramps are quieter, which improves our team’s working environment while reducing noise exposure for the surrounding community,” Meszaros notes. Operators also appreciate the smoother torque of electric tugs, which enables more precise aircraft movements.

However, the conversion isn’t without challenges. Each airport presents electrical capacity constraints, permitting requirements and installation timelines. “The transition has required carefully planned charger placements to avoid interference with ramp safety or day-to-day operations,” Meszaros explains.

Future-proofing

The company’s partnership with Beta Technologies exemplifies its forward-thinking approach. Charging stations are now operational at six Avflight locations, with more planned. These multi-modal units, built around the Combined Charging System (CCS) standard, can support both electric aircraft and ground vehicles using the same infrastructure.

“This flexibility is critical because it maximizes the utility of each installation and simplifies ramp planning,” Meszaros says. “By future-proofing in this way, we can serve a wide variety of electric assets as adoption grows.”

Beyond electrification, Avflight leverages its relationship with sister company Avfuel to promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption. Through the AvfuelZero program, operators can access physical SAF molecules where available, or use a book-and-claim model where physical supply isn’t yet feasible.

“The first step is always education,” Meszaros explains regarding customer engagement with SAF. “For those who are interested, we explain what SAF is and how it fits into their operation without disrupting performance.”

“From there, we can help facilitate a book and claim transaction for SAF or even carbon offsets to help reduce their net carbon emissions. We do so by leveraging the AvfuelZero program, which streamlines sustainability logistics, and provides both proper certification and transparent reporting for sustainable products.”

According to Meszaros the core challenges of SAF adoption isn’t technical at the FBO level. “The primary hurdles are less about technical feasibility and more about supply chain logistics. Does sufficient demand exist at your airport? Can supply be efficiently brought into your location?

“Because SAF is a drop-in replacement for jet fuel, meeting ASTM D1655 certification for jet fuel, it actually does not require separate storage or unique handling procedures,” he explains.

According to Meszaros, customer response to Avflight’s sustainability initiatives has been overwhelmingly positive.

“They appreciate the quieter ramps, carbon offsets, and the assurance that their FBO partner is investing ahead of industry demand,” he says. “For many operators, our commitment helps them meet internal goals and provides evidence they can share with their own stakeholders to demonstrate progress.”

Meszaros believes that sustainability is slowly, but steadily, becoming a factor in FBO choice. “That influence comes from a number of places, it could be passengers’ personal convictions, corporate goals, company stakeholder values or community principles.

“In any case, environmentally conscious aviation operations want to know their partners are serious about providing sustainable solutions that work, whether that’s physical SAF supply, book-and-claim or electric vehicle charging capabilities. Our proactive work in sustainability strengthens our competitive position,” he says.

Meszaros says that the company tracks environmental impact through measurable outcomes. “This includes creating a carbon emissions benchmark that is now tracked annually. For each location, we look at the use of utilities, like gas and electric, as well as fuel use, like diesel and Mogas. When adopting electric GSE, we expect to see fuel use decline and some uptick in our electric utilities, but the net benefit would be positive,” he says.

Roadmap for growth

Looking ahead, Avflight plans to expand its charging network, and increase electric ground equipment adoption where electrical grids support it.

“We will continue to use energy efficient building designs and materials for new hangar and terminal developments,” he says. “We also plan to work closely with Avfuel to connect more customers to SAF solutions, making physical supply available where feasible and expanding book-and-claim options everywhere else.

“We intend to support innovation by engaging with technology partners who are developing the next generation of lower-carbon power solutions. Our role is to bridge that innovation to the operators we serve.”

For FBO operators beginning their sustainability journey, Meszaros recommends starting with baseline assessments of operational impact and local energy infrastructure.

“That foundation gives you the clarity to set realistic goals and track improvements over time,” he says.

“Once you have that picture, begin with practical, high-value measures, for example, piloting electric ground support equipment in one or two high-utilization roles, upgrading lighting or HVAC systems to more efficient options, and implementing transparent emissions accounting so customers can trust your reporting from the start. As your program develops, look toward progressive enhancements that align with your growth and resources.”

He emphasizes the need to treat sustainability as a continuous journey rather than a fixed destination.

“Build in regular reviews to raise your level of ambition, and prioritize partnerships early. Collaboration accelerates progress and builds credibility, enabling us as an industry to deliver meaningful change together.”

Meszaros believes it is possible for aviation companies to grow while still being environmentally responsible. “Growth and responsibility go hand-in-hand, because today’s customers expect both,” Meszaros says.

“Communities demand it, and the technology, from scalable charging to next-generation fuels, is advancing rapidly.

“I believe the companies that integrate sustainability into their operations now will be the ones best positioned to thrive in the future.”",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Joe-Meszaros-2025-1024x683.png,N,,2025-10-21 08:56:50.503458

The new approach concept – deployed for the first time in Europe – will enable the airport to increase the landing rate per hour and reduces emissions, both for the aircraft flying the shorter, curved approach and for those flying the standard instrument landing approach. This is because fewer aircraft have to use the runway dedicated for arrivals, reducing the queue for that runway.

The technique for curved approaches requires special equipment in the aircraft, specially trained pilots and special permission from their national supervisory authority. In addition to reducing the environmental impact, the introduction of the new approach concept provides an incentive for airlines to invest in technique for curved approaches which, in the long run, makes it possible to avoid flying over noise-sensitive areas.

The new concept is commonly referred to as Established on RNP (EoR) and makes it possible for aircraft arriving at Stockholm Arlanda Airport to fly with curved approaches to a greater extent than before.

The concept is an important step towards increasing the capacity, efficiency and sustainability of air traffic.

Susanne Norman, Director of Operations at Swedavia says: “For us, it is of course gratifying that Swedavia will be the first in Europe to apply the new concept for managing arrivals.

Anna Granberg, Director of Operations at Luftfartsverket says: “The modernisation of the airspace by Luftfartsverket shows how air traffic control can help reduce the environmental impact of aviation.

“The traffic flow into Stockholm Arlanda Airport becomes more efficient during peak hours, and arriving aircraft have shorter flight paths with reduced emissions.

Charlotte Holmbergh, Country Director Corporate Affairs at Norwegian says: “We are very pleased with the initiative from Swedavia and the Swedish Air Traffic Control Provider (LFV) to implement new procedures that will increase the number of curved approaches (RNP AR – Required Navigation Performance, Authorisation Required) at Arlanda.

“We would like to commend them for this effort and for the excellent cooperation we have had throughout the project. Shorter approaches result in lower fuel burn and reduced emissions.

“Our goal is to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2030, and more efficient flight operations like this are among our top priorities — alongside increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and continuous fleet renewal.”

Alexandra Lindgren Kaoukji, Head of External Communication & PR at SAS says: “SAS welcomes all initiatives that help reduce fuel consumption, noise, and emissions.
