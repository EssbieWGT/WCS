The UCO SAF ecosystem is being developed by Pertamina in preparation for the SAF mandate scheduled for 2027. This ecosystem includes used cooking oil (UCO) collection and distribution managed by Pertamina Patra Niaga, UCO-to-SAF coprocessing by Pertamina International Refinery, SAF distribution to aviation by Pertamina Patra Niaga, and SAF-powered flights by Pelita Air.

The SAF used for this flight is derived from renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil, and is processed using the “Merah-Putih” catalyst—developed by Indonesian scientists and manufactured by the national catalyst producer, PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia (KSI).

The resulting jet fuel, branded as Pertamina SAF, has undergone rigorous quality analysis. It meets international standards for jet fuel, including ASTM D1655, the latest Defstan 91-91 specifications, and Indonesian regulation SK DJM No. 70.K/MG.06/DJM/2025. This confirms that Indonesia, through Pertamina SAF, is capable of producing high-quality, sustainable fuel.

Strategic Collaboration with ITB

One of the key pillars in the development of SAF has been the strategic partnership between Pertamina and academic institutions, particularly the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). As a gesture of appreciation, ITB’s Rector, Prof. Dr. Ir. Tatacipta Dirgantara, M.T., along with the Red-White Catalyst Development Team and the Bioavtur Test Team, were specially invited to the event, acknowledging their long-standing collaboration and significant contributions to SAF development.

From the outset, ITB played a leading role as the technical coordinator for the SAF Bioavtur J2.4 commercial flight test, working in collaboration with the Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (EBTKE), with funding support from the Indonesia Oil Palm Plantation Fund Management Agency (BPDPKS). The ITB team participated in a series of activities including ASTM-standard fuel quality testing, static engine testing, and in-flight testing using commercial aircraft.

ITB’s contribution to the development of locally-produced catalysts and SAF testing highlights the importance of synergy between academia and industry. This innovation is expected to accelerate clean energy adoption and strengthen national technological self-sufficiency.

All production and distribution activities within the SAF ecosystem have obtained the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This includes UCO collection, UCO-to-SAF coprocessing, and SAF distribution. Pertamina’s coprocessing facility has also received certification under the European Union Renewable Energy Directive (RED-EU). This recognition positions Pertamina as the first fully integrated SAF ecosystem in Southeast Asia to achieve such international accreditation.

Towards a Greener Indonesian Sky

Through this special flight, Pertamina introduces SAF as an emerging energy technology and reinforces its commitment to supporting the government’s Asta Cita vision in achieving energy resilience and sustainability. This initiative positions Indonesia as one of the pioneers in SAF usage within Southeast Asia.

This flight, powered by a blend of jet fuel and recycled cooking oil, stands as proof that research-based local innovation can effectively address global clean energy challenges.

What was once hailed as a revolutionary step toward net-zero emissions in aviation now stands as a cautionary tale of high costs, financial hurdles, and unfulfilled government mandates.

Background: High Hopes for Waste-to-Fuel Innovation

Six years ago, British Airways (BA) unveiled plans for the UK’s first dedicated SAF factory, partnering with fuels firm Velocys to build a state-of-the-art plant near the Humber estuary in north Lincolnshire. The facility was designed to transform household rubbish—destined for landfills—into thousands of tonnes of eco-friendly jet fuel. Alex Cruz, BA’s then-CEO, described SAF as a “game-changer for aviation,” envisioning a future where waste powers sustainable flights.

This initiative aligned with broader industry goals to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. SAF, produced from materials like cooking oil, animal fats, wood, and plastics, promised to cut emissions significantly compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. The project was expected to be operational by last year, symbolizing the UK’s leadership in the energy transition.

Government Push: The “Jet Zero” Policy

In 2022, under then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the UK government launched its “Jet Zero” strategy, aiming for zero-carbon flying by 2050. Johnson optimistically declared that “sustainable fuels and fully electric planes will achieve guilt-free flying for years to come.”

The policy mandated that British airlines incorporate SAF into their operations, starting with 2% this year, rising to 10% by 2030, and 22% by 2040. It also pledged the construction of five new SAF plants by now, which were projected to create jobs and establish the UK as a “clean energy superpower.”These targets were intended to drive investment and innovation in the sector, addressing aviation’s contribution to global emissions—estimated at around 2-3% worldwide, with the UK consuming 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel annually.

Current Reality: Empty Fields and Meager Production

Fast forward to today, and the vision has faltered. The Velocys site remains an undeveloped field, marked only by a lone portaloo, far from the bustling factory once promised.

Velocys itself faced severe financial difficulties, running out of money last year and being acquired by a private consortium, which has further delayed any progress. Across the UK, SAF production is virtually non-existent on the scale needed. The sole operational producer, Phillips 66 at its Humberside refinery, outputs just 20,000 tonnes of SAF per year—equivalent to a mere 0.2% of the nation’s total aviation fuel demand.

No other plants have come online, leaving airlines scrambling to meet the government’s escalating quotas through imports or alternative compliance measures.

The Brick Wall: Cost and Complexity

The primary barriers are economic and technical. SAF production is energy-intensive, requiring processes to break down waste materials into usable fuel. As a result, its cost is prohibitively high: On August 13, the European price for SAF stood at $2,280 (£1,681) per metric tonne—more than three times that of conventional jet fuel, according to biofuels analyst Simone Burgin of Argus Media.

This price disparity, coupled with limited feedstock availability and scaling challenges, has deterred investment. While the government has offered incentives, critics argue they fall short of bridging the gap. The failure of projects like Velocys underscores the broader difficulties in the energy transition for hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, where alternatives like electric or hydrogen-powered planes remain years away for long-haul flights.

Implications for the Energy Sector and Beyond

For the energy industry, this setback highlights the risks of over-reliance on policy mandates without sufficient technological maturity or economic support. Airlines may face higher costs passed on to consumers, potentially slowing travel recovery post-pandemic. Meanwhile, the UK’s ambitions to lead in clean energy are under scrutiny, as imported SAF—often from the US or Europe—fills the void, raising questions about energy security and domestic job creation.

As the world pushes toward net-zero, the UK’s SAF saga serves as a reminder that innovation requires not just vision, but viable economics. Without breakthroughs in cost reduction or stronger incentives, climate-friendly aviation fuel may remain a pipe dream for years to come.

For the first time in Vietnam, Petrolimex Aviation has blended and provided the first 1,200 cubic metres of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for Vietjet flights, marking an important milestone in the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel in Vietnam.

The airline said that its fleet, with 576 modern aircraft on order, would increasingly incorporate this fuel. In October 2024, Vietjet had partnered with Petrolimex Aviation to conduct the first two flights being fueled SAF in Vietnam.

Produced from renewable and sustainable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass, and urban waste, SAF can help reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fuels. It meets stringent international aviation standards and is safe for commercial operations.

Before Vietjet, national flag-carrier Vietnam Airlines flew a commercial flight from Singapore to Hanoi in May 2024 using sustainable fuel; that fuel was, however, produced and supplied by international partners.

Petrolimex pioneers blending aviation fuel technology

Petrolimex Aviation is the fuel subsidiary of Petrolimex, which is the country’s state-owned national petroleum company and largest distributor of oil products.

Petrolimex Aviation said that it is the first company in Vietnam to master the technology behind blending aviation fuel that meets international standards. The green aviation fuel it uses is blended in Ho Chi Minh City, using imported synthetic blending components – hydrocarbons produced from biologically renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass and urban waste.

Vietjet continues upward trajectory

In the first six months of this year, Vietjet, including Vietjet Thailand, transported 17.7 million passengers and nearly 65,200 tonnes of cargo.

At the 2025 Paris Air Show, Vietjet placed a new order for 100 aircraft and 50 options for new Airbus A321neo aircraft. This represented the largest aircraft order at the Paris Air Show 2025, positioning Vietjet among the top 10 airlines globally with the largest orders.

Vietjet was awarded the “Best Workplace in Asia” for a record fifth year in a row at the HR Asia Awards 2025. This achievement reflects the airline’s steadfast dedication to crafting an outstanding workplace culture for its 9,000 staff on four continents across 16 countries and territories.

Production cost of SAF remains high

Despite biofuels’ clean energy profile and growing global demand, they cost more to produce and face competition from fossil fuels, said GlobalData in a report in May. Processing advanced biomass sources, such as agricultural and forestry waste, remains expensive, limiting their scalability and widespread adoption.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in June that the production of sustainable aviation fuel is expected to reach two million tonnes or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director-general, said: “Even that relatively small amount will add US$4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

However, he also criticised the European Union’s SAF mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies there remain low. He made this comment during a recent visit to Singapore

Singapore’s Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint

Under the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint launched in February 2024, flights departing from Singapore will be required to use this sustainable fuel from 2026; one per cent of the total fuel used for such departures will be of the sustainable type, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Under the Blueprint, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will work with aviation stakeholders to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% from 2019 levels in 2030 and achieve net zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

This week on The SAF Podcast we are joined by Greg Constantine, Co-Founder & CEO, AIRCO (Formerly Air Company).

Originally from Australia, Greg explains the strategy behind building out technology development from revenue generating consumer products like carbon negative Vodka, hand sanitizer and perfume building towards production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This allows for ongoing revenue generation and less reliance on raising outside investment.

Constantine explains their technology-licensing business model, contrasting it with the capital-intensive mega-project approaches favored by many competitors in the power-to-liquid (PTL) space. This strategy allows them to avoid massive FID funding rounds while still scaling sustainable aviation fuel production globally.

Their strong partnerships with the US military have provided rigorous testing opportunities across air, land, and marine vehicles, validating their technology beyond what’s possible in purely commercial settings. After closing a $70 million Series B funding round with strategic investors including JetBlue, Alaska Airlines, and Toyota Ventures, AIRCO is positioning itself as a technology provider rather than a large-scale fuel producer—focusing on licensing their technology to established operators who can scale production globally.

Constantine also discusses the challenges of balancing emissions reduction with cost competitiveness in the eSAF market, where fuels can cost seven times more than conventional jet fuel. The conversation then moves to feedstock flexibility, policy implications for e-fuels development and which policy structures he finds most practical.

After EU sanctions, Nayara Energy is using dark-fleet tankers and a limited crude import selection to maintain operations, raising concerns in India about energy security. The government has approved coastal tankers, including sanctioned vessels, to assist Nayara. Despite challenges, Russia assures continued crude supplies, employing special mechanisms to bypass sanctions.

One month after being hit by European Union sanctions, India’s Nayara Energy Ltd. is relying on a growing pool of dark-fleet tankers to transport its products, and a narrowing menu of crude imports to keep its operations running.

The oil refiner’s struggle for survival has come to the attention of India’s government, which is concerned about disruptions to oil flows that could jeopardize national energy security, according to people familiar with the matter. New Delhi has approved at least one coastal tanker in recent days to help the company move cargoes domestically, they said.

The refiner, part-owned by Russian oil major Rosneft PJSC, is an important pillar of the Indian market. Its 400,000 barrels-a-day processing plant accounts for 8% of the country’s refining, and the company operates 7% of its fuel stations. It’s been forced to reduce run rates after being spurned by trade partners following the EU’s measures targeting Moscow’s oil revenues.

Some of the tankers already greenlit by the government to supply Nayara with oil, and transport its refined products, include sanctioned vessels. One such dark-fleet ship, the Leruo, has made at least three domestic runs for Nayara after getting the go-ahead from New Delhi, according to a shipowner, who declined to be named discussing sensitive information, and ship-tracking data.

The medium-range tanker was blacklisted by the EU on July 18, part of a broad sanctions package targeting Russian oil exports that also penalized Nayara. Leruo’s owner is listed as Key Marvel Ltd. on S&P Global Inc.’s maritime database, although no contact details were included.

Live Events

Long-range tanker Next, another EU-sanctioned vessel that’s also blacklisted by the UK, is due to arrive at Nayara’s Vadinar terminal on Wednesday to pick up a cargo of diesel, according to a port agent’s report and ship-tracking data. The database lists Istanbul-based Next Maritime & Trading Ltd. as its owner, again with no email or phone number.

Such vessels are filling the gap left by local shipowners that have stopped doing business with Nayara. They’ve been forced to cut ties to protect their dealings with European ports and insurers. Ships that are covered by Russian or Iranian insurance —and which have been approved by New Delhi — are eligible to service Nayara.

Nayara has more than 1.2 million barrels of refined products on four sanctioned vessels idling off Vadinar, according to shipping data.

The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement last week, it said it remains committed to transporting its products via coastal, rail and road networks in order to efficiently serve its Indian customers.

Tempest Dream, a tanker that recently made a ship-to-ship transfer of gasoline produced by Nayara, has returned to Vadinar to receive more product, according to ship-tracking data. The vessel that took the cargo, Wu Tai, has yet to discharge the shipment, the data show.

Also Read: Nayara’s sanctioned cargo quietly slips into new hands

Nayara has only taken Urals oil from Russia as feedstock since late July. The refiner is expected to receive two cargoes of Urals this week, totaling about 1.4 million barrels, on two Aframax tankers, the Mars 6 and Tiger 6, according to a shipowner, who declined to be named, port agent reports and ship-tracking data.

Another Greek-owned supertanker, Evgenia I, which was supposed to deliver Middle Eastern crude to Nayara last week, is still ballasting in the Persian Gulf.

Keeping up Russian crude supplies to Nayara isn’t a problem, Evgeny Griva, Moscow’s deputy trade representative in India, said at a briefing in New Delhi on Wednesday. More broadly, the country’s imports of Russian oil are expected to continue at current levels, despite the geopolitical situation, given the lack of alternatives, he said.

“There are special mechanisms to get around sanctions and tariffs,” Griva said.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a next-generation biofuel derived from renewable, sustainable feedstocks.

It is chemically similar to Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) and can be used as a ‘drop-in’ fuel in existing aircraft engines without modifications.

Aviation contributes nearly 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, one of the fastest-growing sectors for emissions.

With limited alternatives like electric/hydrogen planes for long-haul, Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the most practical decarbonisation pathway.

Possible Feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Oils & Fats

Used Cooking Oil (UCO)

Algal oils

Animal fats

Oil-rich seeds (jatropha, pongamia, camelina)

Agricultural & Forestry Residues: Sugarcane bagasse, rice husks, wheat straw, forestry waste

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): Plastics, organic waste processed into syngas

Sugars & Starches (Alcohol-to-Jet or ATJ Pathway): Conversion of ethanol, butanol, isobutanol into hydrocarbons

IOC’s Panipat refinery will rely on UCO recycling, linking waste management with aviation decarbonisation.

Significance of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Climate Mitigation

Reduces lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel.

Contributes to over 60% of aviation’s decarbonisation needs (as per IATA).

Energy Security

Reduces dependence on imported crude.

Promotes indigenous feedstocks & waste-to-fuel circular economy.

Green Jobs & Economy: SAF’s value chain can generate employment in waste collection, refining, logistics, and R&D.

Compatibility: Approved blends: up to 50% SAF + ATF in current aircraft engines.

Challenges in SAF Adoption

High Costs

SAF is 2-3 times more expensive than conventional ATF.

Without subsidies or mandates, airlines may resist adoption.

Feedstock Availability

UCO and residues are seasonal, scattered, and difficult to collect.

Risk of food-fuel conflict if oilseeds are diverted.

Infrastructure Gaps: SAF supply chains, dedicated storage, and blending facilities are underdeveloped in India.

Policy & Market Risks: No clear long-term incentives like carbon pricing, tax credits, or feedstock purchase guarantees.

ISCC CORSIA Certification

What is ISCC CORSIA?

A global sustainability certification ensuring that SAF complies with ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation).

About CORSIA (ICAO’s Scheme):

(2) ⇒ Offline Classes Enroll Now

Note: The right guidance from ClearIAS can be the game-changer.

Global initiative to cap international aviation emissions at 2020 levels.

Airlines must offset emissions above the cap through carbon credits and SAF blending.

Phases:

Pilot & Voluntary (2021–2026)

Mandatory from 2027 onwards

Why Critical for India?

With ISCC CORSIA certification, IOC’s SAF can be exported to international airlines, giving India a first-mover advantage in green fuel trade.

India’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap

National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) targets:

1% SAF blending in 2027 (international flights)

2% in 2028

Domestic blending mandate post-2027

Policy Linkages:

Net Zero 2070 commitments.

Biofuel Mission 2022 (expansion of ethanol blending, biodiesel, and SAF).

Waste-to-Wealth and circular economy initiatives.

Opportunities:

India produces over 2.3 crore tonnes of UCO annually.

Potential to emerge as a regional SAF hub, especially supplying Europe (where stricter aviation decarbonisation mandates exist).

Way Forward

Financial Incentives

Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for SAF refineries.

Tax credits/subsidies for airlines adopting SAF.

Feedstock Mobilisation

UCO collection networks via FSSAI, food businesses, and MSMEs.

Dedicated farmer-producer organisations (FPOs) for agri-residues.

Policy Push

Mandatory blending targets with a clear timeline.

Green hydrogen-SAF hybrid R&D support.

Global Integration

Iowa county prepares to take carbon capture pipeline fight to Supreme Court

The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to appeal its case after losing in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in June.

""All levels of government have a role in safeguarding the public for hazardous pipelines,"" said Steve Kenkel, CO2 pipeline liaison for the county board.

The county had passed an ordinance regulating carbon capture pipelines but was sued by Summit Carbon Solutions, a company trying to build pipelines throughout Iowa.

Summit wants to construct pipelines that would carry pressurized CO2 — an ethanol byproduct — from plants in Iowa to North Dakota where it would be buried underground. This would make the ethanol eligible to be processed into sustainable aviation fuel.

But local landowners, like Jan Reinig, object to the plan because of concerns about safety, conservation and property rights.

""Well, actually it was rather emotional to think that this board of supervisors and our people that are behind us here on the county level are willing to step up. That takes a lot of courage I think,"" Reinig said.

Summit praised the Eighth Court of Appeals ruling in June, saying in part, ""This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process...""

Supervisor Mike Kolbe said the lawsuit will be funded by insurance and grant money, not the taxpayers.

Story County, which includes Ames, is also poised to continue the appeals process.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee93907/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+643/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2Fad%2Fb9dd8099464ab074720333c828a5%2Fimg-3135.jpeg,N,,2025-08-20 15:56:18.900637

Here's how to position your portfolio: ETF Exposure: The iShares U.S. Airlines ETF (IAA) offers broad access to the sector.
Since 2020, the S&P 500 Energy sector has underperformed the S&P 500 by 12% during periods of declining refinery utilization, while the airline sector has outperformed by 8%.
Final Takeaway The next time you see a refinery utilization rate miss expectations, don't panic.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration's latest report—showing a refinery utilization rate of 91.6% for the week ending August 20, 2025—has sparked a critical debate among investors. This figure, down from 95.4% in early July, isn't just a number; it's a canary in the coal mine for the energy sector. For those with a contrarian mindset, it's also a green light for airline stocks. Let's unpack why.

The Refinery Utilization Paradox

Refinery utilization rates measure how much of the U.S. refining capacity is being used. A high rate (like the 95.4% in July) typically signals strong demand for gasoline and diesel, which is great for refiners but disastrous for airlines. Why? Because when refineries are running at full tilt, gasoline prices often spike, creating a ripple effect that hikes fuel costs for airlines. In 2015, for instance, a utilization rate of 95.1% coincided with gasoline prices surging $0.36 above crude oil forecasts, crushing airline margins.

But the 2025 landscape is different. The utilization rate's drop to 91.6% isn't just a seasonal dip—it's a structural shift. Electric vehicle adoption now accounts for 18% of U.S. auto sales, and demand for gasoline is flattening. This has created a perfect storm: refining margins are under pressure, while airlines are enjoying a rare reprieve from volatile fuel costs.

Airline Stocks: The Energy Transition's Hidden Winners

The key to understanding this dynamic lies in fuel hedging and capital reallocation. Airlines like Delta (DAL) and American (AAL) have mastered the art of locking in fuel prices at favorable rates, a strategy that becomes exponentially more valuable when refining activity weakens. In 2025, gasoline prices have aligned more closely with crude oil, reducing the volatility that once plagued airline budgets. Delta's 2025 Q2 report showed a 6% improvement in net margins, partly due to its aggressive hedging program.

Meanwhile, refiners are shedding non-core assets and pivoting to hydrogen and biofuels. This shift has created a capital outflow from refining to energy transition projects—projects that airlines are now funding. United Airlines (UAL), for example, has invested $1.5 billion in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a move that's both environmentally and economically strategic. With refining margins compressed, SAF becomes a more viable alternative, and airlines are positioned to lead the charge.

The Contrarian Playbook

When refinery utilization rates fall below 90%, it's not just a red flag for refiners—it's a green flag for airlines. Here's how to position your portfolio:

ETF Exposure: The iShares U.S. Airlines ETF (IAA) offers broad access to the sector.

Individual Stocks: Prioritize airlines with robust hedging and sustainability initiatives. Delta (DAL) and American (AAL) are top picks, but don't overlook regional carriers with lower debt loads.

Energy Transition Plays: Look for airlines investing in SAF and carbon-neutral operations. United (UAL) and Alaska (ALK) are leading the pack.

The Data Doesn't Lie

Let's not ignore the numbers. Since 2020, the S&P 500 Energy sector has underperformed the S&P 500 by 12% during periods of declining refinery utilization, while the airline sector has outperformed by 8%.

The message is clear: as the U.S. shifts away from fossil fuels, the refining sector's struggles will persist. For investors, this isn't a crisis—it's an opportunity.

Final Takeaway

The next time you see a refinery utilization rate miss expectations, don't panic. Instead, consider it a signal to rotate into airlines. The energy transition isn't just about EVs and renewables—it's about rethinking where value is created. And right now, that value is flying at 35,000 feet.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-20 20:56:19.587273

First-of-its-kind eSAF Production

Based on research carried out at Tampere University, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolytes technology used to convert CO2 emissions and renewable hydrogen into eSAF.

Production is set to launch in Autumn 2025 in Eespo, Finland. The new electro-fuel production unit is the first of its kind and is aiming to establish a functioning ecosystem for synthetic fuel production in Finland.

Cooperation with Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia will support the development of eSAF production and develop globally scalable processes to secure the future supply of domestically produced SAF in Finland.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market. To achieve this goal, it is critical that the project brings together industrial partners across the eSAF value chain with a shared ambition to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels,” said Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

ReFuelEU Aviation

At the beginning of 2025, the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate entered into force, promoting an increase in renewable fuel usage in aviation through 2050.

In 2030, the mandate will include fully synthetic fuel produced from CO2, such as eSAF. By 2050, the fuel blending requirement will rise to 70%, with half of this requirement being SAF.

Mandate applies to airports with at least 800,000 passengers and 100,000 tonnes of cargo annually. In Finland, Helsinki Airport (HEL) and Rovaniemi Airport (RVN) fall under the mandate.

“As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel. This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders, and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations,” says Henri Hansson, SVP, Airport Infrastructure, Sustainability, Safety, Security & Compliance at Finavia.

Finland as a Producer of Renewable Fuels

Finland has a unique opportunity to become an industry-leading producer of renewable aviation fuels with 20 million tons of biogenic CO2 annually from the forest industry and emissions from biogas plants. Diverse sources enable decentralized eSAF production, stronger energy security, and even distribution across Finland.

‍

“There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favorable. We believe rapid piloting and validation are the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels. If successful, this project can give Finland a significant competitive advantage,” said Pasi Keinänen, Liquid Sun.

Collaboration for Renewable Energy Usage

Project development is the result of close cooperation of various companies along the aviation value chain in Finland - Liquid Sun, ABB, Finnair, Finavia, and Fortum.

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, and its energy transition will require innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to contribute to developing Finland’s capability in synthetic aviation fuel production while advancing the industry’s carbon neutrality goals,” said Riku Aho, Vice President Energy Transition, at Finnair.

eSAF in Comparison

Producing eSAF from biogenic CO2 emissions is environmentally competitive compared to other SAF production methods, but the details depend on the pathway and feedstock used. Here’s a comparison of key production methods:

1. eSAF from Biogenic CO2

CO2 Source: Captured from biological processes (e.g., fermentation, biogas plants) where the carbon would be released to the atmosphere if not captured.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reduction: High. Biogenic CO2 is considered carbon neutral because the original photosynthetic capture offsets emissions from combustion. Life-cycle GHG reduction estimates are typically in the 74–90% range versus fossil jet fuel, depending on efficiency and renewable energy use.

Land/Resource Use: Lower than crop-based SAF, as it avoids direct land competition if using true waste streams.

2. HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters & Fatty Acids: Waste Oils, Fats, or Algae)

CO2 Source: Biogenic, from fats, oils, and waste (e.g., used cooking oil).

GHG Reduction: Substantial, typically a 74–84% reduction compared to conventional jet fuel. Lower for crop-based (e.g., palm oil) due to potential indirect land use change. True wastes and residues have a better profile.

Feedstock Concerns: Limited global availability of waste oils; risk of market distortion if crops are incentivized over food or forest.

3. Power-to-Liquid (PtL) or Power-to-X

CO2 Source: Can be biogenic, fossil (industrial “point source”), or from Direct Air Capture (DAC).

GHG Reduction: Best when powered solely by renewable electricity and using biogenic CO2 or Direct Air Capture. DAC is the least energy-efficient pathway due to the high energy needed to extract CO2 from ambient air.

Advantages: Potentially near-zero GHG footprint if green electricity and biogenic or atmospheric CO2 are used. Minimal land footprint—significant for places lacking biomass resources.

Challenges: Requires vast amounts of clean energy; currently limited by high cost and infrastructure for hydrogen and DAC.

4. Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)

CO2 Source: Fermentation from plant biomass (corn, sugarcane, or cellulosic waste).

GHG Reduction: Estimated up to 94%, but highly dependent on land use (direct and indirect), fertilizer use, and how the feedstock is grown. If using food crops, the risk of land-use change offsets the benefits.

Feedstock: Requires dedicated crops or waste streams; high sustainability if using agricultural wastes.

5. Gasification + Fischer-Tropsch (GFT)

CO2 Source: Biomass, municipal solid waste, forestry residues.

GHG Reduction: Between 66–94%, depending on how waste would have been managed otherwise (e.g., landfill methane), and whether the process uses renewable energy.

Resource Requirements: The availability of suitable waste and residues limits the scale, and there are concerns about air and water emissions from combustion-derived syngas.

Key Environmental Takeaways

Biogenic CO2–based eSAF is among the least environmentally harmful options when using bona fide waste or residue streams and renewable energy. It generally outperforms crop-based HEFA or ATJ pathways in terms of land and water use and avoids many land-use change risks.

Power-to-liquid (PtL) using renewable power and biogenic or DAC-CO2 can potentially achieve the lowest total GHG emissions—possibly approaching net zero—but at present, DAC is highly energy-intensive and expensive.

Waste-residue-based SAF (any method) typically offers the best lifecycle GHG and resource profile due to avoided waste management emissions and lack of land use competition.

Methods using crop-based feedstocks (food crops) can have significant indirect emissions due to land use change and should be minimized as per current sustainability frameworks.

While still a faraway source of propulsion energy, eSAF from biogenic CO2 might become highly competitive environmentally and, when powered by renewable energy and sourced from waste streams, rival or exceed the benefits of most alternative SAF pathways, especially compared to crop-based or fossil-derived feedstocks.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68a5e280c633105e324fa8cf_OH-LWT%208796%202434.jpeg,N,,2025-08-20 11:57:26.197358

Key takeaways

IATA projects 6% jet fuel demand growth in 2025 to 107 billion gallons.

EU and UK enforce 2% SAF blending from January 1, 2025; EU targets 6% by 2030.

Global SAF production doubled in 2024 to 1 million tonnes; 2025 output ~713 million gallons.

Aviation fuel is the oil market’s outlier in 2025, with jet fuel demand still climbing while gasoline and diesel level off. Airlines worldwide are flying more as travel rebounds, and new rules are pushing more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into tanks. IATA projects a 6% rise in jet fuel use this year to 107 billion gallons, while the industry’s fuel bill is expected to total $248 billion in 2025, nearly 5% below 2024 as prices ease.

In the United States 🇺🇸, spot prices fell from an average $2.73 per gallon in Q1 2024 to $2.34 in Q3, with 2025 expected to average $2.07. The contrast is striking: aviation fuels expand as road fuels face long-term pressure from electric vehicles and efficiency gains.

Mandates are the biggest driver behind the shift toward SAF.

From January 1, 2025, the European Union and the United Kingdom began binding SAF blending rules.

The EU requires 2% SAF at all airports in 2025, ramping to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The UK starts at 2% in 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Both systems rely on verified emissions savings and tradable certificates to prove compliance. According to VisaVerge.com analysis, these policies, paired with airline purchase agreements, are giving suppliers firmer signals to invest in new plants.

Asia-Pacific governments are moving too:

Japan targets a 10% SAF blend by 2030.

Singapore plans 1% for departing flights in 2026, moving to 3–5% by 2030.

China and India are building local SAF output and preparing blend goals.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2025 Renewable Fuel Standard holds:

Advanced biofuel at 7.33 billion gallons

Biomass-based diesel at 3.35 billion gallons

New state SAF tax credits are expected in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

The European Commission’s ReFuelEU framework sets a template many markets are watching. See the regulation details here: https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-transport-policy/refueleu-aviation_en

Supply vs demand: catching up but not enough

Global SAF production doubled in 2024 to 1 million tonnes (about 0.3 billion gallons), and output could reach about 713 million gallons in 2025. Yet that remains only a sliver of total aviation fuel use.

IATA reports 70 airlines have committed to buy 11.5 billion gallons of SAF by 2030, indicating strong demand intent that still outpaces confirmed capacity.

The SAF market is set to surge from $2.06 billion in 2025 to $25.62 billion by 2030, driven by large plants, new feedstocks, and long-term offtake deals.

Cost pressures and economic impact

Costs remain the hard part. SAF continues to trade at a premium to conventional jet fuel.

IATA estimates SAF will add $3.8 billion to airlines’ fuel costs in 2025, more than double the $1.7 billion added in 2024.

In Europe, non-compliance with blending rules can trigger penalties, raising real costs for airlines that fall short.

The UK builds in a buy-out price to control the hit to consumers if supply is tight.

Even with falling spot prices for standard jet fuel, the SAF premium keeps pressure on budgets and could nudge ticket prices higher on some routes.

Important: The SAF premium may lead to higher fares in regions where supply is scarce or penalties are strict.

⚠️ Important

Do not assume SAF certificates equal physical fuel availability—airlines may buy certificates or use buy-outs to meet mandates, leaving airports short of blended supplies and increasing spot premiums.

Production pathways and industry response

Producers and refiners are retooling to meet changing demand profiles.

About 82% of current SAF capacity uses HEFA (hydro-processed esters and fatty acids), relying on fats, used cooking oil, and similar inputs.

These feedstocks are limited, so investors are funding alternative pathways such as:

Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ)

Power-to-liquid (synthetic e-fuels)

Policymakers in the EU and UK designed mandates to slowly shift away from heavy HEFA dependence and promote these newer routes. This matters because meeting future targets will require far more supply than today’s HEFA feedstocks can cover.

“SAF is strengthening its role as the cornerstone for the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Robust policy frameworks and targeted support are essential to keep SAF growth on track,” said SkyNRG CEO Maarten van Dijk in June 2025. SkyNRG’s market outlook aligns with IATA’s view that production is accelerating but still behind what mandates and airline pledges will require.

How EU and UK systems work in practice (2025)

Fuel suppliers blend the required 2% SAF into aviation fuel.

They document SAF volumes and greenhouse gas savings and submit evidence.

Authorities issue tradable certificates tied to those savings.

Suppliers use certificates to prove compliance or trade them if they have extra.

Penalties apply in the EU for shortfalls; the UK’s buy-out helps shield travelers.

For airline finance teams, these steps are now core to carbon accounting:

Certificates and credits show progress toward emissions goals and help meet legal rules across markets.

Procurement teams are locking in multi-year SAF deliveries, often linked to specific airports to align with local mandates.

Consumer effects and regional differences

Travelers will feel mixed effects:

Positive: more routes will carry fuel with a lower carbon footprint, and carriers will promote this in booking tools.

Negative: the SAF premium can feed into fares, especially where supply is scarce.

Regional differences matter:

Europe’s penalties raise stakes for compliance and could translate to greater operational costs for airlines.

The UK’s buy-out seeks to limit price spikes for consumers.

Refiners and the long-term pivot

Refiners face strategic choices:

Some plants are shifting yields toward jet fuel to match growing demand.

Others are converting units to produce SAF.

With gasoline and diesel no longer the growth engines they once were, jet products are taking a larger share of the slate. Analysts note this long-term pivot could reshape refining margins and trade flows through 2050.

The gap and the risk to meeting targets

Looking ahead, the main risk is the gap between goals and physical supply.

SAF demand could triple by 2035 to 40 million tonnes (about 13.2 billion gallons).

Projections show a 26 million tonne (about 8.6 billion gallons) shortfall unless new capacity is built.

EU and UK targets tighten sharply from 2030 and 2040 onward, with synthetic fuels expected to gain a larger role. Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America are preparing targets and plants, but investors need confidence in stable policy and offtake deals to move faster.

Bottom line

For now, aviation’s energy story is one of momentum:

IATA’s price and demand outlook points to affordable conventional supply in 2025.

Mandates and airline contracts keep SAF growth in the spotlight.

VisaVerge.com reports that firm policy, clearer certificates, and rising purchase commitments are pushing the market from pilot volumes toward commercial scale.

If governments keep incentives steady and producers deliver on new technologies, the industry could meet higher blend levels without sharp shocks to travelers. But if build-out lags, airlines may lean on buy-outs and certificates while paying more for limited physical supply—especially in regions with strict rules and busy hubs.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Growth Drivers

How is the acceptance of high-integrity lifecycle carbon reductions fueling the sustainable aviation fuel market progress?

Aviation's climate strategy pivots on fuels with verifiable lifecycle cuts. CORSIA (ICAO) moved into wider implementation in 2024-2026, tightening accepted sustainability criteria and methodologies for SAF.

This compliance-grade carbon value is monetized. Airlines' decreasing reported emissions exposure can trim ETS-CORSIA liabilities. At the same time, producers earn higher credits in LCFS if they drive CI lower (for instance, via renewable power, green hydrogen, or CCUS on ethanol feedstocks). The global sustainable aviation fuel market is hence rewarding projects that can document traceability and additionality, increasing investment into digital MRV and lower-CI feedstocks.

How is cost curve pressure: scale, credits, and better logistics propelling the sustainable aviation fuel market?

The price delta remains the central brake, but it's easing at the margin. Based on the region and feedstock, SAF premiums have commonly ranged $2 to $4/gal above Jet-A. With IRA + LCFS, specific United States lanes can compress this to sub-$1-$2/gal efficient premiums for qualifying low-CI volumes, mainly for HEFA and some ATJ routes tied to low-CI ethanol.

Supply chain and scale optimization are progressing. More pipeline-grade SAF, on-airport blending, and multi-airline pooling decrease logistic costs. Indexed SAF price benchmarks and forward curves launched by price reporting agencies in 2023-2024 are allowing structured and hedging offtakes, enhancing bankability.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Restraints

Costly and limited feedstock availability negatively impacts market progress

Current SAF production is led by HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathways, depending on animal fats, waste oils, and vegetable oils. These feedstocks face competition from biodiesel, renewable diesel, and oleochemicals, increasing prices, and are finite.

The EWABA (European Waste-Based Biodiesel Association) cautioned in 2024 that waste oil imports, especially from Asia, are under scrutiny for traceability concerns, possibly tightening supply. Meanwhile, scaling next-gen feedstocks like lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and CO2-derived e-fuels needs logistics and infrastructure that remain underdeveloped.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Opportunities

How do airline climate and corporate commitments present favorable prospects for the sustainable aviation fuel market?

Large corporations are committing to decreasing Scope 3 emissions, comprising business travel, while airlines are planning to be net-zero by 2050. In 2023-2024, carriers like Lufthansa, Delta, Air France-KLM, and United contracted multi-year offtake pacts for billions of gallons of SAF, usually at fixed-price terms to secure supply.

Corporate programs like ‘Book & Claim’ are progressing rapidly – United’s Eco-Skies Alliance and Shell’s Avelia platform experienced distribution sell-out in 2023-2024. These commitments ultimately fuel the sustainable aviation fuel industry.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Challenges

Infrastructure limitations for distribution and blending restrict the growth of market

Only a small number of airports, mainly in Europe and North America, have SAF integrated into their fueling systems. Many others depend on off-site blending or costly trucking. In 2024, fewer than 60 airports across the globe had regular SAF supply, according to IATA.

Without significant investment in hydrant injection, on-site storage, and blending, meeting 2030 mandates will require ineffective workarounds, increasing costs for producers and airlines.

Forging a New Era of India-ASEAN Relations

For Prelims: Indo-Pacific region, ASEAN, Act East Policy, Free Trade Agreement, Strategic Partnership to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership

For Mains: Areas of Cooperation Between India and ASEAN, Significance of the Indo-Pacific Region for India, Key Issues Hindering India's Active Engagements in the Indo-Pacific.

Source: ORF

Why in News?

Amid China’s growing assertiveness, the US strategic recalibration, and uncertainties in the Indo-Pacific, ASEAN’s role has become increasingly significant. For India, it remains a cornerstone of the Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific vision, as emphasized at the 2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, promoting a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific.

What Opportunities does ASEAN Present to India?

Economic and Trade Opportunities: ASEAN, with 650 million people and a GDP of USD 3.2 trillion, is a key economic and trade partner for India.

Bilateral trade has reached USD 122.67 billion (2023–24), 11% of India’s global trade.

Singapore is India’s largest ASEAN trade partner and 6th largest trade partner (FY 2024-25) with a share of around 3% of India’s overall trade & also the top FDI source at USD 14.94 billion.

Full utilisation of ASEAN-India FTA (AIFTA) and finalising ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) can further boost trade and investment.

Defence Cooperation: India is increasingly emerging as a reliable defense partner, providing military hardware and technology to ASEAN nations.

Key deals, such as the sale of the BrahMos cruise missile system to the Philippines, signify a new phase of strategic cooperation.

India's assistance also includes providing training, maintenance, and technical expertise to help modernize the armed forces of various ASEAN member states, thereby strengthening their defense capabilities and promoting self-reliance.

Strategic & Security Engagement: ASEAN provides a strategic counterbalance amid regional tensions, reinforcing India’s Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific vision while supporting ASEAN Centrality.

India engages through East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Maritime Forum, and joint exercises like the ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise (South China Sea, 2023).

Cooperation spans anti-piracy measures, disaster management, and promoting a rules-based regional order aligned with India’s SAGAR doctrine.

Connectivity & Infrastructure Integration: India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport projects are poised to enhance regional physical connectivity and integration, while also boosting economic development in India’s Northeast by positioning it as a hub for regional trade.

Digital initiatives like 5G, cybersecurity, and participation in the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) strengthen technological and economic linkages.

These efforts provide alternatives to China’s Belt and Road Initiative and promote economic and cultural integration in the region.

Tech & Energy Cooperation: India-ASEAN collaboration also spans IT, fintech, e-commerce, AI, and start-ups (via ASEAN-India Start-up Festival), supported by the ASEAN-India Science & Technology Development Fund.

Cooperation in energy resources, solar and clean technology, and semiconductors strengthens energy security and sustainability, highlighted by the ASEAN-India High-Level Renewable Energy Conference in 2022.

Cultural & People Ties: India-ASEAN historical and cultural links support soft power through the Artists’ Camp, Music Festival, and Network of Universities (2022), enhancing academic and societal bonds.

Participation in Initiative for ASEAN Integration Work Plan IV and centers of excellence promotes innovation, connectivity, and sustainable development.

Year 2025 has been designated the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism, featuring youth summits, start-up festivals.

Also, Indonesia’s Ramayana Ballet and Thailand’s Ayutthaya, called the “Ayodhya of Thailand,” reflect shared cultural heritage.

What are the Areas of Friction Between India & ASEAN?

Trade Imbalance & RCEP Withdrawal: India’s trade deficit with ASEAN has widened sharply, rising from USD 9.66 billion (2016–17) to USD 45.2 billion (2024–25), largely due to faster import growth compared to export growth.

To address concerns over market access, tariff asymmetry, and unfair trade practices, India is reviewing the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITGA).

Earlier, India withdrew from RCEP in 2019 to prevent a surge of Chinese goods via ASEAN markets, while efforts to renegotiate the ASEAN-India FTA have been slow and limited.

Delays in Connectivity Projects: Projects like the IMT Trilateral Highway and KMMT Project face funding, security, and bureaucratic delays, impeding trade, investment, and people-to-people ties and affecting India’s regional credibility.

Limited Defence Cooperation & Divergent Strategies: ASEAN’s divergent security priorities and economic dependence on China (ASEAN-China trade USD 702 billion vs ASEAN-India USD 122.67 billion, 2023–24) limit defence collaboration, as ASEAN countries are reluctant to counter China militarily or strategically due to their strong economic ties, resulting in only partial support for India’s Indo-Pacific vision.

ASEAN countries also differ politically, with Vietnam and the Philippines supporting India’s open, inclusive Indo-Pacific vision, while Cambodia and others prefer neutrality.

Also, India and ASEAN differ on their approach to Myanmar’s political crisis, where India maintains pragmatic ties with the junta for border and connectivity reasons, whereas ASEAN pursues diplomatic engagement via the Five-Point Consensus, causing friction.

Digital Trade & Data Governance Challenges: Regulatory mismatches in digital trade, fintech, and data governance slow India-ASEAN collaboration.

While ASEAN favors a liberal digital trade regime, India enforces data sovereignty under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

What Strategies Can India Pursue to Strengthen Ties with ASEAN and Assert Leadership in the Indo-Pacific?

Enhance Connectivity (Physical + Digital): Expedite projects like IMT Trilateral Highway and KMMT Project to scale up maritime linkages, air corridors, and digital infrastructure.

Implement mutual recognition agreements, interoperable digital platforms, and pilot projects with ASEAN partners, balancing India’s data sovereignty under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 with ASEAN’s liberal digital trade regime.

Bilateral initiatives like India–Singapore UPI linkage (2023) should be expanded to a regional digital payments architecture.

Maritime Security & Blue Economy: India and ASEAN should deepen maritime cooperation beyond naval exercises and piracy patrols by enhancing underwater domain awareness, logistics and MRO support, and addressing non-traditional threats like terrorism, drug smuggling, and human trafficking.

On the blue economy front, joint initiatives in marine technology, offshore renewable energy, and sustainable fisheries can combat IUU fishing and strengthen regional food security.

Sustainability, Resilience & Development Partnerships: Deepen collaboration on climate change, renewable energy, disaster management, food security, and digital skilling.

India can launch supply chain diversification initiatives in critical technologies and co-develop green energy corridors and sustainable agriculture models to boost regional resilience.

Strengthening Institutional & People-Centric Engagement: Leverage platforms like East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), ADMM-Plus to strengthen strategic dialogue.

Integrate Quad–ASEAN cooperation, institutionalize Track-1.5 dialogues, scholarships, cultural exchanges, and bolster people-to-people ties to reinforce India’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific.

The designation of 2025 as the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism is an excellent opportunity to promote travel and cultural understanding.

Space for Sustainability: India can elevate its space collaboration with ASEAN from a transactional level to a strategic partnership by spearheading a dedicated ""Space for Sustainability"" program.

Building on the success of the South Asia Satellite (GSAT-9), India should extend its space diplomacy to ASEAN by launching a dedicated Regional Satellite for Sustainability.

This mission would provide critical data for crop monitoring, tracking marine pollution, and delivering disaster alerts, bolstering India's role as a trusted and low-cost space partner in Southeast Asia.

ASEAN

About: ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is a regional intergovernmental organization founded in 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand.

It consists of 10 member countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia.

Objective: Promoting economic growth, regional stability, and cooperation among member states.

India’s Engagement with ASEAN: India formal engagement with ASEAN started in 1992 as a Sectoral Dialogue Partner, became a Dialogue Partner in 1995.

It was elevated to Strategic Partnership in 2012, and upgraded to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2022.

Indo-Pacific Region

The Indo-Pacific spans the Indian Ocean and western/central Pacific Ocean, hosting diverse cultures, ecosystems, and major powers such as India, China, Japan, and the US.

It accounts for over half the world’s population, 60% of global GDP, and two-thirds of global economic growth.

India’s vision promotes a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific, advocating peaceful dispute resolution and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Conclusion

India–ASEAN relations stand as a cornerstone of Act East and Indo-Pacific vision, rooted in shared prosperity, strategic trust, and cultural connection. By deepening cooperation in connectivity, digital innovation, climate resilience, and maritime security, the partnership can evolve into a future-ready, rules-based and inclusive regional architecture.

Indian Economy

Tourism as India’s Growth Engine

For Prelims: UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Swadesh Darshan, PRASAD, Heal in India Initiative

For Mains: Role of tourism in India’s economic resilience and employment generation, Challenges hindering growth of India’s tourism sector

Source:BS

Why in News?

Following the 50% US tariffs imposed on Indian goods, experts such as former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant have suggested that tourism could help offset potential losses by attracting high-value tourists, since tourism is free from tariff barriers.

What is the Potential of India’s Tourism Sector?

India’s Tourism: The tourism sector in India has regained its pre-pandemic momentum, contributing 5% to GDP in FY23 and creating 7.6 crore jobs.

India recorded 9.95 million foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) in 2024 but still below pre-pandemic levels. Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEEs) grew 10% in 2024 to Rs 2.9 lakh crore compared to 2023, reinforcing tourism’s role in jobs, revenue, and global standing.

India accounts for 1.5% of international tourist arrivals. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) 2024-25 report, India is the 8th largest tourism economy, contributing USD 231.6 billion.

India ranked 10th out of 46 destinations in the Medical Tourism Index (2020–21) released by the Medical Tourism Association.

Key Source Markets: Between 2020 and 2024, US, Bangladesh, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Germany, and France emerged as the top source countries for India’s foreign tourist arrivals.

Travel purposes are mainly leisure (46%), diaspora visits (27%), and business travel (10%).

Future Growth: The WTTC has projected that the travel and tourism sector will contribute almost Rs 42 trillion to India’s economy by 2035, supporting 64 million jobs.

By 2028, FTAs are expected to rise to 30.5 million, generating over Rs 5.13 lakh crore in revenue.

By 2047, India aims to become a USD 3 trillion tourism economy, attracting 100 million international tourists, 20 billion domestic trips, and creating 200 million tourism-related jobs.

What are the Challenges Hindering the Growth of Indian Tourism?

Visa and Travel Hurdles: Paper-based processes, complex approvals, limited visa-free access make FTAs entry difficult.

For example, only citizens of Bhutan, Nepal, and Maldives can travel to India without a visa, whereas China allows 70 countries and Thailand 90 countries visa-free access.

Poor Infrastructure: Limited hotel rooms and weak transport networks reduce tourist comfort.

India has around 200,000 hotel rooms, compared to China’s 20 million. Many government-run hotels operate at a loss, discouraging investment.

Lack of Cleanliness: Inadequate waste management and untidy surroundings near airports and public areas leave poor first impressions on visitors, especially when compared to cleaner international tourist destinations.

Safety Concerns: Inadequate security and emergency services pose risks to tourists, particularly in remote or high-traffic areas.

Low Global Promotion: India lacks a strong, ongoing international marketing campaign. Past initiatives like “Incredible India” were successful, but no major campaign has run in the last decade.

As of July 2025 India has 44 UNESCO World Heritage Sites while Greece has around half, but attracts three times more tourists. This highlights underutilization of cultural assets, weak global branding, poor visitor facilities, and limited promotion, making it harder for India to attract high-value tourists.

Urban and Connectivity Gaps: Difficult access to remote or high-potential destinations reduces tourist inflow.

Regions like the Himalayan religious circuits remain underdeveloped in terms of roads, airports, and accommodations.

How can India Attract High-Value Tourists?

Simplify Entry and Travel: Expanding e-Tourist Visa and visa-on-arrival to more countries, while making them faster and cheaper, can boost arrivals.

For high-value tourists, seamless travel through better airports, quicker immigration, and multilingual support is essential.

Promote Unique, Premium Experiences: Promote Niche Tourism like Ayurveda retreats, luxury wildlife safaris, spiritual wellness tours, high-end cultural festivals, and river cruises. These attract tourists willing to pay more.

Lakshadweep, with its pristine beaches, coral reefs, and clear waters, holds immense promise as a high-value tourist destination. With sustainable tourism practices and carefully planned infrastructure, the islands can become a premier hotspot.

Invite influencers, travel writers, and opinion leaders for luxury experiences that build aspiration and word-of-mouth.

Showcase Destination Diversity with Circuits: Schemes like Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD can be used to package experiences into premium itineraries, such as the Buddhist Circuit for international pilgrims, a luxury Himalayan Circuit combining wellness and adventure, and Spiritual Circuits with upgraded PRASAD sites.

These initiatives transform India from a single-site destination into a multi-day immersive journey, encouraging longer stays and higher spending by tourists.

World-Class Infrastructure and Connectivity: The initiative to develop 50 top tourist destinations through challenge-mode partnerships with states ensures premium facilities, luxury hotels, and seamless connectivity.

Classifying hotels under the Infrastructure Harmonized Master List (HML) will draw private investment into high-end hospitality, crucial for attracting affluent travelers.

Upgrade Service Quality: High-value tourists want comfort. More focus on training manpower in hospitality (chefs, guides, service staff) is key.

Encourage global-standard hotels, boutique stays, luxury trains, and cruises.

Medical and Wellness Tourism: The Heal in India initiative, blending modern medicine with Ayurveda, Yoga, and wellness, positions India as a global healthcare hub.

With Medical Value Travel projected at USD 13.42 billion by 2026, India can attract affluent patients seeking holistic, high-quality care.

Knowledge as Value Additions: Initiatives like the Gyan Bharatam Mission (digitizing manuscripts, preserving heritage) can support cultural tourism aimed at scholars, and global heritage enthusiasts.

Strengthen Safety and Comfort: 24x7 helplines, tourist police, welcome booklets, and multilingual guides can build trust and attract more tourists.

Conclusion

Tourism offers India a tariff-free path to resilience by creating jobs, earning foreign exchange, and strengthening global branding. With ‘Seva’ and ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ as guiding values, India can redefine its tourism landscape and emerge as a world-class destination by 2047.

Ethics

Stray Dog Management in India: Balancing Public Safety and Animal Welfare

For Prelims: Rabies, Article 21, Supreme Court of India, National Rabies Control Program

For Mains: Balancing People Rights Vs Animal Welfare

Source: IE

Why in News?

The Supreme Court (SC) of India issued a suo motu directive to remove stray dogs in the National Capital Region (NCR), following tragic attacks on children.

This directive has sparked discussions on the legal and ethical aspects of balancing public safety with animal welfare.

Menace of Stray Dog in India

India has 62–80 million stray dogs. Over 2.2 million dog bite cases were reported in 2024 alone. Rabies from dog bites accounts for 36% of global deaths, primarily affecting children, women, and the elderly.

National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows that more than 4000 dog bite fatalities occurred in 2019.

Delhi alone recorded over 35,000 animal bite incidents in the first half of 2025. The cost of treating rabies through post-exposure prophylaxis places a financial strain on healthcare systems, with an average cost of Rs 5,128 per case.

What are the Legal and Policy Frameworks for Stray Dogs Management in India?

Constitutional Provision;

Article 246(3): States manage preservation, protection, and improvement of livestock, prevention of animal diseases, and veterinary training/practice.

Articles 243(W) & 246: Local bodies are responsible for controlling the stray dog population.

Article 51A(g): Fundamental duty of citizens to show compassion for all living creatures.

Article 21 (expanded by SC in Animal Welfare Board of India v. Nagaraja (2014): Right to life extended to animals (Jallikattu Case).

Legal and Policy Framework:

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960: Prohibits cruelty and mandates humane treatment.

Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023: Provide for sterilization, vaccination, and release of stray dogs back to their habitats.

Rabies Control Efforts: The National Rabies Control Program (NRCP), led by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, aims for rabies elimination by 2030 through vaccination, sterilization, and surveillance.

What are the Key Ethical Aspects Surrounding Stray Dog Management?

Human Safety vs. Animal Rights: Rising dog-bite cases and rabies deaths create a moral conflict between ensuring public safety and protecting animals’ right to life.

High incidence of attacks on children raises ethical concerns of negligence in safeguarding the most vulnerable. ABC Rules prioritise animal welfare over human safety, risking Article 21 rights when aggressive strays are released.

Whereas animals, as living beings, deserve protection and humane treatment. The removal or abandonment of stray dogs is viewed as a violation of their fundamental right to life.

Disparity in Treatment: Well-bred dogs are often treated as family members or status symbols, while stray dogs are seen as social outcasts, raising concerns about unequal treatment.

Ethical Dilemmas in Control Methods: Instances of culling, poisoning, or cruel relocation violate ethical principles of compassion and humane treatment.

Corruption and Mismanagement: Mismanagement and misuse of funds allocated for sterilization, vaccination, and stray dog welfare programs undermine both the effectiveness of these initiatives and the ethical obligation to ensure humane treatment for animals.

Ethical Frameworks Guiding Stray Dog Management

Utilitarian Ethics: Sterilization and vaccination serve the greater good by reducing the risk of rabies while avoiding cruelty. This approach often advocates for stricter measures to protect human health, aiming for the overall benefit of society.

Deontology: The State and society have a duty to protect both citizens and animals.

Rights-Based Ethics: Stray dogs are seen as having inherent rights, and ethical action involves protecting those rights and ensuring their welfare.

Cultural Ethos of Ahimsa: Indian tradition emphasizes compassion and coexistence with all living beings.

One Health Approach: Ethical stewardship demands integrating animal welfare with human and environmental health.

Best Practices in Stray Dog Management

In Bengaluru, assessments of the ABC program showed a 10% reduction in the street dog population from 2019 to 2023, with a 20% increase in the neutering rate, reflecting positive results in managing stray populations.

The Netherlands achieved a “stray dog-free” status through the CNVR (Collect, Neuter, Vaccinate, Return) program, and encouraged adoption.

Istanbul, Turkey the city runs comprehensive Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return programs, tags sterilized dogs with ear markers, and engages community feeders.

Over the past decade, the stray population has stabilized, rabies is nearly eliminated, and coexistence with humans is maintained.

Bangkok, Thailand replaced mass culling with TNVR. This approach halted rabies outbreaks and significantly reduced community aggression toward dogs.

What Measures Should Be Taken to Balance Public Safety and Animal Welfare?

Service Roles for Dogs: Collective measures should be taken by all key stakeholders to Leverage Dogs' Cognitive and Social Skills for Critical Roles in Drug Detection, Bomb Sniffing, and Therapy, while Promoting a Positive View of Dogs in Society.

Policy Implementation: Governments must collaborate with civil society to enhance vaccination, sterilization programs, and prevent pet abandonment. A national policy should address the human-dog conflict.

Dedicated Facilities: Establishing feeding stations, veterinary healthcare facilities, and supporting animal welfare organizations is key to managing stray dog populations effectively.

Additionally, a dedicated helpline must be established for reporting attacks.

Public Awareness and Education: Educate the public on responsible pet ownership, the importance of sterilization, and the safe interaction with animals to prevent dog bites and reduce abandonment.

Conclusion

The ethical responsibility to protect animals must be aligned with society’s duty to safeguard its citizens. By fostering compassion, implementing effective policies, and engaging in public awareness campaigns, India can build a future where both human and animal rights are respected, ensuring peaceful coexistence.

Did You Know?

Only J&K, Delhi, and Puducherry are represented in the Rajya Sabha because they are the only union territories with elected legislatures.

The composition of the Legislative Assemblies of UTs are governed by acts of Parliament.

The Delhi Assembly has 70 elected members and no provision for nominated MLAs under the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991.

The Puducherry Assembly has 30 elected members, with the Union government allowed to nominate up to three members under the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963.

What are the Constitutional Provisions Regarding Nominated Members?

Rajya Sabha: Under Article 80, the President can nominate 12 members having special knowledge in literature, science, art, and social service, on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.

Nominated members enjoy most privileges of elected MPs, such as participating in debates, and introducing bills, but cannot vote in presidential elections. They can vote for the Vice President.

They are also not required to declare assets and liabilities under the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

Nominated members have six months from taking their seat to join a political party; joining after this period leads to disqualification.

Legislative Councils: Under Article 171, nearly one-sixth of members in a State Legislative Council are nominated by the Governor, based on the advice of the Council of Ministers.

Anglo-Indian Members: Earlier, the Constitution allowed the President (Article 331) to nominate two Anglo-Indian members to the Lok Sabha and Governors (Article 333) to nominate one Anglo-Indian member to State Legislative Assemblies.

Both provisions were abolished by the 104th Constitutional Amendment in 2020.

Judicial Precedents Regarding Nominated Members

Puducherry Case (K. Lakshminarayanan vs Union of India, 2018): The Madras High Court upheld the Union government’s power to nominate three MLAs to the Puducherry Assembly without needing the UT government’s advice.

It recommended statutory clarity on the nomination process, including the authority and procedure, but the Supreme Court later set aside these recommendations on appeal.

Delhi Case (Government of NCT of Delhi vs Union of India, 2023): The Supreme Court had delved into the concept of “triple chain of command,” where civil servants are accountable to ministers, ministers to the legislature, and the legislature to the electorate.

It ruled that the LG must follow the advice of the Council of Ministers, except in matters beyond the Delhi Assembly’s powers.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Source: IE

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will start commercial Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production from used cooking oil at its Panipat refinery after ISCC CORSIA (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification for CORSIA) certification, marking India’s first SAF plant and a key step in reducing aviation emissions.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

About: SAF is a biofuel produced from sustainable feedstocks, chemically similar to conventional Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), and can be used in existing aircraft engines and infrastructure without modifications (‘drop-in’ fuel).

Possible Feedstocks for SAF: Oils & fats (Used Cooking Oil, algae oils, animal fats, oil-rich seeds), municipal solid waste, agricultural/forestry residues (sugarcane bagasse, husks etc), and sugars & starches via Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway.

The ATJ pathway converts renewable alcohols (ethanol, butanol) from sugars, starches, or residues into hydrocarbon-based SAF.

Significance: SAF reduces GHG emissions by up to 80%, contributes over 60% to aviation decarbonisation, boosts energy security, creates green jobs, and supports up to 50% fuel blends.

Challenges in SAF Adoption: SAF faces high costs (2-3 times conventional fuel), infrastructure gaps, and challenges in feedstock collection due to seasonal and scattered supply.

ISCC CORSIA Certification

ISCC CORSIA ensures compliance with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

From 2027 (mandatory phase), international airlines must offset emissions above 2020 levels, with SAF blending being a key compliance route.

CORSIA is a global ICAO initiative to limit international aviation CO₂ emissions growth by stabilizing net emissions at 2020 levels through carbon offsetting, credits, and SAF.

India’s Roadmap

NBCC (National Biofuel Coordination Committee) targets 1% SAF blending in 2027 and 2% in 2028 for international flights, with domestic mandate post-2027.

This supports Net Zero 2070, gives a first-mover advantage, promotes a circular economy (UCO recycling), and opens export opportunities to European airlines.

Bioactive Peptides

Source: PIB

A study finds that bioactive peptides (BAPs) from traditional fermented foods can deliver health benefits tailored to specific population groups, opening scope for personalized nutrition in India.

Bioactive Peptides (BAPs): Bioactive peptides are short chains of 2–20 amino acids that remain active after digestion and directly affect body functions.

They are essentially ""hidden"" or ""encrypted"" within the larger structure of a parent protein.

They become ""activated"" or ""released"" when the parent protein is broken down by enzymes during digestion, fermentation, or other forms of processing.

BAPs interact with biomolecules via electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, providing antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antioxidant, and immune-modulatory effects.

Peptides and proteins are both made up of amino acid chains linked by peptide bonds.

The key difference is that peptides are shorter chains, while proteins typically have more than 50 amino acids.

Health Benefits: BAPs can regulate blood pressure, blood sugar, immunity, inflammation, and influence cardiac and metabolic health.

However, the way biopeptides work varies from person to person due to factors such as genetic makeup, gut microbiota, diet, and overall health.

This highlights the importance of precision nutrition, where diets and health plans are tailored to an individual’s unique biology, an approach particularly crucial in a diverse population like India.

Amino Acids:

Amino acids are organic compounds that act as the building blocks of proteins, essential for growth, repair, and normal functioning of the body. They are of three types:

Essential amino acids, which the body cannot produce and must be obtained from food (such as histidine, leucine, and lysine).

Nonessential amino acids, which the body can synthesize on its own (such as alanine, glutamic acid, and glycine).

Conditionally essential amino acids are usually not essential, except in times of illness and stress (eg: arginine, cysteine, and glutamine )

The Finance Ministry stated that nearly one-fourth of PM Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts are inoperative, raising concerns about financial inclusion and account usage.

Scale of Inoperative Accounts: Out of 56.04 crore PMJDY accounts, 13.04 crore (23%) are inoperative. Uttar Pradesh has the highest share (2.75 crore), followed by Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.

As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, a savings account is marked inoperative if there are no transactions for over 2 years.

However, Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) continue to flow even into inactive accounts.

About PM Jan Dhan Yojana: It provides a basic zero-balance account for every unbanked adult without any opening or maintenance charges.

Account holders receive a RuPay debit card with Rs 2 lakh accident insurance cover and are eligible for an overdraft facility of up to Rs 10,000 to meet emergencies.

The scheme also serves as a key platform for Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) and subsidies, and through its integration with the JAM trinity (Jan Dhan–Aadhaar–Mobile), it ensures transparent and efficient delivery of welfare schemes.

Transformative Impact: PMJDY has significantly boosted women’s financial inclusion-women owning bank accounts rose from 53% (2015-16) to 79% (2019-21).

Leveraging PMJDY’s financial inclusion base, access to Mudra loans has expanded, recording a CAGR of 9.8% between 2019 and 2024.

The scheme has also boosted savings habits with an average deposit of Rs 4,352.

With improved access to high-quality data, APRIL’s forestry management can become more agile, responding faster and smarter to changing environmental conditions.","Forestry has always been a game of patience and long-term vision, shaped by the careful management of resources that take years, even decades, to mature. For Gustavo Martins, APRIL Group’s Tree Improvement Head, the appeal of forestry lies precisely in these challenges.

Born into a family rooted in agriculture in Brazil, Gustavo developed an early fascination with the outdoors.

“My family has roots to agriculture. My grandfather was a rancher. My father is an agronomist. I always grew up in this environment,” he shares.

“Forests are even more challenging because of the long cycles and exciting because they’re big living beings,” Gustavo explains.

His interest grew stronger during graduate school, where tree improvement offered him the perfect intersection of biology, statistical analysis, and practical outcomes. Today, that deep engagement is directly contributing to APRIL2030, the company’s ambitious sustainability strategy which aims for a 50 per cent increase in fibre productivity without expanding its plantation footprint. APRIL has already achieved a 12 per cent productivity gain, and Gustavo’s work is central to continuing this progress.

For him, the journey of improvement is endless: “It’s a never-ending journey. Every day there’s a new discovery…that’s quite exciting.”

Improving Forest Productivity Through Traditional Breeding

At APRIL, Gustavo leads tree improvement initiatives using traditional breeding techniques designed to enhance growth rates and the resilience of commercial tree species. He emphasises that APRIL does not rely on genetically modified trees but instead harnesses naturally occurring genetic variations through selective breeding practices.

“We introduce natural variation from these species, fine-tuning genetics from the natural variability,” Gustavo notes.

His team primarily focuses on acacia and eucalyptus, species well suited to APRIL’s tropical plantation environments due to their fast growth and inherent resistance to pests and diseases. To ensure reliable performance, Gustavo explains that each promising tree clone is rigorously tested under various conditions, observing how they respond over time.

“We have a well-defined research programme. We do clonal testing in different environments and verify how they perform under those site conditions,” he explains.

Harnessing Data to Guide Better Forestry Management

The secret behind APRIL’s robust plantation operations lies partly in the comprehensive data-driven approach Gustavo oversees. APRIL’s forestry R&D team includes over 200 specialists from diverse fields such as genetics, plant health, nutrition, and silviculture, who together manage vast datasets to support strategic decision-making.

A particularly impactful innovation is the company’s use of remote sensing technologies, allowing teams to monitor vast forested areas in a way previously impossible.

“Remote sensing was really a game changer because we can cover and monitor the forest in a larger scale that was not possible before,” Gustavo highlights.

The team integrates detailed maps of soil texture and fertility to strategically match specific tree clones to the most suitable planting sites. This careful approach ensures that trees thrive despite challenges like climate variability and environmental stresses.

From Insight to Impact: Caring for Soil and Feeding Forests

For Gustavo, the health of APRIL’s plantations starts from the ground up. Each plantation site is viewed as a long-term investment designed to yield productivity not just once, but across multiple planting cycles.

“Our land works double duty. It needs to boost productivity but simultaneously protect the environment,” he emphasises.

APRIL’s meticulous approach ensures every tree receives precisely tailored nutrition, applying macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and calcium, alongside essential micronutrients like magnesium, zinc, and boron. The carefully balanced nutrient programme protects long-term soil health and sustains productivity.

This practice also helps APRIL achieve its broader sustainability goals. Gustavo draws a clear link between productivity and climate mitigation, noting that healthier, faster-growing trees capture more carbon from the atmosphere.

“A more productive forest is absorbing more carbon from the air,” he explains.

Partnerships Powering Forestry Innovation

Gustavo firmly believes that addressing forestry challenges cannot be done by APRIL alone. Instead, the company relies on robust partnerships with global research institutions and universities to expand its capabilities.

“We have collaborative projects and partnerships; it’s a multi-disciplinary approach,” Gustavo explains.

Notably, APRIL collaborates closely with North Carolina State University through initiatives like CAMCORE and the Plant Sciences Initiative, leveraging their expertise in genetic research and forest management practices. Additionally, APRIL partners with Pretoria University’s FABI institute, further strengthening its capabilities in plant health and pest management.

“These partnerships exemplify our commitment to integrating academic excellence with our practical science-based solutions,” he says.

Gustavo believes that partnerships are critical because forestry’s complexity requires collaboration between diverse fields, from biotechnology and genetics to data science. Solving complex issues like climate change and resource management demands collective, interdisciplinary action.

Rethinking the Role of Planted Forests

Gustavo sees a common misunderstanding about the role planted forests play in the environment. While consumers increasingly demand sustainability, they also continue to require materials derived from forestry.

“Everyday people want to consume more and more. How do we achieve both at the same time? There’s no other way if we don’t use technology and science,” he explains.

Planted forests, he stresses, are essential because they help meet fibre demand without placing additional pressure on natural forests. Gustavo highlights APRIL’s one-to-one conservation policy, which pairs every hectare of planted forest with an equal area conserved as natural habitat.

His global forestry experience across Brazil, Indonesia, and the United States underscores a universal misconception about commercial forestry, that economic production and environmental protection cannot coexist. Gustavo argues passionately against this view, insisting that sustainability can and should be an integral part of commercial forestry practices worldwide.

Building Progress Over Time

Reflecting on his nine-year tenure at APRIL, Gustavo highlights tangible gains already made through the company’s genetic improvement programme.

“We already verified a significant improvement in our forest productivity. Our approach has been working,” he states.

But he sees these improvements as part of a longer continuum rather than isolated victories. Sustainable forestry, for Gustavo, comes from continuous, incremental improvement rather than dramatic overhauls.

“What we do today should be better than what we did yesterday, and what we do tomorrow should be better than what we do today,” he says, underscoring his long-term vision for progress.

Looking ahead, Gustavo sees further potential in the integration of artificial intelligence and automation. With improved access to high-quality data, APRIL’s forestry management can become more agile, responding faster and smarter to changing environmental conditions.

“Artificial intelligence, it’s definitely going to change the way we do things in the next five years,” Gustavo concludes, confidently pointing toward a future where innovation, sustainability, and productivity align seamlessly.",https://www.inside-rge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gustavo_tree-improvement_4-e1755681766126.png,N,,2025-08-20 09:56:58.114338

As part of this initiative, Grainger engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.
For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams.
Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.
After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Ill., the researchers utilized HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil.","For researchers from The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, a new avenue for reducing carbon emissions can be found on the side.

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step towards carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Grainger engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural & biological engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

“There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.”

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Ill., the researchers utilized HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab.

“Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

“We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

“There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.” Yang said. “I’m optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.”

Other co-authors on this study included Haozhen He, Runnan Gao and Anran Song of the Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering; Sabrina Summers and Buchun Si of the Department of Agricultural & Biological Engineering; and Zhibin Yang and Joshua Heyne of Washington State University. Yang is affiliated with the Department of Chemistry, the Materials Research Laboratory, the Prairie Research Institute and the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation.

SAF, like ethanol-blended petrol for cars, is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation.

The jet fuel can be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced. This week, the country’s largest refiner and fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp. signed a memorandum of understanding with Tata Group airline Air India for the supply of SAF, marking a major step towards a greener future for Indian aviation.

IOC is the first Indian company to secure ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat Refinery. ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production.

The company plans to start production of SAF on a commercial scale at its Panipat refinery by December, according to media reports. By the end of 2025, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil.

Sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks like food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. These require complex chemical processes at the refineries.

Triglyceride or oil-based feedstocks such as plant oil, animal oil, yellow or brown greases or waste fat, oil, and greases are hydroprocessed to break apart the long chain of fatty acids, followed by a process called hydroisomerization and hydrocracking, according to the US Energy Department.

Pretreated waste fat, oil, and greases can also be eligible feedstocks. Used cooking oil and waste animal fats are two other popular sources for coprocessing with petroleum intermediates as a potential SAF pathway.

Such non-petroleum feedstock to make SAF could be sourced at scale from large hotel chains like those run by Taj Hotels, Oberoi Hotels and ITC Hotels, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors like Haldiram’s, which normally discard cooking oil after single use.

Sustainable aviation fuel blended with conventional jet fuel can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure. Compared with conventional jet fuel, 100% SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway, according to the US Energy Department.

SAF is a replacement for conventional jet fuel, allowing for multiple products from various feedstocks and production technologies. Aviation accounts for 2% of all carbon dioxide emissions globally and 12% of all CO2 emissions from transportation.

The international aviation industry has set an aspirational goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2050. SAF presents the best near-term opportunity to meet these goals.

Biofuels in India are of strategic importance as they align with the ongoing initiatives of the government such as Make in India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. For example, India initiated the use of ethanol as an automotive fuel in 2003 and is primarily produced using sugarcane molasses.

The government has a 10% blending target for mixing ethanol with petrol by 2022, a 20% blending target by 2030 and 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel in the whole country by 2030.

Likewise, the adoption of SAF also presents the opportunity to reduce reliance on costly imported crude and create a new income source for small and large companies to dispose of their used oil.",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-02-11%2F6g3zmye3%2F4888a338-3b77-4c54-9b9f-047634014a79.jpg?rect=0%2C423%2C2928%2C1537&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-08-20 04:56:19.326836

Air India and Indian Oil Corporation have taken a significant step forward in shaping the future of sustainable aviation in India. By signing a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the two organisations are aligning with India’s broader climate goals and the global net zero ambition led by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The partnership signals more than a commercial arrangement. It represents a bold vision for reducing aviation emissions in a sector often regarded as one of the most challenging to decarbonise.

The Role of SAF in Aviation Decarbonisation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not just an alternative to fossil-based jet fuel. It is one of the most viable pathways to immediately reduce carbon emissions from aviation without requiring major modifications to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure. SAF can lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

By incorporating SAF into its operational strategy, Air India is contributing to India’s national target of achieving a 5 per cent SAF blending mandate by 2030. This move also aligns the airline with IATA’s long-term goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, underscoring how international and domestic ambitions are now converging.

A Dual Commitment: Efficiency and Innovation

The announcement also highlights Air India’s broader approach to sustainability. Beyond SAF, the airline has initiated a suite of measures such as fuel efficiency enhancements, flight route optimisation, and partnerships for joint research in alternative fuels.

This layered strategy is essential. While SAF provides an immediate solution for emissions reduction, improvements in operations and future innovation will amplify the impact and ensure long-term resilience. The combination of efficiency and innovation reflects a modern blueprint for responsible aviation.

Why This Matters for India’s Sustainability Goals

India’s aviation sector is one of the fastest growing in the world. Passenger numbers are increasing, routes are expanding, and the demand for air cargo is rising steadily. This growth, while positive for the economy, also brings environmental challenges.

The government’s target of blending 5 per cent SAF into aviation fuel by 2030 is both ambitious and necessary. The Air India and IOC agreement provides a practical demonstration of how this target can be pursued through cross-industry collaboration. The message is clear: decarbonisation cannot be achieved in isolation. It requires synergy between airlines, fuel producers, policymakers, and innovators.

Strengthening India’s Global Position

This initiative also positions India as a proactive contributor to global aviation’s decarbonisation journey. Countries around the world are experimenting with SAF blending mandates, production capacity scaling, and supportive policy frameworks.

By taking decisive steps now, India signals that it is not only catching up with global trends but also capable of setting benchmarks for others. The Air India–IOC agreement is therefore more than a domestic achievement; it is a marker of India’s rising influence in the climate-conscious aviation landscape.

The Challenges of Scaling SAF

Despite its promise, SAF adoption faces challenges. Production remains limited, costs are higher compared to conventional jet fuel, and supply chain logistics require substantial investment. Achieving the 5 per cent blending target by 2030 will require careful coordination of infrastructure, incentives, and technology development.

However, these challenges are also opportunities. They open the door for new partnerships, research investments, and industrial diversification. By addressing these barriers now, India can build a resilient SAF ecosystem that ensures both environmental and economic benefits.

Collaboration as the Key to Transformation

What makes the Air India–IOC pact particularly noteworthy is its collaborative essence. Aviation decarbonisation cannot be achieved by airlines or fuel suppliers alone. It requires an ecosystem approach, where knowledge, resources, and risks are shared.

This agreement showcases how collaboration can turn climate ambitions into measurable outcomes. It creates momentum for other airlines, fuel producers, and stakeholders to step forward and contribute to India’s sustainability roadmap.

Subtle Shifts with Far-Reaching Impacts

While SAF blending may appear incremental today, its ripple effects will be profound. Even small percentages of SAF adoption across the sector can reduce millions of tonnes of carbon emissions over time. It can also drive local innovation, support jobs in biofuel production, and create new markets for sustainable feedstocks.

These subtle shifts underline the importance of seeing SAF not just as a compliance tool but as a catalyst for long-term systemic transformation.

Lessons for Other Industries

The aviation–oil collaboration also offers lessons for other hard-to-abate sectors. Maritime and road transport, for instance, face similar challenges in decarbonisation. Just as airlines and fuel suppliers are coming together for SAF, ports, shipping companies, and logistics providers can form comparable alliances to advance clean fuels and efficiency.

Cross-sector collaboration, therefore, is the thread that ties together the larger net zero narrative.

Conclusion

The agreement between Air India and Indian Oil Corporation is more than a memorandum of understanding. It is a symbol of how ambition, innovation, and collaboration can converge to create real change in aviation sustainability. By embracing SAF alongside efficiency improvements and research partnerships, Air India is positioning itself as a responsible leader in a rapidly evolving industry.

As India continues to expand its aviation footprint, the integration of sustainable practices will determine not only the sector’s environmental impact but also its global competitiveness. The Air India–IOC pact is a timely reminder that the future of aviation lies in foresight, partnerships, and bold action.

Five years after Covid-19 emptied the skies, global jet-fuel demand has yet to recover to its pre-pandemic level.
Meanwhile, global consumption of every other category of petroleum refined products — gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha and fuel oil — has already surpassed 2019 levels.
Aside from plastics, the brightest spot for global oil consumption is air travel.
While kerosene only accounts for 10% of the wider pool of jet fuel, its declining consumption is another headwind .","Among my many quirks is a fascination with planes: Tracking flights and reading crash-investigation reports are some of my guilty pleasures. The enthusiasm — or obsession — came in handy during the pandemic, when aviation shut down and quashed oil demand. Now, it’s equally useful for investigating the final piece in the oil-recovery jigsaw.

Five years after Covid-19 emptied the skies, global jet-fuel demand has yet to recover to its pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile, global consumption of every other category of petroleum refined products — gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha and fuel oil — has already surpassed 2019 levels.

Still, I’m bullish on jet-fuel consumption. Perhaps because of my enthusiasm for planes, perhaps because I fly a fair bit for work, I’m typically upbeat about the future of aviation. No matter how much I hear about staycations, heat waves or anti-tourist protests, I’m convinced people will continue to take to the air for holidays. And when it comes to the climate threat, I believe most travelers overlook it -- or salve their conscience by purchasing carbon credits, despite the fact that most of them are meaningless in protecting the environment.

I also tend to look at the world through a different glass: I care less about airports like Heathrow in London and John F. Kennedy in New York, instead focusing on emerging hubs like Guangzhou in China, Hyderabad in India, Istanbul in Turkey, Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Bogota in Colombia. Those are where, increasingly, the next generation of travelers are departing and landing.

Put simply, the more the global middle class grows, the more people will fly. Meanwhile, large electric planes remain a dream; hydrogen is a chimera; and so-called sustainable aviation fuel, derived from cooking oil and animal fat, is a hope rather than a reality. Thus, I’m not only bullish about jet-fuel demand now, but also in the future. Aside from plastics, the brightest spot for global oil consumption is air travel. How long can jet fuel offset a decline in gasoline consumption? Probably another five years, if not longer.

Since the pandemic ended, jet fuel has struggled to recover not because people aren’t traveling as much as before — spoiler: they are — but because the shock of lockdown and the high oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine forced the industry to retire old, gas-guzzling planes. Their replacements are far more fuel efficient.

The narrow-body flagship models from Airbus SE and Boeing Co., introduced shortly before the pandemic, are about 20% more parsimonious with fuel than the models they replaced, on the back of better aerodynamics like wingtips, lighter materials and better engines . On top, a portion of what the industry typically calls jet fuel isn’t consumed by planes. Instead, it’s the kerosene that fuels stoves and furnaces. While kerosene only accounts for 10% of the wider pool of jet fuel, its declining consumption is another headwind .

Still, the recovery is on course. Flight counts — and passenger numbers — are well above 2019 levels. Despite early worries that traffic was going to subside this year, so far it’s continued growing, albeit slower than during 2023 and 2024. The share prices of major airlines have also recovered from their drop in March, when concern about summer bookings and business travel was the talk of the industry.

Measured by the so-called revenue-passenger-kilometers benchmark, which combines both the number of people flying and how far they travel, the aviation industry last year clocked 9,037 billion RPKs, surpassing for the first time the 8,688-RPKs peak in 2019. This year, the aviation industry expects another increase to 9,500 billion. And everything suggests that, barring another crisis, the indicator will keep increasing in 2026 and beyond. We shouldn’t be surprised: every other crisis was a mere blip on flying’s long rise. Whether it was the Gulf War in 1990-1991 or the global financial crisis in 2008, every setback has proven temporary.

Despite the surge in flights, jet-fuel demand remains below pre-pandemic levels due to those more efficient planes. The International Energy Agency estimates consumption will reach 7.7 million barrels a day this year, below 2019’s 7.86 million but still posting the strongest annual growth of any refined-oil product. By next year, the headwind of aircraft improvements will start to vanish, with jet-fuel appetite nearly matching pre-Covid levels — something already seen in Europe and North America, where kerosene plays a smaller role.

From 2026 onward, demand should be setting new all-time highs every year. Until when? We have good visibility at least until 2030, when the need is likely to top 8.5 million barrels a day.

What about beyond 2030? My guess is that demand will keep growing, even if gasoline and diesel drop. Turn to Asia for clues: Its fragmented geography, including islands, is well suited for air travel, disposable income among the middle class is rising and, as their counterparts in Europe and America did from the 1960s onwards, the new wealthy Asian urbanites will want to take to the skies. The global use of jet fuel will continue to fly.",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iGgBPhI4asG4/v1/1200x1173.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 00:56:23.840001

Sustainable fuel goals This milestone comes when airlines face increasing mandates to incorporate SAF into their fuel mix.","California-based startup, Circularity Fuels, hopes to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using its compact, electric-powered reactor unit. The Ouro Reactor converts biogas from dairy farm waste into syngas, a precursor to jet fuel. On August 19, the company announced that the technology successfully converted biogas from a California Central Valley dairy farm. This new electric reforming system could create jet fuel right on the farm. Interestingly, the reactor does it all at just 1/100th the capital cost of conventional systems. The dramatic reduction in capital expenditure could make on-site fuel production a realistic prospect for individual farms. Over 20,000 large livestock farms in the U.S. produce nearly a trillion pounds of manure annually, but less than 6% capture the biogas from this waste. “Farmers in the U.S. and around the world are sitting on an untapped goldmine. We’re giving them the ability to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need,” said Dr. Stephen Beaton, CEO and Founder of Circularity Fuels, in the press release. A promising solution Sustainable aviation fuel has been a promising but expensive solution, limited to massive, centralized facilities. But this development could change it as the tech is a hundred times cheaper and small enough to fit on a farm. The Ouro Reactor takes biogas—a mix of methane and carbon dioxide from decomposing manure in waste lagoons—and converts it into a key component for jet fuel. The syngas can be further processed into jet fuel using the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a well-established industrial method. Moreover, this development solves another huge problem. Most farms aren’t connected to the pipelines needed for traditional fuel production. The company says the new technology will allow liquid fuel to be produced on-site and trucked using existing transportation networks. “For the first time, farmers will become renewable fuel producers without waiting for pipeline infrastructure that will never come,” Beaton said. The successful demonstration validates several key innovations. The reactor is said to be the first to electrically convert raw biogas from a farm’s waste lagoon into a jet-fuel precursor without combustion. This system is easy to use because it plugs into a standard electrical connection and can directly process raw biogas, skipping expensive pre-treatment steps. In addition, the reactor can maintain stable operation even with the contaminants that would damage other reformers. Sustainable fuel goals This milestone comes when airlines face increasing mandates to incorporate SAF into their fuel mix. SAF production meets less than 1% of the industry’s demand. “If deployed across all viable U.S. waste sites – including farms, landfills, and wastewater treatment plants – biogas-to-SAF technology could produce 42 million gallons per day, meeting 70% of the nation’s jet fuel demand,” the press release shared via email noted. Circularity Fuels will showcase its new technology at the SAF Global Summit in London next month. It also aims to demonstrate the full biogas-to-SAF process on a California farm later this year. With the large-scale adoption of this tech, the company could help airlines meet their sustainable fuel goals and create billions of dollars in new revenue for farmers.",,N,,2025-08-19 23:56:07.676566

The key question is whether LanzaTech's technology can scale cost-effectively.
Investors should monitor LanzaTech's cash burn rate, progress on SAF projects, and ability to secure offtake agreements.
While the company's technology and strategic moves are promising, its financial struggles and competitive landscape demand careful scrutiny.","LanzaTech Global (NASDAQ: LNZA) is navigating a precarious crossroads. The carbon management company, once a poster child for climate-tech innovation, has seen its revenue plummet by nearly 50% year-over-year to $9.1 million in Q2 2025. Yet, amid the financial turbulence, the company is betting its future on a bold pivot to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a sector poised for explosive growth. The question for investors is whether this high-stakes strategy—coupled with aggressive cost-cutting—can transform LanzaTech from a cash-burning R&D shop into a scalable, profitable player in the decarbonization race.

The Financial Reality: A Company in Transition

LanzaTech's Q2 2025 results underscore the challenges of its transformation. Revenue fell sharply due to the absence of a $7.5 million licensing deal from 2024 and reduced engineering services. While CarbonSmart™ revenue—a newer product line—jumped to $3.8 million, it remains a fraction of the company's former licensing income. Operating expenses rose to $35.1 million, driven by professional fees tied to financing and strategic overhauls. The net loss of $32.5 million, though partially offset by a $6.7 million non-cash gain, highlights the financial strain of this transition.

Liquidity, however, offers a glimmer of hope. A $40 million preferred equity financing in May 2025 boosted cash reserves to $39.6 million, providing runway for its SAF projects. Yet, with an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $29.7 million, the company's path to profitability remains unproven.

Strategic Moves: From R&D to Commercialization

LanzaTech's pivot to SAF is anchored in two pillars: cost optimization and strategic partnerships.

Cost-Cutting Measures:

The company has slashed costs through workforce reductions and leadership changes in 2025, aiming to streamline operations. These cuts align with CEO Dr. Jennifer Holmgren's vision of a “more efficient, scalable business.” While painful in the short term, they signal a shift from R&D-centric spending to commercial execution.

SAF Ambitions:

The UK Advanced Fuels Fund's £6.4 million grant for the DRAGON 1&2 projects is a critical win. These facilities will use LanzaTech's ethanol-to-jet technology to produce SAF from recycled carbon and waste ethanol. The first plant in Port Talbot will convert ethanol into SAF, while the second will leverage CO₂ and green hydrogen for Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuel. These projects position LanzaTech to tap into the $28.6 billion SAF market by 2032, which is expected to grow at a 39.9% CAGR.

Market Potential vs. Competitive Realities

The SAF market is a gold rush, but LanzaTech faces stiff competition. Neste and TotalEnergies dominate with established HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) technology and large-scale production. LanzaTech's gas fermentation platform, which converts industrial waste gases into ethanol, offers a unique edge: it can utilize feedstocks that competitors cannot, such as off-gas from steel mills. This niche could be a differentiator in regions with high industrial emissions but limited access to traditional SAF feedstocks.

However, scaling remains a hurdle. Neste's Singapore plant and TotalEnergies' partnerships with Airbus and Air France-KLM give them a first-mover advantage. LanzaTech's DRAGON projects, while promising, are still in development. The company's ability to secure long-term offtake agreements with airlines or governments will determine its success.

Risks and Rewards: A Calculated Bet

Investors must weigh LanzaTech's risks against its potential. The company's current financials are dire, with a $32.5 million net loss and no clear path to profitability. Yet, the SAF market's growth trajectory is undeniable. If LanzaTech can execute its DRAGON projects and secure partnerships, it could capture a niche in the SAF value chain.

The key question is whether LanzaTech's technology can scale cost-effectively. Its ethanol-to-jet process is still unproven at commercial scale, and the company's reliance on government grants (like the UK's £6.4 million) raises concerns about long-term funding. Meanwhile, Neste and TotalEnergies are expanding their own SAF capacities, potentially crowding out smaller players.

Investment Considerations

For risk-tolerant investors, LanzaTech offers a speculative play on the decarbonization megatrend. The company's innovative technology and strategic pivot to SAF align with global sustainability goals. However, the path to profitability is fraught with execution risks.

Catalysts: Successful completion of DRAGON 1&2, partnerships with major airlines, and regulatory tailwinds (e.g., EU's SAF mandates).

Headwinds: Delays in commercialization, rising production costs, and competition from established players.

A cautious approach is warranted. Investors should monitor LanzaTech's cash burn rate, progress on SAF projects, and ability to secure offtake agreements. For now, the stock remains a high-risk, high-reward proposition.

In conclusion, LanzaTech's pivot to SAF is a bold gamble. While the company's technology and strategic moves are promising, its financial struggles and competitive landscape demand careful scrutiny. For those willing to bet on the long-term vision, LanzaTech could be a hidden gem—but patience and a long-term horizon will be essential.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-19 22:56:24.682851

The goal of being net zero carbon is not just in the design, development, and manufacturing of Formula 1 cars, but also in logistics, operations, and travel.
Formula 1's feeder series, F2 and F3, have successfully run the aforementioned fuels, while former F1 driver Sebastian Vettel has been a strong supporter of it.
While cars around the world adopted ethanol-blended fuels decades ago, Formula 1 was late to the party, only switching to E10 in 2022.

In 2019, Formula 1 set a target to become carbon net zero by 2030, and the technicians across its teams and suppliers had already achieved half that goal by the end of the 2024 Formula 1 season, with a 26 percent decline in carbon emissions.

The goal of being net zero carbon is not just in the design, development, and manufacturing of Formula 1 cars, but also in logistics, operations, and travel. While becoming carbon net zero could benefit the Formula 1 brand — which many detractors see as a waste of resources and a rich man's sport — the technology used by teams could, as is often the case, eventually trickle down to the road cars we drive.

For instance, beginning in 2026 all Formula 1 cars will run on an advanced sustainable fuel blend coupled with the new hybrid engine that will debut next year, technology that can be easily transferable to road cars. Former Red Bull boss Christian Horner also believed that the switch to such a fuel could pave the way to bring back V10 engines in F1, an idea which was ultimately rejected. Formula 1's feeder series, F2 and F3, have successfully run the aforementioned fuels, while former F1 driver Sebastian Vettel has been a strong supporter of it.

One of the biggest issues with Formula 1 from an environmental standpoint is the air miles that teams rack up throughout the year, which has grown significantly due to the ever-growing race calendar. The sport has a barrage of trucks and airplanes that traverse the globe, moving cars, parts, and personnel from one corner of the globe to another.

It may be a while before Formula 1 drivers share an airplane rather than fly solo on their private jets after a scrap on Sunday, but the sport seems intent on doing its part through investment in sustainable aviation fuel technology. They believe that the environmentally-friendly fuel has reduced travel emissions by at least 19 percent, and is a technology that could eventually make its way into the wider aviation industry.

While cars around the world adopted ethanol-blended fuels decades ago, Formula 1 was late to the party, only switching to E10 in 2022. However, Formula 1 is making progress in using HVO100 biofuel for its long-haul trucks that are used during the European leg of the calendar. The hydrotreated vegetable oil fuel, already commonly used in trucks in some parts of Europe, is gaining prominence, and its use in F1's trucks has resulted in an 83 percent reduction in carbon emissions.

Perhaps one Formula 1 innovation that could reach our road cars sooner than the rest is the tire technology currently used on Formula 1 cars. Pirelli's FSC, or Forest Stewardship Council, certified tires promote the ""responsible procurement"" of rubber and ensure a lower ecological footprint. The tires, which have been in use in Formula 1 since the 2024 season, are also recycled into secondary raw materials after they are driven to their limits by Verstappen and company.

These FSC-certified tires will soon be introduced in Jaguar Land Rover cars, with Pirelli and JLR announcing earlier this year that new Range Rover models will sport specially made Pirelli P Zero tires that are FSC-certified. Initially, only vehicles with 22-inch wheels will have the tires, before they are introduced to other models in the range. The P Zero tires are made using recyclable materials, with Pirelli claiming that 70 percent of each tire is composed of recycled content.

However, the Range Rover won't be the first car with Pirelli's FSC-certified tires, as BMW's X5 xDrive45e plug-in hybrid first sported it back in 2021. The Italian tire company's FSC range has even been launched for mountain bikes, underscoring how seriously it takes its environmental consciousness.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/formula-1s-push-for-carbon-net-zero-could-change-more-than-just-racing/l-intro-1755208081.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 18:56:22.414373

The company continues to focus on operational execution and strategic transformation, aiming to transition from a research and development-centric company to a commercially focused enterprise.

Financial Highlights

For the second quarter of 2025, LanzaTech reported a total revenue of $9.1 million, a significant decrease from $17.4 million in the same period last year. This decline was primarily due to reductions in licensing business and a decrease in engineering and other services. The company also reported a net loss of $32.5 million, compared to a net loss of $27.8 million in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA loss increased to $29.7 million from $17.8 million in the same period last year.

Business and Operational Highlights

LanzaTech has been advancing key commercial projects and deepening strategic partnerships. Notably, the company is working on scaling the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using its proprietary gas fermentation platform. This initiative positions LanzaTech to meet the growing demand from airlines, refiners, and governments aiming to achieve decarbonization targets.

In July 2025, LanzaTech was awarded a £6.4 million grant from the UK’s Advanced Fuels Fund to accelerate the development of two commercial-scale SAF facilities under Project Dragon. These facilities will utilize LanzaTech’s ethanol-to-jet technology to convert recycled carbon and waste-based ethanol into SAF.

Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments

During the second quarter, LanzaTech announced transitions in its executive leadership team and reductions to its workforce to improve cost efficiency. The company also completed a $40.0 million preferred equity financing in May 2025, bolstering its liquidity to support near-term operational execution and strategic SAF initiatives.

(NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a carbon management solutions company, today reported its financial and operating results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.

Second Quarter Highlights:

Efficiency & Profitability Initiatives - In May and June 2025, LanzaTech announced certain transitions in its executive leadership team and reductions to its workforce in connection with its ongoing strategic measures to scale its global business with greater cost efficiency to support its transition from a research and development-centric company to a commercially focused enterprise.

Revenue

Reported total revenue of $9.1 million in the second quarter of 2025, compared to $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was due to reductions in licensing business and a decline in engineering and other services and activity, partially offset by growth from CarbonSmart™ revenue:

Licensing revenue in the second quarter of 2025 was $1.1 million, compared to $8.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by $7.5 million in licensing revenue received in the prior period related to LanzaJet sublicensing our technology.

Engineering and other services revenue in the second quarter of 2025 was $1.9 million, compared to $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2024, due to the completion of projects with existing customers and government entities whose projects reached completion of their current development phase.

JDA and contract research revenue was $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2025, compared to $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, due to the completion of certain government projects during 2024, compounded by a period of downtime prior to new projects commencing.

CarbonSmart revenue was $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2025, compared to $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was due to an increased sales volume in CarbonSmart products during the three months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the same period last year.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue increased by $0.7 million, or 13%, in the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. The year-over-year increase was driven in part by a change in revenue mix related to CarbonSmart sales increase, a lower margin business as compared to biorefining and JDA revenues.

Operating Expense

Operating expenses were $35.1 million in the second quarter of 2025, compared to $34.7 million in the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher professional fees related to our financing and strategic initiatives.

Net Loss

Net loss for the second quarter of 2025 was $32.5 million, compared to $27.8 million in the same period last year. Net loss decreased year-over-year primarily as a result of a $6.7 million non-cash gain on financial instruments recognized in the second quarter of 2025, which was partially offset by expenses associated with evaluating strategic options and a $3.3 million non-cash loss recognized in equity method investees.

Adjusted EBITDA Loss

Adjusted EBITDA loss was $29.7 million in the second quarter of 2025, compared to $17.8 million in the same period last year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss year-over-year was primarily attributable to higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of cost optimization efforts, along with lower revenue and higher cost of sales period-over-period. While expected to reduce long-term expenses, short-term restructuring costs were impacted during the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

Balance Sheet and Liquidity

As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $39.6 million in total cash, restricted cash, and investments, compared to total cash of $23.4 million as of March 31, 2025. The increase reflects the $40.0 million preferred equity financing completed in May 2025, which bolstered liquidity to support near-term operational execution and strategic SAF initiatives.

Management Comments

""We are focused on building a more efficient, scalable business with a path to profitability,"" said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, Board Chair and CEO of LanzaTech. ""In the second quarter, we took important steps to streamline operations and shift resources toward commercial execution especially relating to the high-growth market for sustainable aviation fuel. Our platform’s ability to convert carbon waste into SAF will position us to play a critical role in aviation decarbonization.""

Dr. Holmgren added, ""As we refine our operating model, we’re prioritizing capital-light growth through licensing and partnerships, supported by strong regulatory and customer momentum. With a focused strategy, we believe that we are well-positioned to scale our impact and create long-term value.""

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP and to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as our net loss, excluding the impact of depreciation, interest income, net, stock-based compensation expense, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, loss on the Brookfield SAFE extinguishment, change in fair value of the Brookfield SAFE and the Brookfield Loan liabilities, change in fair value of the FPA Put Option liability and Fixed Maturity Consideration (net of interest accretion reversal), change in fair value of the Convertible Note, change in fair value of the PIPE Warrant, change in fair value of the Brookfield Loan and loss from equity method investees, net. We monitor and have presented in this earnings press release Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and the Board to understand and evaluate our operating performance, to establish budgets, and to develop operational goals for managing our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of certain expenses that we include in net loss. Accordingly, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors, analysts, and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects.

Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net loss, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: (i) excludes stock-based compensation expense because it is a significant non-cash expense that is not directly related to our operating performance; (ii) excludes depreciation expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; (iii) excludes gain or losses on equity method investee; and (iv) excludes certain income or expense items that do not provide a comparable measure of our business performance. In addition, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. In addition, other companies may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.

Ltd. (IOC) has secured India’s first international approval to advance commercial-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the operator’s 15-million tonne/year (tpy) integrated Panipat refining and chemical complex in Haryana, just north of New Delhi.
In mid-August, IOC received notice that the Panipat refinery’s production of SAF complies with ISCC System GmbH’s International Sustainability Carbon Certification (ISCC) standards, validating that SAF produced at the site meets the highest international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards, the operator said.
31, 2025, IOC said it plans to establish India’s first commercial-scale SAF plant at Panipat with a proposed production capacity of 86.8 million tpy.
Scheduled for startup in 2025-26, the Panipat co-processing plant will produce SAF-blended ATF with a 4% SAF blend, IOC said.
According to the operator’s latest annual report, the Panipat refinery’s integrated crude processing and petrochemical production capacity expansion is on track for phased commissioning in 2025-26.","Indian Oil Corp.

(IOC) has secured India’s first international approval to advance commercial-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the operator’s 15-million tonne/year (tpy) integrated Panipat refining and chemical complex in Haryana, just north of New Delhi.

In mid-August, IOC received notice that the Panipat refinery’s production of SAF complies with ISCC System GmbH’s International Sustainability Carbon Certification (ISCC) standards, validating that SAF produced at the site meets the highest international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards, the operator said.

Developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by the International Civil Aviation Organization, the ISCC CORSIA certification is a prerequisite for commercial-scale SAF production following rigorous assessment of the production’s lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability.

Alongside creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate the certified SAF production into their operations, IOC said the Panipat refinery’s ISCC CORSIA certification also will serve as a benchmark for other domestic refiners to scale up SAF production as part of India’s broader strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.

In its annual 2024-25 annual report released on Aug. 6 covering the 12-month period from Apr. 1, 2024 – Mar. 31, 2025, IOC said it plans to establish India’s first commercial-scale SAF plant at Panipat with a proposed production capacity of 86.8 million tpy.

The proposed SAF plant will be equipped with LanzaJet Inc.’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology, which uses a feedstock of ethanol to produce low-emission, circular aviation fuel, according to the operator.

IOC said it plans to commission Panipat’s ATJ-SAF plant by 2027-28.

In addition, the operator said it is developing a co-processing SAF unit at the Panipat refinery to produce 735,000 tpy of SAF-blended aviation turbine fuel (ATF) from a feedstock of used cooking oil to further support India’s decarbonization efforts in the aviation sector.

Scheduled for startup in 2025-26, the Panipat co-processing plant will produce SAF-blended ATF with a 4% SAF blend, IOC said.

Panipat refinery capacity expansion

As part of IOC’s broader program of growing capacities at its refineries to help meet projections for ongoing rising demand for finished petroleum products through at least 2040, the Panipat refinery is currently undergoing a 10-million tpy expansion project to lift overall crude processing capacity at the site to 25 million tpy (OGJ Online, Aug. 12, 2024).

According to the operator’s latest annual report, the Panipat refinery’s integrated crude processing and petrochemical production capacity expansion is on track for phased commissioning in 2025-26.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/08/68a4defbd65001b0943c94c7-250819indian_oil_corp.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-19 17:56:24.449581

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step towards carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Grainger engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang , a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering, and Yuanhui Zhang , a professor of agricultural & biological engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

""There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,"" said Zhang. ""Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.""

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang's lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Ill., the researchers utilized HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang's lab.

""Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,"" Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

""We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition"" said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they'd like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

""There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed."" Yang said. ""I'm optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.""

From renewed tariff wars to fresh geopolitical flashpoints, logistics professionals have had to contend with a constantly shifting landscape.

At the same time, structural challenges around skills, safety, and sustainability have continued to grow. Here we review six developments that defined H1 2025.

1. Tariffs return to the fore

The pause in US tariff escalation ended in August, with the White House reintroducing “reciprocal” tariffs that apply baseline duties of 10% to all countries and higher rates of 10–41% depending on origin. The UK sit at the low end, while Syria faces the steepest levels. Brazil has been singled out further, hit by an additional 40% levy. Canada also saw tariffs raised from 25% to 35% on certain goods, justified by Washington’s claim that Ottawa has not done enough to curb fentanyl flows.

The executive order applies from 7 August 2025, with a grace period allowing cargo already loaded onto vessels before that date to arrive until 5 October 2025. To add complexity, US Customs will also impose new fees on Chinese-built or operated vessels from 14 October, potentially forcing alliances such as the Ocean Alliance into costly fleet reshuffles. Carriers are already working through how to redeploy capacity to avoid penalties, with COSCO and OOCL particularly exposed.

2. New shipping alliances reshape networks

The recomposition of global shipping alliances in Q1 has reshaped carrier strategies. The launch of the Gemini Cooperation between Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd marked one of the most significant realignments in recent years, focused on achieving 90%+ schedule reliability. Shippers are already seeing more dependable services, but questions remain about whether premium pricing will follow.

Other alliances, particularly Ocean and THE Alliance (now Premier Alliance), are recalibrating networks, with competition sharpening across Asia–Europe and transpacific trades. For shippers, the alliance changes mean rethinking service contracts and adapting to new network structures that could endure for much of the decade.

3. Houthi attacks deepen Red Sea crisis

The Red Sea crisis, triggered by Houthi rebel attacks, has now stretched on for nearly two years. In July 2025 the threat escalated further with the sinking of the Magic Seas, a Greek-operated vessel targeted for its links to companies calling at Israeli ports. Analysis suggests that one in six vessels globally could now be considered threatened under the Houthis’ broad definition of violators.

For container lines, this effectively rules out a return to Suez Canal routings before 2026 — and possibly not until 2027. Rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope adds up to two weeks to Asia–Europe journeys, pushing up costs and insurance premiums, and putting additional strain on fleet capacity. The Red Sea instability has been a reminder of how localised conflicts can have global consequences for supply chains.

4. Logistics skills shortages persist

The UK continues to face a significant shortfall in logistics skills, with the Road Haulage Association estimating a deficit of around 50,000 HGV drivers. The ONS also reports 6,000 fewer courier and delivery drivers than the previous year. With 55% of HGV drivers aged between 50 and 65, the demographic imbalance remains a long-term concern.

Factors include reduced access to EU workers post-Brexit, poor industry perception, and limited uptake of government training schemes. Although the crisis is not as acute as during the height of the pandemic, the ageing workforce and lack of young entrants mean structural shortages will continue. Rising wage costs, recruitment struggles, and bottlenecks in road transport all add to the burden on UK supply chains.

5. EV shipping challenges raise alarm

The growth of electric vehicle (EV) trade has created new safety risks at sea. Several high-profile fires on car carriers have been linked to lithium-ion batteries, sparking concern among insurers, regulators, and shipowners. Insurers are pushing for tougher loading protocols, enhanced crew training, and more advanced fire suppression systems.

For supply chains, this adds cost and complexity to automotive logistics, with carriers facing higher insurance premiums and the need to retrofit vessels. It is also slowing the momentum of EV exports, just as demand for cleaner vehicles accelerates globally.

6. Sustainability regulations tighten

Sustainability regulation is reshaping procurement strategies. The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is beginning to impact trade in carbon-intensive products such as steel, aluminium, and cement, with importers required to report embedded emissions.

At the same time, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is moving toward a tipping point. UK and EU mandates are pushing airlines to integrate SAF into their fuel mix, with new investments underway to scale production.

While tariffs and geopolitics grab headlines, sustainability is quietly becoming a decisive factor in supplier choice, cost structures, and long-term resilience planning. For many organisations, compliance with emissions and ESG frameworks is no longer optional but critical.

Outlook

H1 2025 has exposed the vulnerability of supply chains to political shocks, armed conflict, safety risks, and structural labour shortages. Tariffs, alliances, and attacks have disrupted networks, while long-term challenges around sustainability and skills remain unresolved.

The message for supply chain leaders is clear: resilience, agility, and visibility will be critical in the second half of 2025, as disruption becomes the new normal.

H1 2025 has underlined how vulnerable global supply chains have become and staying ahead demands visibility, expertise, and a trusted partner by your side.

The fuel used during the test contains 30% SAF, was made with 100% renewable raw materials in the Enilive biorefinery in Gela, in line with the technical requirements defined by the Aeronautical and Space Materials Technologies Department (R.T.M.A.S.), and Leonardo, as manufacturer of the T-346A, has previously verified its compatibility with the aircraft’s fuel systems for aviation safety.

The mixture obtained was also verified by means of radiocarbon analysis by the ppqSense Laboratories for the exact determination of the biogenic content.

The verification of compliance with technical regulations of the fuel for the introduction into the logistics cycle of the F.A. was carried out at the 2nd Technical Control Laboratory of Fiumicino (RM) in coordination with the Department of Technical Operational Services (R.S.T.O.) of the D.A.S.A.S. and then tested in flight on the T-346A aircraft, the new Leonardo Trainer that will replace the current MB339 of the National Aerobatic Team-Frecce Tricolori.

Although the “ReFuelEU Aviation” does not formally apply to the FFAA, in fact the supply chain of military aircraft is strongly interconnected with that of civil aviation; for this reason it is strategic for the FA to maintain the possibility of refueling military aircraft at dual-use airport infrastructures, i.e. both military and civil, where it is not logistically possible to manage separate lines for SAF fuel and conventional fuel of fossil origin.

The flight test represents the culmination of the integration process that combines the Air Force’s need to undertake a path of alignment with the European legislation on SAF to increase the strategic-operational capacity in full compliance with environmental sustainability and the new progressively more sustainable fuel production strategies launched by Enilive.

The Air Division of Aeronautical and Space Experimentation brings together, under a single command, all the study and experimentation bodies of the Air Force. The Division is the main consulting body of the Armed Forces and the Defense Administration for flight tests of aircraft and weapon systems, the analysis and chemical-physical evaluation of structural and consumable materials, training and experimentation in the field of aerospace medicine, the management of operational software and the operational verification of weapon systems. The D.A.S.A.S. also provides technical-logistical and operational support to the Air Force and other Armed Forces and Armed Corps of the State that insist on the grounds and manages, through the Air Terminal Operation Center (A.T.O.C.), flights intended for operations outside national borders.

The seven vehicles have performed well since the trial at the airport started in May, said CAG.

The six-month trial is part of a push by the airport operator to find cleaner alternatives for its existing fleet of 60 vehicles deployed airside, where loading and unloading of aircraft, as well as take-offs and landings, take place.

The renewable diesel is being used to fuel heavy vehicles and specialised equipment that do not yet have viable electric variants.

CAG said electric variants are more readily available for light vehicles, such as forklifts and tractors.

Most heavy vehicles used in the aviation industry are still diesel-powered, such as airport runway sweepers.

These specialised vehicles are used to remove debris, including foreign objects, from runways and taxiways, and are crucial for maintaining runway safety.

Another example is runway rubber removal vehicles, which remove rubber deposits left by aircraft tyres, which can affect braking and safety.

The used cooking oil collected from Changi Airport eateries contributes to the feedstock – or raw material – to produce the renewable diesel used in the trial, CAG said.

The feedstock is converted into high-quality renewable diesel fuel that has a similar chemical composition to fossil diesel, it said.

This is done at

a refinery in Tuas run by Neste Singapore

, a renewable energy company.

Renewable diesel can be adopted as an easy replacement for fossil diesel as it can be used in existing diesel engines without modification.

Minimal adjustments are required for renewable diesel to use existing transportation, storage and distribution infrastructure.

The six-month trial will use approximately 14,000 litres of renewable diesel, said Mr Steven Bartholomeusz, Neste’s Asia-Pacific head of public and regulatory affairs.

CAG began its trial in May with a 50 per cent renewable diesel blend. This was upped to 100 per cent in August.

At 100 per cent renewable diesel, up to 90 per cent less greenhouse gas emissions will be produced over the fuel’s life cycle, when compared with fossil diesel, CAG said.

Renewable diesel can also be blended with fossil diesel in any proportion, helping companies to match the use of clean energy to their decarbonisation goals.

Mr Gerald Ng, CAG’s vice-president for regulatory affairs and sustainability, said the vehicles in the trial have performed well on the 50 per cent renewable diesel blend, and “without any impact to vehicle operations and efficiency”.

Renewable diesel trials have taken place at Changi Airport since 2024, when the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced a year-long trial of the fuel, also for heavy and specialised airside vehicles.

These trials are the result of the

sustainable air hub blueprint

launched in 2024, which aims to help reduce domestic aviation emissions by 20 per cent (from 2019 levels) by 2030 and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

Other initiatives from the blueprint include a passenger levy on flights departing from Singapore from 2026 to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as well as increased deployment of solar panels at the airport.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/f92c1588acd29bcd3ed9e4f207590ba36430d104670b5e1681597f3f37b897a8,N,,2025-08-19 13:56:39.039133

Air India partners IndianOil to boost sustainable aviation Air India and IndianOil Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel.","Airlines across the world are uniting under one goal: to make flying cleaner, greener, and sustainable for the future. Air India has now joined global leaders including United, Delta, American, JetBlue, Alaska, and IAG in boosting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This new update signals not just a trend, but a decisive move towards the aviation industry’s Net Zero 2050 target. Air India and IndianOil Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This agreement represents a turning point for Indian aviation. It signals a shift from conventional jet fuels to green energy. Both companies are aligning with India’s climate commitments. The MoU reflects urgency. It shows aviation is moving to meet Net Zero targets. Sustainable Aviation Fuel will be central to this transformation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is changing the way we think about flight. Made from renewable sources such as waste oils, plant matter, and other innovative feedstocks, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel. It is also compatible with today’s aircraft engines, meaning airlines can adopt it without waiting for new technology. For Air India, working with IndianOil to secure certified SAF represents both a national milestone and a global statement of intent.

In the United States, carriers like United and Delta have already committed to multi-billion-gallon supply contracts. JetBlue and Alaska are running corporate SAF programmes to attract eco-conscious travellers. IAG, the parent company of British Airways, is investing in new UK SAF plants, while American Airlines is supporting research into e-fuels. Air India’s step to join this circle of pioneers underlines India’s growing role in aviation sustainability.

The message is clear. The future of flying will not just be about more destinations and faster connections. It will be about responsibility, resilience, and reducing emissions with SAF at its heart.

Aviation is changing. Airlines around the world are racing to cut emissions. They are investing in new aircraft, new technology, and a new type of fuel. This fuel is called Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF. It is made from renewable sources, not fossil oil. It can cut carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent over its life cycle. For an industry that produces around three per cent of global CO₂ emissions, this is a major shift. Governments are now setting targets. Airlines are signing contracts. Energy companies are building refineries. Together they are moving towards the goal of Net Zero by 2050.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel and why it matters

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not science fiction. It is already here. SAF is produced from waste oils, plant material, and even captured carbon. Unlike fossil fuels, SAF can be dropped into existing aircraft without any change to engines. This means airlines can adopt it now. For the planet, it is a lifeline. The International Air Transport Association has pledged Net Zero by 2050. That goal will only be possible if SAF is scaled. Today, SAF use is less than one per cent of all jet fuel. The challenge is to increase production and lower costs.

India steps forward with Air India and IndianOil

India is joining the green aviation race. In August 2025, Air India and IndianOil signed a landmark agreement. IndianOil has produced SAF at its Panipat refinery. It is certified under CORSIA, the international carbon scheme for airlines. Air India will use this fuel to meet its Net Zero by 2050 targets. The airline is also renewing its fleet with 570 new aircraft. These planes will be among the most fuel-efficient in the world. Air India is also testing new technology like electric towing, single engine taxiing, and lighter onboard materials. Together with SAF, these steps show India’s ambition.

United States pushes ahead with large-scale commitments

The United States is one of the largest air travel markets. It is also a leader in SAF policy. The government has launched the SAF Grand Challenge. It aims to produce three billion gallons a year by 2030. United Airlines is leading the charge. It has signed the biggest forward contracts for SAF of any carrier. It has invested in Blue Blade Energy, a joint venture that converts ethanol into SAF. Delta is also scaling. It has contracted more than 200 million gallons already and aims for 10 per cent SAF use by 2030. American Airlines has partnered with Infinium to secure e-fuels. JetBlue has secured more than 670 million gallons through a deal with SG Preston. Alaska Airlines is running projects with Microsoft and SkyNRG. Each of these carriers sees SAF as essential.

Europe sets strict mandates for SAF use

Europe has moved from voluntary action to law. The European Union has passed the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation. It requires airlines to blend two per cent SAF by 2025, six per cent by 2030, and seventy per cent by 2050. The UK has also set a two per cent mandate from 2025. To support airlines, Heathrow Airport offers incentives that cut the cost premium of SAF by half. Virgin Atlantic made history by flying the first transatlantic flight using 100 per cent SAF in 2023. International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways, is building UK plants with LanzaJet and Nova Pangaea. Lufthansa and SWISS are working with Synhelion to use solar fuels. Air France-KLM has signed a contract with TotalEnergies for up to 1.5 million tonnes of SAF over ten years. Low-cost carriers are also joining. Ryanair aims for 12.5 per cent SAF by 2030 and is working with Neste and OMV. easyJet is exploring hydrogen as a long-term option but will also use SAF to meet mandates.

Middle East airlines test 100 per cent SAF flights

The Gulf airlines are also moving. Emirates flew a Boeing 777 with one engine powered fully by SAF. It also flew an Airbus A380 with SAF in one engine. This was the first such test for the world’s largest passenger aircraft. Emirates has begun SAF uplifts in Singapore with Neste. Etihad has its Greenliner programme and is adopting SAF in regular operations. These moves are important. The Middle East is a major global hub. SAF adoption here can influence travel across Asia, Europe, and Africa.

Asia-Pacific builds regional supply chains

Asia-Pacific airlines are not behind. Singapore Airlines is running a national SAF pilot with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Neste is supplying SAF directly into Changi Airport’s system. Corporate customers can also buy SAF credits. In Japan, both ANA and JAL are targeting ten per cent SAF use by 2030. They have corporate SAF programmes and strong government support. Qantas in Australia aims for ten per cent SAF by 2030 and sixty per cent by 2050. It is investing with Airbus in new projects in Queensland. Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong has signed a deal with Aemetis to buy 38 million gallons for flights from San Francisco. Across Asia, governments are starting to set mandates. India will require one per cent SAF blending in 2027, rising to two per cent in 2028.

The barriers to faster adoption

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is ready, but supply is short. Costs remain two to five times higher than fossil jet fuel. Infrastructure is still being built. Airlines want to buy more, but there is not enough available. Policy is critical. Incentives, subsidies, and mandates reduce the price gap. Airports like Heathrow are proving that targeted support works. The challenge is scale. Current global capacity may reach 2.1 million tonnes by 2025. That is still less than one per cent of what is needed.

The bigger picture: SAF and tourism

Tourism is tied closely to aviation. Travellers are more aware of carbon footprints. Corporate customers want to reduce emissions from business travel. SAF provides a solution. Airlines can market green flights. Countries can brand themselves as sustainable destinations. India, with its new SAF supply, can tell travellers that their flights are greener. Europe can show it is serious about climate goals. The United States can link tourism to energy innovation. Travellers benefit because they can enjoy destinations while knowing their impact is reduced.

The role of alliances and collective action

Airlines are stronger when they work together. The oneworld alliance has pooled demand for more than 350 million gallons of SAF. This allows producers to secure finance for new plants. The SkyTeam and Star alliances are also exploring similar moves. By acting collectively, airlines can create stable demand and push prices down faster.

The road to Net Zero by 2050

Net Zero by 2050 is not a slogan. It is a binding goal for global aviation. It requires fleet renewal, operational efficiency, and fuel innovation. SAF is the biggest single lever. It is not the only one. Hydrogen and electric aircraft will play roles in the future, especially on short routes. But for long-haul travel, SAF is the answer. Airlines are proving it works. Governments are mandating it. Producers are scaling up. The challenge is to move from small volumes to mass supply.

A global race for green skies

The shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel is happening. Air India is partnering with IndianOil to secure domestic supply. United and Delta are signing billion-gallon deals. Virgin Atlantic has shown a full SAF transatlantic flight is possible. Emirates has tested SAF on the largest aircraft in the world. Singapore and Japan are embedding SAF into their national strategies. Qantas and Cathay are securing supply for international routes. The European Union and the United Kingdom are mandating blending. The United States is investing billions in production.

Aviation has always been an industry of innovation. Today, its greatest challenge is climate change. SAF is the most practical solution available. It reduces emissions now, not decades from now. It works with existing aircraft. It aligns with national goals. It ensures aviation remains a driver of tourism and trade without damaging the planet. The race is on. The winners will be the airlines and countries that act fastest. The world is watching. And the future of flying depends on it.

Air India partners IndianOil to boost sustainable aviation

Air India and IndianOil Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This agreement represents a turning point for Indian aviation. It signals a shift from conventional jet fuels to green energy. Both companies are aligning with India’s climate commitments. The MoU reflects urgency. It shows aviation is moving to meet Net Zero targets. Sustainable Aviation Fuel will be central to this transformation.

The announcement reflects a bold step forward. Air India is owned by the Tata Group. Its modernisation includes sustainability. IndianOil is the country’s largest fuel supplier. Together, the two giants can change aviation’s carbon footprint. The agreement was signed in the presence of top leadership. It marked a shared pledge to decarbonise skies. The partnership reflects India’s global role in climate action. It ties energy innovation with aviation growth.

SAF adoption powers Net Zero by 2050 goals

The focus of this collaboration is Sustainable Aviation Fuel. SAF is a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel. It cuts lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent. India has set a target of five per cent SAF blending by 2030. This MoU helps accelerate that goal. Air India is committed to IATA’s Net Zero 2050 pledge. IndianOil is producing ISCC-CORSIA-certified SAF at its Panipat refinery. The partnership ensures availability and demand. It builds a supply chain for green fuel in India.

Global aviation contributes nearly three per cent of global emissions. Decarbonising flights is critical. SAF is the most effective short-term solution. For Air India, using SAF is more than compliance. It is also brand positioning. It signals leadership. For IndianOil, it is energy diversification. It demonstrates readiness to supply future fuels. Both companies are creating a framework for the future of travel.

Fleet renewal and green innovation drive progress

Air India is investing in fleet renewal. With 570 new aircraft on order, it will operate one of the most fuel-efficient fleets globally. Modern aircraft reduce emissions through lighter bodies and advanced engines. The airline is also optimising routes. Direct non-stop flights mean less fuel burn and fewer stopovers. The MoU with IndianOil complements these efforts. Fuel efficiency plus SAF equals transformation.

Green practices are already in place. Air India has cut single-use plastics. It uses lighter cutlery to save fuel weight. Processes like single-engine taxiing and autonomous electric towing are being rolled out. Frequent engine washes reduce drag and increase efficiency. These steps save millions of litres of jet fuel annually. Adding SAF adoption makes the programme comprehensive. Air India is becoming a leader in green aviation.

IndianOil strengthens its clean energy leadership

IndianOil has become the first Indian company to earn ISCC-CORSIA certification for SAF. Its Panipat refinery is producing certified green fuels. Certification matters. It means compliance with international standards. It ensures the SAF meets lifecycle carbon emission rules. For IndianOil, this milestone strengthens global credibility. It shows India can supply fuel that meets the strictest environmental checks.

The MoU allows IndianOil to expand its SAF supply. It will serve not only Air India but potentially international airlines in India. This positions IndianOil as a regional SAF leader. As demand rises globally, the company can also look at export markets. This is important for India’s energy security and trade. It links energy innovation with aviation and economic growth.

Aligning India’s climate strategy with aviation

India has made bold commitments in the energy transition. Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Yet it is vital. Domestic air travel is expanding. International connectivity is increasing. Demand for flights is rising. Without sustainable fuels, emissions will climb.

The MoU between Air India and IndianOil shows alignment with India’s 2030 and 2070 climate goals. It is also in step with ICAO’s CORSIA scheme. By ensuring supply and adoption, India builds resilience. It avoids dependence on imported SAF. It secures energy autonomy. And it sends a message that India’s aviation sector will lead, not lag, in the green transition.

Global context and competitive advantage

Airlines around the world are racing to secure SAF. European and American carriers already operate SAF-powered flights. Singapore and Japan are building supply chains. India cannot afford to fall behind. This MoU provides competitive advantage. It secures future fuel for Air India. It supports branding as a sustainable global carrier. It will attract international travellers conscious of emissions.

In the global market, SAF adoption is also linked with airport hubs. Airports providing SAF will attract international carriers. For India, this opens an opportunity. Major hubs like Delhi and Mumbai can become SAF-ready airports. This enhances competitiveness. It makes India a global leader in sustainable aviation routes.

Industry implications and ripple effects

The impact of this MoU goes beyond Air India and IndianOil. It sets a precedent for other Indian carriers. Vistara, Indigo, and SpiceJet will likely follow. SAF will become an industry standard. IndianOil can expand supply. Other refiners may join. This builds a domestic SAF ecosystem.

Travel industry stakeholders must prepare. Tour operators can market India as a green travel destination. Hotels can highlight sustainable transport links. Business travellers can choose India for eco-conscious meetings. The ripple effects extend to tourism branding. India can position itself as both an ancient land of heritage and a modern leader in green travel.

Challenges in scaling sustainable aviation fuel

SAF adoption is not without challenges. Production costs remain high. Global SAF is limited in supply. Infrastructure is still building. Yet demand is rising. The MoU addresses these by linking supply with demand. IndianOil will scale production. Air India will guarantee uptake. Over time, scale will reduce cost. Certification ensures transparency. India is positioning itself early.

For travellers, SAF may not change ticket prices immediately. But over time, green fuels will reduce dependence on fossil jet fuel imports. This stabilises long-term costs. It also makes aviation resilient against carbon taxes and international regulations.

Tourism benefits and global image of India

Tourism is a sector sensitive to sustainability. Travellers now seek destinations with strong green credentials. Airlines are central to this. Air India’s adoption of SAF enhances India’s image. It signals that visiting India supports green aviation. It reassures travellers that flights are aligned with climate goals.

This branding has value. It can influence high-spending international tourists. It can support India’s bid to host global events. It also enhances the image of Air India itself. It positions the airline as a leader in Asia. It strengthens Tata Group’s role in sustainability.

A decisive move for green skies

The MoU between Air India and IndianOil is historic. It links aviation with energy. It links climate with commerce. It is a decisive move towards Net Zero. For India, it sets a standard. It shows leadership in green aviation. For the travel industry, it offers reassurance. It proves that India is future-ready.

The challenge now is scaling. Production, distribution, and infrastructure must grow. But the foundation is laid. Air India’s new fleet will run on fuel-efficient technology. IndianOil will supply SAF certified to global standards. Together, they are ensuring India takes flight into a sustainable future.

This MoU is not just an agreement. It is a signal to the world. It says India will lead in sustainable aviation. It says green skies are possible. And it says travellers can fly with confidence that India is on the path to Net Zero.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-19-at-170130_348aacb9.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 13:56:47.429909

That’s according to Chetan Krishna, head of research and diligence at Third Derivative, RMI’s climate tech accelerator, which just announced support for a cohort of nine climate tech startups, five of which are based in India.

“A decade ago, there were a couple hundred climate tech startups in India. Today, there are about 3,000,” Krishna told Latitude Media. In 2024, he added, $1.5 billion — roughly 10% of all Indian venture capital investments — went into the sector.

That’s not much compared to the $24 billion that went into climate tech startups in the U.S. in the same period, but it’s still a sign of promising growth. And it appears to be slowly stirring the interest of some climate-focused venture capital investors in North America and Europe looking for opportunities beyond their usual geographies.

U.S.-based Lowercarbon Capital, for instance, has two Indian startups in its portfolio: River, which develops electric two-wheelers, and rooftop solar developer SolarSquare. SE Ventures, Schneider Electric’s venture capital arm, recently expanded its investment horizon to include India, leveraging “a partner on the ground helping [it] identify opportunities first and best,” said Carlos Kokron, one of the company’s general partners. And about 15% of Third Derivatives’ portfolio companies are based in India, which is the accelerator’s largest geography after North America and Europe.

It’s still too early to say whether these moves mark the start of a lasting trend, but they already invite a closer look at what makes India attractive to Western VCs—and how deep its climate tech potential truly runs.

Fast growth

The size of India’s economy is one immediate selling point for investors, explained Jai Shekhar, senior analyst at Peak Sustainability Ventures, a Mumbai-based early-stage climate VC firm.

“If you are willing to risk capital on the fact that the Indian economy is going to grow at a very substantial pace over the next 10 years, then the sector is attractive,” he said. And India is growing fast — it’s considered the fastest growing economy and the fourth largest in the world, having just surpassed Japan.

That growth has itself created an urgent need for scaling up the climate sector. Sandiip Bhammer, founder and managing partner of Green Frontier Capital, one of the first Indian early-stage VC funds dedicated to climate, pointed out that as India’s economy grows, so will its greenhouse gas emissions.

“There is no other country in the world where the demand for climate technology to address the environment is going to be extremely high, while also delivering potential for high returns. That’s the reason why people are gravitating towards India,” Bhammer said.

“If you are an American climate VC fund, you have the ability to find very well-priced startup deals in India, because the supply of capital in India is not very large yet and the prices of companies in India tend to be a little lower,” Krishna added.

Plus, compared to China, the other comparable market outside of North America and Europe, the Indian market is relatively accessible. “Entering China as a VC is difficult. The economy is structured differently, norms are different, and languages are different,” Krishna said. “But in India, you can operate in English, and the overall structure of the economy is very similar to the U.S. or EU.”

A country for scaling

For Rajesh Swaminathan, partner at Khosla Ventures, where he manages many of the firm’s climate tech investments, the conversation around Indian climate tech changes depending on the sector.

U.S. climate tech investors backing technologies such as nuclear and geothermal, for instance, are better off keeping their capital and innovation in the country. The “U.S. needs a strong competitive advantage,” he said. But for expensive technologies, like green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, that need to prove that they can be scaled economically, India provides a great platform.

“There’s an advantage in building first-of-a-kind plants, especially for hardware, expensive technologies, in countries like India, because it just reduces the cost and the risk potential,” he said. China is not as advantageous, he added because the technology gets copied pretty quickly.

In other sectors, like solar and batteries, India can provide the advantage of scale, if not necessarily of technical innovation. When it comes to batteries, for example, Swaminathan has found that many Indian companies are focusing on importing core technologies from abroad and scaling them up, rather than developing them themselves. Participating in this scaling, through joint ventures and partnerships, can provide interesting opportunities for Western investors.

“We see more market expansion and relatively less hardcore, fundamental technical innovation,” Swaminathan said. For now, “I think the innovation would still come from pockets in the US, and maybe Europe, and a lot of the expansion will happen in India.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-28-1024x683.png,N,,2025-08-19 13:57:04.623009

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Air India have partnered to promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a significant move towards greener aviation in India. IOC will supply SAF produced from used cooking oil, starting December, at its Panipat refinery, with an annual production of 35,000 tonnes.

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has signed a landmark agreement to supply sustainable aviation fuel to Air India, representing a significant step towards a greener and cleaner aviation in India.

IOC plans to begin production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil starting December this year at its Panipat refinery, according to Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney. The facility is expected to produce 35,000 tonne of green fuel annually, using waste cooking oil sourced from hotel and restaurant chains such as ITC and Haldiram's.

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It can be blended up to 50 per cent in conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF or jet fuel), depending on availability. India has mandated 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel sold to international airlines from 2027.

IOC on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) which ""outlines the shared commitment of both parties to promote the adoption of low-carbon fuels in aviation, support global decarbonisation goals, and contribute to the transition toward more sustainable air transport operations,"" it said in a statement.

The MoU was signed by Shailesh Dhar, Executive Director (Aviation), IOC, and P Balaji, Group Head - Governance, Regulatory, Compliance (GRC) and Corporate Affairs, Air India, in the presence of Sahney and Air India CEO Campbell Wilson.

Live Events

""This collaboration reaffirms IOC's role as a trailblazer in India's energy transition, bringing India closer to a greener, cleaner aviation future,"" the statement said.

IOC has become the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery.

The certification is granted under ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which establishes IOC's capability to produce SAF that meets the most stringent international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards.

Sahney said, ""The signing of this MoU with Air India represents a strategic step in India's transition to sustainable aviation. With our ISCC-CORSIA-certified SAF from Panipat, IOC is ready to provide a sustainable fuel solution that will help decarbonise air travel. Partnering with India's flagship carrier, we are aligning national growth with global climate goals and setting a benchmark for the industry.""

Wilson said through this MoU, Air India is committed to supporting Government of India's initiatives to promote sustainable development in the aviation sector and to further its own sustainability goals to achieve the IATA net zero by 2050 target.

By integrating certified green fuels into commercial operations, IOC and Air India are together reinforcing India's position as a front-runner in sustainable aviation and energy transition.

""Through this MoU, IOC and Air India aim to collaborate on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets and even exceeding them for international flights, ensuring a reliable, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply to support both companies' environmental goals,"" the statement added.

,,2025-08-19 14:48:30+00:00,The Indian Express,Indian Oil to supply sustainable aviation fuel to Air India; MoU inked to set the ball rolling,Sukalp Sharma,,,,,https://indianexpress.com/article/business/aviation/indian-oil-supply-sustainable-aviation-fuel-air-india-10199002/,"ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF.
SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil.
CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels.
“By integrating certified green fuels into commercial operations, Indian Oil and Air India are together reinforcing India’s position as a front-runner in sustainable aviation and energy transition.
Through this MoU, IOCL and Air India aim to collaborate on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets for international flights, ensuring a reliable, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply to support both companies’ environmental goals,” Air India and IOC said in a statement.","By the end of this calendar year, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil, which will be sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors like Haldiram’s, which usually discard cooking oil after single use.

IOC became the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana. ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. According to IOC, the certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend. For instance, Airbus claims that all its aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50 per cent blend of SAF and conventional fuel. Various Indian airlines have already operated successfully a few test and demonstration flights using jet fuel doped with SAF in various proportions. According to aviation industry and energy experts, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

The year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

“By integrating certified green fuels into commercial operations, Indian Oil and Air India are together reinforcing India’s position as a front-runner in sustainable aviation and energy transition. Through this MoU, IOCL and Air India aim to collaborate on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets for international flights, ensuring a reliable, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply to support both companies’ environmental goals,” Air India and IOC said in a statement.

According to Air India, the MoU is part of the airline’s efforts that align with India’s broader push for green aviation, which includes blending regular jet fuel with SAF, and development of supply chains for the biofuel across the country. As part of its broader strategy to achieve the International Air Transport Association’s target of net-zero emissions by 2050 and comply with CORSIA obligations, Air India is actively pursuing initiatives in operational efficiency, low-carbon emissions, and SAF.

While IOC has already received the certification for the used cooking oil pathway for SAF production, the company is also working on setting up units based on the alcohol-to-jet pathway, which involves using ethanol as a feedstock to make SAF. A few other companies in India are also working to build units based on the various SAF manufacturing pathways.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/08/air-india-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-19 12:56:53.627718

Unlike traditional gas-fired reformers that cost millions and require massive infrastructure, the Ouro Reactor uses modified automotive industry components to achieve the same result at a fraction of the size and cost.
“Farmers in the U.S. and around the world are sitting on an untapped goldmine,” said Dr. Stephen Beaton, chief executive officer and founder of Circularity Fuels.
The Ouro Reactor operates on standard electrical connections, uses industrially proven catalysts and processes raw biogas without expensive pretreatment.
The syngas produced by the Ouro Reactor can be converted into jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven industrial process that transforms carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons.","Circularity Fuels announced it has successfully converted biogas from a California Central Valley dairy farm into synthesis gas (syngas), a key precursor to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), using a compact electric processing unit one-hundredth the cost of conventional steam methane or autothermal reformers.

The successful demonstration marks a major step toward transforming the economics of renewable fuel production, one that Circularity believes will help airlines meet mandates for sustainable fuel alternatives while unlocking billions of dollars in new revenue streams for farmers. America’s 20,000-plus large livestock operations generate nearly a trillion pounds of manure each year, yet fewer than 6% of them capture the biogas that is produced as the waste decomposes.

“Farmers in the U.S. and around the world are sitting on an untapped goldmine,” said Dr. Stephen Beaton, chief executive officer and founder of Circularity Fuels. “We’re giving them the ability to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need.”

Meeting aviation fuel demand

The demonstration – the first to electrically reform farm raw biogas from a lagoon digester into a jet fuel precursor without combustion – validates several critical innovations. The Ouro Reactor operates on standard electrical connections, uses industrially proven catalysts and processes raw biogas without expensive pretreatment. Importantly, it maintains stable operation despite the contaminants typically found in agricultural biogas that would damage conventional reformers.

The milestone comes as airlines face increasing mandates to incorporate SAF into their fuel mix, with current production meeting less than 1% of demand. The syngas produced by the Ouro Reactor can be converted into jet fuel using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven industrial process that transforms carbon monoxide and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons.

The lack of access to natural gas pipelines has prevented most agricultural biogas from being converted into renewable fuels. Circularity's Ouro Reactor addresses this problem by slashing reforming costs from millions to tens of thousands of dollars, making the technology affordable enough to deploy directly at large farms. When paired with scaled-down Fischer-Tropsch systems, these distributed units can produce liquid fuel on site that can be transported by truck or rail, eliminating the need for pipeline infrastructure entirely.

“For the first time, farmers will become renewable fuel producers without waiting for pipeline infrastructure that will never come,” Beaton said. “The liquid fuel can be trucked out using existing transportation networks, making energy production as straightforward as any other farm output.”

If deployed across all viable U.S. waste sites – including farms, landfills and wastewater treatment plants – biogas-to-SAF technology could produce 42 million gallons per day, meeting 70% of the nation’s jet fuel demand.

Circularity will showcase the technology next month at the SAF Global Summit in London, U.K., where airlines and fuel producers gather to address the industry’s supply challenges. The company plans to demonstrate complete biogas-to-SAF production later this year at a California farm, with commercial deployment targeted for 2026 across farms in California and beyond.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blte5a51c2d28bbcc9c/bltbe40cbea6cec3e55/67f989c255e7c7e418f54854/dairy_cows_in_front_of_dairy_digester_biogas_facility_-_GettyImages.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-19 12:56:59.447704

“Through this MoU with IndianOil, Air India is committed to support the Government of India’s initiatives to promote sustainable development in the aviation sector and to further its own sustainability goals to achieve the IATA Net Zero by 2050 target,” said CEO and MD, Air India, Campbell Wilson, according to the statement.

The move by the Tata Group airline aims to strengthen India’s broader goal for green aviation, including its target of 5% SAF blending by 2030 and the development of SAF supply chains across the country, Air India said.

The development comes just days after the Petroleum & Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said that the ministry is working closely with various stakeholders to ramp up SAF production in the country. He had also cited the example of IOCL’s refinery in Panipat, which is using used cooking oil to produce SAF.

“The ministry is working closely with oil marketing companies, airlines, and global technology partners to develop and scale up SAF,” Puri had said, according to a statement by the ministry on August 8.

While Air India and the petroleum ministry are ramping up efforts to scale SAF production to fuel clean aviation, aircraft manufacturers like Airbus feel sustainable aviation is a distant dream. Speaking at a sustainability-related event in March this year in France, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said the aviation industry is likely to miss its carbon emissions target by 2050, citing a lack of proper regulatory framework in place, Bloomberg earlier reported.

“I don’t think we are wrong to pursue net zero by 2050...Maybe it’s going to take a bit more time, but let’s not be shy in the ambition,” the Airbus CEO had said.",https://media.assettype.com/outlookbusiness/2025-08-19/zoaoy8sj/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-19-at-5.01.32-PM.jpeg?w=1200&amp;ar=40%3A21&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true&amp;mode=crop&amp;enlarge=true&amp;overlay=false&amp;overlay_position=bottom&amp;overlay_width=100,N,,2025-08-19 12:57:30.578321

Wilson said: “Through this MoU, Air India is committed to support the Government of India’s initiatives to promote sustainable development in the aviation sector and to further its own sustainability goals to achieve the IATA Net Zero by 2050 target.”

The partnership comes as Air India sharpens its sustainability portfolio. The airline, which has placed orders for 570 new aircraft, aims to operate one of the world’s lowest carbon-emitting fleets. “Alongside its fleet renewal, Air India is introducing more non-stop city pairs to reduce emissions, upgrading route planning and optimisation software and working closely with air traffic management to cut fuel burn,” said an airline official.

Air India has also entered into a research collaboration with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Indian Institute of Petroleum to develop and deploy SAF. On the ground, it has rolled out a series of green practices, including reducing single-use plastics, replacing inflight cutlery and dishes with lighter materials, carrying out more frequent engine and airframe washes, adopting single-engine taxiing, and deploying autonomous EV towing to conserve fuel.

The broader push aligns with India’s national target of 5 per cent SAF blending by 2030. Indian Oil has already taken the lead, becoming the first Indian company to secure ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery.

Long-Term Recovery: A Sector on the Mend Despite the turbulence, the Canadian aviation sector is demonstrating resilience in its post-pandemic recovery.
In the long term, the Canadian aviation sector's potential is underpinned by its role in global connectivity and innovation.","The August 2025 operational suspension of Air Canada, triggered by a strike involving 10,000 flight attendants represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), has exposed the fragility of the Canadian aviation sector in the post-pandemic era. The strike, centered on disputes over unpaid boarding time and inflation-adjusted wages, led to the cancellation of over 1,700 flights, stranding 130,000 passengers and eroding investor confidence. Air Canada's stock plummeted 14.25% during the crisis, underscoring the sector's sensitivity to labor unrest and operational disruptions. Yet, beneath the immediate chaos lies a broader narrative of recovery, innovation, and structural challenges that investors must weigh when assessing the sector's long-term potential.

Short-Term Volatility: A Microcosm of Systemic Risks

The strike revealed critical vulnerabilities in Air Canada's business model and the wider industry. By refusing to compensate flight attendants for pre- and post-flight duties—such as safety demonstrations and galley checks—the airline exacerbated tensions with its workforce, leading to a prolonged labor action. The government's intervention via binding arbitration, while criticized as overreach by unions, highlighted the precarious balance between corporate interests, labor rights, and regulatory oversight.

The immediate financial fallout was severe. Air Canada suspended its 2025 financial guidance, citing uncertainty from the strike, and faced estimated daily EBITDA losses of C$75 million. The airline's reliance on a single unionized workforce for critical operations—ground handling, customer service, and flight operations—exposed it to systemic risks. Meanwhile, the cancellation of international and transcontinental flights disrupted Air Canada's 73% of 2024 revenue tied to non-domestic routes, compounding its financial strain.

This crisis mirrors broader trends in the aviation sector, where labor shortages, rising operational costs, and regulatory shifts (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel mandates) are creating a volatile environment. For investors, the key takeaway is that airlines with weak labor relations and rigid operational structures are particularly vulnerable to short-term shocks.

Long-Term Recovery: A Sector on the Mend

Despite the turbulence, the Canadian aviation sector is demonstrating resilience in its post-pandemic recovery. Passenger traffic at Canada's eight largest airports reached 4.7 million in May 2025, a 5.5% increase over pre-pandemic levels in May 2019. Domestic traffic has rebounded strongly, with a 6.7% year-over-year growth, while international travel outside the U.S. surged 16.2% compared to 2019. This recovery is driven by a surge in inbound tourism, fueled by Canada's natural attractions and aggressive marketing campaigns.

However, the sector's long-term health depends on its ability to adapt to evolving dynamics. Airlines are investing in digital transformation—biometric screening, AI-driven analytics, and touchless technologies—to enhance efficiency and passenger experience. Sustainability is also a priority, with carriers like Air Canada and WestJet exploring sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and energy-efficient aircraft. These initiatives align with Canada's net-zero emissions goals and could position the sector for long-term growth.

Government policies are further shaping the landscape. Infrastructure investments in terminal expansions and runway upgrades are boosting capacity, while regulatory reforms—such as the proposed Air Passenger Protection Regulations—aim to improve customer satisfaction. Yet, challenges persist, including U.S. trade tensions and the high cost of debt in a high-interest-rate environment.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Opportunity

For investors, the Air Canada strike serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of labor relations and operational flexibility. While Air Canada remains a dominant player, its recent struggles highlight the risks of over-concentration in a single operator. Competitors like WestJet and Porter, with stronger labor relations and more agile business models, may offer safer long-term bets.

The sector's recovery also hinges on macroeconomic factors. Rising labor costs and inflationary pressures could erode profit margins, particularly for low-cost carriers. Conversely, airlines that integrate fair compensation practices and proactive labor strategies—such as Alaska Airlines in the U.S.—are gaining a competitive edge. Investors should monitor key indicators, including fuel prices, interest rates, and regulatory developments, to gauge sector-wide risks.

In the long term, the Canadian aviation sector's potential is underpinned by its role in global connectivity and innovation. As air travel becomes more sustainable and digitized, airlines that prioritize ESG alignment and technological adoption will likely outperform. However, the path to recovery remains uneven, with transborder traffic to the U.S. declining and regional disparities in airport growth persisting.

1. Aircraft emit water vapour, soot, sulfur aerosols, nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), which contribute to the formation of contrails – clouds that form when water vapour condenses and freezes around small particles (aerosols) in aircraft exhaust. All of these factors have additional warming effects on the atmosphere. In this context, SAF has emerged as a credible alternative with the potential to reduce aviation-related emissions.

2. According to aviation industry and energy experts, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

3. SAF, also known as aviation biofuel, is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil.

4. It is a ‘drop in’ fuel, meaning it can be blended with ATF without requiring any change in the existing machinery of aircraft.

5. SAF can be derived from a range of materials, including:

— Oils and fats such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO), oil-rich seeds from plants, algae oils, animal fats,

— Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)

— Agricultural and forestry residues such as wood waste, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, husks and straw, sugars and starches.

6. There are various methods to produce SAF, with each using different combinations of raw materials. However, for SAF to be truly sustainable, it is important that the feedstock used in its production does not compete with food production, cause deforestation, or harm biodiversity.

Benefits of SAF

1. SAF offers multiple benefits. The primary advantage is its ability to significantly reduce emissions and its compatibility with the current global aircraft fleet. It means SAF can be used without modifications to existing planes, engines, or fueling infrastructure.

2. It is estimated that SAF has the potential to reduce GHG emissions in air travel by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

3. Diversification of fuel sources in the aviation sector can help reduce import dependence and protect the sector from global oil price volatility. This, in turn, could lead to a more stable aviation sector, possibly making air travel accessible to larger sections of society

4. Moreover, SAF adoption will also generate employment opportunities in the sustainability sector.

Barriers to the widespread adoption of SAF

1. The cost of producing these biofuels, which is more than double that of conventional fuels, makes its large-scale adoption difficult for airlines without passing the burden onto consumers.

Story continues below this ad

2. The production, storage, blending, and transportation of SAF require the development of new infrastructure, which would add significantly to the initial cost of adoption.

3. Another key issue is the availability and sustainability of feedstock required for SAF production. The characteristics and variety of necessary feedstock mean that there is no guarantee of year-round supply.

BEYOND THE NUGGET: What is ISCC CORSIA?

1. Earlier this week, IOC became the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana. ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF.

2. ISCC CORSIA is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. Notably, the year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in.

3. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

Story continues below this ad

4. India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights.

5. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

India is set to begin commercial production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale by December 2025. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest fuel refiner and retailer, has received international certification for manufacturing SAF from used cooking oil at its Panipat refinery. This marks step towards reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Recent Developments in SAF Production

IOC has secured the ISCC CORSIA certification, essential for commercial SAF production under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. The Panipat refinery will produce 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually from used cooking oil. This volume aligns with India’s target of 1 per cent SAF blending for international flights by 2027. The certification also sets a precedent for other Indian refiners to expand SAF manufacturing.

Feedstock Sourcing

The primary feedstock for IOC’s SAF is used cooking oil collected from large hotels, restaurants, and food manufacturers like Haldiram’s. While collection from big businesses is manageable, gathering used oil from smaller users and households remains a challenge. IOC plans to engage aggregators to streamline collection and ensure a steady supply of raw materials.

Importance of SAF in Aviation Decarbonisation

SAF is a biofuel made from sustainable sources with chemical properties similar to conventional jet fuel. Aircraft engines can use SAF blends without modification. Airbus states its planes can operate on up to 50 per cent SAF blend. Aviation experts estimate SAF will contribute over 60 per cent of the sector’s carbon reduction efforts globally. The move supports international commitments to curb emissions.

Regulatory Framework and Future Targets

India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee has set indicative SAF blending targets – 1 per cent in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028 for international flights. Domestic flight mandates are expected after 2027. These targets align with the global CORSIA framework, which requires airlines to offset carbon emissions growth beyond 2020 levels from 2027 onwards. The government is cautious about earlier mandates due to SAF’s higher costs and airline concerns.

Cost and Production Pathways

Currently, SAF costs roughly three times more than conventional jet fuel. IOC is exploring multiple production methods, including the alcohol-to-jet pathway using ethanol. Other Indian companies are developing SAF units based on various technologies. All must obtain certification before commercial operation. The higher cost remains a key barrier but is expected to decline with scale and innovation.

Global Market and Export Potential

Europe’s established SAF blending mandates make European airlines potential buyers of IOC’s SAF when flying into India. The global demand for SAF is projected to rise sharply in the coming years. IOC is actively exploring export opportunities to meet this growing market. The year 2027 is critical as CORSIA’s mandatory phase begins, increasing pressure on airlines worldwide to adopt SAF.",https://i0.wp.com/www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/logopeg.jpg?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-19 03:56:15.330927

Mains: Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Advantages & Challenges.

India's first Sustainable Aviation Fuel Plant

IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil by the end of 2025.

Feedstock: The used cooking oil will be sourced by engaging aggregators from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors, which is otherwise discarded after use.

The capacity (35,000 tonnes per year) will be sufficient to meet the country’s 1% SAF blending requirement (for international flights) by 2027.

IOC has become the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana.

ISCC CORSIA Certification System:

ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production.

The certification sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

About Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks. SAF has chemistry and properties similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel (derived from crude oil) but with a smaller carbon footprint.

It can be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.

Sources of SAF:

Oil seeds, other fats, oils, and greases

Agricultural residues, Forestry residues, Wood mill waste

Municipal solid waste streams, Wet wastes (manures, wastewater treatment sludge)

It can also be produced synthetically via a process that captures carbon directly from the air.

Advantages of SAF:

Engine compatibility: Existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend (up to 50% blend) without modification.

Fewer greenhouse gas emissions: It is estimated that SAF alone is likely to account for over 60% of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

Sustainable: Raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, or is responsible for forest degradation.

More flexibility: SAF is a replacement for conventional jet fuel, allowing for multiple products from various feedstocks and production technologies.

Challenges Associated with SAF:

SAF is about three-four times more expensive than the price of regular jet fuel.

SAF success will require using a greater diversity of feedstock and production methods.

Moreover, collection of SAF would be a challenge. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households.

Key Facts:

International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) is dedicated to reducing carbon emissions from international civil aviation.

To mitigate the environmental impact of aviation, ICAO has set several aspirational goals:

Two Percent Annual Fuel Efficiency Improvement: Targeted through 2050.

Carbon Neutral Growth: Striving for no net increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from international aviation.

Net Zero CO2 Emissions from aviation by 2050.

These goals are encompassed under two major initiatives: Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the Long-Term Aspirational Goals (LTAG).

CORSIA Implementation Phases:

CORSIA will be implemented in three phases:

Pilot Phase (2021-2023): Voluntary participation by States.

First Phase (2024-2026): Also voluntary, but with expanded participation.

Second Phase (2027 onwards): Mandatory for all ICAO member states, including India.

India’s indicative blending Target for SAF:

In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are:

1% SAF indicative blending target in 2027 (Initially for International flights)

2% SAF blending target in 2028 (Initially for International flights)

5% by 2030.

The success of SAF will require using a greater diversity of feedstock and production methods. This includes areas such as investing in carbon offset programmes and the diversification of SAF feedstocks.

IOC is also working to set up units based on the alcohol-to-jet pathway, which involves using ethanol as a feedstock to make SAF.",https://i0.wp.com/compass.rauias.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/daily-current-affairs-64ec4be4a6652.webp,N,,2025-08-19 02:56:14.622432

Continued wrangling on biofuel policy

U.S. industry groups continue to spar with the Trump administration over a proposal to slash incentives for biofuel imports. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal, which could be finalized before the end of the year, would allocate half as many renewable fuel credits to imported biofuels and biofuel feedstocks as to domestic ones.

Livestock Tax Deferral regions announced for drought-affected producers

Cattle producers in large swaths of Western Canada and northwest Ontario will qualify for Livestock Tax Deferral in 2025, federal agriculture minister Heath MacDonald announced on Monday.

Effectively, U.S. biofuel plants using Canadian canola would earn 12 cents less per pound from fuel credits than if they used U.S. soybean oil, wrote FCC senior economist Justin Shepherd in an Aug. 13 report.

The American Petroleum Institute said in a letter to the EPA that the country lacks enough feedstock to meet federal quotas without imports.

“As proposed it is unworkable and would have significant harmful effects on the overall (Renewable Fuel Standard) program and could place upward pressure on fuel costs,” the institute said.

The institute also challenged the legality of the proposal.

U.S. producers, specifically soybean farmers, hailed the proposed shift as a victory, arguing the Renewable Fuel Standard was always intended to boost domestic production and that countries like China were flooding the market with cheap supply.

Canadian impacts

“Canada exports more vegetable oil – mainly canola – to the U.S. for biofuel production than it uses domestically,” Shepherd wrote.

Canada used a bit more than 1 million tonnes of vegetable oil for domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel, but exported 2.8 million tonnes to the U.S, he said.

The U.S. tax credit for biofuels has also shifted from being granted at the point of blending to a producer-based model. This changed excludes imported Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel.

“This adjustment may reduce opportunities for Canadian exports of these biofuels, leading domestically produced biodiesel and renewable diesel to seek alternative markets,” Shepherd said.

Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel output ramped up in 2024 as two new facilities came online, however the FCC report shows production dropped off as the new year began. It attributes this to uncertainty around the U.S. blender tax credit.

The EPA also announced higher-than-expected blending targets for 2026 and 2027, which boosted North American oilseed markets.

Hopeful signs?

“These considerations indicate that biodiesel and renewable diesel produced in Canada may face demand constraints,” wrote Shepherd.

However, the USDA projects that more than half of U.S.-produced soybean oil will be used for biofuels. This could send domestic and international buyers to Canadian vegetable oil as an alternative. Since canola oil is closely linked in price to soybean oil, it could see some market support.

Canadian oilseed producers could also see some opportunity down the line in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Sustainable aviation fuel production is produced via similar methods to renewable diesel and also typically uses vegetable oils as feedstocks.

“Canada does not have operational plants, though future development is anticipated,” Shepherd said.

The buyer, Conestoga Energy, will integrate SAFFiRE into its Kansas operations, where a pilot facility for the technology is expected to begin production in 2026. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

SAFFiRE holds an exclusive license for Deacetylation and Mechanical Refining, a process developed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab. The technology is designed to produce ethanol with an ultra-low carbon intensity for conversion into jet fuel. Under the agreement, Conestoga acquires all intellectual property, related technologies and the proposed pilot facility, along with key leadership staff including Chief Technology Officer Marykate O’Brien and Director of Engineering Nitin Kolhapure.

Conestoga CEO Tom Willis said the acquisition positions the company at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel development. “Sustainable aviation fuel represents a multibillion-dollar market opportunity, and this acquisition positions Conestoga at the leading edge of efforts to bridge the critical supply-demand gap facing the aviation industry while creating transformative opportunities for American agriculture,” Willis said.

Southwest originally invested in SAFFiRE in 2022 and took full ownership in 2024 through its renewable ventures platform. At the time, company leaders described the acquisition as central to its “Nonstop to Net Zero” sustainability plan. While Southwest did not comment on the reason for its divestment, the airline said it was proud to have supported SAFFiRE’s early-stage development and expressed confidence in Conestoga’s ability to advance the technology.

The transaction comes as the sustainable aviation fuel sector faces turbulence.

On World Biodiesel Day, a significant milestone was reached in sustainable fuel production by MOL Group. The company has successfully produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery. This achievement is part of a pilot project that also involves the generation of renewable diesel known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). This latest accomplishment is the second test of its kind for MOL Group, following an earlier successful pilot conducted at the Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These advancements underscore MOL Group’s technological capability and its dedication to alternative fuel solutions aimed at promoting environmental sustainability and energy security.

Collaboration at Rijeka Refinery

The pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was carried out in collaboration with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor for the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit. The project’s goal was to test the co-processing of 5% Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) along with traditional fossil feedstocks. A total of 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were utilized during this trial. An independent audit was conducted by Bureau Veritas d.o.o., which confirmed that the process met the parameters set by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard for sustainable biofuels.

Preparation and Testing Process

The preparations for the pilot project unfolded over a period of eight months, primarily due to the intricate nature of processing a novel type of feedstock alongside specific physical and chemical characteristics. Throughout the test runs, over 400 samples were diligently collected for analysis at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL). External laboratories, notably the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen, were also engaged to assess the biogenic content through a C14 analysis.

Further Developments at Bratislava Refinery

In a similar vein, earlier this year, the Bratislava Refinery achieved notable success with production tests involving diesel fuel infused with HVO and SAF. This HVO was derived from cashew nut shells, and in the SAF case, partially refined cooking oil was co-processed with conventional crude oil. These tests affirmed that the production unit at the Bratislava Refinery, dedicated to producing standard aviation kerosene, is also capable of manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel.

Innovative Co-Processing Method

Utilizing a co-processing method has been a common practice for MOL Group at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for several years. This method effectively reduces emissions associated with traditional fuels by blending plant waste products, where both bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously during production.

Strategic Commitment to Renewable Fuels

Renewable fuels play an essential part in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already recognized as a leader in biofuel markets in Hungary and the surrounding region, particularly for HVO produced from waste materials. This leadership is significant, as it meets the criteria for one of the most environmentally-friendly fuel options and positions MOL Group among the pioneers in aviation biofuel production in Europe.

MOL Group’s Vision for Sustainable Mobility

Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President for Fuels at MOL Group, emphasized that the company has been producing diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable sources and is poised to expand its production capabilities. This readiness and strategic commitment reaffirm MOL Group’s vision for sustainable mobility, whether for road transport or air travel. By becoming a comprehensive mobility service provider, the company can offer an even wider variety of fuels, fostering a seamless energy transition for customers.

Commercialization of SAF

MOL Group is actively involved in research and development, continuously exploring new possibilities for biofuel production and utilization. In 2022, in partnership with Budapest Airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Supply LLC, the company initialized commercial testing of SAF in Hungary. This initiative has led to the sale of SAF as a regular part of their operations in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, amounting to approximately 14 kilotons of biocomponents.

Technical and Environmental Standards

It is important to note that SAF can only be produced from traditional renewable feedstocks or from waste, complying with the same technical and environmental standards as conventional kerosene. Although very few refineries globally possess the capability to produce SAF, the current demand significantly surpasses supply, which reflects in the pricing dynamics. Thus, the ongoing developments by MOL Group hold strategic significance both for climate protection and the security of fuel supply.

Conclusion: A Step Towards Sustainable Logistics

MOL Group’s recent successful SAF and HVO production testing not only marks a crucial technological advancement but also signals an active commitment towards sustainable mobility. The emphasis on renewable fuels is vital, aligning with global energy trends and regulatory frameworks that prioritize reduced carbon footprints.

In the ever-evolving landscape of logistics, such advancements in fuel production resonate closely with modern transportation needs and environmental sustainability efforts.

Indian Oil Corp., the largest refiner in the country, is set to launch its first sustainable aviation fuel production facility by the end of the year.

Production capacity will be 35,000 tons annually, with the feedstocks coming from hotel chains, restaurants, and other large-scale users of cooking oil.

The main market for the product will be Europe, which has SAF blending mandates for airlines operating on its territory.

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from waste materials such as cooking oil and biomass, is believed to be a necessary element of the energy transition due to the amount of emissions from the aviation industry, which amount to 2.5 per cent of the global total emissions of carbon dioxide.

However, sustainable aviation fuels are expensive to produce, which has made their transformation into a mainstream blending component for jet fuel problematic.

The high costs are attributable to the complex process required to turn waste fats and oils into biofuel and to a more challenging problem: the lack of sufficient waste fats and oils.

Reuters recently published a detailed look into the present state of SAF production globally and its immediate outlook. The picture painted by that article was not an optimistic one.

A number of large air carriers made commitments to buy significant amounts of sustainable fuels from startup producers only to change their minds later, likely when they realised the bill they would be facing.",https://theelectricityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SAF-Chile-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 17:56:50.709073

After weeks of talks, the government said on Friday it would not be providing financial support for the bioethanol sector, which is facing increased competition from imported US ethanol.

Vivergo, owned by Associated British Foods, said that would have meant continuing as a ""heavily loss-making"" business. As a result it is closing, with all staff due to be gone and the site ready for demolition by end of the year.

The government said it had decided a rescue would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry's long-term problems.

Bioethanol, can be made from waste oil or grains and is used as an additive to fuels, to reduce climate-damaging emissions. For example it is added to E5 and E10 petrol and sustainable aviation fuel.

In May the UK signed a trade deal which removed 19% tariffs on US-imported ethanol up to a quota of 1.4bn, roughly eqivalent to the size of the UK market.

It was one of the concessions made by the UK as part of a broader trade pact, that eased the tariffs that President Donald Trump had said he would impose on UK car and steel being imported across the Atlantic to the US.

Even before that trade agreement, the UK sector had complained that US imports had an unfair financial advantage as their ethanol is certified as a waste byproduct in the UK, whereas domestically-produced bioethanol is not.

Vivergo is one of two bioethanol sites in the UK which has said without support it will be forced to close.

The BBC understands that the other plant in Redcar, Teesside, which is owned by German firm Ensus, is waiting to hear whether the government will provide support to protect its CO2 production, a product widely used in industry, food production and healthcare.

Vivergo had also been planning to start capturing CO2 produced as part of the bioethanol making process, but had not yet started.

Ben Hackett, Vivergo's managing director described the government's decision not to provide a rescue package as a ""massive blow to Hull and the Humber"".

He said the government had decided the bioethanol sector was something that could be ""traded away"" and that it amounted to a ""flagrant act of economic self-harm"".

As well as the loss of its own staff, Vivergo warned there would be a knock-on effect on suppliers and customers. It would be hard for UK farmers to find alternative customers for wheat which is not food-grade, Mr Hackett said.

Andrew Symes, the chief executive of OXCCU, which makes sustainable aviation fuel, told the BBC's Today programme that the closure would make the UK reliant on imports for CO2 and for ethanol, which he described as ""risky"".

""I think that was probably what wasn't realised when the trade deal was done,"" he said.

The government said it had taken the decision ""in the national interest"" and that the tariff deal with the US had protected ""hundreds of thousands of jobs in sectors like auto and aerospace"".

A government spokesperson said it would work to support the companies through the closure process and that it was continuing to work on proposals that would ""ensure the resilience of our CO2 supply in the long-term"".

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, GMB National Officer, said the government's commitment to green policies should mean a commitment to green jobs.

""A clean energy industrial strategy means nothing if we cannot protects plants long enough to deliver clean energy jobs here in the UK,"" she said.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2dde/live/deacf570-7c45-11f0-b34b-3f615028e3e9.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 11:56:07.882029

BirdLife International reports that the illegal wildlife trade brings in between $7 and $23 billion.
The trade has become so commonplace that complete smuggling networks exist that routinely source, transport, and launder illegally taken birds using fictitious documentation.
Ecological implications The extraction of wild birds as a class from their ecological niche can have very detrimental effects.
International responsibility The illegal wildlife trade is a cross-border crime that requires cross-border cooperation.","Nigeria’s customs agency caught more than 1,600 parrots and canaries headed to Kuwait. Officials call this the country’s ‘largest’ wildlife-trafficking bust by number.

The shipment was seized at Lagos’ Murtala Muhammed International Airport. This incident is indicative of a broader, ongoing issue – Nigeria as a source and transit point for illegal wildlife trade, which treaties such as CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) attempts to combat.

However, poor enforcement capability and scant border security allow wildlife traffickers to engage in business unhindered. Borders remain porous due to a lack of resources.

BirdLife International reports that the illegal wildlife trade brings in between $7 and $23 billion. This makes it the 4th most profitable cross-border crime right behind drugs, weapons, and human trafficking.

Singing competitions popular in some Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian regions have boosted the demand for songbirds like canaries. Rare parrots, some critically endangered, can exceed $1,000 per bird in global markets.

There is appeal beyond aesthetics. Some buyers desire rare feathers for fashion or home decoration. Others keep birds as status symbols. The trade has become so commonplace that complete smuggling networks exist that routinely source, transport, and launder illegally taken birds using fictitious documentation.

Ecological implications

The extraction of wild birds as a class from their ecological niche can have very detrimental effects. Parrots and other seed dispersers are extremely important in maintaining healthy ecosystems, in regenerating forests, and determining insect populations. Over-extraction is an all too real problem and has adverse effects by degrading habitats and diminishing biodiversity.

For species likely already facing pressures from deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and climate change, wildlife trafficking adds pressure to already limited populations and pushes species closer to extinction. Many parrot species in West Africa, including the African grey, have seen their wild populations drop by over 90% in some regions due to traps set up just for the wildlife trade.

This latest seizure marks a big win for Nigerian customs, but experts note that such captures are too infrequent. Nigeria plays a key role for smuggling networks because it directly links to other areas.

Animals trafficked out of Nigeria typically go first to a Middle Eastern or Asian countries before their final destination. Wildlife experts warn that unless funding continues and more severe consequences are established for traffickers, no real dent will be made in the illicit trade.

International responsibility

The illegal wildlife trade is a cross-border crime that requires cross-border cooperation. Supply countries are not the only ones that should have a shared accountability for their encroachment, and demand countries also need to be doing their share to help mitigate this trade.

If the consumer market for exotic pets and status-symbol animals continues to thrive, enforcement actions in the supply country will likely be of little effect.

Some conservation groups have called for more public awareness campaigns in nations that serve as a regular destination, in conjunction with stricter monitoring of captive-breeding claims, which is a frequent loophole in laundering wild-caught birds as ‘bred in captivity.’

For now, the fate of the birds will remain uncertain. Rehab and release is a huge challenge when the animals are not injured or stressed by the transport. As it stands, wildlife rescue centers in Nigeria are always underfunded and understaffed.

This crackdown underscores how big, lucrative, and complex wildlife trafficking is and serves as a reminder that there is a collective responsibility for all to be custodians for animals. They’re not commodities to be bought and sold, key players in our ecological web that sustains all life on Earth.",https://thred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/parrots-wildlifeSOS.png,N,,2025-08-18 14:56:58.834110

Discussing his work at United, Tom explains, “I feel a tremendous sense of pride working for United and playing a part in everything that we do to unite the world. The ability to board one of the most complex pieces of machinery created by man, fly at a speed of 500 mph at 37,000 ft and land safely at our destination is proof the system we have built is robust and healthy.”

Tom’s colleague Ken Allen of United Airlines says, “Whether it is upholding quality and mitigating risk in maintenance operations or establishing the operational protocol and viability for introducing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Tom is ready for the challenge. Tom’s approach to anything quality or compliance is not How can I make this better? but rather How do we make this better?”

This collaborative attitude shines through in Greif’s sentiments, such as his hopes for the future of aircraft maintenance.

Greif says, “We need to continue to foster a culture of industry-wide collaboration to evolve our safety and quality practices. We should never compete on safety nor rest in the pursuit of quality excellence.”

When asked about the accomplishment he’s most proud of, Greif answers, “The most notable accomplishment was leading United’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) quality initiatives which resulted in (United being) the first domestic airline to use SAF for regularly scheduled flights, first to complete the longest trans-Atlantic flight powered by SAF and first to complete a domestic flight powered by 100% SAF.”

Allen praises Greif for this achievement, He remains an industry go-to person in this space.”

Greif also offers advice to new professionals entering the aviation industry for the first time. He says, “Commercial aviation was built upon the shoulders of giants, and we have a responsibility to maintain those traditions but continue to evolve for the future. This industry has always been about building and maintaining relationships.”

Greif concludes, “If you are fortunate to have strong mentors early in your career, pay it forward later by mentoring new and upcoming leaders. Operate every day with a sense of pride, ownership and accountability.”","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/07/686fd123521e9e86a9e4e947-picture_1.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-18 11:56:13.108102

“We would be (producing) enough SAF to meet country’s demand. As of now, there is no mandate on SAF blending (in India). We can export too,” said IOC chairman Sahney. Indian Oil also plans to export the green aviation fuel and has said that the overseas demand is currently stronger than domestic.

SAF, or bio-jet fuel, is a low-carbon fuel used in aircraft and made from non-petroleum products such as ethanol, which results in lower emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. The blending of SAF with aviation turbine fuel (ATF) has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel.

India is yet to set rigorous SAF blending targets, but mandates are expected for one percent SAF blending with ATF for Indian airlines beginning 2027. For one percent blending of SAF in jet fuel, India would require around 140 million litres of SAF every year.

Indian Oil has already received ISCC CORSIA (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) mandate for SAF production, emerging as the only Indian company with the certification, which is mandatory for commercial SAF production.

As India aims to achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2070, the government has been focusing on shifting towards a greener economy, and the adoption of SAF is seen as a move in that direction. Globally, the aviation sector contributes around 12 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from transportation, and SAF is expected to help reduce this emission.

Through the SAF initiative, India is looking to boost the rural economy and help farmers increase their income. According to an estimate, just by one percent SAF blending, more than five lakh farmers could benefit from the supply of sugarcane as feedstock. The move promises to create over one lakh green jobs.

The government has already set the target of achieving 20 percent ethanol blending with petrol by October 2025.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2020/09/indian-oil-ioc.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 11:56:19.525730

What’s the ongoing story: Kerala’s health department has sounded an alert in Kozhikode district after three back to back cases of the rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) were reported in the region. One of the victims, a nine-year-old girl, died and two others, including a three-month-old baby, are battling for their lives.

Key Points to Ponder:

Story continues below this ad

— What is Naegleria fowleri or ‘brain-eating amoeba’ (rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) ?

— In which season is PAM more likely to occur?

— How does Naegleria fowleri infect people?

— What are the symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis?

— Read about the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).

— What steps should we take to stop the spread of PAM?

Key Takeaways:

— Amoebic meningoencephalitis is caused by Naegleria fowleri, known as the “brain eating amoeba”. It is a free-living amoeba found in warm, fresh water and soil, and infects people when it enters the body through the nose. This year, Kerala had eight confirmed cases and two deaths, including the one reported in Thamarassery in Kozhikode on August 14.

— Health department officials said there is no common factor among the three cases, which were reported from different villages in the district.

— Sources said that when molecular diagnosis of meningoencephalitis was done, it was understood that apart from naegleria fowleri, another genus, acanthamoeba, also causes the illness.

— The first case of PAM in India was reported in 1971, and the first case in Kerala was reported in 2016. From 2016 to 2023, the state had only eight cases. Last year, Kerala had 36 positive cases and nine deaths.

— If the fatality of the disease is 97 per cent globally, Kerala has been able to bring it down to 25 per cent. All reported cases in India had led to the patient’s death until July 2024, when a 14-year-old boy in Kozhikode district became the first Indian to survive the disease. He was only the 11th PAM survivor in the world.

— One of the reasons for the spike in cases in Kerala has been increased testing for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) – a condition that can be caused by various diseases including amoebic meningoencephalitis – as well as other factors such as climate change and environmental pollution. Last year when Kerala faced a sudden spike in cases, the state issued a special treatment protocol and a standard operating procedure for the management of amoebic meningoencephalitis cases – the first state in India to do so.

— The initial symptoms of PAM include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Later on, the patient may experience a stiff neck, confusion, seizures, hallucinations, and slip into a coma.

— Scientists have not yet identified any effective treatments for the disease. Currently, doctors use a combination of drugs, including amphotericin B, azithromycin, fluconazole, rifampin, miltefosine, and dexamethasone for treatment.

— According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the rising global temperatures, the chances of getting Naegleria fowleri infection will go up as the amoeba mainly thrives in warm freshwater bodies. The organism best grows in high temperatures up to 46°C and sometimes can survive at even higher temperatures.

Govt plan for an animal blood bank network

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national importance.

Story continues below this ad

Mains Examination: General Studies-II: Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation.

What’s the ongoing story: The Union government is working on ways to facilitate and standardise blood banking and blood transfusion in veterinary care.

Key Points to Ponder:

— Why are blood banks for animals required in India?

— What role does the livestock and companion animal sector play in the Indian economy?

— What are the major challenges in veterinary blood transfusion practices in India?

Story continues below this ad

— Know the key features of the draft SOP for veterinary blood banks.

— What are the challenges associated with the storage of animal blood?

— What services will be provided by the National Veterinary Blood Bank Network (N-VBBN)?

Key Takeaways:

— The Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying invited comments from experts, institutions, and the public on draft “Guidelines/ Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Blood Transfusion & Blood Bank for Animals in India” that it prepared last month.

Story continues below this ad

— India is home to a very large livestock population of 536.76 million, according to the 20th Livestock Census conducted in 2019, and is also seeing a boom in the practice of keeping pets or companion animals.

— Livestock include cattle, buffalo, goats, and sheep, as well as animals such as horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, camels, and pigs. India has the world’s largest population of cattle and buffalo, and the second-largest population of goats. The population of companion animals is estimated at 125 million, according to the draft guidelines.

— The livestock and companion animal sector plays a pivotal role in the country’s agricultural economy and rural livelihoods. The animal husbandry and dairying sector contributes about 30 per cent of the agricultural GVA and 5.5 per cent of the national economy.

— Given this context, there is an urgent need to formalise critical and emergency veterinary care services, including blood transfusion support across species, the draft says. Blood transfusion, it says, is “increasingly recognized globally as a life-saving intervention, essential for managing trauma, severe anemia, surgical blood loss, infectious diseases, and coagulation disorders”.

Story continues below this ad

— India, the draft notes, “lacks a national regulatory framework and standardized protocols guiding veterinary transfusion medicine with structured blood banking and transfusion practices”. Most animal blood transfusions are dependent on “hospital-available or client-owned donors, without consistent screening, blood typing, or standard operating protocols”.

— According to the government, the SOPs will address this situation “by providing structured, ethical, and scientifically sound guidance on donor selection, blood collection, processing, storage, transfusion procedures, and safety monitoring”.

— The veterinary blood banks will be hosted at veterinary colleges and universities, referral hospitals and polyclinics, large veterinary diagnostic centres, and multi-speciality animal hospitals operated by the government. The veterinary blood banks will function round the clock, according to the draft.

— Notably, the draft document prohibits monetary incentives to pet owners or livestock owners for the donation of the animal blood.

Do You Know:

— The volume of blood in both humans and animals ranges between 7 per cent and 9 per cent of body weight. Transfusion is required when the volume of blood falls below this level.

— Cattle have 55 ml of blood per kg of their body weight, and at an average weight of 300 kg, each head of cattle carries 16.5 litres of blood.

— Like humans, there are a large number of blood groups in animals, produced by species-specific antigens on the cell membrane of their red blood cells. There are 11 blood groups in cattle, 9 in dogs, 8 in horses, and 4 in cats, according to the draft guidelines.

India’s S&P rating upgrade

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national importance, Economic development.

Mains Examination: General Studies-III: Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilisation, of resources, growth, development and employment.

What’s the ongoing story: Last week was turning out to be a great one for the Indian economy even before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a raft of reforms in his Independence Day speech. A day earlier, S&P Global Ratings had upgraded its rating on India to BBB from BBB-.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What is the Sovereign Credit Rating System?

— What are the credit rating agencies in India?

— Who regulates credit rating agencies in India?

— Read about the S&P rating.

— What is the significance of rating upgrade on India by S&P?

— What can be the implications of better rating by S&P for India?

— What are the reasons behind India’s improved S&P rating?

— Know about the SEBI (Credit Rating Agencies) Regulations, 1999.

— Read about the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

Key Takeaways:

— The sovereign rating upgrade by S&P is significant for two key reasons. One, it came after a gap of nearly two decades; and two, it has meaningful implications for the Indian economy.

— The Indian government has over the last several years aggressively pursued the three global agencies — S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings — for higher ratings that, in its opinion, better reflect the economy’s fundamentals. In fact, New Delhi has repeatedly expressed its displeasure over the agencies’ methodologies, saying they were biased against emerging economies. So, what has convinced S&P that now is a good time for India to be given an upgrade?

— The primary reason is clarity on the government’s finances. While the Centre has had a law called the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act since 2003 — it demands reducing the annual fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP — it has rarely been met.

— However, post the coronavirus pandemic, the fiscal deficit has been reduced aggressively from 9.2 per cent in 2020-21 to a targeted 4.4 per cent in 2025-26. Going forward, the Centre will start targeting a reduction in its debt-to-GDP from 57.1 per cent in 2024-25 to 49-51 per cent by 2030-31.

— Then there is growth. Despite GDP growth falling to a four-year low of 6.5 per cent in 2024-25, India remains one of the fastest growing large economies in the world — or in S&P’s words, “among the best performing economies in the world”. And this is real, or inflation-adjusted, growth; nominal growth — which is the actual increase in the GDP in today’s prices — is even higher.

— Another key factor has been the fairly low and stable domestic inflation, with S&P praising the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation management record.

— To be sure, India’s rating level with S&P has itself not changed — the country remains in the BBB category. It’s just that it has gone from the lowest edge of it, or BBB-, to a more secure position. The next step would be BBB+.

— Ratings are divided into two rough classes: investment and speculative grades. Entities, including countries, in the former class are worth investing in, while repayment of loans taken by those in the latter is difficult to predict. But even within the investment grade, there are steps, and BBB is the lowest.

— According to S&P, a BBB rating indicates “adequate capacity to meet financial commitments, but more subject to adverse economic conditions”. The next step is A, then AA, and finally, AAA, which signifies “extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments”.

– The implications of a better credit rating are clear — the Indian government should be able to borrow at a lower rate of interest. This has already occurred, with government bond yields in the secondary market on August 14 falling as much as 10 basis points, with the rupee’s exchange rate also getting a boost.

Do You Know:

— A credit rating is nothing more than a measure of an entity’s creditworthiness, or how likely it is that they may pay back borrowed money. If you pay back your loans and credit card bills on time and in full, your credit score improves. It is the same for countries.

— Most countries need to borrow money every year to fund some of their expenditures. The difference between the total income and the expenditure for a year is the fiscal deficit; the Indian government’s is Rs 15.69 lakh crore for 2025-26. This has to be met by borrowing money from the markets, with the government paying interest on it. Now, if the government is seen as being more likely to repay the loan — which is what a higher credit rating indicates — then the rate of interest is lower.

India’s first sustainable aviation fuel plant to start production by year-end

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national importance.

Mains Examination: General Studies-III: ScienceandTechnology- developments and their applications and effects in everyday life, Environmental pollution and degradation.

What’s the ongoing story: The country’s largest refiner and fuel retailer Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) expects to start producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on commercial scale at its Panipat refinery by December, following the recent international certification received by the unit for manufacturing the biofuel from used cooking oil, according to energy major’s chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney.

Key Points to Ponder:

— What is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?

— How is SAF different from conventional aviation fuel?

— What is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)?

— What are the key environmental benefits of adopting SAF in the aviation sector?

— Why is SAF referred to as a “drop-in” fuel?

— What are the primary feedstocks used in SAF production? How can India leverage its agricultural and waste resources to become a global exporter of SAF?

— How has India positioned itself in the global SAF landscape, and what are its national blending targets?

— What are the major global initiatives for promoting SAF adoption?

Key Takeaways:

— By the end of this calendar year, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil, which will be sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors like Haldiram’s, which normally discard cooking oil after single use.

— Earlier this week, IOC became the first company in India to receive the ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana.

— ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production. According to IOC, the certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production.

— SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend.

— The year 2027 will be an important one for adoption of SAF globally with the mandatory phase of CORSIA kicking in. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

— India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards.

The next leap forward

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national importance, economic and social development.

Mains Examination: General Studies-II, III: Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation, Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilisation of resources, growth, development and employment.

What’s the ongoing story: Ashok Gulati and Ritika Juneja write- “As the Tricolour was unfurled on India’s 79th Independence Day, the country stood proudly as a confident, resilient, and rising nation. It is not just the world’s largest democracy, but a country that has successfully crafted its destiny since attaining independence in 1947.”

Key Points to Ponder:

— As India has become the world’s fourth-largest economy in nominal terms and third-largest in PPP terms, what is the significance of this achievement?

— What are the challenges that remain for inclusive growth?

— Why do the issues of nutritional security still persist in India?

— Why is rationalising food and fertiliser subsidies the need of the hour?

— What measures should be taken to ensure efficiency and equity of subsidies?

— Why are increasing investments in agri-R&D and efficient value chains important?

Key Takeaways:

— “Just look at the last decade, India’s GDP has more than doubled. It is projected to reach $4.19 trillion by 2025, making India the fourth-largest economy, behind the United States ($30.5 trillion), China ($19.2 trillion), and Germany ($4.74 trillion) (IMF estimates).”

— “Measured in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, India is already the world’s third-largest economy at $17.65 trillion, trailing only China ($40.72 trillion) and the US ($30.51 trillion) in 2025. All this is a reflection of rising aspirations and India’s strong resolve to regain its civilisational legacy.”

— “When India gained independence in 1947, its GDP was around $30 billion. The population stood at 330 million, with an estimated 80 per cent living in poverty. The average life expectancy was a mere 32 years (1947), and literacy levels were just 18.3 per cent (1951). Foodgrain production stood at about 50 million metric tonnes (MMT).”

— “Fast forward to 2025: India’s population has increased to 1.46 billion, but poverty, measured at the $3/day (2021 PPP) threshold, has fallen to just 5.3 per cent, as per World Bank estimates. Literacy has surged to 77 per cent, while life expectancy has more than doubled to 72 years (2023). Foodgrain production has multiplied sevenfold, reaching 353.9 MMT in 2024-25. India is now the world’s largest rice exporter, shipping 20.2 MMT in FY25…India is a net exporter of agriculture, unlike the US and China, which are both net importers of agriculture. These are not mere statistics; they narrate the story of a country in motion.”

— “However, even as India has achieved food security, there are still many challenges: Nutritional security, especially of children under the age of five, remains pressing. This calls for a sharper focus on women’s education, improved maternal health, and continued emphasis on sanitation. The Modi government deserves compliments for making India open defecation free (ODF), which will help improve child nutrition.”

— “In the agri-food space, however, much more can be done. In particular, rationalising food and fertiliser subsidies needs to be put on high priority…While these subsidies are meant to shield vulnerable populations, they are plagued by large inefficiencies.”

— “Studies suggest that at least 20 to 25 per cent of these subsidies fail to reach intended beneficiaries. Though politically tempting, these subsidies come at the cost of productive investments.”

— “The next leap forward has to be rationalising subsidies and increasing investments in agri-R&D and efficient value chains. India’s future lies in empowering its citizens to innovate, invest, and generate sustainable incomes. Environmental sustainability has to be central to this journey. The quality of India’s soil, water, and air needs to be protected to attain the Viksit Bharat vision by 2047.

Stress tests for nuclear taboo

Syllabus:

Preliminary Examination: Current events of national and international importance

Mains Examination: General Studies-II: Important International institutions, agencies and fora- their structure, mandate

What’s the ongoing story: C. Uday Bhaskar writes- “The bombing of Hiroshima with an atomic weapon on August 6, 1945, that killed almost 1,40,000 people and led to the end of World War II is a pivotal event in global history. It marked the dawn of the apocalyptic atomic age, wherein nuclear weapons demonstrated their enormous destructive capability — first in Hiroshima and three days later over Nagasaki. Progressively, a norm was internalised globally that Nagasaki would be the last time that a nuclear weapon would be used militarily. And so, the nuclear taboo was born.”

Key Points to Ponder:

— How did the bombing of Hiroshima also mark the start of a new way of thinking about war, peace, and the use of force?

— What was the Cuban missile crisis?

— What is the doctrine of MAD — mutually assured destruction?

— What is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)?

— Is India part of the NPT? What is the purpose of the NPT?

— What is India’s Nuclear doctrine?

— India’s nuclear power programme

— Read about the Helsinki Accords.

Key Takeaways:

— “It is a matter of considerable relief that the nuclear-weapon nations of the world have so far respected the sanctity of the nuclear taboo. But the run-up to the 80th anniversary suggests that the taboo is under stress in a very unexpected manner. The recent war of words between the US and Russia, laced with menacing references to nuclear weapons, is cause for deep concern and augurs ill for global nuclear stability and restraint.”

— “The US and Russia (which inherited the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union) were the two superpowers of the Cold War decades and had amassed thousands of nuclear weapons of varying yields. After the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis that saw these two nations stepping back from the precipice, they arrived at a modus vivendi that neither nation would use the dreaded nuke except to “deter” the other. Thus was born the deterrence doctrine of MAD — mutually assured destruction — an anomalous form of ensuring “security” in a SAD manner: Self-assured destruction.

— “To regulate the spread of nuclear weapons, the two superpowers introduced the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) in 1970, and while this had no legitimacy in law, it was a de facto imposition of realpolitik and techno-strategic power. The world was divided into the nuclear haves — the first five nuclear weapon powers (US, USSR/Russia, UK, France, and China) — and the permanent nuclear have-nots, who were compelled to forego the option of ever acquiring nuclear weapons.”

— “The quid pro quo was that the latter, the NNWS (non-nuclear weapon states), would have access to civilian nuclear technology, and they would not be threatened by an NWS (nuclear weapon state). Concurrently, the NWS agreed to “negotiate in good faith” towards disarmament — this remains the elusive Holy Grail.”

– “In summary, the world had evolved two norms to ensure the sanctity of the nuclear taboo. One, that nuclear weapons would not be brandished to resolve territorial disputes (Pakistan was rebuked for its attempt to do so in the 1999 Kargil War), and secondly, the sovereignty of a NNWS would not be violated without legitimate sanction.”

— “There was no sabre-rattling for almost three decades, from 1991 till 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine and Moscow found it necessary to invoke its nuclear capability.”

— “This was a major setback to the deterrence template and agreements such as the 1975 Helsinki Accords that sanctified the inviolability of borders in Europe. This was compounded in June 2025 when Israel, not an NPT signatory, attacked Iran, a NNWS, on the assumption that Tehran was about to acquire a nuclear weapon in violation of its NPT commitment.”

— “The more alarming exigency is a breakdown in US-Russia relations and an unintended military escalation. While the probability is low, it merits notice that both nations possess the world’s largest nuclear arsenals — Russia with 5,459 warheads and the US with 5,177 (Federation of American Scientists’ 2025 report on the Status of the World’s Nuclear Forces).”

— “Even a limited exchange could cause catastrophic loss of life. A 2019 Princeton University simulation estimated 91.5 million casualties in the first few hours of a US-Russia nuclear war, with long-term effects like radioactive fallout and global cooling adding to the atomic apocalypse.”

Do You Know:

— The NPT is an international treaty whose objective is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to foster the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and to further the goal of disarmament.

— In 1968, the NPT came into existence. The treaty defines nuclear-weapon states as those that have built and tested a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967 – the US, Russia (formerly USSR), the UK, France and China – and effectively disallows any other state from acquiring nuclear weapons.

— While the treaty has been signed by almost every country in the world, India is one of the few non-signatories.

,,2025-08-18 12:37:20+00:00,www.argusmedia.com,US refiners ready for heavy crude return | Latest Market News - Argus Media,Argus Media,,,,,https://www.argusmedia.com/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2722191-us-refiners-ready-for-heavy-crude-return,"US refiners are expecting a boost from returning medium and heavy crude supplies from Canada, Venezuela and the Opec+ group of countries.
This means the group will have restored all of a scheduled 2.46mn b/d increase in six months.
Forward markets show heavy crude at a $9-10/bl discount to light crude in the third quarter and a $13/bl discount in the fourth quarter, he says.
There is potential for that heavy crude discount to get even larger sometime in 2026, Ledbetter says.
Marathon is also looking forward to having access to more heavy crude produced in California because of the upcoming closures of two large refineries in the state, Hessling says.","US refiners are expecting a boost from returning medium and heavy crude supplies from Canada, Venezuela and the Opec+ group of countries.

About 2mn-2.5mn b/d of medium and heavy crude should be returning to the market in the autumn, coinciding with seasonal refinery maintenance, US independent PBF Energy chief executive Matthew Lucey says. This will cause light-heavy spreads to widen in the third and fourth quarters, he says. Additional supplies will be ""a huge tailwind going forward"" for PBF by lowering the cost of feedstocks, which has ""a dollar-for-dollar impact"" on the company's bottom line, Lucey says.

US sanctions against Venezuela pulled about 200,000 b/d out of the US Gulf coast market and Canadian wildfires took about 5mn bl of June supply off the market, Valero's chief operating officer Gary Simmons says. ""Things will get better,"" probably starting in the fourth quarter, he says.

Marathon Petroleum chief commercial officer Rick Hessling says that he sees ""positive trends"" in Canadian oil for his company's refineries that consume large amounts of heavy and medium crude. These include less competition for supply because of turnarounds at the US Gulf coast in the autumn. ""The signals and the differentials are already beginning to change,"" he says. Mars and WCS crudes have fallen by $0.70-1.00/bl against benchmark WTI prices since late July (see graph).

Meanwhile, Chevron-linked oil tankers have converged on Venezuela's main terminals. One is already carrying a cargo of Boscan crude from Bajo Grande and another Hamaca crude from the Jose terminal. The movements suggest Chevron has resumed loading Venezuelan crude for export in August under its restricted US licence. Chevron said previously that it expects limited oil flows to resume from Venezuela to the US this month after the administration of President Donald Trump reversed course on an earlier decision to cancel its licence to operate.

Re-engagement rings

In another supply boost, eight predominantly sour crude producers in Opec+ will raise their collective production target by 547,000 b/d in September, matching an increase in August. This means the group will have restored all of a scheduled 2.46mn b/d increase in six months. US refiners have not seen that much of this rise in Opec+ production so far because of higher oil burn at power stations in the Mideast Gulf in the summer, Simmons says. ""As we move out of summer, more of those barrels will make their way to the market,"" he says. Valero has recently ""re-engaged"" with historic partners in the Middle East, Simmons says, suggesting to him that Opec's Mideast Gulf members plan to sell more crude to the US.

HF Sinclair commercial vice-president Steven Ledbetter agrees that higher Opec+ production is not yet having an impact on light-heavy crude spreads in the US market. But it will in the longer term, together with Canadian production exceeding pipeline export capacity, he says. Forward markets show heavy crude at a $9-10/bl discount to light crude in the third quarter and a $13/bl discount in the fourth quarter, he says. There is potential for that heavy crude discount to get even larger sometime in 2026, Ledbetter says.

Marathon is also looking forward to having access to more heavy crude produced in California because of the upcoming closures of two large refineries in the state, Hessling says. The firm's 365,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery ""will have access to a lot of local California crudes"" to which it currently has limited or no access, he says. Valero is planning to shut or repurpose its 145,000 b/d Benicia refinery near San Francisco by April and Phillips 66 plans to shut its 139,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery complex by the end of this year.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-08-18 09:56:47.380777

The global aviation industry continues to make significant progress toward achieving the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation's net-zero target, driven by efforts to reduce carbon intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. In parallel, the US, at both federal and state levels, has introduced various incentives to support the growth of low-carbon fuels, including SAF, contributing to a steady rise in production and consumption.

Following extensive feedback from market participants, Platts identified a clear demand for transparent, market-based SAF assessments. Additionally, stakeholders, particularly airlines and aviation fuel buyers, have expressed the need for assessments that reflect the market value of SAF, independent of environmental credits such as Renewable Identification Numbers, Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits and 45Z tax credits.

Platts has therefore launched four SAF assessments that exclude environmental credits, in response to market feedback that the value of SAF with credits detached is a more widely used price reference, particularly among airlines seeking clarity on the intrinsic value of SAF itself.

The new assessments have the following specifications:

SAF (H-S) California (credits detached)

The California neat SAF (HEFA-SPK) assessment is published as an outright price in US cents/gallon, as well as a premium to the Platts Jet Kero LA pipeline (PJAAP00) assessment. The assessments are exclusive of the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard carbon credit, federal SAF tax credit and D4 biomass-based diesel Renewable Identification Number. This is assessed on a delivered at place basis and reflects SAF delivered via rail car or barge to Los Angeles. Neat SAF delivered to other locations within California, such as San Francisco, is also considered, but may be normalized back to the basis location.

SAF (H-S) Illinois (credits detached)

The Illinois neat SAF (HEFA-SPK) assessment is published as an outright price in US cents/gallon, as well as a premium to the Platts Jet Kero Chicago pipeline (PJAAF00) assessment. The assessment excludes the Illinois SAF tax credit, federal SAF tax credit and D4 biomass-based diesel RINs. It is assessed on a DAP basis and reflects SAF delivered via rail car or barge to the Chicago area.

Both assessments reflect delivery five to 25 days forward.

The assessments reflect a minimum volume of 1,000 barrels, meeting the ASTM D7566 standard specification for Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (SPK-HEFA), as referenced in Annex A2, using feedstocks such as vegetable oils, waste oils, fats, tallow and other similar feedstocks. Platts is not considering SAF produced from palm oil or palm fatty acid distillate within the assessment. The values reflect a reference carbon intensity of 42gCO2e/MJ.

The assessments consider information reported to Platts and published as heards throughout the day, including firm bids and offers, trades and indicative values, as well as any other data deemed relevant to the assessment process.

The assessments reflect a 13:30 Houston time market close and follow the Platts US publishing schedule.

“It is ultimately up to our investment managers to decide whether to allocate to these companies,” says Marcel Roberts, CIO of SPMS.
At the moment, SPMS invests in eight oil and gas companies, including Shell, Total and Eni.","The Dutch pension fund for self-employed medical specialists (SPMS) will only invest in oil and gas companies that want to commit to the goals of the Paris Agreement or commit at least 20% of their annual capital expenditure to renewable energy projects, according to the fund’s annual report.

The new policy follows from a survey among participants about their sustainability preferences.

This showed that only a minority of 22% want to exclude fossil fuels altogether. However, 62% want their pension to invest sustainably, the survey showed.

A majority of active members also expect SPMS to assume “a leading role” when it comes to sustainable investments. This is not the case for pensioners, who are less ambitious in this regard.

Climate benchmarks

The new fossil fuel policy only applies to the pension fund’s actively managed equity portfolios for European equities and emerging market equities, as well as to European and US corporate bonds.

This is because SPMS considers that the new policy would “interfere” with the climate transition benchmark it has been running for its passively managed equity portfolios (developed market equities excluding European equities) since 2022, implementing an annual CO2 reduction of 7%.

Climate transition benchmarks are already heavily underweight to oil and gas companies compared to regular indices.

Capital expenditure

SPMS has now determined that investments in oil and gas companies in the actively managed portfolios may only be made if they allocate more than 20% of their annual capital expenditure to renewable energy and/or technology that supports this, such as battery storage, hydrogen, charging station infrastructure or lithium extraction. Investments in carbon storage also count.

The pension fund’s sustainability adviser, Columbia Threadneedle Investments, checks annually which companies meet this criterion. Based on the new policy, 242 oil and gas companies globally have been excluded. Investments can still be made in a small number of firms, which are mostly headquartered in Europe.

As per The Economic Times report, Chairman A. S. Sahney confirmed, “Indian Oil Corporation, the country’s largest refiner, will begin producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in December.” The dedicated SAF unit at Panipat, Haryana, will deliver 35,000 tonnes per year, a capacity designed to meet all of India’s mandated international aviation requirements by 2027.

Blending Mandates, Costs and Feedstock Assurance

As per news reports, India has rolled out a phased blending obligation for SAF in jet fuel, starting at 1% for international flights in 2027, ramping up to 2% by 2028. While sustainable aviation fuel is expected to cost nearly 3 times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF), Sahney said airlines “must comply with the blending mandate” so the company will not struggle to secure buyers. If local demand does not absorb Panipat’s full output, Indian Oil will consider exports.

Used cooking oil (UCO) has been selected as the feedstock for this SAF initiative. Sahney explained, “Arranging feedstock is not a challenge. There is an ample collection of UCO in the country, most of which is currently exported.” The corporation will leverage established UCO supply chains, drawing oil predominantly from large hotels, restaurant groups, and traditional snack producers.

Certification and Unique Market Position

The Panipat facility has been awarded ISCC CORSIA certification, a requirement for commercial-scale SAF production. Sahney noted that Indian Oil is “currently the only company in India to hold this certification for producing SAF from used cooking oil,” which remains valid for the next year. This milestone firmly establishes Indian Oil as a pioneer in India’s sustainable aviation sector, particularly for SAF derived from UCO.

What does this mean?

China is making a serious play to decarbonize its skies. The country’s top aviation fuel supplier, CNAF, is throwing support behind Henan Junheng’s plant in Puyang, which turns used cooking oil into sustainable jet fuel. That facility is on track to more than double its output to one million metric tons a year by June 2026. This follows CNAF’s $36 million move to buy into another SAF supplier last year. While there’s still no official nationwide mandate for greener jet fuel, China started requiring SAF on some outbound domestic flights from major hubs in March. Add in China’s deep well of used cooking oil and the country is positioning itself to slash aviation emissions in a big way.

Why should I care?

For markets: China’s SAF play could spark global change.

China is the world’s second-biggest market for aviation fuel, so its push into SAF matters for both investors and airlines. With global SAF demand expected to surge tenfold this decade, local suppliers and carriers are well-positioned to drive standards and shape supply chains both in Asia and beyond. As investment picks up, Chinese companies could lead a new wave in low-carbon aviation—and that’s likely to catch the attention of global players looking to keep up.

The bigger picture: China’s head start could set the pace for green aviation.

China’s preemptive moves in sustainable jet fuel signal momentum even before detailed regulations are in place. Boosting homegrown biofuel production can shrink emissions for one of the busiest air networks on Earth and help meet national climate goals. As more large-scale green fuel projects take off, China’s early lead may nudge other major markets to speed up their own sustainable aviation efforts.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L4N3UA09E.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=0d092407fdb600562dfe35617bed6202,N,,2025-08-18 07:56:24.038370

On Aug 15, the carrier signed an agreement to use 1,200 cubic metres (cu m) of this fuel, blended in Vietnam and supplied by Petrolimex Aviation, the fuel subsidiary of Petrolimex, which is the country’s state-owned national petroleum company and largest distributor of oil products.

The airline said in a recent statement that its fleet, with 576 modern aircraft on order, would increasingly incorporate this fuel, which it said can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent, compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

Petrolimex Aviation said in a separate statement that it is the first company in Vietnam to master the technology behind blending aviation fuel that meets international standards.

The partnership between Vietjet and Petrolimex Aviation builds on their cooperation in October 2024, when they operated the first two flights using this fuel.

The following month, the Vietnamese low-cost airline ran the “Green Friday” promotional campaign in Singapore, touting its new-generation fleet that is significantly more economical with fuel, and also reduces emissions and noise. In its responses to media queries, the firm said the promotion reflected its adoption of the sustainable aviation fuel.

The Green Friday campaign was, however, short-lived. In January, the campaign was pulled in Singapore after the city-state’s advertising watchdog found the company’s claims about its fleet’s reduced fuel consumption and emissions misleading, and applicable only to certain combinations of aircraft and engine types.

It is not immediately clear how many Vietjet flights would be powered by the bumped-up volume of this greener fuel.

Data suggests that the Airbus A321neo, commonly used by Vietjet, would typically use about 5 cu m of fuel for a two-hour flight; 1,200 cu m of fuel could therefore power about 240 such short- to medium-haul flights.

Airbus noted in its website that the model is currently able to fly on up to a 50 per cent blend of the sustainable fuel and conventional fuel, with a target to increase to 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel capability by 2030.

As at the end of the first quarter, Vietjet was running a fleet of 99 Airbus aircraft, including seven A330s, 21 A320s and 71 A321s.

The green aviation fuel it uses is blended in Petroleum’s Nha Be Oil Depot in Ho Chi Minh City, using imported synthetic blending components – hydrocarbons produced from biologically renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass and urban waste.

Before Vietjet, national flag-carrier Vietnam Airlines flew a commercial flight from Singapore to Hanoi in May 2024 using sustainable fuel; that fuel was, however, produced and supplied by international partners.

In the first half of 2025, Vietjet reported consolidated revenue of about US$1.4 billion, up 5 per cent from a year ago. Its pre-tax profit was US$61 million, 65 per cent higher than in the year before.

Analysts from Vietcap, a brokerage firm, said that Vietjet achieved higher gross profit margin in Q2, at 13.5 per cent, on the back of strong passenger numbers, effective cost control and low jet fuel prices.

In the first six months of this year, Vietjet, including Vietjet Thailand, transported 17.7 million passengers and nearly 65,200 tonnes of cargo.

Vietnam welcomed nearly 10.7 million international arrivals during the period, a 21 per cent year-on-year increase; the figure was 26 per cent higher than that in 2019, pre-pandemic.

Production and adoption

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in June that the production of sustainable aviation fuel is expected to reach two million tonnes or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director-general, said: “Even that relatively small amount will add US$4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

Under the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub blueprint launched in February 2024, flights departing from Singapore will be required to use this sustainable fuel from 2026; 1 per cent of the total fuel used for such departures will be of the sustainable type, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Airports like Changi now offer fuelling with this greener fuel. Singapore Airlines and Scoot are already using the fuel produced by Neste, which runs the world’s largest sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Singapore.

However, despite biofuels’ clean energy profile and growing global demand, they cost more to produce and face competition from fossil fuels, said GlobalData in a report in May.

Prospects ahead until 2030 Looking ahead from mid 2025, Chile’s airfreight sector is poised for moderate but steady expansion.","Chile’s air cargo sector has demonstrated steady growth and strategic dynamism in recent years. In 2024, Santiago’s Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport (SCL) handled 409,824 tonnes of cargo – a 14% increase compared to 2019 and a 1.5% rise over 2023 – making it the country’s undisputed cargo hub. Exports of salmon and cherries dominate the mix, representing approximately 61% and 28.3% of volumes respectively, with the United States as the top destination by far.

In terms of productivity, Chile’s airfreight volume stood at 1.33 billion tonne kilometres in 2023, and forecasts expect this to rise to 1.38 billion by 2028, implying a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 0.6%. The national freight and logistics segment overall is projected to grow from $20.1 billion in 2024 to $27.9 billion by 2030 (CAGR 5.6%) – underpinned by major infrastructure investments in ports, roads, railways and customs facilities.

Cargo airports, major airlines and forwarders

Santiago’s Arturo Merino Benítez is by far the primary cargo gateway for Chile. Its facilities serve LATAM Cargo and other operators; salmon, cherries and high value perishables flow through in temperature controlled conditions. A second airport, Concepción (Carriel Sur, CCP), while mainly domestic, this airport functions as an alternate international airport and may handle overflow cargo when SCL is constrained. The other 17 commercial regional airports are less significant in airfreight volumes, which remain concentrated at these two hubs.

LATAM Cargo Chile is the dominant domestic-sector carrier. Operating out of Santiago, its fleet of six Boeing 767 freighters serves roughly 21 destinations across South America, North America and Europe, alongside belly hold cargo in LATAM’s passenger flights. In response to perishable goods demand, LATAM added freighter capacity and increased weekly frequencies, especially for cherries during the 2023–24 season, to export over 7,500 tonne of cherries (a 32% increase year over year).

Avianca Cargo, though based in Colombia, serves Santiago regularly and is expanding its presence. Plans announced include introducing multiple Airbus A330 freighters to boost capacity by up to 70%, contributing to Chilean connectivity.

Global integrators like UPS, FedEx, DHL and Agility Logistics Chile SA maintain significant operations via charter and scheduled freighters and extensive forwarding networks. DHL and UPS have also embraced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Chile, echoing LATAM’s shift toward environmental efficiency.

The Chilean airfreight forwarding market is competitive, featuring both national and multinational players: Samex, KLog.co, Andes Logistics Group, Pedro Serrano and Balmoral Chile are among the top Santiago based forwarders focused on airfreight, ocean freight, warehousing and consultancy services.

Membership in global networks like Globalia Logistics Network and Conqueror Freight Network is increasingly common among medium and small forwarders aiming to enhance international reach and sales leads. Larger multinationals like UPS, FedEx and DHL often lead individual player rankings in market share, but smaller forwarders remain competitive through specialisation in e commerce, cold chain logistics, customs consultancy or niche routes.

Chile’s government has supported the logistics sector robustly. Between 2020 and 2022, it invested $1.9 billion in railway infrastructure through the state rail company EFE – aiding intermodal connections with airports and ports. A wider $17.6 billion infrastructure roadmap (2024 2028) includes rail expansions, customs facility upgrades and port modernisation, with completion targets around 2026.

Environmental sustainability is also top of mind. The government has outlined plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale by 2030, aiming for SAF to meet 50 % of aviation needs by 2050. Meanwhile, major carriers such as LATAM Cargo, UPS are already using SAF blends, reducing lifecycle emissions significantly and positioning Chile as a regional leader in green logistics.

E commerce growth is a critical driver. In Chile, cross border e commerce categories—particularly apparel (59%) and electronics (51%)—are increasing airfreight demand. Forwarders now offer integrated solutions combining air cargo with last mile delivery and digital tracking tools.

Prospects ahead until 2030

Looking ahead from mid 2025, Chile’s airfreight sector is poised for moderate but steady expansion. Volume forecasts suggest cargo tonne kilometres rising from 1.33 billion in 2023 to around 1.38 billion in 2028 (0.6% CAGR). Economic and logistics market growth is expected to deliver stronger momentum: the overall freight and logistics market is projected to grow at 5.5% per annum, reaching $27.9 billion by 2030; air cargo volume should benefit via modal share gains and efficiency gains from digital platforms and infrastructure modernisation.

Perishables exports, such as cherries, seafood and salmon are expected to remain a core component of international airfreight from Chile. LATAM Cargo’s expansion of cherry specific freighter flights and new interline routing to Asia and North America illustrates evolving responsiveness to seasonal demand.

Competition dynamics will evolve as regional carriers like Avianca scale their freighter fleets in South America, offering alternatives to LATAM dominance and diversifying routings out of Santiago. Smaller forwarders may see opportunity in niche verticals (e commerce, cold chain, customs compliance), aided by membership in global networks and digital platforms, enabling them to compete for cross border shipments and higher value contracts.

Conclusion

Chile’s airfreight industry is grounded in strong fundamentals: a dominant cargo hub in Santiago, rising exports of perishables, modernising infrastructure and a logistics market that embraces digital transformation and sustainability. While growth in pure tonne kilometres is expected to be modest – the 1.33 billion tonne kilometres in 2023 rising to approximately 1.38 billion by 2028 – value added segments and technological efficiencies are likely to deliver stronger commercial impact.

Over the next five years, continued investment in cold chain facilities, SAF expansion, and digital logistics platforms will shape a progressively more efficient and sustainable Chilean air cargo ecosystem, enhancing its role within Latin America’s supply chain architecture.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1024px-Terminal_Aeropuerto_Pudahuel.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 09:57:12.821368

Major Challenges in Aviation Fuel Industry

The primary factor preventing the aviation fuel market from expanding is expected to be the cost of fuel. The high cost is likely to be a barrier to market expansion. Since jet fuel is a derivative of Brent crude oil, the reason for the rise in fuel prices is the higher price of Brent crude oil. The price of Brent crude oil is rising as a result of the mismatch between supply and demand. Despite the rising demand for Brent crude oil, prices are driven up by the lack of production. Saudi Arabia, one of the founding members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), significantly cut back on its crude oil production. They claimed that the weakening global economy and rising interest rates in some western countries were the reasons behind the production cut, which accounted for 2% of global supply.

The market is predicted to suffer since low-income nations might not be able to pay the exorbitant airfares brought on by these factors. Asia Pacific and Africa are two of the price-sensitive regions. Due to their lower per capita incomes, developing countries in the region are unable to purchase pricey tickets.

Competitive Landscape

ExxonMobil is expected to generate USD 339.9 billion in 2024, followed by Chevron with USD 194.7 billion, Total with USD 210.2 billion, Shell with USD 302 billion, and Reliance Petroleum with USD 15.7 million. These are the top five companies in the aviation fuel industry. Each business contributes to the growth of the regional aviation fuel sector.

By fuel processing technology, the market is classified into conventional, hydrotreating, catalytic cracking, isomerization, blending, synthetic fuel, water electrolysis, reverse water-gas shift, hydrocracking & fractionation, biofuel, alcohol-to-jet conversion, and biomass-to-liquid. Depending on aircraft type, it is divided into fixed wing, military aviation, business & generation aviation, rotary wing, military helicopter, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and defense & military. According to fuel type, the market is categorized into conventional aviation fuel, sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen fuel, power-to-liquid, and gas-to-liquid. As per end user, it is segregated into airline, government & military, and non-scheduled operator.

By fuel processing technology, hydrotreating, especially the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids, Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) pathway, dominated the market in 2024. It had the biggest market share among sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technologies due to its proven scalability, compatibility with modern jet engines, and widespread regulatory acceptance. Large producers such as Neste and World Energy have significantly expanded the capacity of HEFA production worldwide.

By aircraft type, fixed-wing aircraft, which include freight, commercial, and military aircraft, will consume more than 72% of aviation fuel in 2023–2024. Due to its extensive use in the transportation of people and goods, gasoline is in high demand worldwide.

By fuel type, the primary fuel for airplanes is still jet A/A-1, which will account for about 96% of the market in 2024. Sustainable aviation fuel's current infrastructure, dependability, and engine compatibility keep it at the top even if more people become interested in it.

By end user, the commercial aircraft category is the largest users of aviation fuel in 2024, accounting for more than 60% of total usage. Due to the large number of passenger and freight flights, commercial aviation is the primary cause of the world's gasoline consumption.

Regional Outlook

North America held the largest aviation fuel market in 2024 due to its robust commercial aviation sector, ongoing additions of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), and robust regulatory support. SAF gained popularity due to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and incentives for producing biofuel. The continued use of conventional and alternative aircraft fuels was ensured by major airlines and regional defense operations.

Asia-Pacific expanded at the fastest rate in 2024 due to aggressive fleet growth, a growing middle class, and more people traveling. Much money was spent on creating SAF throughout the region, particularly in Southeast Asia, China, and India. As defense spending increased and infrastructure improved, both the military and the civilian sectors required more types of aviation fuel.

Europe is significantly ahead in 2024 due to its stringent environmental laws, such as the EU ETS (Emissions Trading System), which mandated SAF blending and carbon pricing. SAF production and usage increased as a result of the region's focus on decarbonizing aviation and collaboration between airlines and fuel suppliers. Power-to-liquid fuels and hydrogen are also very popular in the European market.

The LAMEA aviation fuel market grew steadily in 2024. Due to its extensive refinery capacity and importance on international aviation routes, the Middle East had a significant impact. Regional air travel increased in Latin America, and new airline routes and infrastructure upgrades in Africa increased demand. Comparatively speaking, this region's adoption of SAF was still quite low.

Understanding the formation mechanisms of these scatterers is crucial for understanding mantle dynamics and chemical evolution. Previous studies suggest that their formation is linked to the structural phase transition of SiO2 from stishovite to post-stishovite in the subducted oceanic crusts, with variations in Al and H content potentially influencing the transition depth. However, earlier experiments on (Al, H)-bearing stishovite phase transition were conducted only at high pressures and 300 K, limiting our ability to quantify the relationship between variations in subducted oceanic crust composition and small-scale scatterers in the lower mantle. In this study, we investigate the phase transition of (Al, H)-bearing stishovite under simultaneously high pressure and temperature conditions. Our results reveal that the incorporation of 0.01 a.p.f.u Al into stishovite with H/Al ratio of ~1/3 lowers the transition pressure by 6.7(3) GPa. However, the Clapeyron slope of this transition is nearly unaffected by changes in the Al content and has a value of 12.2-12.5(3) MPa/K. According to our results, Al content variation ranging from 0 to 0.07 a.p.f.u in SiO2 can reasonably explain the depth distribution from 800 to 1900 km of the seismic scatterers observed in the circum-Pacific region.

These issues are not isolated; they reflect systemic bottlenecks in Australia's energy infrastructure.
The Albanese government's ability to deliver on these fronts will determine whether Australia's energy transition remains aspirational or becomes a reality.
Australia's renewable energy infrastructure is at a defining moment.
The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon—it is a present-day imperative, and firms like Ampol are leading the charge.","Australia's energy transition is at a pivotal crossroads. As global demand for decarbonization accelerates, traditional energy firms are no longer passive observers but active participants in reshaping the sector. Among them, Ampol stands out as a case study in strategic adaptation, navigating the dual challenges of declining refining margins and the urgent need to build renewable infrastructure. For investors, the company's struggles and ambitions highlight a broader opportunity: the reallocation of capital toward firms capable of pivoting from fossil fuels to renewables, provided they secure the right policy frameworks.

The Ampol Dilemma: A Catalyst for Policy Reform

Ampol's recent warnings about the energy transition's fragility—particularly in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure and refining sector viability—serve as a wake-up call. CEO Matt Halliday has underscored delays in connecting EV charging stations to the grid, poor resale values for EVs, and stagnating adoption rates. These issues are not isolated; they reflect systemic bottlenecks in Australia's energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, Ampol's refining operations face margin compression, exacerbated by the underperformance of the Fuel Security Services Payment (FSSP) program, which was designed to stabilize the sector during unprofitable periods.

The company's pivot to renewable fuels, however, offers a blueprint for resilience. Ampol's Brisbane Renewable Fuels (BRF) Project, a proposed Low-Carbon Liquid Fuels (LCLF) plant at its Lytton refinery, aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel using feedstocks like used cooking oil and tallow. This initiative aligns with global trends: SAF production reached 1.25 billion litres in 2024, and Australia's potential to produce 14 billion litres by 2050 hinges on policy support. Ampol's collaboration with partners like ENEOS and GrainCorp further underscores the need for industry-government partnerships to scale renewable infrastructure.

Policy as a Critical Enabler

Ampol's calls for 2025 policy announcements are not mere requests—they are a demand for structural reform. The Australian government's $1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund and $18.5 million for renewable fuel certification are steps forward, but they fall short of addressing the sector's systemic risks. For instance, the FSSP program's rigid margin-based criteria have left Ampol without support during periods of low refining margins, despite rising operational costs. Reforming such mechanisms to account for inflation and supply-chain volatility is essential to prevent the collapse of transitional infrastructure.

Investors should note that Ampol's success in transitioning to renewables depends on three pillars:

1. Supply-side incentives: Subsidies for feedstock procurement and production tax credits for SAF and renewable diesel.

2. Demand-side mandates: Regulatory requirements for blending renewable fuels into existing infrastructure.

3. Grid modernization: Accelerated investment in transmission lines and EV charging networks to alleviate bottlenecks.

The Albanese government's ability to deliver on these fronts will determine whether Australia's energy transition remains aspirational or becomes a reality.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

For investors, the key lies in identifying firms like Ampol that are not only adapting to the new energy paradigm but actively shaping it. Ampol's 2025 capital expenditure of A$600 million—directed toward the Lytton ultra-low sulphur fuels project and the BRF Project—signals a commitment to long-term sustainability. Its proposed A$1.1 billion acquisition of EG Australia to expand convenience retail further diversifies its revenue streams, reducing reliance on volatile refining margins.

However, Ampol's stock remains undervalued relative to its peers, reflecting market skepticism about its transition costs. This presents an opportunity for patient investors who recognize that the company's pivot to renewables is not a risk but a necessity. The BRF Project, expected to operationalize by 2029, could unlock significant value if policy reforms align with Ampol's timelines.

The Path Forward: A Call for Immediate Action

The energy transition is not a linear process; it requires iterative policy adjustments and bold capital allocation. Ampol's warnings about EV infrastructure delays and refining sector fragility should galvanize policymakers to act. For investors, the lesson is clear: firms that can bridge the gap between traditional energy and renewables—while securing government support—will dominate the next decade.

Australia's renewable energy infrastructure is at a defining moment. Ampol's journey from refining giant to green energy pioneer exemplifies the potential of strategic reallocation. For those willing to invest in this transition, the rewards will be measured not just in financial returns but in the creation of a resilient, low-carbon economy.

In conclusion, the time to act is now. The energy transition is no longer a distant horizon—it is a present-day imperative, and firms like Ampol are leading the charge. For investors, the question is not whether to participate, but how to position themselves to benefit from the inevitable shift.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-18 04:56:18.320403

The Indian Oil Corporation recently secured the ISCC CORSIA certification, the global standard that allows airlines to count biofuel use under international carbon offsetting rules. This sought to clear the final regulatory hurdle before commercial production.

Indian Oil Turns Waste Oil Into Jet Fuel

According to Indian Express, the Panipat plant is designed to turn out 35,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel annually. That quantity, according to Indian Oil, would be sufficient to meet India’s first blending requirement of 1% for international flights in 2027. Oil collected from hotel kitchens, restaurant chains, and packaged food companies, including brands such as Haldiram’s, is expected to provide the bulk of the sustainable feedstock.

The appeal of Indian Oil’s sustainable aviation experiment lies in its compatibility. It mirrors the chemistry of aviation turbine fuel, so no changes to aircraft engines are required. Airbus has already confirmed that its fleet can fly on a 50% SAF blend, and several Indian carriers have flown demonstration services using biofuel mixes. Analysts tracking global climate goals expect SAF to shoulder over 60% of aviation’s total emissions reductions.

India’s Sustainable Aviation Experiment

The year 2027 has become a looming milestone for the industry. That is when the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) shifts into its binding phase, obliging airlines to cap emissions at 2020 levels or face penalties. In line with this timetable, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee has set an initial SAF blending target of 1% in 2027 and 2% the following year. Requirements for domestic flights are expected later, though policymakers appear reluctant to impose them before international blending takes hold.

European airlines, already required to use SAF, are seen as likely early customers for IOC’s output, particularly on flights operating in and out of India. Export markets are also under consideration, since demand is projected to surge worldwide once the CORSIA deadline kicks in.

What threatens the upcoming initiative is the cost. Producing SAF currently runs to about three times the price of jet fuel refined from crude oil. Airlines have warned that passing those costs through could inflate ticket prices, making widespread adoption politically fraught.

IOC is trying to reduce that dependence on used cooking oil by advancing work on an alcohol-to-jet pathway, where ethanol serves as feedstock. Rival refiners are pursuing their own technological bets, but every new facility must be certified before it can supply the market, as stated by the Indian Express.

The main market for the product will be Europe, which has SAF blending mandates for airlines operating on its territory.
However, sustainable aviation fuels are expensive to produce, which has made their transformation into a mainstream blending component for jet fuel problematic.
Reuters recently published a detailed look into the present state of SAF production globally and its immediate outlook.","Indian Oil Corp., the largest refiner in the country, is set to launch its first sustainable aviation fuel production facility by the end of the year. Production capacity will be 35,000 tons annually, with the feedstocks coming from hotel chains, restaurants, and other large-scale users of cooking oil.

The plant’s projected capacity will be enough to meet India’s requirements for blending 1% of sustainable aviation fuel with jet fuel beginning from 2027, the chairman of Indian Oil Corp., Arvinder Singh Sahney, told the media as quoted by The Indian Express. The main market for the product will be Europe, which has SAF blending mandates for airlines operating on its territory.

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from waste materials such as cooking oil and biomass, is believed to be a necessary element of the energy transition due to the amount of emissions from the aviation industry, which amount to 2.5% of the global total emissions of carbon dioxide.

However, sustainable aviation fuels are expensive to produce, which has made their transformation into a mainstream blending component for jet fuel problematic. The high costs are attributable to the complex process required to turn waste fats and oils into biofuel, but also to a more challenging problem: the lack of sufficient amounts of waste fats and oils.

Reuters recently published a detailed look into the present state of SAF production globally and its immediate outlook. The picture painted by that article was not an optimistic one. A number of large air carriers made commitments to buy significant amounts of sustainable fuels from startup producers only to change their minds later, likely when they realised the bill they would be facing. As a result, SAF producers are shutting down, and the availability of these fuels is shrinking instead of growing ahead of blending mandates.

However, after US, Indonesia, China, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, and various European nations, India is set to produce SAF using used cooking oil (UCO) at a commercial scale.

Recently, India’s largest refiner and fuel retailer, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) became the first in the country to receive the prestigious ISCC CORSIA Certification for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production at its Panipat Refinery.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Similar in chemical composition to traditional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is made from crude oil, SAF is a biofuel made from sustainable feedstocks. This implies that the SAF-ATF blend is easily compatible with current aviation engines.

Depending on the efficiency and sustainability of the feedstock and production process, SAF can reduce carbon emissions—one of the harmful greenhouse gases—by up to 80% over the course of a conventional jet fuel’s lifecycle.

Various studies have found that commercial aviation produces 2.5% of the world’s CO2 emissions. According to an Air Transport Action Group report, in 2023 alone, commercial aviation’s contribution to CO2 emissions wasat roughly 882 million tonnes. This makes it imperative to switch from traditional to more sustainable fossil fuels to bring down carbon emissions to optimal level and protect the environment.

Interestingly, the aviation industry estimates that more than 60% of the global aviation sector’s decarbonisation efforts will likely come from SAF alone.

What is ISCC CORSIA certification

The ISCC CORSIA certification, i.e., International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), developed under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), validates that SAF meets the highest international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards.

SAF produced at Indian Oil’s Panipat Refinery has undergone rigorous assessment for lifecycle carbon emissions and traceability, creating a clear pathway for Indian airlines to integrate certified SAF into their operations. The certification also sets a benchmark for other domestic refiners and industry players to scale up SAF production. This is in line with the government’s vision of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070.

Earlier this month, Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu announced that Indian Oil’s Panipat Refinery has been certified as the country’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel producer.

IOC’s Panipat Refinery to start SAF biofuel production at commercial scale

IOC has said that by end of this calendar year, its Panipat Refinery will start producing SAF from used cooking oil at a commercial scale. By December 2025, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil. This used cooking oil will be sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and sweets and snacks companies like Haldiram’s. While these companies normally discard cooking oil after single use since it becomes unhealthy, now the same oil will be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Speaking about the significance of producing SAF and used cooking oil collected for the same, IOC’s Chairman Arvind Sawhney said, “The capacity (35,000 tonnes per year) will be sufficient to meet the country’s 1 per cent SAF blending requirement (for international flights) by 2027… For feedstock (used cooking oil), we will be engaging aggregators to collect it from big hotel chains and restaurants. There is a large amount of such oil available in the country. The only challenge is collection. While it is easy to collect from large hotel chains, a solution needs to be found for collection from small users, including households.”

SAF production, however, comes with its own challenges as despite offering a lower carbon footprint, SAF made from used cooking oil is currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fuel due to its higher production costs, which are caused by issues including feedstock constraints and evolving production technology.",https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/001-2025-08-18T113505.096.jpg,N,,2025-08-18 03:56:37.817614

This milestone, anticipated within weeks, underscores Airbus’s relentless ascent and Boeing’s recent stumbles, reshaping the dynamics of an industry that powers global travel.

According to data from aviation consultancy Cirium, as of mid-August 2025, Airbus has delivered 12,155 A320-series aircraft, trailing Boeing’s 12,175 737s by a mere 20 units. The European planemaker’s production ramp-up, coupled with Boeing’s supply-chain woes and regulatory hurdles, positions the A320 to claim the title of the most-delivered commercial jetliner in history, a record Boeing has held since the 737’s debut in 1968.

A Historic Rivalry Takes a Turn

The rivalry between the A320 and 737 dates back to 1981, when Airbus announced its challenger to Boeing’s single-aisle workhorse. Launched in 1984, the A320 introduced fly-by-wire technology and fuel-efficient designs that appealed to airlines seeking lower operating costs. Over the years, variants like the A320neo have boosted its appeal with advanced engines from CFM International, reducing fuel burn by up to 20% compared to earlier models.

Boeing’s 737, meanwhile, evolved through generations, from the Classics to the Next Generation and the troubled MAX series. But crises, including the 2018-2019 MAX groundings after two fatal crashes and ongoing production delays, have hampered deliveries. As reported in a recent article by Fortune, Airbus’s consistent output—aiming for 75 A320s per month by 2026—has allowed it to close the gap steadily since overtaking the 737 in orders back in 2019.

Boeing’s Challenges and Airbus’s Edge

Industry insiders point to Boeing’s internal turmoil as a key factor. Supply-chain disruptions, exacerbated by the pandemic and quality-control issues, have limited 737 MAX production to around 30 aircraft monthly, far below targets. A February 2025 report from Flight Plan highlighted how steel and aluminum tariffs further strained Boeing’s operations, delaying recoveries.

Conversely, Airbus has capitalized on its diversified supplier base and investments in automation. The A320 family’s backlog stands at over 8,000 units, driven by demand from low-cost carriers in Asia and Europe. Wikipedia’s entry on the Boeing 737 notes that while 17,037 have been ordered as of July 2025, deliveries lag due to certification delays for the MAX variants, allowing Airbus to pull ahead.

Market Implications and Future Outlook

This delivery milestone isn’t just symbolic; it reflects shifting airline preferences amid rising fuel prices and environmental regulations. The A320neo’s efficiency has secured massive orders, such as IndiGo’s 500-unit deal in 2023, outpacing Boeing’s commitments. Posts on X from aviation enthusiasts and analysts, like those from Aviation Facts, echo the sentiment that Airbus’s dominance in narrowbody jets is solidifying, with the A320 family now operating in more fleets worldwide.

Looking ahead, Boeing aims to stabilize with new leadership and FAA approvals, potentially ramping up to 50 737s monthly by 2026. Yet, Airbus’s lead could widen, especially with the A321XLR’s entry, enabling longer routes. As Simple Flying projected in March 2025, this overtake signals a new era where European innovation challenges American legacy.

Economic Ripples and Strategic Shifts

The economic stakes are immense, with each aircraft valued at around $100 million. Airbus’s triumph boosts Europe’s aerospace sector, supporting thousands of jobs across France, Germany, and the U.K. For Boeing, the loss intensifies pressure to innovate, possibly accelerating development of a 737 successor amid whispers of a clean-sheet design by 2030.

Analysts from IndexBox, in a blog post dated August 17, 2025, emphasize that this shift highlights Airbus’s strategic agility, from neo upgrades to sustainable aviation fuel compatibility. Meanwhile, Boeing grapples with reputational damage, as evidenced by IATA’s 2024 statistics showing both families as top-used types, but Airbus gaining ground in utilization rates.

Lessons from a Decades-Long Duel

Ultimately, this record-breaking moment teaches that in aviation, adaptability trumps tradition. Airbus’s focus on efficiency and reliability has paid off, while Boeing’s setbacks serve as a cautionary tale. As the industry eyes recovery from post-pandemic demand, the A320’s ascendancy may redefine competitive strategies for years to come.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-47d3ed47-2ad1-478e-afaf-3e7d7fe30533.jpeg,N,,2025-08-18 03:56:42.199975

Sustainable Aviation Fuel India Latest News

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India’s largest refiner and fuel retailer, is set to begin commercial production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at its Panipat refinery by December 2025. The facility recently received international certification to manufacture biofuel from used cooking oil (UCO).

By year-end, IOC will achieve a production capacity of 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually, with raw material sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants, and food companies, which typically discard cooking oil after one-time use.

This development marks a significant step in India’s green aviation push, contributing to cleaner energy transition and reducing dependence on conventional jet fuel.

About Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a bio-based alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, forestry waste, and non-edible crops.

SAF is a “drop-in fuel,” meaning it can be blended with existing jet fuel and used in current aircraft engines without modification.

International aviation bodies certify blending limits (usually up to 50%) to ensure safety and performance.

Benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Engine and infrastructure compatibility – SAF blended with conventional Jet A can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Fewer emissions – Compared with conventional jet fuel, 100% SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway.

More flexibility – SAF is a replacement for conventional jet fuel, allowing for multiple products from various feedstocks and production technologies.

Energy Security – It reduces dependence on imported crude oil.

Economic Opportunities – It Creates new markets for farmers (through non-edible crops and residues) and waste collectors (used cooking oil, biomass).

Exports: With Europe already enforcing SAF blending mandates, European airlines are seen as the first major buyers of IOC’s SAF when they land in India. IOC also plans to tap into global export markets as demand rises.

IOC’s First Commercial SAF Plant

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest refiner, will begin commercial production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at its Panipat refinery by December 2025.

The plant is certified under ISCC CORSIA standards.

IOC is the first Indian company to receive ISCC CORSIA certification, a requirement under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

From 2027, airlines worldwide must offset emissions beyond 2020 levels, and using SAF blends will be a key compliance pathway.

It will produce 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually using used cooking oil (UCO).

UCO refers to edible oils and fats that have been used for frying, cooking, or food preparation in both commercial and household settings.

It is essentially leftover oil from cooking processes.

While UCO can be a sustainable feedstock for biodiesel and other products, its improper disposal can lead to environmental and health issues.

Meeting India’s SAF Targets

The initial production capacity will be sufficient to meet India’s 1% SAF blending target for international flights by 2027.

The National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set indicative targets of 1% blending in 2027 and 2% in 2028.

SAF blending for domestic flights is expected to follow, but only after international targets are in place.

Challenges Ahead

Collection bottlenecks: While UCO collection from big hotel chains is easy, creating systems to collect oil from small eateries and households remains difficult.

High cost: SAF is currently about three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, raising concerns for airlines about higher operating costs.

Feedstock Availability: Large-scale production requires a steady supply of sustainable feedstocks (used cooking oil, residues, waste).

Policy roadmap: Although the government had earlier considered early SAF mandates, cost concerns have pushed implementation to 2027 onwards.

Future Pathways

While IOC has started with the used cooking oil route, it is also working on alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology, which uses ethanol as feedstock.

Other Indian companies are exploring similar SAF technologies, but all pathways require international certification before commercial rollout.

The company’s SAF production unit, located alongside its refinery in Panipat, Haryana, will have an annual capacity of 35,000 tonnes. This output will be enough to meet the entire SAF blending requirement for international airlines in India by 2027, Sahney said.

India has adopted a phased approach to SAF, starting with a mandate for 1% blending in jet fuel for international flights by 2027, rising to 2% by 2028.

SAF will cost nearly three times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF), but finding buyers will not be an issue, Sahney said, as airlines must comply with the blending mandate. If the Panipat facility’s output is not fully absorbed domestically, Indian Oil will explore exports, he added.

Used cooking oil (UCO) will serve as the feedstock for SAF production. “Arranging feedstock is not a challenge. There is ample collection of UCO in the country, most of which is currently exported,” Sahney said.

With international targets aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as one of the most critical pathways to reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. In this context, a significant development has taken place in Vietnam, where Petrolimex has introduced SAF to domestic operations. This milestone highlights both technological progress and the commitment of the aviation sector to embrace cleaner alternatives.

The Emergence of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Vietnam

Petrolimex has become the first enterprise in Vietnam to import synthetic blending components derived from renewable or bio-based sources. Through this move, the company has not only introduced SAF into the domestic market but also mastered blending technologies that meet internationally recognised standards such as EI 1533, ASTM D7566, DEF STAN 91-091 and Vietnam’s own TCVN 14414:2025.

This development represents more than a technical achievement. It lays the foundation for a sustainable aviation ecosystem in Vietnam, signalling the readiness of the sector to integrate SAF into daily operations while aligning with global standards.

Reducing Emissions by Up to 80 Percent

One of the most remarkable benefits of SAF is its potential to cut lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. This figure is not just symbolic; it represents tangible progress toward climate goals. By introducing SAF into commercial operations, Vietnam is aligning itself with international efforts to limit aviation’s environmental impact while maintaining the sector’s role as an economic driver.

Partnerships Driving Adoption

At the official launch in Hanoi, Petrolimex Aviation signed SAF offtake agreements with both Vietjet and Associated Energy Group (AEG Fuels). These partnerships are essential for creating demand and building trust in the new fuel source. For Vietjet, this collaboration translates into a practical way of reducing the emissions of its modern fleet, while for AEG Fuels, it represents an opportunity to connect Vietnam’s SAF supply to international markets.

By working with global and domestic partners, Petrolimex is not just offering a product but helping to establish a value chain that positions Vietnam as an active participant in aviation’s decarbonisation journey.

Technological Milestone at Nha Be Terminal

The SAF blending system installed at the Nha Be Petroleum Terminal stands as a flagship project. It represents a demonstration of how advanced infrastructure and technological expertise can converge to deliver innovative solutions. Recognition of this project during Petrolimex’s 70th anniversary underscores its symbolic importance as a milestone achievement for both the company and the broader aviation community in the country.

Strategic Significance for National Aviation

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, the launch of SAF holds significance that extends beyond commercial value. It signals the beginning of a domestic supply chain that is internationally compliant, strengthening collaboration among stakeholders including airlines, fuel providers, and regulatory authorities. This holistic approach ensures that Vietnam is not merely following global trends but actively contributing to the evolution of sustainable aviation practices.

Certification and Global Credibility

Petrolimex Aviation has achieved certifications under ISCC EU and ISCC CORSIA, two of the world’s most respected frameworks for sustainability and carbon reduction. These certifications provide assurance that the SAF being supplied is not only effective but also credible on a global scale. In practice, this means that international carriers and partners can confidently source SAF from Vietnam, integrating it into their sustainability strategies without concerns over compliance or quality.

Vietjet Leading the Way

The agreement with Vietjet to uplift the first 1,200 cubic metres of SAF blended in Vietnam illustrates the willingness of airlines to take a proactive role in emission reduction. Vietjet’s leadership in adopting SAF demonstrates how airlines can align their operational strategies with broader national and global sustainability goals. By doing so, Vietjet is positioning itself as a pioneer in the region’s transition toward cleaner air travel.

Global Expansion Through Strategic Alliances

The partnership with AEG Fuels creates a channel for Vietnam-produced SAF to reach international markets. This move enhances the role of the domestic industry in the global aviation supply chain, while also contributing to the international push for greener skies. By expanding beyond national boundaries, the initiative reflects a vision of interconnected sustainability, where innovation in one country can benefit the broader aviation ecosystem.

A Broader Perspective on Green Transition

The launch of SAF in Vietnam should not be seen as an isolated development but rather as part of a larger shift taking place across the global aviation sector. Countries and companies are racing to align with climate targets, and the availability of SAF is a critical enabler of this transition. For emerging economies, in particular, the ability to participate in and contribute to SAF adoption sends a powerful message of readiness and responsibility.

Subtle Lessons for Stakeholders

The progress made in Vietnam illustrates several valuable lessons for stakeholders across the aviation landscape. First, technological mastery combined with international certification builds confidence and credibility. Second, partnerships between fuel suppliers, airlines, and global distributors accelerate adoption and create stronger ecosystems. Third, investment in infrastructure, such as the SAF blending facility at Nha Be, ensures that commitments to sustainability are backed by tangible capabilities.

For professionals engaged in sustainability, these lessons highlight how collaborative strategies and systemic thinking can drive real progress.

The Role of Independent Expertise

Behind every transition to cleaner fuels lies the need for expertise in sustainability assessments, compliance with international standards, and long-term planning. Independent sustainability consultants and advisory firms play a crucial role in guiding such transitions. By helping organisations evaluate their carbon reduction potential, navigate evolving regulations, and optimise their green strategies, they act as a bridge between ambition and execution.

Conclusion

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel in Vietnam is more than a milestone for one company. It marks the beginning of a new chapter in aviation, where emissions reductions, global collaboration, and technological innovation converge. With SAF reducing emissions by up to 80 percent, Vietnam is sending a clear signal that it is committed to being part of aviation’s global green transition.

The road to net zero will be long and complex, but developments such as this demonstrate what is possible when ambition meets action. As more stakeholders across the aviation sector embrace SAF and strengthen partnerships, the vision of cleaner skies and a sustainable future becomes increasingly achievable.

Forecast capital expenditure (capex) in 2025 was unchanged at A$600mn, including the Lytton ultra-low sulphur fuels project and Lytton alkylation turnaround.
Transitioning to 10ppm gasoline will begin at retail sites from September to ensure regulatory compliance, Ampol said.","Canberra's Fuel Security Services Payment programme (FSSP), designed to protect Australia's refining sector from weak margins, is not working as planned in the face of losses in January-June, Australian refiner and retailer Ampol has said.

The programme is designed to pay Ampol and fellow domestic company Viva Energy when refining becomes unprofitable. But Ampol has not received funds despite weak results in the first half of the year, especially during the January-March quarter, when the 109,000 b/d Lytton refinery near Brisbane was affected by a cyclone.

Active discussions with the federal Labor government are underway to improve the ""effectiveness"" of the FSSP for the remainder of its present period, running to 30 June 2027, Ampol said.

""As costs have escalated, the mechanism does not take that into account and that's a part of the decision we're engaged on as part of the review,"" chief executive Matt Halliday said on 18 August, with the firm expecting an outcome in the present half.

Ampol will work with Canberra for the post-2027 period to understand its objectives for refining. This includes potentially incorporating biofuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, before recommitting to keeping Lytton operational beyond that date.

Just one FSSP payment has been made since the July-September quarter of 2021. This was a A$25mn ($16mn) payment in July-September last year to Viva, which operates the 120,000 b/d Geelong refinery.

Ampol's Lytton refinery margin (LRM) for the January-June first half was $7.44/bl, down by 28pc from $10.27/bl a year earlier. Refiners become eligible for the FSSP when margin markers fall to A$10.20/bl, with a maximum of A1.8¢/litre available when the marker drops to a floor of A$7.30/bl.

The LRM firmed following the end of the half to $9.95/bl in July, while the alkylation turnaround at Lytton started in mid-July and the refinery will return to normal operations at the end of September.

Alkylation and crude distillation unit works underway will affect 130-150mn litres, or impact Ampol to the tune of A$15mn-20mn in opportunity costs, while next year's planned turnaround on the fluidised catalytic cracking unit will affect about 300mn litres of production.

This means volumes produced next year will be similar to 2025, chief financial officer Greg Barnes said.

Earnings before interest and tax at Ampol's Lytton refinery in Brisbane slumped to $1.1 million in the half, from $89.5 million a year earlier.

Ampol reported a replacement cost operating profit of A$180mn in the first half, down by 23pc from A$234mn a year earlier.
