Private Aviation: A High-Growth Opportunity for SAF

The U.S. private jet market represents a significant opportunity for SAF producers. In 2024, the U.S. recorded over 3 million private flights—more than 40% of global private jet activity—consuming an estimated 2 billion gallons of jet fuel. General aviation accounts for roughly 8% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, nearly 5.5 million gallons per day, making it a largely untapped market for SAF, where XCF seeks to lead.

Leadership Perspectives

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, said, “Private aviation represents a growing frontier for SAF demand—a premium segment with high visibility and substantial commercial potential. Partnering with Impact Jets allows XCF to extend the reach of our fuel to customers who value both performance and purpose. We are not just delivering cleaner fuel; we are transforming the private flight experience into one of leadership in sustainability.”

Rodney Rigg, CEO of Impact Jets, added: “Through our partnership with XCF, we can provide our clients with verified, traceable SAF solutions that achieve real emissions reductions. Together, we aim to give operators and members a clear, credible path to lower their carbon footprint without compromising the performance and luxury expected in private aviation.”

The non-binding MOU reflects a shared commitment to accelerate SAF adoption in the private aviation sector. Its execution is subject to due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/XCF-global-image-logo-updated.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 03:56:13.991943

They focused on how to scale production while maintaining commercial viability, with a mixture of policies to build a new SAF market at scale.

Middle East’s potential needs policy push

Noura Al Nuaimi, VP Retail Aviation, ADNOC, brought perspective on the current situation in the Middle East, its comparison with other world regions and its real potential for SAF production and use.

“Europe has firm targets of reaching 70 % of SAF by 2050,” she said. “Asia is following with firm mandates as well with private investment to really strive and upscale SAF production.”

“If we look at the Middle East as a hub, we are leading in investments and financing,” she continued. “However, we do not see demand and policies to pick up the demand.”

Despite the lack of mandates in the region, there are approaches that can work to spur demand in the region. Al Nuaimi outlined several approaches.

“The potential is great,” she said.

Electrons are key

Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO, LanzaTech, pointed to the important connection of clean power to sustainable aviation fuel.

“Clean power is absolutely the key to conversion,” she said. “The electrons are how we are going to convert CO2 because that's how we also make hydrogen.”

“Electrons are the key to the future of molecules,” she added.

Holmgren emphasised that is it very important to just begin to deploy new fuels.

“At the end of the day, you've got to build, that's how you make it reliable and available - you just build,” she said.

“And that means we have to have permits go faster, we have to have people taking long-term PPAs, and we have to just increase our investment.”

Complementary tech

Horst H. Mahmoudi, CEO & Executive Chairman, Smartenergy, spoke about the importance of partnerships to launch a nascent industry.

“Nowadays as we see volumes are still very low,” he said. “And I think the only way to push it forward is through real partnerships.”

“Alliances that are also able to overcome certain periods, like for example less attractive periods for sustainable fuels.”

Steve Kelly, President and GM, 1PointFive International, discussed the importance of direct air capture as an important complement to SAF.

“As a capture developer, what we offer is a range of solutions that are complementary to the decarbonisation of an industry like aviation,” he said. “It's a full range,” he continued.

“We can deal with the residual emissions that exist with the SAF that's being used.” He said that the various roadmaps to get to net zero aviation shows that there will be something from 500 to 800 million tonnes of residual emissions to deal with.

His company is focused on that while also building a sustainable feedstock for e-fuel, in the form of a sustainable supply of CO2 that's atmospherically sourced from the use of any fuel.

Optimistic outlook

Dr. Steven Griffiths, Professor and Vice Chancellor for Research, American University of Sharjah, emphasised the important of development in the research and development for SAF.

“I always get asked about R & D and I always tell people that, in an area like SAF, we talk about R & D & D & D - research, development, demonstration, and deployment,” he said.

“Because really it's the demonstration and deployment that matters.”

Griffiths said that when he’s working with organisations he brings focus on several concerns. One is the feedstock, as the availability and sustainability of the feedstock are critically important. Likewise, the scalability of the technologies to convert the feedstock has to be thought about, such that developers are able to convert feedstocks through various technologies.

Griffiths and the other panellists conveyed optimism about the future of SAF, with the current global push and mandates in various parts of the world.

Münster (Germany) - The RENIXX World continued its upward trend last week. On Wednesday, the RENIXX reached a new yearly high, marking its highest level in two years. However, the index was unable to hold this level and fell slightly by Friday’s close.

The global renewable energy stock index RENIXX World (ISIN: DE000RENX014) gained 4.1% last week, closing at 1,191.46 points (as of October 31, 2025). This is just below the yearly high of 1,202.15 points, reached on October 29, 2025. Top performers last week (closing prices October 31, 2025) were Canadian Solar (+41%), Bloom Energy (+21.4%), First Solar (+16.8%), Jinkosolar (+14.7%), and Nordex (+13%). On the losing side were Enphase Energy (-15.6%), Plug Power (-8.3%), Solaredge (-6.6%), EDP Renewables (-4.1%), and Goldwind (-4.0%).

Technical Situation: RENIXX Near the 1,200-Point Mark

From late 2023 to January 2025, RENIXX moved sideways in a range between 1,000 and 1,200 points. The subsequent drop to 748 points formed the “head” of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. With the current rise to just above 1,200 points, the index has returned to the upper edge of its previous range. Indications of a potential trend reversal formation (inverse head-and-shoulders) are increasing. A confirmed breakout could open up further upside potential. For 2025 as a whole, RENIXX is now up 21.3% (previous week: 16.5%).

Company News from Week 44/25

Canadian SolarCanadian Solar’s subsidiary E-Storage has started commercial operation of the 220-MWh DC Mannum battery storage project in South Australia. The project, owned by Epic Energy and developed by Recurrent Energy, was implemented by E-Storage as EPC contractor (engineering, procurement, construction). Located next to Epic Energy’s 46-MWp solar plant, the Mannum project will strengthen grid stability in South Australia and support the regional energy transition. It uses E-Storage’s proprietary SolBank technology. With a 41% gain to €17.96, Canadian Solar was the top performer in the RENIXX last week.

Bloom EnergyUS energy pioneer Bloom Energy reported its Q3 2025 results, including record revenues. The strong data and prospects for further fuel cell deals for AI data centers boosted investor confidence, sending the stock up sharply. At week’s end, Bloom Energy shares closed 21.4% higher at €113.88.

First SolarFirst Solar reported record shipments but slightly lowered its guidance. In Q3, the US solar module maker posted net revenue of USD 1.6 billion and earnings per diluted share of USD 4.24. Shipments reached a record 5.3 GW. Net cash increased to USD 1.5 billion, supported by prepayments and improved cash flow. For 2025, the company expects revenue between USD 4.95 - 5.20 billion (previously 4.90 - 5.70) and EPS between USD 14.00 - 15.00 (previously 13.50 - 16.50). The stock rose 16.8% to €231.35.

NordexWind turbine manufacturer Nordex raised its EBITDA margin forecast for 2025 significantly to 7.5 - 8.5% (previously 5.0 - 7.0%). The improved guidance was attributed to strong operational execution in both project and service segments, as well as a stable macroeconomic environment. Asset manager BlackRock increased its stake in Nordex to 4.35% (3.17% direct, 1.18% via instruments). The stock rose 13% to €25.52.

Plug PowerHydrogen specialist Plug Power is expanding into renewable fuels production. Together with Edgewood Renewables, the company plans to build a state-of-the-art facility in North Las Vegas (Nevada) that will convert biogenic waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable diesel (RD), and biomethanol.

SAF is THE preferred, only(? )Pathway to Net Zero Carbon Emissions. Indeed it is the primary focus of ICAO, IATA[1], EASA/EU and FAA/DoT[2]. AIN has published a credible article, titled, Report Sees Minimal Role for SAF in Cutting Emissions, suggesting that SAF may not be what it is cracked up to be.

CarbonTracker (CT), the source of this strong opinion, is widely regarded as a credible and influential think tank in climate finance. This non-profit think tank was founded in London by UK fund manager Mark Campanale—

CT has focused on the intersection of climate science and financial markets. Its stature derives, in part, from the collaboration work with respected institutions like the International Energy Agency[3] (IEA) and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, grounding its work in robust climate modeling and financial analysis.

More bona fides:

Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, which used Carbon Tracker’s analysis to justify divestment from fossil fuels.

Its Unburnable Carbon (2011, 2013)reports—are considered foundational in climate finance discourse.

Carbon Tracker’s reports are known for quantitative rigor, using asset-level financial modeling (e.g., CTI-PALEM) to assess transition risks in sectors like oil, gas, steel, and power generation.

Their work is often cited in financial audits, investor briefings, and regulatory discussions, including responses submitted jointly with organizations like Ceres and the Climate Accounting Project.

With that background, here are Fuel Disclosure’s major conclusions—

Near-term shortfall: By 2030, potential Alternative jet fuels (AJF) supply covers only a small share of total jet fuel consumption and fails to offset its growth.

Sustainability criteria: Not all “SAF” is sustainable – several pathways carry risks to nature and climate.

Seven hurdles to scale:

Costs and price premiums;

regulatory uncertainty;

lack of long-term offtake;

weak bankability;

feedstock availability;

feedstock sustainability;

opportunity costs.

Right-sizing roles: AJF has a role, but a smaller one, mostly in long-haul flight; short-haul decarbonisation can proceed sooner with zero-emission and hybrid-electric aircraft, alongside operational measures.

These major premises are supported by the following two charts:

So much of what surrounds this technological, developmental and environmental sector is hard to take for granted; debate/review MUST ADDRESS TC’s analysis. If the think tank’s conclusions are valid, then ICAO CORSIA MUST review the degree to which SAF is relied upon as its primary pathway. A reference library for such a policy discussion might include the following reports:

Contrails

ICAO #42 report says CONTRAIL policies may avoid >90% of aviation-induced warming by 2050 From EPA Acid Rain lesson time to review CORSIA

IATA’s STUDY of Contrails is MOST INSTRUCTIVE

SAF may be the solution to CONTRAILS

Can Civil Aviation decrease CONTRAILS now???

Reports/Assessments

2050 Zero Net Emissions; EU’s Clean Aviation And The Us- How Are They Doing?

Conflicting Developments in the Hydrogen Aviation Power Race

News about a new “breakthrough” in SAF poses the question of how these worthwhile efforts are being coordinated

Hydrogen Option(S)

Solid Hydrogen as power source in an eVTOL- a real advance??

UK says H2 has a positive prospect; France is delaying its H2 efforts- COOPERATE???

UPDATE ON H2 PROGRESS TOWARD ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS

Redesign Of Traditional Powerplants

RISE’s innovative patent: Green Positive?

SAF Alternatives

Swiss Alchemy creates SAF with the SUN ???

Big announcement of major investment on GREEN SAF, is it the ONE?

Operational Alternatives

Emirates’ Green Operating Procedures start with the Cockpit

Initial environmental efforts are not always successful. Acid Rain, for example, was caused by the use of tall smokestacks to disperse their emissions. It was later found that “actually tall stacks generally disperse pollutants over greater distances than shorter stacks and provide pollutants greater time to react in the atmosphere to form ozone and particulate matter.” Statutes and EPA rules moved to scrubbers to control SO2 and post-combustion controls to capture NOx emissions.

Perhaps it is time for ICAO and the world’s aviation community to review options based on the CT Fuel Disclosure report. Since the discussions and vote setting Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), BILLIONS of dollars have been invested in a plethora of potential CO2 solutions some of which do not depend on SAF, in whole or in part. Perhaps it is time for the global aviation community to return to Montreal and ASSESS WHAT OPTION(S) MAY HAVE THE MOST LIKELY RESULTS IN ATTAINING NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS 2050.

October 31, 2025

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL (SAF) will make only a marginal contribution to reducing aircraft emissions before 2030, according to a new report published yesterday by Carbon Tracker. The UK-based independent financial think tank’s “Fuel Disclosure” report concluded that alternatives to jet-A are “unlikely to make a significant dent” in emissions this decade.

The group’s analysts concluded that high costs and limited feedstocks will curtail the impact of SAF. “EVEN IF ALL EXISTING, UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND ANNOUNCED PROJECTS OPERATE AT FULL CAPACITY, [SAF] PRODUCTION WOULD ONLY SUPPLY AROUND 5% OF GLOBAL JET FUEL DEMAND AND MEET LESS THAN HALF OF THE EXPECTED GROWTH IN TOTAL JET FUEL CONSUMPTION,” Carbon Tracker concluded.

Apart from high production and distribution costs for SAF, the report said that perceived technology, feedstock, and policy risks are constraining funding for the sector, which the report defines as “weak bankability.” Other factors identified as hurdles to progress include regulatory uncertainty, competition for feedstocks with other sectors, and uncertainty over how much SAF aircraft operators will buy, resulting in revenue uncertainty for producers.

“On top of high costs, offtaker hesitation, and financing constraints, most alternative jet fuels are also saddled with a handful of environmental downsides,” commented Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, lead author for the report. “These fuels may someday have a larger role in decarbonizing aviation, but the burden of proof is on the industry to show that it can find a pathway that will deliver alternative jet fuel that’s at once sustainable, abundant, and feasible.”

CARBON TRACKER IS URGING COMPANIES TO “RIGHT-SIZE” THE ROLE OF SAF IN THEIR BUSINESSES, PRIORITIZING “PATHWAYS WITH ROBUST SUSTAINABILITY CREDENTIALS AND CLEARER COST TRAJECTORIES” WHILE AVOIDING “OPTIONS WITH WEAK LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE OR MATERIAL NATURE/FOOD SECURITY RISKS.” The company argued that for flights on routes of less than 500 kilometers (270 nm), THE PRIORITY SHOULD BE ON INVESTING IN BATTERY-ELECTRIC, HYDROGEN-ELECTRIC, AND HYBRID-ELECTRIC AIRCRAFT.

Sustainability specialists like 4Air are focused on helping aircraft operators, airports and other stakeholders to pursue multiple components towards decarbonization. According to 4Air, in addition to SAF, these will include carbon offsets, the introduction of new aircraft and propulsion technology (fleet renewal and electrification), and improvements to infrastructure and operational efficiencies (including air traffic management).

[1] IATA projects that SAF will likely deliver around 65–80% of the aviation sector’s CO₂ cuts by 2050. However, IATA also supports complementary strategies like operational efficiency and new propulsion technologies.

At lower temperatures, byproducts such as methane are formed, which decreases carbon monoxide productivity.
When using traditional copper catalysts, carbon dioxide and hydrogen first react to form formate intermediates, which are then converted into carbon monoxide.
In contrast, the new catalyst was found to directly convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide on the catalyst surface without generating intermediates.
The study was supported by the KIER’s R&D project, ‘Development of e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production technology from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.","A research team led by Dr. Kee Young Koo from the Hydrogen Research Department at the Korea Institute of Energy Research (President Yi Chang-Keun, hereafter referred to as KIER) has developed a world-class catalyst for the reverse water–gas shift reaction, transforming carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, into a key building block for eco-friendly fuels.

The reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a technology that converts carbon dioxide (CO₂) into carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H₂O) by reacting it with hydrogen (H₂) in a reactor. The resulting carbon monoxide can be combined with the remaining hydrogen to produce syngas, which serves as a building block for synthetic fuels such as e-fuels* and methanol. This makes the RWGS reaction a promising technology for driving the eco-friendly fuel industry.

* E-Fuels are synthetic fuels produced by combining green hydrogen, generated with renewable electricity, and captured CO₂ from the atmosphere or sustainable biomass. They are emerging as a promising alternative to conventional fossil fuels, especially for hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as aviation and shipping.

The reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction achieves higher carbon dioxide conversion at temperatures above 800 °C, and thus nickel-based catalysts, known for their superior thermal stability compared to other metals, are typically employed. However, prolonged exposure to such high temperatures causes particle agglomeration, leading to reduced catalytic activity. At lower temperatures, byproducts such as methane are formed, which decreases carbon monoxide productivity. Therefore, current research is focusing on developing catalysts that maintain high activity even under low-temperature conditions, in order to reduce process costs and improve efficiency.

The KIER research team has overcome the limitations of conventional catalysts by developing a cost-effective and abundant copper-based catalyst. Their newly developed copper–magnesium–iron mixed oxide catalyst successfully produced carbon monoxide 1.7 times faster and with 1.5 times higher yield than commercial copper catalysts at 400 °C.

Unlike nickel catalysts, copper-based catalysts can selectively produce only carbon monoxide at temperatures below 400 °C without generating byproducts such as methane. The challenge, however, is that copper’s thermal stability decreases significantly at around 400 °C. Reduced thermal stability leads to particle agglomeration, which markedly diminishes the overall stability of the catalyst.

To address this issue, the research team implemented a layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure. This structure has a sandwich-like form, where water molecules and anions are intercalated between thin metal layers, and by adjusting the types and ratios of metal ions, various physical and chemical properties can be achieved. By incorporating iron and magnesium, the team was able to fill the spaces between copper particles, preventing particle agglomeration and thereby enhancing thermal stability.

Through real-time infrared analysis and reaction experiments, the researchers identified why the newly developed catalyst outperforms conventional ones. When using traditional copper catalysts, carbon dioxide and hydrogen first react to form formate intermediates, which are then converted into carbon monoxide. In contrast, the new catalyst was found to directly convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide on the catalyst surface without generating intermediates. Because it avoids producing unnecessary intermediates or methane byproducts, the catalyst maintains high activity even at the relatively low temperature of 400 °C.

The catalyst developed by the research team achieved a carbon monoxide yield of 33.4% and a formation rate of 223.7 micromoles per gram of catalyst per second (μmol·gcat⁻¹·s⁻¹) at 400 °C, while operating stably for more than 100 hours. This performance represents over a 1.7-fold increase in carbon monoxide formation rate and a 1.5-fold increase in yield compared to commercial copper catalysts. Furthermore, when compared to noble metal catalysts such as platinum, which exhibit high activity at low temperatures, the new catalyst demonstrated a 2.2-fold higher formation rate and a 1.8-fold higher yield, marking it as one of the best-performing catalysts worldwide.

Dr. Kee Young Koo, the lead researcher, stated, “The low-temperature CO₂ hydrogenation catalyst technology is a breakthrough achievement that enables the efficient production of carbon monoxide using inexpensive and abundant metals. It can be directly applied to the production of key feedstocks for sustainable synthetic fuels. Moving forward, we will continue our research to expand its application to real industrial settings, thereby contributing to the realization of carbon neutrality and the commercialization of sustainable synthetic fuel production technologies.

The research findings were published online in May 2025 in Applied Catalysis B: Environmental and Energy (Impact Factor: 21.1), a leading journal in the field of energy and environmental catalysis.

(Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials) RSB’s Sustainability Framework Drives Measurable Impact in Landmark European Aviation Project -- ALIGHT final conference at Copenhagen Airport celebrates five years of collaboration delivering practical tools and emissions reductions

On 1st October, partners and stakeholders gathered at Copenhagen Airport for the final conference of the ALIGHT (Airport-centred, Life cycle-based, Integrated, Green-House gas reduction Technology) project, marking the successful conclusion of a five-year Horizon 2020-funded collaboration that has delivered tangible environmental improvements for aviation.

The conference celebrated the project’s systems-level collaboration’s ability to deliver genuine progress: a 30% reduction in taxiing emissions through sustainable aviation fuel implementation, deployment of smart energy infrastructure, and creation of practical tools that airports across Europe can now use to accelerate their sustainability transitions.

For RSB, ALIGHT provided an opportunity to demonstrate how our comprehensive sustainability framework translates into measurable impact in complex, high-stakes sectors.

Five Years of Collaboration: What ALIGHT Delivered

The project brought together 17 leading airports, airlines, technology providers, and universities to develop solutions for sustainable airport operations. Key achievements showcased at the final conference included:

30% emissions reduction during taxing using 34% SAF blends

Battery energy storage and smart energy management systems deployed at partner airports

Infrastructure guidance for airports preparing for electric and hydrogen aircraft

Replication Toolbox enabling airports across Europe to implement proven solutions

European network built through collaboration with Green Deal sister projects OLGA, Stargate, and TULIPS

These outcomes demonstrate that the airport of the future can be greener, smarter, and more resilient when industry, research, and sustainability expertise work together.

RSB’s Strategic Contribution: Beyond Carbon

RSB’s role in ALIGHT exemplified how our organisation’s capabilities extend beyond certification to encompass strategic partnership and sector-specific application of comprehensive sustainability principles.

.Sustainable Airport Platform

RSB developed the Sustainable Airport Platform, a collaborative space facilitating knowledge sharing and coordinated action across European airports. The platform embodies RSB’s own multi-stakeholder governance model, providing airports with validated tools, peer networks, and frameworks for measuring sustainability performance.

Holistic Sustainability Tools

Drawing on RSB’s globally recognised Principles & Criteria—covering environmental, social, management, and legal dimensions—RSB contributed tools that help airports assess and improve operations holistically. This reflects a critical insight emphasised at the final conference: genuine aviation sustainability requires looking beyond carbon emissions to consider water stewardship, biodiversity protection, air quality, labour rights, and community impacts.

Key Insights for Aviation Sustainability

The ALIGHT final conference reinforced several critical principles: systems thinking is essential for sustainable airports; collaboration unlocks progress by bringing together complementary expertise; comprehensive frameworks prevent unintended consequences; and practical tools drive real-world implementation.

Perhaps most importantly, the conference highlighted that airports planning to accommodate hydrogen and electric aircraft in the 2030s need to begin infrastructure investments now. ALIGHT’s guidance helps airports make these long-term investments strategically.

From Conference to Action .

The tools, networks, and insights developed through ALIGHT are now available for airports worldwide to adapt and implement. For RSB, the project demonstrates our capability to serve as a strategic sustainability partner in complex sectors, applying our comprehensive framework to drive innovation and measurable impact.

The aviation sector faces immense pressure to reduce its climate impact whilst accommodating continued growth. Meeting this challenge requires exactly the kind of collaborative, evidence-based, holistic approach that ALIGHT exemplified. RSB is committed to continuing this work—supporting airports, airlines, and the broader aviation ecosystem in their transitions towards genuine sustainability.

“The Porvoo refinery is one of the most complex refineries in Europe.","Neste has been transforming from a local oil refiner in Finland to a global frontrunner in renewable and circular solutions. Today, Neste is the world's leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, enabling its customers across a variety of sectors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with Neste’s renewable solutions.

This year, Neste marks two significant milestones: the 15th anniversary of its renewable products refinery in Singapore and the 60th anniversary of its Porvoo refinery in Finland, showcasing a legacy of refining that has grown from local operations to make a global impact.

15-year-old state-of-the-art Singapore refinery, a crucial hub in global operations. Neste's investment in the Singapore refinery marked a pivotal milestone as the company’s first major renewable products focused investment in Asia and outside of Finland. In 2010, Neste’s refinery in Singapore commenced operations as the world's largest renewable diesel refinery.

A subsequent expansion in 2023 integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production capabilities into the refinery operations, elevating the total production capacity of renewable products to 2.6 million tons annually, encompassing renewable diesel, SAF, and renewable raw materials for polymers and chemicals.

Investments in Singapore have solidified Neste's role as a significant global player in renewable fuels, enhancing its global footprint and strengthening ties with its Asia-Pacific customers.

“The Singapore refinery's 15th anniversary is a testament to Neste’s refining expertise and the dedication of our talented employees in Singapore. Their commitment to pioneering renewable solutions and our strategic growth in the region make this refinery a cornerstone of our global operations, giving us an advantage in global competition and enabling us to continue helping our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,” says Jukka Kanerva, Senior Vice President, Refining, Renewable Products at Neste.

60-year-old Porvoo refinery, a cornerstone of Neste’s innovative refining

Neste’s Porvoo oil refinery in Finland began operations in 1965 with the purpose to secure Finland’s oil supply. After its expansion, it became the largest oil refinery in the Nordics already in the 1970s.

The basis for Neste’s fuel innovations was built at the Porvoo refinery. Lead-free and sulfur-free fuels were Neste’s first steps towards improving products' environmental performance, and in the 1990s, Neste’s NEXBTL technology for renewables production was developed and NEXBTL refining units started-up in 2007 and 2009 at the Porvoo refinery.

“The Porvoo refinery is one of the most complex refineries in Europe. It was built that way to ensure flexibility in producing more than 100 products from a variety of raw materials, including different crude oil qualities. Now 60 years after its start-up, Neste proudly showcases a very unique oil refinery with the capability of processing not only crude oil but also renewable and recycled raw materials”, says Jori Sahlsten, Executive Vice President of Oil Products at Neste.

“We want to thank our customers and partners for collaborating with us to develop high-quality products for diverse sectors and applications. Above all, we are incredibly proud of our teams, whose expertise and commitment ensure that our refineries continue to serve Neste customers worldwide for years to come,” Jori Sahlsten and Jukka Kanerva state about the refineries’ achievements.

CAPA's Airlines in Transition (AIT) event in Dublin assembled a panel of senior industry figures moderated by John Byerly, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation at the US State Department, to review the arguments.

The US big three claimed that subsidies to the Gulf three distorted the market. They called on the US government to open consultations under the relevant bilateral air services agreements and, in the meantime, to freeze new passenger services. A ponderous bureaucratic process to examine whether action should be taken is still under way. European airlines have also been dragged into the debate.

At the same time, the Gulf airlines have continued to add and announce new routes to the US. Ultimately, the US big three's aims contemplate the termination, or modification, of the relevant 'open skies' bilaterals, which allow the Gulf airlines unlimited capacity on routes to the US (the bilaterals reciprocally offer the same to the US airlines). From airlines faced with unexpectedly effective competition this cynical approach was little more than an attempt to further distort an already protective bilateral system.

Europe is still an important aviation region. But it is diminishing in importance and its position as one of the two leading world regions (with North America) has been surpassed by Asia Pacific. Moreover, it is clear from orders for widebody aircraft, the main agent of competition between the regions, that the future belongs to Asia Pacific and the Middle East. In this respect, Europe and North America are becoming 'also rans'.

That said, Europe is home to globally significant airlines and other aviation companies, and these players are anxious to participate in the growth offered by aviation markets to the east. The European Union's new Aviation Strategy document, published on 7-Dec-2015, recognises this: ""The EU aviation sector must be allowed to tap into the new growth markets where significant economic opportunities will be generated in the decades to come"".

However, all six associations representing Europe's aircraft operators issued a joint response calling for more specific and far-reaching remedies. In a rare display of unity, AEA, EBAA, EEA, ELFAA, ERA and IACA* said that that the strategy ""lacks ambition"". It certainly seems to duck some key issues.

Aviation in Europe has a PR problem, which is not helped by the fragmentation of industry representation. Efforts to consolidate representation have so far not yielded material results. Europe's five largest airlines are now attempting to seek common ground, prompted by the European Commission's consultation on a new aviation policy. However, they are avoiding obvious sticking points such as protectionism with regard to competition from Gulf-based airlines. By contrast, airport representation is unified in ACI Europe, which has also responded to the Commission with a liberal set of policy proposals.

Recent changes in the membership of Europe's main airline representative bodies have seen ELFAA become its biggest airline association, measured by its members' passenger numbers, ending the previous hegemony of AEA.

Expands XCF's reach to the ~$17 billion U.S. private aviation market

Develops new growth channel through Impact Jets' network of ~130 operators

Accelerates adoption by bringing verifiable, traceable SAF to private jet operators and travelers

XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today announced a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") with Impact Jets, LLC (""Impact Jets""), a private aviation platform, to accelerate SAF adoption across the private jet market.

Under the MOU, Impact Jets is expected to launch a ""Powered by XCF SAF"" program to onboard private jet operators and clients into direct SAF purchasing through XCF. With access to Impact Jets' ~130 existing clients, XCF will supply the fuel, manage logistics, and provide verified documentation for operators and their end clients, ensuring traceability and measurable environmental impact.

This initiative is expected to bring XCF access to a premium customer segment and expand the reach of its fuel beyond commercial airline partners. With private jet operators known for rapid adoption of best-in-class, reputation-enhancing technologies, the rollout would position XCF at the forefront of sustainability within private aviation.

As part of the collaboration, ""Powered by XCF SAF"" is expected to be featured prominently on the Impact Jets digital platform, including homepage visibility and a dedicated SAF education hub. The companies will jointly launch awareness and promotional campaigns designed to stimulate sales and accelerate SAF adoption within the private aviation community.

Private Aviation: A High-Growth Market for SAF

The U.S. private jet market represents an attractive expansion opportunity for sustainable aviation fuel producers. The U.S. saw more than 3 million private flights in 2024, accounting for more than 40% of all global private jet activity, and burning an estimated 2 billion gallons of jet fuel. With general aviation responsible for roughly 8% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, or nearly 5.5 million gallons per day, the sector represents a meaningful and largely untapped market for SAF and XCF intends to be at the forefront.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Private aviation is an emerging frontier for SAF demand - a premium segment combining strong visibility with significant commercial potential. Working with Impact Jets would allow XCF to extend the reach of our fuel to a premium customer base that values both performance and purpose. We're not just delivering cleaner fuel; we're transforming the experience of private flight into one of leadership in sustainability.""

Rodney Rigg, Chief Executive Officer of Impact Jets, added:

""Partnering with XCF would enable us to offer verified, traceable SAF solutions that deliver real emissions reduction to our customers. Together, we intend to give our members and operators a clear, credible path to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining the performance and luxury they expect when flying private.""

The non-binding MOU reflects a shared vision to accelerate SAF adoption throughout the private aviation market. Execution is subject to due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Every function in the jet fuel/SAF supply chain needs to know these testing standards as fuel moves along the chain of custody.","Illinois: Fuelling Sustainable Aviation

by Cindy Tomei (SAFII/The Illinois Manufacturer) The Prairie State can claim a variety of unique qualities as its own: Illinois grows 95% of the processed pumpkins in the U.S., it’s the birthplace of the first skyscraper in 1885, and is the home of the Twinkie. While these little-known state facts may be entertaining, it is also becoming a leader in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) industry.

In recent years, SAF has increasingly entered the conversation, not only in aviation but also in agriculture, tax policy, biofuel use mandates, the reduction of greenhouse gases, and contributing to a diverse fuel supply. Illinois has been at the forefront of many of these issues as SAF production takes shape.

There are a few obvious attributes that make Illinois the ideal hub for the SAF supply chain. Most notably, the rich agricultural economy has a natural allure in bringing SAF producers to the state. According to data from the Illinois Economic Development Corporation (formerly Intersect Illinois), the state is the number one producer of soybeans, the number two producer of corn, and the number three producer of ethanol — all vital components of SAF feedstock.

It goes without saying that the state’s aviation infrastructure is one to be envied. O’Hare International Airport serves as the number one airport for domestic connectivity. By all accounts, Illinois’ infrastructure, which includes waterways, railroads, and its highway system, contributes to its attractiveness for the entire SAF supply chain.

...

Of note, several leaders in SAF are based within Illinois’ borders. Aether Fuels, Avina Clean Hydrogen, Inc., Crysalis, CES— Compressed Energy Systems, LanzaJet, and Marquis Sustainable Aviation Fuel call Illinois home.

Legislators have also demonstrated a commitment to SAF by passing a first-in-the-nation SAF tax incentive at the state level. The SAF Purchase Credit is designed to support and drive demand from air carriers. The SAFPC is a $1.50 credit per whole gallon of purchased SAF.

...

Lesser-known SAF leaders deserve equal mention. The Sustainable Aviation Fuels Institute (SAFII) focuses on bringing together all SAF stakeholders from around the globe to stay up to date on SAF developments such as tax credits, SAF usage mandates, economic implications, and feedstock updates. Most importantly, SAFII is an Approved Training Provider through ASTM International. ASTM is committed to serving global societal needs; its international standards positively impact public health and safety, consumer confidence, and overall quality of life. Its testing methods are universal in ensuring consistent quality fuel from the producer to the wing (astm.org).

...

SAFII’s team of experts has served on ASTM committees for decades and is recognized for their thought leadership and contribution to the development of industry-accepted testing methods. Every function in the jet fuel/SAF supply chain needs to know these testing standards as fuel moves along the chain of custody. Hands-on training on the testing methods includes fuel sampling on world-renowned, best-in-class testing equipment, manufactured right here in Illinois.

Coming in at 200 pages, the GGR review is a comprehensive review of the state of GGR in the UK, readiness of various GGR technologies, and barriers to scaling removals to deliver on the UK’s net zero ambitions.

What’s the background to the review?

In May 2025, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) commissioned an independent review of GGRs to understand how different GGR options, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation, and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) can assist the UK in meeting its 2050 net zero target.

Removals are required to realise the ‘net’ in ‘net zero’ as even with significant emissions reductions across the economy, some industries will have residual emissions that are unable to be abated (e.g. emissions from ruminant agriculture). Removals help balance these emissions and limit the damaging impacts of climate chance.

The review was chaired by Dr. Alan Whitehead CBE, and was published in October 2025.

Chart and Map of UK GGR companies, according to GGR solution and staff size (2000-2024)

What does the Committee on Climate Change say about GGR?

The Committee on Climate Change’s (CCC’s) advice on the Seventh Carbon Budget recommends emissions be compensated on a source-sink symmetry basis – i.e. that biological emissions be balanced with biological removals, and fossil emissions be balanced with engineered (novel) removals, often with geological storage – currently limited to BECCS and DACCS.

In practice, this means that residual emissions pertaining to agriculture and land use will be compensated for through conventional CDR, primarily afforestation and grasslands, with -29.9MtCO2e of removals in 2050. Residual emissions from all other sectors, primarily aviation, will be compensated for through novel CDR methods, primarily BECCS, DACCS, biochar and enhanced rock weathering (ERW), with -35.8MtCO2e of removals in 2050.

Sources of abatement in the balanced pathway for engineered removals

What are the headline recommendations?

What GGR technologies does it recommend?

What are ‘low regret’ options for GGR deployment?

Who pays for GGRs?

Transitioning the UK to a net zero economy and society will incur costs, both to finance the transition, and lost revenues from phasing out emitting activities (e.g. fuel levies). A recent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) report estimates this to be £116 billion, over 25 years1. However, not reaching net zero also incurs costs, as the impacts of a warming world hit the economy. In a three-degree warming scenario, this is estimated to reduce GDP by 8% in 2070 and increase public sectoring borrowing to cover climate damages to over 4% of GDP. Taken together, the OBR report highlights that the costs of not achieving net zero outweigh the costs of achieving it, from a mitigation perspective. Costs and benefits associated from adaptation were not considered.

A key question the Review grappled with was who should provide the funding needed to support the deployment of GGRs in the UK. It considered financing in the context of the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS), the SAF mandate for aviation, the voluntary carbon market, and the potential for procuring GGRs internationally.

The government has previously indicated its intention to expand the coverage of the ETS to include energy from waste and domestic shipping, as well as include engineered removals. Decisions around woodland creation’s inclusion have not been taken but, as the Review notes, its inclusion would have issues, not least increasing misalignment between the EU ETS, with which negotiations to link the two schemes is ongoing.

Inclusion of GGRs in the ETS can provide financial incentive for their deployment at the level of the ETS price. However, without a significant increase in the ETS price, the government would be forced to ‘top up’ the payment to the costs of GGR deployment, given the current high costs of GGRs. Absent any alternative funding mechanism, this cost would be borne by the taxpayer.

The review notes that two policy options are available to avoid this – either constrain the supply of allowances sufficiently so that the gap between the ETS and GGR deployment prices are minimised, or employ a sub-mandate, whereby participating entitles are obliged to pay for an increasing fraction of GGR deployment over time. A buy-out price would also need to be set to ensure compliance with payment into the sub-mandate.

Aviation and the SAF Mandate

Aviation is projected to be the industry with the highest emissions in 2050. Under the CCC’s balanced pathway for net zero, it is assumed that aviation will pay for the removals necessary to balance their residual emissions, as SAF and demand-side abatement alone is insufficient to deliver net zero aviation. Given recent government decisions on airport expansions, the Review acknowledges that demand side reductions are increasingly unlikely, leaving GGR and SAF deployment the most viable policy options.

Currently, the SAF Mandate obliges suppliers of aviation fuels in the UK to include in their output a rising proportion of SAF, from 2% in 2025, to 22% in 2040. As SAF has lower emissions than kerosene, SAF represents an emissions saving, rather than actively reducing atmospheric emissions associated with aviation.

Given this, and the need to scale up the removals necessary to balance aviation emissions, the Review recommends expanding the SAF mandate to become a Net Zero Aviation Mandate, increasing the proportion of emissions to be addressed by SAF and GGRs combined. The Review views this as a means of reducing taxpayer liability for funding GGR deployment, avoiding competition for similar feedstock (in the case of biomass for BECCS and SAF) and, potentially, allowing for more cost-effective abatement, particularly where GGRs prove cheaper than SAF production.

What about sourcing GGRs internationally?

The CCC has consistently avoided recommending the usage of international mechanisms, such as carbon credits, to achieve the UK’s net zero ambitions, and the Review is no different. The Review finds that sourcing GGRs internationally carries significant risks and impacts, particularly around ensuring project integrity and the risks of impacting global fair burden sharing and the UK’s perceived international leadership on climate action.

However, the Review does find a potential role for international cooperation for DACCS, given its high deployment costs. Although the UK’s relatively clean electricity grid means it could produce DACC removals at a lower cost than other countries, in the longer term it may be the case that DACC removals become cheaper than in the UK, particularly in ‘sunbelt’ countries with high potential for solar energy generation. In these cases, it may be prudent to establish bilateral agreements for building GGR projects abroad, where the UK would secure access to lower cost DACC removals. The Review notes this should not be done at the expense of the UK’s current relative advantage in developing scaled GGR.

What about biomass?

A key debate in the GGR space is the role that biomass, particularly biomass utilised in BECCS, should play. BECCS deployment is limited by feedstock (input) availability, including waste feedstock, but also the growth of energy crops such as willow and miscanthus for BECCS. For the latter, this raises questions around land-use, with increased energy crop production reducing the amount of land available for other activities, such as food production or nature restoration. With current large-scale bioenergy plants in the UK running on imported forestry residues, shifting to energy crops is a live issue.

The Review takes a cautious approach to biomass feedstocks, emphasising the need for the UK to demonstrate leadership in sustainably sourcing biomass. To that end, the review calls for the publication of Defra’s Land Use Framework, to understand future land availability in England, and guide decision makers, from landowners to local councils, in making effective land use decisions. Additionally, the Review recommends limiting imported biomass as much as possible to reduce global land-use pressures.

What are the co-benefits of GGRs?

Greenhouse gas removals have a range of co-benefits, depending on the technology in question. The Review highlights a number of these.

Engineered removals can create economic activity and jobs, thereby contributing to the government’s growth objectives. This can happen throughout their lifecycle, from innovation, through operation, and the potential for their outputs (e.g. carbon dioxide) to be used in other industries and sectors. The Review estimates the global GGR market will be up to $1.2 trillion by 2050, with the UK well placed to capitalise on this opportunity, given its relatively well-developed policy on GGRs and storage potential in the North Sea. The Review highlights that these economic opportunities are largely concentrated in industrial centres for engineered removals, while land-based GGRs can lead to economic opportunity for rural areas, and represent new job opportunities to farmers in livestock agriculture or to rural workers.

GGRs can additionally provide access to low or zero-carbon energy in their deployment, via technologies like power BECCS (producing electricity from biomass while capturing and storing the carbon) or the generation of hydrogen or SAF with carbon capture.

For land-based GGRs, the Review highlights the contribution they can make to environmental objectives, such as enhanced flood resilience, improved soil health, biodiversity gains, erosion control, and physical and mental health benefits via access to nature. GGRs can therefore contribute to other government objectives, such as their Environmental Improvement Plan targets, while removing carbon from the atmosphere.

What next?

Key actions to lookout for mainly revolve around the degree to which the government accepts, acts on, or even acknowledges the recommendations contained within the report. Regardless, the report places additional pressure to follow through on already announced policy areas, such as the Land Use Framework, and the sustainable biomass framework consultation. The recommendations around the SAF mandate and aviation may prove more complicated in the context of the recent airport expansion announcements, although the government has approved these whilst remaining committed to net zero, increasing the need for direct mitigation of higher emissions.

Regardless, the challenge around responsibly scaling GGRs will not go away given the need to limit the damaging effects of climate change by reaching net zero. The question is how proactive the government will be in driving the agenda and realising the economic and wider benefits that investments in GGRs can provide.",https://ca1-eci.edcdn.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/carbon-dioxide-removal.jpg?v=1762185679,N,,2025-11-03 18:16:39.705426

The fund formed part of Microsoft's medium-term sustainability strategy and it was announced alongside the firm's commitments to being carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030.

The fund has adopted what it calls a ""market development flywheel"" approach, combining corporate investment with procurement commitments and technology support.

To date, this strategy has attracted an impressive US$12bn in follow-on capital across its portfolio companies, according to a newly published report which focuses on the lessons Microsoft has learned since the initiative began five years ago.

""Through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, we invest in bold ideas and scalable technologies that drive real impact,"" says Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of Microsoft.

Targeting hard-to-abate sectors

Much of the fund has been funnelled into areas where low-carbon alternatives remain scarce or are still commercially unproven.

One of these sectors has been steel production. In an effort to move the dial in this particularly heavy industry, Microsoft invested in Stegra's commercial-scale facility in Sweden, which uses green hydrogen-based direct reduced iron technology.

The plant aims to produce steel with up to 95% emissions reduction compared to traditional blast furnaces. Microsoft has paired this equity investment with some multi-year purchase agreements for suppliers to buy Stegra steel for data centre equipment.

There's also the aviation sector, where Microsoft has been backing the R&D around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Since funding opened, Microsoft has backed Twelve's carbon transformation technology as well as LanzaJet's alcohol-to-jet scheme.

In the same sector, Microsoft invested in a book-and-claim accounting model with Alaska Airlines that allowed the company to report lower emissions from SAF use without requiring physical delivery to specific flights.

First-of-a-kind project financing

The fund has also committed more than US$100m to what it calls ""first-of-a-kind"" projects. As the rubric suggests, these are nascent climate technologies that have been caught in limbo, facing financing challenges too large for venture capital but too risky for traditional infrastructure investors.

The team at Microsoft estimates that this gap typically ranges between US$100m-US$180m per project.

The company provided project finance for Climeworks' Orca plant, the world's first commercial direct air capture (DAC) facility, alongside a 10-year offtake agreement for 10,000 tons of CO₂.

In Nigeria, the fund backed Konexa's construction of renewable energy infrastructure linking Heineken's operations to clean power. That particular project has now been commissioned and aims to establish a replicable model for the country's renewable power sector.

Measuring catalytic impact

The Climate Innovation Fund has not been a case of scattergun investing. Microsoft has been determined to extract as much information from these investments as possible, evaluating the success and viability of projects for the benefit of future investments.

To this end, the Washington-based company has developed a framework alongside Rhodium Group that assesses both direct emissions reductions from invested projects and ""catalysed"" reductions from helping technologies reach cost parity with conventional alternatives.

For emerging climate technologies like low-carbon steel and DAC, the fund reports that catalysed emissions reductions could substantially exceed the direct reductions from individual projects.

Microsoft has acknowledged that the per-dollar emissions reductions from these early-stage investments tend to fall below those from more mature technologies like solar and wind, though it argues that this is a necessary part of the R&D process as it lays the groundwork for future markets and future solutions.

Geographic and social considerations

So far, about 19% of the fund's capital has been allocated to projects in the Global South, including a great deal of investments in energy access across Africa.

The fund backed CrossBoundary Access, which finances mini-grids across the continent, and invested in WaterEquity's initiatives that improve water and sanitation infrastructure across South and Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.

And of all the start-ups in the fund's portfolio, 22% of the CEOs and founders are women, while 21% come from underrepresented backgrounds.

""Our goal isn’t just to become more sustainable but also to help every organisation in Africa and the world to do the same,"" says Lillian Barnard, Microsoft's Chief of Enterprise Partners for the Middle East and Africa.

Why Microsoft sees AI as the key to climate innovations

As Microsoft has become more involved with AI, so too has the fund. The project has increasingly incorporated AI into its investment strategy, with the team describing the technology as an ""innovation amplifier"".

Some recent investments on this front include Vibrant Planet, a company that uses AI-powered geospatial analytics to detect and reduce the risks of wildfires. Another is Terradot, a start-up that applies AI to enhanced rock weathering – a novel way of removing carbon from the atmosphere.

These investments in particular speak to the philosophical direction that Microsoft has been going in over the past few years. The company believes that AI's ability to measure, predict and optimise complex systems is going to be essential in the fight against climate change.

The problem is that, for now at least, AI is the single fastest growing source of carbon emissions in Microsoft's entire value chain. The firm's leadership hopes that the benefits it imparts will outweigh the issues it creates in the long run.

As aviation accelerates towards net-zero, one message has become unmistakably clear — no company can decarbonise alone. Airlines, airports, fuel producers, freight forwarders, shippers, and technology providers are increasingly coming together to tackle one of logistics’ greatest challenges: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from air cargo.

Airports as innovation hubs

Among the airports leading this transition is Edmonton International Airport (YEG), which has positioned itself as a hub for hydrogen and clean aviation technologies. Earlier this year, YEG joined H2CanFly, a pan-Canadian consortium advancing hydrogen-powered flight and supporting infrastructure.

“As Canada’s first airport-based hydrogen hub, YEG is helping test scalable solutions that could shape net-zero aviation,” said Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Director of ESG & Sustainability Strategy at YEG.

YEG’s decarbonisation efforts extend beyond aircraft fuel. The airport is piloting Diesel Tech Industries’ Guardian Hydrogen Diesel System on heavy-duty runway sweepers and expanding its hydrogen-powered ground vehicle fleet. It is also supporting ShipAlberta, a digital logistics platform connecting small businesses to global markets — reinforcing its commitment to link economic growth with environmental responsibility.

Data-driven sustainability and partnerships

Chivot-Legris said that partnerships and data-driven innovation form the foundation of the airport’s climate roadmap.

“We joined the Net-Zero Challenge by the Government of Canada in 2022, and we're now a proud bronze participant,” she explained. “That partnership with the government helps us navigate the challenging journey of identifying pathways to reach net-zero by 2050.”

“As Canada’s first airport-based hydrogen hub, YEG is helping test scalable solutions that could shape net-zero aviation.”

Marion N. Chivot-Legris, Edmonton International Airport (YEG)

She stressed the need for close collaboration with governments, academia, and industry to explore clean technologies, assess climate risks, and empower airports to take ownership of their sustainability goals.

“As part of H2CanFly, we aim to accelerate both infrastructure and aircraft technology development to make hydrogen aviation a reality,” Chivot-Legris added.

With 60% of Canada’s hydrogen produced in the Edmonton metro region, YEG is ideally positioned to serve as a testbed for hydrogen applications in aviation. The airport is collaborating with Airbus, CAE, and the National Research Council of Canada to advance hydrogen-powered flight over the next two decades.

SAF and circular collaboration

Beyond hydrogen, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains the most immediate lever for aviation decarbonisation — and partnerships are key to scaling it.

In a South American first, Avianca Cargo, The Queen’s Flowers, and Repsol completed the region’s first SAF Book & Claim operation, offsetting emissions equivalent to over 6,000 gallons of jet fuel on a Bogotá–Miami cargo flight. Using the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) framework, the initiative allows verified emissions reductions to be claimed even when SAF is not physically available at every airport — a model proving that collaboration and certification can make cleaner aviation globally viable.

In Europe, DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz have set a new benchmark through their largest-ever SAF deal, purchasing 13,000 tonnes of fuel to reduce 40,000 tonnes of CO₂ on flights between Frankfurt, Beijing, and Shanghai. “Collaborative efforts like this demonstrate how shippers can play a direct role in decarbonising aviation,” said a company spokesperson.

Similarly, Cargolux, AIT Worldwide Logistics, and Microsoft have launched a three-year SAF partnership to transport server racks for Microsoft Cloud Logistics, targeting 66,000 tonnes of CO₂ savings.

Operational efficiency and forwarder collaboration

“Partnerships are extremely important in general for air cargo, but especially in sustainability,” said Anna-Maria Kirchner, Head of Global Sales at Finnair Cargo.

Kirchner emphasised that collaboration across the value chain — from fuel producers to freight forwarders — is vital for meaningful progress. Finnair Cargo works closely with forwarder partners to optimise routes, reduce cancellations, and maximise aircraft load factors. “The fuller a plane is, the less we are wasting any fuel — and that makes operations far more sustainable,” she explained.

Beyond operations, Finnair Cargo also partners with SAF suppliers, hosting educational seminars and joint initiatives to accelerate adoption. “All of this can only be done as a team sport,” she added. “Everyone — from airlines and airports to fuel suppliers, shippers, and even IT companies — plays a crucial role in making flying more sustainable.”

Forwarders driving measurable results

Partnerships between carriers and logistics providers are also producing tangible emission reductions. Avia Solutions Group, in collaboration with DHL Express, achieved a 12.61% emissions reduction (30.6 tonnes) between January and April 2025 through DHL’s GoGreen Plus service, powered by SAF supplied by bp and Neste.

On the supply side, Neste has ramped up production at its Rotterdam refinery to 1.5 million tonnes annually, with plans to reach 2.2 million tonnes by 2027. Meanwhile, Amazon Air signed an agreement with Neste to supply 7,500 tonnes of SAF for operations at San Francisco International Airport and Ontario International Airport, marking Ontario’s first use of SAF.

Energy innovation and the future of SAF

While SAF remains costlier than conventional jet fuel, industry experts agree it is indispensable to achieving net-zero goals. Broader collaboration — including new entrants, hydrogen development, and circular logistics — is essential to scaling impact.

According to Boeing’s World Air Cargo Forecast, the air cargo market is expected to grow 4.0% annually through 2043, with the global freighter fleet reaching 3,900 aircraft. Freighters are projected to handle over half of total air cargo traffic, while express carriers will account for around 25%. Rapidly growing corridors such as South Asia–East Asia, Domestic India, and Africa–East Asia — each expected to expand around 7% annually — present both opportunities and sustainability challenges.

“For me, nuclear is an important component of the future in terms of power generation to enable the production of SAF.”

Richard Forson, Cargolux

“We need more and more airlines to embark on their sustainability journey. We need more and more corporate customers to reach agreements with airlines to buy SAF and reduce their CO₂ footprint,” said Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and Fuel Efficiency at Airbus, in a video by Neste.

Nuclear power and long-term solutions

In an interview with The STAT Trade Times at transport logistic and air cargo Europe 2025 in Munich, Richard Forson, CEO of Cargolux, highlighted a longer-term perspective — the potential role of nuclear power in producing SAF sustainably.

“I see Microsoft and Google investing in restarting nuclear power plants,” Forson said. “For me, nuclear is an important component of the future in terms of power generation to enable the production of SAF.”

He mentioned that the growing energy needs of data centres cannot be met by wind or solar alone, while coal and gas face strong resistance. “Nuclear, for me, is the answer for these data centres because of the power needed to cool the equipment running inside,” he added.

Forson believes that while nuclear energy is a long-term enabler, the immediate path forward lies in collaboration and innovation. “The immediate option could be to bring in new players, enable more collaborations, and develop new technologies to produce SAF more sustainably,” he said.

The power of collaboration

From hydrogen and SAF to digital platforms and data sharing, the common denominator is clear — partnerships are no longer optional; they are essential.

By aligning incentives, sharing technologies, and coordinating strategies, airlines, shippers, fuel producers, and airports are proving that emissions reductions can be measurable, scalable, and economically viable.

The air cargo industry’s sustainability journey is a collective one — and as Forson, Kirchner, and Chivot-Legris all demonstrate — collaborative innovation remains its most powerful engine for change.

Introduction

Business Roundtable appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reconsider and remove program obligations for most source categories under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and suspend program obligations for other sources until reporting year 2034.

Business Roundtable remains concerned by the growing risks from global climate change, including significant economic risks (e.g., technological and market shifts and regulatory and policy risks). Business Roundtable member companies are leading by example, developing and deploying ambitious emissions reduction plans, and exporting innovative technologies that will help lower emissions in the United States and globally, while simultaneously spurring innovation, manufacturing and economic growth. Business Roundtable looks forward to helping advance policies that leverage U.S. leadership, competitiveness and innovation to mitigate the impacts of global climate change while growing our economy.

Business Roundtable welcomes the Administration’s commitment to addressing burdensome regulations, including paperwork and reporting burdens. However, we are concerned that a sudden change to the current program could result in piecemeal, duplicative, incomplete and more burdensome greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting obligations for U.S. companies that also disadvantage them globally. We urge EPA to carefully consider options that would allow the GHGRP reporting framework to continue so that it is not inadvertently recreated at an even greater expense to U.S. business in a scattershot, non-uniform way via other state and foreign governmental avenues. We also urge the agency to hear from stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by the agency’s actions and take the necessary steps to coordinate across federal agencies that would also face impacts from the proposal.

GHGRP Data is a Critical Tool for Various Reporting, Disclosure and Compliance Obligations

The GHGRP provides standardized, facility-level emissions data that U.S. companies have relied on for effective regulatory enforcement, tax credit administration, international trade compliance and voluntary disclosures. The proposed changes risk fragmenting emissions reporting across the U.S. economy, introducing regulatory uncertainty and upending an existing process for international trade compliance, particularly for U.S. exports. The comprehensive data set that GHGRP provides, including current emissions levels and historical trends, is also important for helping to prevent ill-informed policies from being adopted.

GHGRP data is central to the administration of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).2 Under current IRS rules, CO₂ injected into secure geologic storage qualifies only if verified under Subpart RR with an EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) plan. Removing this pathway would potentially jeopardize sequestration projects, create regulatory uncertainty and chill investment. This would undermine the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that preserved 45Q and increased the value of the credit in some circumstances. At a minimum, elimination of GHGRP will require the IRS to amend its regulations to require new monitoring, reporting and verification protocols—prior to EPA finalizing this rule. Timing is of the essence to ensure the left hand is aware of the right hand’s actions, such that a gap between changes does not undermine investments in major infrastructure projects, including projects based on 45Q credits that taxpayers are relying on in the 2025 tax year.

Other credits such as 45V (clean hydrogen), 40B (sustainable aviation fuel), 45Z (clean fuel production credit) and 48C (advanced energy projects credit) rely on emissions factors from Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model,3 which uses this federally verified GHGRP data as a key input. It is unclear how this data can be replicated in a cost effective or timely way should EPA remove GHGRP obligations, thus creating uncertainty for past, current and future investment decisions relying on these credits. Again, if EPA were to move forward with a final rule that prevents companies from utilizing GHGRP data to claim inextricably linked federal tax credits, Business Roundtable would encourage ample time be afforded to stakeholder engagement to build consensus with private businesses that have relied on U.S. tax policies enacted and sustained with bipartisan support in Congress, which could be abruptly undermined if EPA does not engage across government agencies, particularly with the Department of Treasury in this instance.

Elimination of GHGRP Likely Will Result in Piecemeal Reporting Obligations That Are Incompatible, Incomplete and More Expensive

GHGRP provides a trusted dataset used by state regulators and private companies. If GHGRP obligations were to cease, some states can be expected to step into the void and promulgate their own data collection and reporting obligations. These new requirements, adopted on a piecemeal state-level basis, are at significant risk of becoming inconsistent, creating a cumbersome, balkanized and more expensive reporting obligation for companies subject to the requirements than if the current GHGRP were to continue as is.

EPA estimates the total cost of reporting to be $303 million per year, with subpart W reporting accounting for $256 million of the annual costs.4 Under EPA’s proposed rule, subpart W companies would be relieved of their reporting obligations until 2034.

Companies that are subject to GHGRP have made the necessary investments to monitor emissions, and capture and report the required data. One-time hardware and software investments and employee training necessary to be able to report the data required by GHGRP far exceed on-going costs associated with the program. While on-going reporting costs are not inconsequential, we would expect them to be significantly less than the costs that would be incurred by businesses if they are required to recreate and comply with differing monitoring and reporting obligations likely to emerge at the state and international level if GHGRP were to end. This fragmented reporting system would in turn result in higher costs and less data consistency than if the current GHGRP was left in place. Simply put, the result of the repeal of the GHGRP will be to impose costs that are likely to far exceed the estimated savings associated with repealing the current program in exchange for a sub-optimal, inconsistent, fragmented reporting system.

U.S. Competitiveness in Foreign Markets Would be Undermined

U.S. exports of energy-intensive products would be disadvantaged under the proposed rule. Data transparency provides the backbone of the U.S. competitive position on energy dominance. Credible and verified GHGRP data is vital for U.S. competitiveness in global markets, especially with the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), low carbon fuel (LCF) and methane regulations. Without federally verified GHGRP data, U.S. exporters may face default emissions penalties, higher compliance costs and loss of market access. The United States is Europe’s largest Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplier and a major oil exporter to these markets. Moreover, without the GHGRP data to demonstrate our manufacturing emissions profile, the United States may end up with a higher default value under CBAM, thereby undermining U.S. competitiveness in Europe. The net result of eliminating GHGRP could inadvertently harm U.S. competitiveness by weakening exports and run counter to the President’s “Energy Dominance” agenda.

EPA Should Maintain GHGRP as a Voluntary Program if it Determines the Clean Air Act (CAA) Cannot Legally Support a Mandatory Program

In its proposal, EPA indicated that it “considered the alternative of transitioning the GHGRP from mandatory to voluntary reporting” but ultimately rejected this option because it “could also result in submittal of incomplete or piecemeal reports, and the verification and accuracy of the data submitted would be limited.”5 EPA also concludes that “maintaining continuous or intermittent reporting under any of these source categories, including voluntary reporting, is inconsistent with CAA section 114 (emphasis added).”6

Business Roundtable believes EPA’s authority to administer a voluntary program is consistent with section 114. CAA section 114 allows EPA to collect emissions information for GHGs as the CAA contains an underlying statutory purpose to reduce “air pollutants” that can potentially be regulated under the CAA. EPA recently acknowledged its authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA, even if it declines to exercise such authority in the proposed rescission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding (“’Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate’” GHG emissions,7 quoting the Supreme Court’s decision in AEP v. Connecticut “The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.”).8

Business Roundtable maintains that EPA has the legal authority to regulate GHG emissions if it makes the requisite findings and closely hews any regulatory response to the limitations of the Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts v. EPA9 the Court determined that GHGs are covered by the CAA’s section 302(g) definition of “air pollutant,” and that therefore EPA can impose regulations of GHG emissions once the EPA makes the requisite findings under the CAA. Neither UARG v. EPA10 nor West Virginia v. EPA,11 two cases that struck down EPA’s expansive claims of authority to regulated GHGs, disturbed this central finding.

Although EPA asserts that “since 2011 [the EPA] has not used most of the information collected to carry out other provisions under the CAA”12, EPA can potentially use this information for regulation of GHGs. GHGRP supplies the data necessary for informed decision-making for deciding whether, when and how to regulate GHGs. Accordingly, we believe EPA retains the authority to regulate GHGs and as a corollary, to allow voluntary data collection efforts to inform the agency’s future regulatory efforts.

If EPA is concerned about incomplete data, it may still establish minimum standards for voluntary participation, and we encourage it to do so if it chooses to maintain a voluntary program.

EPA has experience with voluntary programs, including programs directly associated with greenhouse gas emissions.13 Retaining GHGRP as a voluntary program should not be unduly burdensome, nor is it inconsistent with EPA’s legal views regarding the limitations of section 114. Moreover, retention of GHGRP in some form will avoid the multiple rulemakings, inconsistent reporting obligations and international trade and regulatory uncertainty that will result if GHGRP is repealed.

Scientists at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are making it possible, converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that could help the aviation industry cut carbon emissions.

The team uses hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a process that mimics how crude oil forms in nature. Wet food waste is exposed to high heat and pressure, producing a “biocrude” oil. This oil is then refined using catalysts to remove oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, resulting in a fuel that meets ASTM and FAA standards for commercial aircraft.

“Food waste is an untapped resource,” said Professor Yuanhui Zhang, lead researcher.

We’re turning something that would release greenhouse gases in landfills into drop-in jet fuel.

The stakes are high. Aviation accounts for a growing share of global emissions, and roughly 30% of food produced worldwide is wasted, often ending up in landfills as methane. Converting this waste into fuel tackles emissions while creating renewable energy.

Challenges remain. Lab-scale production yields are currently modest, and scaling up will require efficient waste collection, industrial refining, and economic feasibility. The researchers stress that partnerships with the aviation industry will be key to bringing this technology to airports worldwide.

Beyond aviation, the process could turn other wet biomass, like algae, sewage sludge, or agricultural residues, into fuels or industrial chemicals, supporting a circular bioeconomy.

“This isn’t a magic solution,” Zhang added. “But it’s a step toward turning waste into value and flights into cleaner skies.”

The UK is moving too slowly in its efforts to decarbonize aviation, a sector responsible for a significant portion of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s think tank has warned that the government must accelerate its efforts to cut aviation emissions in order to meet net-zero targets. This is the third time in 2023 that Blair has spoken out about the UK’s green policies, highlighting the urgent need for cleaner fuel alternatives to traditional jet fuel.

Aviation Emissions and the Climate Crisis

Aviation accounted for around 7% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, equivalent to 29.6 million tons of CO2. The Climate Change Committee forecasts that aviation’s share will increase to 11% by the end of this decade and up to 16% by 2035. This trend presents a significant challenge to the UK’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and meeting international climate targets.

In a recent report, Blair’s think tank, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI), pointed out that while governments are mandating the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the coming years, the production of SAF is not progressing fast enough to meet the urgent demands of decarbonizing aviation.

What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF is a cleaner alternative to conventional jet fuel and can be produced from various feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and even algae. It has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions when blended with traditional jet fuel. SAF is seen as a key part of the strategy to decarbonize aviation, a sector that remains one of the hardest to decarbonize due to its reliance on jet fuel for long-haul flights.

Currently, the UK government has set a target for SAF to account for 40% of jet fuel usage by 2040, up from just 2% in 2025. However, the TBI has warned that while the early stages of SAF usage will help reduce emissions, a significant portion of global and domestic flights will still rely on conventional jet fuel in the coming decades.

Slow Progress and the Need for Urgency

Despite the growing global push for greener aviation, the pace of SAF production in the UK has been slower than expected. The UK government’s current efforts to expand airport capacity, including the planned expansion of Heathrow, could clash with its legally binding emission limits. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has emphasized the importance of SAF to ensure that economic growth does not come at the expense of the UK’s climate goals.

Blair’s think tank argues that the UK must invest more in SAF production to meet these ambitious targets. While some progress has been made, including the allocation of £63 million in government funding to scale up domestic SAF production, much more needs to be done. According to the TBI, the government should also explore ways to integrate carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures into the SAF production process to further reduce emissions.

A Global Problem: Aviation’s Impact on Climate

Aviation emissions are not just a national issue for the UK but a global challenge. As air travel grows around the world, especially in developing regions, the demand for cleaner alternatives to jet fuel will increase. Governments must collaborate to create a global framework for SAF production and distribution to ensure that the aviation sector can meet future emissions reduction targets.

The Role of SAF in Net-Zero Aviation

The UK government remains committed to its SAF mandate, but as the TBI report highlights, this commitment needs to be accompanied by faster action. According to a Department for Transport spokesperson, the government is seeing “encouraging early signs” in meeting the SAF mandate and believes that SAF is a key part of the global effort to decarbonize aviation.

However, the TBI urges policymakers to go further. It suggests that the financial responsibility for carbon dioxide removal plans should fall on the aviation industry, which is best positioned to afford such measures. The government should continue to support the growth of SAF production but must also ensure that sufficient financial incentives are in place to encourage faster development.

Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Net-Zero Aviation

The UK faces a tough challenge in reducing aviation emissions, but with the right investments and policy changes, it can achieve its climate goals. Tony Blair’s think tank has made it clear that faster action on sustainable aviation fuels is crucial for meeting net-zero targets. While progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. The government, along with private sector stakeholders, must work together to accelerate the production of SAF, reduce the industry’s carbon footprint, and ensure that aviation becomes a cleaner and more sustainable mode of travel in the coming decades.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UK-Airlines.jpeg,N,,2025-11-03 16:56:23.813691

A recently unveiled system from Honeywell, a conglomerate corporation headquartered in the United States, can convert agricultural and forestry byproducts into ready-to-use renewable fuels through an innovative Biocrude Upgrading process. This approach transforms waste biomass into sustainable alternatives for marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel and gasoline, delivering higher energy density than many existing biofuels and enabling ships and aircraft to transition without costly engine modifications.

The technology’s modular, prefabricated design also simplifies deployment and reduces investment risk, addressing one of the biggest barriers to decarbonisation in aviation and shipping, long-standing infrastructure “lock-in” that has kept these sectors dependent on high-carbon fuels for decades. The Renewable Energy Institute supports such innovations across the renewable energy sector, recognising their vital role in accelerating the global transition towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

Shipping and aviation are among the most challenging sectors to decarbonise, together responsible for around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a share that continues to grow as global trade expands and air travel becomes more accessible. Despite major efficiency gains since the 1960s, aviation emissions have quadrupled and rising incomes worldwide are expected to drive demand for both flights and freight. However, a breakthrough in biofuel technology could offer a promising long-range, low-carbon alternative for these industries.

Maritime shipping still depends heavily on bunker oil, the world’s second dirtiest fossil fuel after coal, and if the industry were a country, it would rank as the sixth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to the US Department of Energy. Like aviation, shipping faces major decarbonisation challenges due to its need for highly energy-dense fuels to power heavy loads over long distances with limited refueling opportunities. While biomass has so far been an impractical substitute given the shortage of waste oil feedstocks, emerging advances in producing biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural residues are opening new possibilities for cleaner alternatives.

Developing biofuels that are both practical and affordable is essential to driving meaningful change in the shipping and aviation sectors. As Ken West, president of Energy and Sustainability Solutions, noted in Interesting Engineering, the maritime industry urgently needs renewable fuels that are readily available and economically viable. The new Biocrude Upgrading technology meets this demand by converting waste biomass into high-density fuels while offering systems that reduce costs from installation through refining and use, making the transition to cleaner fuels far more accessible.

While the biofuels industry has experienced several strong growth years, its future momentum will depend on supportive trade and policy environments. Continued collaboration and open trade with key partners such as Canada, an important supplier of agricultural and forestry feedstocks, will be vital to scaling such technologies. The sector remains sensitive to shifts in government fuel standards and trade policies, which could either accelerate or hinder progress towards a lower-carbon future.

The Renewable Energy Institute plays a crucial role in advancing innovation across the renewable energy landscape by providing accredited training and professional development opportunities for individuals and organisations worldwide. By fostering education and collaboration across industries, the Institute helps ensure that breakthroughs are supported by a skilled workforce capable of driving the global shift to a sustainable energy future.

By providing long-term revenue predictability for SAF producers, this initiative will encourage investment in manufacturing capacity, ensuring the country can meet its SAF Mandate commitments. This move will help reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation sector while also supporting the growth of the green economy.

Creating Green Jobs and Economic Growth

One of the primary goals of the SAF revenue certainty mechanism is to stimulate economic growth. With the right investment in sustainable fuel production, the UK can expect to see a rise in skilled job opportunities within the aviation sector. The new green jobs will play a pivotal role in the country’s transition to a low-carbon economy, reinforcing the UK’s position as a leader in sustainable aviation technology.

This initiative will not only help reduce aviation emissions but also offer significant economic benefits. By creating a strong domestic SAF industry, the UK can reduce its dependence on imported fuels while creating new markets for sustainable aviation products. For global travelers, this translates into an aviation industry that is committed to reducing its environmental impact and providing cleaner, more sustainable travel options.

The Role of Aviation Fuel Suppliers in the Mechanism

The government has proposed that the SAF revenue certainty mechanism be funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. These suppliers are vital to the smooth operation of the aviation industry, ensuring the safe and reliable provision of fuel to aircraft. By implementing a levy, the UK aims to create a sustainable financial model for SAF production without overburdening consumers.

The consultation seeks to outline the key considerations for this levy, including how it will be applied and how it will impact the aviation fuel supply chain. By working closely with industry stakeholders, the UK government aims to strike the right balance between encouraging SAF production and ensuring the smooth operation of the aviation industry.

A Step Towards Achieving Net Zero Aviation

This consultation is a significant step towards the UK’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050. Sustainable aviation fuel is a key component in this strategy, as it offers a practical solution to reducing carbon emissions from aircraft. By supporting the domestic production of SAF, the government hopes to achieve substantial emissions reductions and support the growth of green technologies in the aviation sector.

The proposed mechanism aligns with the UK’s broader carbon budget commitments and is a crucial part of the government’s decarbonization strategy. As global travelers, we will likely see a future where flying becomes more environmentally friendly, with airlines increasingly relying on SAF to reduce their carbon footprints.

The Future of Sustainable Air Travel in the UK

For travelers, this initiative signals a future of greener, more sustainable air travel in the UK. The SAF revenue certainty mechanism is part of a broader government effort to ensure that the aviation sector plays its part in achieving the country’s net-zero target.

Coulson SafeFuel is the world’s first patented onboard fuel-quality assurance and protection system. It continuously analyzes the product during refueling, detecting contamination or chemical degradation in real-time, preventing unsafe fuel from ever reaching the tanks.

The innovation comes amid growing safety concerns following multiple fuel-related incidents in military and commercial aviation, and recent Navy aircraft accidents under investigation.

Coulson Aviation’s aircraft often operate in remote environments around the world, where the risk of contaminated or off-spec fuel is heightened. Over years of operations, the company has encountered issues ranging from water-laden Jet A and microbial growth to cross-contamination, while the industry has seen increased fuel issues, including contamination from DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) and SAP (Super Absorbent Polymer) from aging filter separators. One such incident resulted in one of Coulson’s jets having an engine flameout during an overwater ferry flight, a near-disaster that underscored the absence of onboard fuel technology across aviation.

Developed and patented by Coulson’s in-house team, SafeFuel integrates directly into an aircraft’s single-point refueling manifold and analyzes fuel during refueling. The system verifies key parameters in real time and automatically notifies the flight crew and can halt fueling if contamination or out-of-spec readings are detected before fuel reaches the tanks. Each fueling is digitally recorded, providing traceability and a verifiable chain of custody for operators, OEMs, and regulators.

“We’ve spent decades designing aircraft to survive any emergency, but none of that matters if the fuel itself isn’t safe,” said Britt Coulson, President & COO of Coulson Aviation. “As the industry transitions to Sustainable Aviation Fuels and complex global supply chains, the risks multiply and even small deviations can have catastrophic consequences. When only a few gallons of off-spec fuel can bring down a $100 million aircraft, it’s time for aviation to recognize that fuel is the final unmonitored frontier. SafeFuel closes that gap permanently.”

b) Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organisations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply chain carbon footprint credibly and cost-effectively.
SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand programme for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF Levy.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy. SAFCo is set up as a non-profit Company Limited by Guarantee wholly owned by CAAS. Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, will chair SAFCo’s Board. Ms Tan Seow Hui, a seasoned leader in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed as its founding Chief Executive Officer.

The setting up of SAFCo follows the passing of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 14 October 2025, which allows for the implementation of SAF policies for air transport in Singapore and empowers CAAS to collect a SAF Levy, to set up a SAF Fund and to procure, manage and allocate SAF andSAF environmental attributes (EAs) or to establish and appoint a central procurement entity to carry out these functions. More details on the SAF Levy amounts will be shared later.

Through SAFCo, CAAS seeks to build a transparent and integrated SAF demand market that brings together airlines, corporate buyers of SAF, fuel producers, carbon market platforms and stakeholders across the aviation fuel chain in Singapore to aggregate demand, stimulate investment and accelerate the use of SAF:

a) SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF Fund to achieve the 1% SAF target in 2026, for flights departing Singapore. The amount of SAF procured by SAFCo will increase accordingly when the SAF target is raised to 3–5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF. SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA. With predictable cashflows from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.

b) Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organisations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply chain carbon footprint credibly and cost-effectively. The demand from the SAF Levy forms a scalable baseload, enabling SAFCo to negotiate attractive pricing for SAF and SAF EAs, and to anchor long-term supply agreements. Businesses that participate in SAFCo’s voluntary SAF purchases can leverage this baseload to unlock economies of scale. They can also gain access to competitively priced and verified SAF and SAF EAs through SAFCo and avoid the need to set up their own procurement systems.

As a new entity, SAFCo’s immediate priorities will be to establish robust governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build manpower and procurement capability, while engaging stakeholders on the implementation, ahead of the first SAF procurement in 2026. SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand programme for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF Levy. SAFCo will reach out to businesses and airlines to encourage them to partner SAFCo and use its central procurement mechanism for voluntary SAF purchases. Conversations are ongoing; SAFCo will provide more details on the side of the Singapore Airshow in February next year.

SAFCo will also support the development of the SAF supply ecosystem in Singapore and the region. With predictable and stable cashflows, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still nascent SAF market. This approach aims to encourage investment in SAF production capacity and the development of SAF-related carbon markets in Singapore and the region.

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS and Chairman of SAFCo said, “Singapore is taking a pragmatic, balanced and action-oriented approach to advancing sustainability in the aviation sector. The setting up of SAFCo is another concrete step forward. Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF Levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

Ms Tan Seow Hui, Chief Executive Officer of SAFCo said, “I am honoured to lead SAFCo at this pivotal stage. My priority will be to put in place credible and scalable frameworks, partnerships and processes to ensure that SAFCo delivers on its mandate to aggregate demand, procure SAF efficiently, and manage SAF EAs transparently. By working closely with airlines, businesses and suppliers, we aim to facilitate greater SAF adoption in the region and contribute to the decarbonisation of aviation.”",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-6.png,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:10.491433

Following the Prime Minister’s meeting with Vietnam’s General Secretary yesterday, VietJet has announced a significant order for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft.

The Transport Secretary visited Airbus’ site in Bristol lawst week to mark the order and see how this will allow Airbus to continue investing in research and development.

Overall, the deal supports Airbus’ 79,000 strong supply chain and 12,000 employees across the country, with Airbus estimated to bring £5.3 billion to the economy each year.

The wings for 100 aircraft will be manufactured at Airbus’ Broughton site in North Wales, with their design developed at the company’s Filton facility, showing a strong pipeline from concept to reality delivered from the UK. This programme will safeguard highly skilled jobs across both regions, supporting delivery of the Plan for Change.

The deal comes alongside further investment from Vietjet into the UK aviation sector, with Vietjet and Rolls Royce signing a deal for 92 Trent 7000 engines to be manufactured in the UK for use in 40 A330 Neos, also set to support thousands of high-skilled jobs.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “This landmark deal shows that British innovation continues to be at the forefront in connecting the world.

“By working hand-in-hand with our international partners, we are helping our aerospace sector soar, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs, boosting our economy, and delivering real benefits for working people across the UK as part of our Plan for Change.”

Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “This major investment from VietJet is a big vote of confidence in British aerospace and engineering, and will support jobs across the country to deliver our Plan for Change.

“Homegrown research and development is vital to our net zero ambitions and I’m delighted that this order will encourage investment back into aviation innovation – helping us to continue as a global leader in the industry.”

The Government is also supporting sectors such as aviation with major investments to encourage innovation, including £20.4 billion for research and development across the UK until April 2026.

Further funding to support aviation innovation was also announced over the summer, with £63 million to encourage the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels, and £4 million allocated to grassroots research projects trialling next-generation drone technology.

These investments have been echoed by strong industry support, with energy logistics firm Exolum recently announcing the creation of a brand-new Sustainable Aviation Fuel supply network, starting with a fuel blending facility in Portishead, just outside Bristol.

The Government is supporting airport expansion at Gatwick and Luton – where capacity upgrades have been approved – and Heathrow. The moves support the Government’s growth mission and any expansion will be balanced with environmental, climate and air quality aims.

By encouraging investment that feeds back into innovation, such as VietJet’s order, aviation can take advantage of cleaner, greener technology to reduce it’s carbon footprint and expand airports responsibly.",,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:16.025445

The future of sustainable aviation fuel - Circular Online,Not Available,,,,,https://www.circularonline.co.uk/features/turbulence-ahead-the-future-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel/,"Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to slash emissions from aviation and create a market for waste that cannot be recycled.
This is where sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) comes in.
It’s important to bear in mind, however, that SAF is only sustainable if it’s made from a sustainable feedstock.
The word sustainable means different things to different people – for example, is growing so-called ‘energy crops’ that are destined for SAF production, sustainable?
While numerous SAF production facilities have been announced, current production is less than 1% of the 400 billion litres required annually by 2050.","Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to slash emissions from aviation and create a market for waste that cannot be recycled. Ian Farrell asks what’s the catch?

Aviation is a highly carbon-intense activity, but only makes up 2.5% of the world’s CO2 emissions. That sounds like a contradiction, until we factor in an important statistic: it is estimated that only 10% of the world’s population fly.

As incomes and living standards rise, however, so will this figure. Social mobility in countries such as India and China will undoubtedly mean a rise in passenger aviation, while imports mean an increase in freight flights, too.

To add to the problem, while aviation only contributes 2.5% of CO2 emissions, it is responsible for 4% of anthropological global temperature change, thanks to emissions of soot and water vapour, sulphur aerosols and contrails. Some of these heat the planet; others cool it – but the net effect is one of warming.

The aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 looks like a difficult one to achieve. Other carbon-intensive activities are gradually being replaced or refined to make them less polluting – for example, the electrification of automobiles, and the rise in solar and wind farms. But aviation is much harder to decarbonise.

The energy density of hydrocarbon jet fuel is hard to match, especially with current approaches to electrification. There is a lot of research happening in the field of hydrogen-powered aircraft, but this will take time and require the replacement of perfectly serviceable aircraft that cost hundreds of millions of dollars each.

What’s needed in the meantime is a stop-gap solution that can be ‘dropped in’ to existing aviation-fuel infrastructures, enabling the industry to use existing equipment more sustainably while new technology is brought to market. This is where sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) comes in.

Blending fuels together

SAF is virtually identical to the JET-A1-grade kerosene fuel obtained by refining crude oil, except it comes from different sources that are part of a circular closed-loop cycle. At the moment, SAF is blended with JET-A1 up to a maximum 50% mix.

Both fuels are a mixture of hydrocarbon fuel molecules, but JET-A1 also contains aromatic (cyclic) molecules. These have a lubricating role in engines, but are costly to synthesise by themselves, so they are added by blending together SAF and JET-A1.

Eventually, 100% SAF flights will happen – test flights across the Atlantic have already taken place – but modifications to engines and fuel pumps will need to be made first.

SAF can be produced by a number of industrial processes, but the original starting materials are often organic waste. This could be waste oils and fats from food manufacturing, municipal food waste, agricultural by-products and waste, forestry residues, and animal slurries. Even the CO2 from carbon-capture processes can be used in SAF manufacture.

Currently, the most popular way of making SAF is from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids – the so-called HEFA process. These waste materials are first treated with hydrogen to remove oxygen, which breaks them down into hydrocarbon chains. These are then chemically reacted to produce SAF. This process saves around three-quarters of the carbon emissions from fossil jet fuel and is already certified for use in a 50% blend on commercial flights.

The HEFA pathway is currently the only fully commercialised method, and will probably supply the majority of SAF until 2030. However, there is a naturally limited amount of available feedstock for it. Clearly, other processes are needed.

An alternative is to use the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process – an old piece of organic chemistry that is used extensively in the chemical industry – to convert syngas into fuel. Syngas (which gets its name from synthesis gas) is formed from biomass, including municipal solid waste, agricultural wastes, forest wastes, wood, and energy crops. Johnson Matthey is one of the companies taking this forward, with its HyCOgen process, which uses bespoke catalysts to do the necessary chemistry. SAF made in this way can also be blended up to 50% with fossil-derived fuel.

A third option is alcohol-to-jet chemistry. This involves the conversion of cellulosic or starchy alcohols (usually ethanol and isobutanol) through a series of chemical reactions. The alcohols are derived from cellulosic or starchy feedstocks via fermentation or gasification reactions.

In total, there are eight certified processes for making SAF and more will surely emerge as research continues. It’s important to bear in mind, however, that SAF is only sustainable if it’s made from a sustainable feedstock.

The word sustainable means different things to different people – for example, is growing so-called ‘energy crops’ that are destined for SAF production, sustainable? Some would say ‘yes’, as they take CO2 from the air, which is then put back again when the fuel is burned – a closed system.

Others point out that there is more than climate change at play here: land use, biodiversity, water use and food security also need to be taken into account. Deforestation, to make space to grow energy crops, is obviously extremely unfavourable.

The waste industry, however, can provide exactly what SAF production needs, in the form of solid municipal waste.

Harder than it looks

It’s not time to enjoy guilt-free sustainable flying just yet, however. Getting the right waste to where it needs to be for SAF production is not as easy as you might think.

Although multiple biomass feedstocks can be used by gasification-based technologies, the supply chain for used cooking oil and animal fat, as well as forest and agricultural residues, is not well established.

Additionally, the low-energy density of forest residues makes it uneconomical to transport them long distances to a refinery. Unless supply chains are developed with intermediate densification (such as pellets or bio-oils), large-scale SAF facilities could be difficult to establish.

All this will require considerable investment and innovation, and support from governments and industry. The International Energy Agency’s Task 39 evaluated the current state of SAF production in its January 2024 report (bit.ly/3X37aXu). While numerous SAF production facilities have been announced, current production is less than 1% of the 400 billion litres required annually by 2050.

A 2023 Royal Society report (bit.ly/3EEarGq) estimates municipal waste arisings could contribute 12Mt per year of feedstock for bioenergy production. With a 10% conversion rate, this would contribute 1.2Mt per year of fuel, or 10% of the total amount of fuel required.

There is clearly potential for growth, and a market for those collecting municipal solid waste that cannot be recycled, but can SAF compete with current long-term contracts with energy from waste (EfW) facilities?

The inclusion of EfW in the Emissions Trading Scheme could affect things, as could legislation prohibiting the use of single-use plastics, but local authorities are unlikely to change contracts to an as-yet unproven SAF producer at the moment.

If they fail to dispose of the waste, then the local authority could fall into legal default and risk having to pay dearly to send it to landfill – defeating the purpose of the whole SAF exercise.

In summary, if SAF production from waste is to become a reality, there will need to be a wholesale overturning of the current UK waste management system that will take years to achieve.

Remember – SAF is only a stop-gap solution, favoured by the aircraft operators, who can use it within their existing fleets. The aircraft industry, however, is concentrating on its development into hydrogen. Rolls-Royce, General Electric, Airbus, Pratt & Whitney, and Boeing are all developing hydrogen-fuelled engines and aircraft.

It seems as if SAF, at the volumes currently being considered, could have a relatively short shelf life. l",https://www.circularonline.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-2149783756.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:20.689467

Road transport will move to a 10 percent bioethanol blend (E10) by 2030 and 15 percent (E15) by 2035, while aviation will introduce a five percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend, marking a first step toward aligning Ethiopian Airlines with global decarbonisation standards, according to a file obtained by Birrmetrics.

“The strategy aims to ensure energy security through locally sourced biofuels, reduce exposure to global oil price volatility, and create sustainable rural jobs,’” the document states. “By 2035, Ethiopia’s biofuel sector will be a core pillar of the country’s green and inclusive growth agenda.”

Ethiopia’s energy mix remains heavily reliant on biomass, which accounts for nearly 87 percent of primary energy consumption, while oil makes up only eight percent. Imported petroleum, also nearly eight percent of the total energy supply in 2023, draws significant foreign currency and exposes the economy to global price volatility. The strategy aims to address these vulnerabilities by expanding biofuel use in transport and aviation, turning agricultural output into energy feedstocks and generating rural employment through cultivation and processing.

The updated plan coincides with a high-profile partnership announced on October 24 between Sunbird Bioenergy Africa and the Ethiopian Mining Corporation (EMC) to develop a 23,000-hectare agricultural biorefinery, set to begin operations by 2030. The facility will produce SAF for aviation, ethanol for transport, and household biofuels, while supporting the government’s parallel transition toward electric vehicles, liquefied natural gas, and compressed natural gas.

The biorefinery is projected to produce enough SAF to meet the 10 percent aviation blending target, with annual output estimated at 530,000 million litres between 2028 and 2030. Household clean cooking fuels, replacing kerosene, charcoal, and LPG, are expected to reach 120–150 million litres per year from 2025 to 2030. Transport ethanol blends (E10–E20) could generate 115–230 million litres annually in the same period.

A core component of the roadmap is a regulatory and investment framework to attract private capital and ensure market stability. The Ministry plans to collaborate with the African Development Bank and World Bank to provide financing instruments and risk guarantees for biofuel producers and distributors.

The strategy outlines an end-to-end value chain. Sugar cane will serve as the main source for bioethanol, while oil-rich crops such as Ethiopian mustard will be cultivated for biodiesel. The use of non-food feedstocks is intended to prevent competition with food production while expanding agricultural opportunities.

“The revised framework creates clear market signals through mandatory blending, ensuring long-term investor confidence,” the strategy reads. “It integrates climate action with rural industrialisation, placing agriculture at the centre of Ethiopia’s energy transformation.”",https://birrmetrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1400x900-2025-11-03T144625.089.png,N,,2025-11-03 11:00:26.329481

This fall, the University of Minnesota's Forever Green initiative is in the early stages of a study to determine the next steps for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. A key ingredient is winter camelina, a cover crop that not only protects the soil from erosion but has the potential for commercial use.

Mitch Hunter, co-director of the Forever Green Initiative at the University of Minnesota, said right now, they are green rows of little plants that will fully blossom in the spring.

""After the plant flowers, those flowers will turn into fruit packed with seeds, and inside each one of those seeds, you have 35 or so percent oil,"" Hunter explained.

Minnesota researchers and their partners are leading a charge to convert seed oil into low-carbon jet fuel airlines can use to reduce emissions. Last fall, a test flight using Sustainable Aviation Fuel flew out of the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Hunter pointed out the latest research aims to lay out a blueprint detailing what is needed to scale up production. Challenges include perfecting crop varieties and finding enough processing capacity.

Eric Kukowski, a fourth-generation farmer in Northern Minnesota, just planted his share of winter camelina across roughly 640 acres. It is his third season of trying out the crop. As with researchers, there is a learning curve for him, including the best time in the fall for putting the seeds in the ground. He said it is an easy crop to manage.

""I don't have to babysit it,"" Kukowski emphasized. ""I can take care of my other crops and make sure they're producing like they're supposed to.""

Honeywell biocrude technology for sustainable fuel marks a transformative leap in renewable marine fuels by shifting away from costly, food-grade feedstocks and harnessing an untapped resource: abundant agricultural and forestry residues. Traditional biofuels often depend on vegetable oils or animal fats, which not only compete with global food supplies but are also vulnerable to price volatility and limited scalability. Furthermore, Honeywell's innovative biocrude upgrading technology uses materials such as wood chips, crop stubble, nutshells, and bark—resources typically regarded as waste or in need of disposal.

The essence of this innovation lies in its two-stage processing chain. Initially, local facilities at feedstock collection points convert raw biomass into a dense, stable biocrude. Following this, the biocrude is transported to centralised hubs for advanced upgrading utilising proprietary catalysts and reactor designs. This model greatly decreases transportation costs, boosts energy density, and enables on-site waste valorization strategies.

Key Technical Advantages Over HEFA-Based Systems

Comparison Factor Honeywell Biocrude Traditional HEFA Primary Feedstock Agricultural/forestry waste Vegetable oils, animal fats Feedstock Cost Low (waste materials) High (food-grade oils) Energy Density Enhanced through upgrading Standard biodiesel levels Carbon Efficiency Optimised multi-stage process Single-stage processing Scalability Modular deployment Large centralised facilities

This divergence not only alleviates supply chain pressure but also allows regions with excess agricultural waste or timber industry byproducts to contribute to decarbonisation efforts profitably.

Why Are Maritime Operators Prioritising Drop-In Biocrude Solutions?

The maritime sector faces intensifying demands to reduce emissions. New regulations from the International Maritime Organisation stipulate a 20% cut in greenhouse gas intensity from shipping by 2030, necessitating solutions that can be integrated quickly and economically. Mainstream marine fuel alternatives, such as LNG or methanol, frequently require substantial modifications to engines and supporting infrastructure.

Honeywell's biocrude yields a drop-in renewable fuel that mirrors the combustion and handling properties of traditional marine bunker oils. As a result, marine vessels can immediately adopt lower-carbon fuels with:

No retrofits or engine overhauls

Unchanged maintenance protocols

Stable training requirements for crews

Smooth integration into existing bunkering logistics

Maritime Decarbonisation Drivers

Regulatory Compliance: IMO 2030 targets and emerging carbon emission schemes force rapid emissions reduction.

Economic Pressure: Carbon taxes and pricing mechanisms add operating costs for carbon-intensive fuels.

Supply Chain Demands: Major cargo customers demand sustainable logistics and low-carbon certification.

Competitive Advantage: Early movers attract sustainable shipping contracts and enhance market positioning.

How Does The Modular Plant Design Accelerate Commercial Deployment?

The standard biofuel plant business model entails capital-intensive investments and construction times that often exceed half a decade. Honeywell's modular system revolutionises project development by offering pre-engineered, standardised processing units. These units can be rapidly deployed, assembled near feedstock sources, and scaled incrementally.

Strategically, this enables operators to:

Minimise transportation distances for bulky raw biomass

Reduce construction and permitting risks

Start small and scale in response to market growth

Distribute production across regions with seasonal or local feedstock surpluses

Deployment Timeline Comparison: While traditional biofuel plants may require 4-6 years before production, Honeywell's modular approach can transition from site selection to commercial operation within just 18-24 months.

This agility is crucial given the rapid evolution of fuel regulations and market signals in marine decarbonisation. However, implementing electrification and decarbonisation across various industries requires careful planning and strategic deployment.

What Feedstock Flexibility Does This Technology Offer Producers?

A hallmark of Honeywell's biocrude upgrading process is its broad feedstock compatibility. This flexibility enables operators to blend or switch between various forms of biomass based on pricing, geographic distribution, and local partnerships. By capturing a wider array of agricultural and forestry byproducts, the system insulates producers from single-source supply shocks.

Primary feedstock categories encompass:

Agricultural Residues

Corn stover, wheat straw, and barley stems

Rice hulls, sugarcane bagasse

Nut shells, fruit pits, and other processing waste

Forestry Byproducts

Logging debris, wood chips, and sawdust from sustainable forest management

Bark, branches, and storm damage recoveries

Sawmill and pulp mill residues

Energy Crops

Purpose-grown short-rotation woody crops and perennial grasses

Algae (in selected regional applications)

Dedicated energy plantations on non-arable land

This multifaceted strategy aids rural economic development and valorises resources that would otherwise contribute to landfill volume or open burning emissions.

How Does Biocrude Upgrading Compare To Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production?

While Honeywell's platform is capable of supplying both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and marine fuel markets, maritime applications are particularly advantageous due to:

Less stringent fuel quality specifications relative to aviation, lowering upgrading costs

A larger, more immediate addressable market: annual marine fuel consumption hovers near 300 million tonnes, compared to around 95 million tonnes for aviation

Alignment with shipping's accelerated decarbonisation timeline, which demands scalable solutions pre-2030

London Stansted Airport (STN) has released its latest Sustainability Report, outlining key achievements from the past five years under its strategy Working together for a brighter future. The strategy reflects the airport’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions, creating jobs and training opportunities, and supporting local communities.

The five-year plan focused on three main priorities: achieving zero carbon airport operations, creating opportunities for all, and engaging local voices. These priorities were developed under Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which also owns Manchester and East Midlands airports.

Among the airport’s most notable achievements are establishing a target to reach net zero carbon operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2038, launching the Jet Zero curriculum at its Aerozone education centre to teach young people about Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and securing planning permission for a 14.3MW on-site solar farm, the first of its kind at a London airport. Construction on the solar farm is already underway.

Over the five-year period, Stansted also generated more than £7.6 million of new business for local small and medium-sized enterprises through its Meet the Buyers events and donated over £665,000 to community organisations via the Stansted Community Fund.

In the final year of the strategy, the airport began installing high-speed electric vehicle chargers and welcomed the 25,000th visitor to the Aerozone since its opening in 2015. It also marked the 10th anniversary of its school mentoring programme with Forest Hall School in Stansted Mountfitchet, which helps Year 11 students gain skills and confidence as they prepare for life beyond school.

Stansted’s Airport Academy has also played a major role in local employment, supporting more than 5,000 jobseekers with free training and advice to begin or advance their careers in aviation.

Earlier this year, London Stansted launched its new five-year sustainability strategy, Creating a sustainable future for all, which aims to build on existing progress and further accelerate the transition to net zero carbon operations by 2038.

Gareth Powell, Managing Director of London Stansted, said:

“The past five years have seen the airport make excellent progress delivering a host of projects and initiatives against our three strategic priorities: Zero Carbon Airport, Opportunity for All and Local Voices. I’m very proud of our achievements, particularly in light of the unprecedented challenges we faced because of the pandemic.

“These positive developments include securing planning permission for our 14.3MW on-site solar farm, which in now well underway and when complete in spring next year will be the first of its kind at a London airport. Alongside this, our education and employment programmes supported more than 40,800 people, and we donated more than £665,000 to local causes through our Community Fund.

“During the final year of our Strategy, our hard work continued to deliver successful sustainability initiatives, including the installation of 10 new high-speed Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers for EV owners using the airport.

“We were also pleased to welcome the 25,000th visitor to our on-site Aerozone education facility since it opened in 2015, demonstrating the scale of our positive impact on young people in our region.”

Looking ahead, Stansted aims to grow sustainably by applying to increase its passenger limit to 51 million per year on its existing runway, without operating additional flights beyond those already approved.

Powell added:

“We want to grow the airport in the most sustainable and responsible way possible and have applied to increase our passenger limit to 51m per year on our existing runway without operating any additional flights beyond those already approved. We recognise to achieve this goal our ambitious approach to sustainability must continue, so earlier this year we launched our new Sustainability Strategy: Creating a sustainable future for all.

“The new Strategy builds on a more than two decades long commitment to sustainability as our industry moves towards its net zero targets. It reaffirms our commitment to providing opportunities for education and employment, as well as ensuring the voices of those who live closest to our airports are heard, understood and valued.

“I would like to thank everyone at Stansted Airport for their continued hard work and commitment to deliver our sustainability programme and look forward to celebrating future achievements together.”

The energy transition will affect every part of our industry.
By participating in the conversation, we can help shape a transition that is practical, inclusive, and grounded in the realities of freight.","Australia’s freight and logistics sector is facing a pivotal moment.

For decades, our industry has enabled the movement of goods across cities, regions, and borders – supporting supply chains and underpinning economic activity.

But as the urgency to reduce carbon emissions grows, we must confront a fundamental question: how do we continue to deliver essential transport services while transitioning away from carbon-intensive fuels?

This is not a distant challenge. It is already reshaping the way we operate. Regulatory pressures, shifting customer expectations, and the increasing viability of alternative technologies are converging to make the transition to lower-emitting fuels a reality. The question is no longer if we transition, but how – and how quickly.

Australia’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 62–70 per cent below 2005 levels by 2035 sets a clear direction for the nation’s energy future. This ambitious target, supported by the Climate Change Authority, is part of a broader strategy to reach net zero by 2050.

For the freight industry, which is heavily reliant on diesel and other liquid fuels, this means significant change is on the horizon.

Recognising the scale of this challenge, the federal government has committed $1.1 billion to stimulate domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. These “drop-in” fuels – designed to work with existing engines and infrastructure – offer a practical pathway for decarbonising sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as heavy transport, aviation, and shipping.

Biofuels represent a promising solution. Australia has access to abundant feedstocks like canola, sugarcane, and agricultural waste, and the potential to build a thriving domestic biofuel industry.

The Cleaner Fuels Program aims to unlock this potential, supporting innovation and investment across the supply chain – from farmers to refiners to fleet operators.

At the Victorian Transport Association, we recognise that this transition will be complex. It will require thoughtful planning, investment, and a willingness to adapt. But it also presents an opportunity to rethink how we power our fleets, design our infrastructure, and future-proof our operations.

To support this, the VTA is convening its fourth Alternative Fuel Summit on Tuesday, November 18 in Melbourne at Hyatt Place, Essendon Fields. The theme – “Is the transport industry ready to decarbonise?” – reflects the urgency and complexity of the issue.

The summit is not about promoting a single technology or pathway. It’s about creating space for informed discussion, sharing experiences, and learning from those already navigating the transition.

The program includes contributions from energy providers, infrastructure specialists, legal experts, and sustainability leaders.

Speakers such as Professor Hadi Ghaderi from Swinburne University will offer insights into supply chain decarbonisation, while case studies from operators like DHL, Fleet Plant Hire, and Cookers Oil will highlight practical approaches to reducing emissions while maintaining service excellence.

Panel discussions will explore the regulatory and commercial landscape, with input from organisations including Gallagher, Impact HQ, and NetNada. Legal and infrastructure perspectives will be provided by Hall & Wilcox, NTI, Mondo, and others, helping attendees understand the broader systems that will shape the transition.

I encourage transport operators, fleet managers, and suppliers to attend, not because the answers are simple, but because the questions are too important to ignore.

The energy transition will affect every part of our industry. By participating in the conversation, we can help shape a transition that is practical, inclusive, and grounded in the realities of freight. You can register at vta.com.au.

While the transition to lower-emitting fuels will undoubtedly be challenging – requiring new thinking, new investments, and new partnerships – it also offers a chance to improve how we operate.

Cleaner fuels can lead to more efficient fleets, reduced maintenance costs, and better alignment with customer expectations. More broadly, they contribute to a healthier environment, stronger communities, and a more resilient economy.

In Europe, regulators have already mandated a minimum 2% SAF blending rate, increasing to 6% by 2030.
By establishing SAFCo, Singapore is signalling its intent to remain a leading aviation hub while aligning with global net-zero targets.","The Singapore government has announced the formation of a new state-owned firm to procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for flights departing the city-state, marking a significant step in its aviation-sector decarbonisation strategy.

The new entity, called SAFCo, will be responsible for collecting a green-fuel levy imposed on all passengers and cargo flying out of Singapore. Funds raised will be used to create a dedicated pool to purchase SAF and distribute it to airlines operating from Changi Airport and Seletar Airport.

Under the policy, Singapore intends to achieve a SAF blending rate of at least 1% in the fuel used at its airports by next year, with a target of between 3% and 5% by 2030, depending on the evolution of global SAF markets and availability.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) Director-General Han Kok Juan, who will chair SAFCo, said the company is already in discussion with multinational partners and has received strong interest from potential suppliers. Centralised procurement, he explained, allows Singapore to act as a single large buyer, helping achieve economies of scale and better pricing.

The levy, announced earlier this year, is expected to range between S$3 and S$16 per economy-class passenger, depending on flight distance. This contribution will help offset the cost of greener fuel and reduce reliance on conventional jet fuel.

Implications for the Aviation and Fuel Sectors

By aggregating demand through SAFCo and introducing the levy, Singapore is taking a proactive stance to reduce aviation emissions and stimulate SAF supply. The approach addresses two of the main obstacles to wider SAF adoption: its higher price and inconsistent demand across airlines.

For carriers operating out of Singapore’s airports, the scheme means the costs of the transition will be shared collectively rather than borne individually. It also reduces exposure to the volatile pricing of emerging SAF markets. For fuel producers and suppliers, the arrangement offers a stable demand base and a predictable customer, encouraging greater investment in production capacity.

Asia’s SAF production capacity is forecast to grow sharply in the coming years, with several refineries under construction or expansion. However, demand has so far lagged due to limited policy frameworks and cost concerns. Singapore’s initiative could therefore act as a catalyst for regional growth and coordination in sustainable fuel use.

Broader Context and Regional Significance

The aviation industry contributes roughly 2–3% of global carbon emissions and remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Sustainable aviation fuel is currently viewed as the most viable medium-term solution, as electric and hydrogen-powered flight technologies are still years away from commercial scalability.

In Europe, regulators have already mandated a minimum 2% SAF blending rate, increasing to 6% by 2030. Asia, in contrast, has been slower to adopt binding targets, largely due to supply constraints and the high cost of production. Singapore’s model could set a benchmark for other regional hubs seeking to balance environmental responsibility with competitiveness.

By establishing SAFCo, Singapore is signalling its intent to remain a leading aviation hub while aligning with global net-zero targets. The centralised procurement model ensures coordination between regulators, airlines, and suppliers, positioning the country as a testbed for large-scale SAF implementation.

Challenges and Next Steps

Despite its promise, the plan faces several challenges. The levy must raise sufficient funds to meet the 1% target in the short term and scale effectively to reach 3–5% by the end of the decade. If SAF prices rise sharply or supply tightens, Singapore may need to adjust its levy or revisit its blending targets.

Another issue is logistical readiness. SAF requires dedicated infrastructure for blending, certification, and storage to maintain quality and ensure compatibility with existing aircraft engines. Expanding these systems will require significant coordination between airports, fuel distributors, and regulators.

For airlines, the added cost per ticket could present pricing pressures, especially for low-cost carriers. Although the levy is modest, maintaining competitiveness while advancing sustainability goals will require careful balancing.

Outlook for Stakeholders

Airlines: Should engage with SAFCo early to plan procurement and adjust operational models to integrate SAF use efficiently.

Fuel producers: Can benefit from a more predictable offtake structure and potential long-term contracts.

Policy makers: May look to replicate Singapore’s model to overcome financing and coordination barriers elsewhere.

Investors: SAF infrastructure and feedstock supply chains represent expanding opportunities in the decarbonisation space.

Passengers and cargo clients: Though the levy slightly increases travel costs, it also represents a tangible contribution to cleaner air transport.

Singapore’s move to establish a state-owned procurement company and fund it through a passenger levy reflects a pragmatic balance between climate ambition and economic realism. If successful, the approach could serve as a blueprint for other nations seeking to decarbonise aviation without undermining growth or competitiveness.",https://netzerocompare.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/spaces/fuel_aviation.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 11:02:07.819353

Additionally, Airbus will provide the Indonesian Air Force with comprehensive training and support services to ensure a smooth entry into service.

In the context of this A400M delivery, Indonesia will study the potential integration of the newly developed A400M firefighting kit on-board both aircraft.

The roll-on / roll-off modular firefighting kit allows the A400M to be rapidly converted into a water bomber aircraft, capable of dropping up to 20,000 litres of retardant or water in a single pass. This new capability will significantly bolster Indonesia’s ability to respond to wildfires across its widespread and often hard-to-reach terrain.

The A400M delivered to Indonesia is configured for cargo, troop transport, MEDEVAC, and humanitarian missions. It can carry a maximum payload of up to 37 tonnes of heavy or oversized loads, including helicopters, vehicles, and relief supplies. For an average mission carrying 30 tonnes, the A400M can fly 2,400 nautical miles, covering the entire archipelago from Jakarta.

Designed for operational flexibility, it can operate on short, unpaved runways and also serves as a multi-role aerial refuelling platform, acting as a force multiplier that extends the reach of the Indonesian Air Force.

Europe’s push toward large-scale green hydrogen production has reached a major milestone with the successful commissioning of the MultiPLHY project — the world’s first high-temperature, multi-megawatt electrolyzer system integrated into an industrial operation. Launched in early 2020, the initiative unites leading industry partners Neste, Sunfire, CEA, Paul Wurth, and ENGIE, aiming to demonstrate how high-efficiency hydrogen production can be achieved within existing industrial settings.

The project is hosted at Neste’s renewable products refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, one of the most advanced facilities globally for producing renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). By coupling Sunfire’s Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) technology with the refinery’s processes, MultiPLHY showcases how renewable electricity and waste heat can be leveraged to produce green hydrogen with exceptional efficiency.

In the following interview, Sunfire’s CTO and Co-Founder Christian von Olshausen sheds light on how its SOEC technology works, what makes it a game-changer for industrial-scale hydrogen production, and how the lessons from MultiPLHY are shaping the next generation of electrolyzers.

1. Can you explain how the SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell) technology works and what makes it suitable for industrial-scale hydrogen production? How are your electrolyzers different from traditional electrolyzers?

Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) technology is an advanced form of electrolysis that operates at high temperatures around 850°C. At these elevated temperatures, water (steam) is split into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity and heat. Because much of the energy required for splitting water comes from heat rather than electricity, our SOEC technology achieves a significantly higher electrical efficiency compared to low-temperature electrolysis technologies.

The heart of an SOEC is a solid ceramic layer that lets oxygen ions pass through. Inside the cell, steam is turned into hydrogen at one side (the cathode). The oxygen moves through the ceramic and leaves as oxygen gas on the other side (the anode). This is the reverse of how a solid oxide fuel cell works.

So, what makes SOEC especially suitable for industrial-scale hydrogen production is its ability to integrate with existing industrial processes and use waste heat to further boost efficiency. The high operating temperature also enables co-electrolysis, where water and CO2 can be converted into syngas – a valuable feedstock for producing e-Fuels and chemicals.

SOEC combines superior efficiency, scalability, and process integration potential, making it a leading technology for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors and enabling large-scale green hydrogen and e-Fuel production.

2. This electrolyzer has been described as the world’s largest multi-megawatt high-temperature electrolyzer in an industrial setting . What does this mean for the broader hydrogen industry?

The MultiPLHY project marks a major milestone for the hydrogen industry. This commissioning proves that our SOEC technology can deliver on an industrial scale, following several successful demonstration projects at smaller capacities. The system shows that electrolysis can deliver the volumes of green hydrogen industry needs. What’s now required are the right political frameworks and final investment decisions to accelerate adoption and ensure that Europe secures technology leadership in the global hydrogen market.

3. Are there plans to further increase the capacity of this high-temperature electrolyzer? What’s next for Sunfire after this milestone — are there ongoing projects that build upon the learnings from MultiPLHY?

Within the ongoing test program of the MultiPLHY project, we are gathering valuable operational experience and performance data from the world’s largest SOEC electrolyzer in an industrial environment – insights that enable us to continuously further develop and optimize the technology. Building on these learnings, we’re upscaling SOEC for even larger applications, demonstrating that the technology is ready to deliver at multi-megawatt scale.

With the launch of our Generation 3 SOEC electrolysis technology last year, we are introducing a modular concept built around a powerful 10 MW module – designed for large-scale deployment, similar to our proven pressurized alkaline systems. We are ready to work with our customers to bring SOEC technology into applications in the double-digit, and soon even triple-digit, megawatt range – step by step, following the successful path we have already taken with our pressurized alkaline technology.

4. Do you see this project as a blueprint for future large-scale installations in other refineries or industrial clusters?

Absolutely. The MultiPLHY project demonstrates how SOEC technology can be deployed at industrial scale. Its modular, high-capacity design shows that these systems can be adapted to other refineries and industrial use cases, step by step, just as we have successfully scaled our pressurized alkaline technology. The project provides valuable operational data and insights that can be applied to near future installations, making it a blueprint for rolling out large-scale green hydrogen production across Europe and beyond.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-03 08:16:57.470436

From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude.","Airplane travel is more popular than ever, and our desire for fast transportation means jet fuel has become a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at University of Illinois.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

Zhang has developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, and he said SAF provides a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he concluded.

The new Biocrude Upgrading process technology produces “drop-in” fuels, including marine fuel, gasoline, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), from inexpensive biomass sources such as wood chips and crop residues.

The technology addresses one of the key challenges in decarbonising heavy transport sectors: producing cost-effective, energy-dense fuels that can be used as direct replacements for conventional fossil fuels. Honeywell’s process creates “drop-in” renewable fuels that can be blended or used directly without requiring costly engine modifications.

Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, said the maritime sector urgently needs renewable fuels that are both affordable and readily available. “Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use,” he said.

The system converts plant and agricultural waste into lower-carbon biocrude at collection sites, reducing transportation costs. This biocrude can then be refined at major facilities to produce renewable fuels with performance comparable to conventional petroleum products. Delivered as prefabricated modular plants, the technology helps reduce project risk, shorten construction timelines, and accelerate deployment.

The launch comes as the shipping industry intensifies its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which currently account for about 3% of global totals. Heavy fuel oil has dominated maritime transport since the 1960s, but stricter international regulations and customer pressure are driving demand for cleaner alternatives.

From 2026, all departing flights must use at least 1 per cent sustainable fuel, and are expected to increase usage to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Going beyond Singapore The sustainable aviation fuel levy is a meaningful first step.","The recently passed bill to impose a levy on passengers of all departing flights from Singapore marks a turning point in the country’s efforts to decarbonise its transport sector.

The levy, which will fund the procurement and use of sustainable aviation fuel, signals Singapore’s intention to adopt cleaner fuels in the transportation sector despite the higher prices of such fuel. Proceeds will go into a fund managed by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, which will help airlines offset some costs of adopting sustainable fuel blends.

From 2026, all departing flights must use at least 1 per cent sustainable fuel, and are expected to increase usage to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030. Given the limited regional supply and high prices of such fuel, the levy will help to level the playing field by supporting airlines through the transition.

A good start, but not enough

This new levy is an encouraging move. It sends a strong policy signal and ensures that decarbonisation costs are shared more equitably between consumers and industry.

But it also represents just one side of the equation. To make low-carbon fuel a lasting part of the energy mix, Singapore must now focus on building up the supply side – supporting the producers who can deliver such fuel sustainably and at scale.

Without targeted support for biofuel producers, the country risks becoming dependent on imported sustainable aviation fuel indefinitely, exposing itself to global price swings and supply disruptions.

How can biofuel producers become sustainable?

Biofuels remain a critical pillar of the energy transition. They strengthen energy security while helping to decarbonise sectors where electrification alone cannot yet reach.

They are particularly vital for hard-to-abate industries such as aviation, shipping and heavy road transport, where technologies such as hydrogen and electrification are yet to mature.

The recent White Paper from the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute at NUS (SGFIN), Sustainable Business in Biofuels, highlights several opportunities for both biofuel suppliers and policymakers to strengthen producers’ business resilience.

The biofuel industry’s long-term sustainability depends on whether producers can overcome key challenges such as financing, technological innovation and policy support.

Financing the missing middle: Unlike mature renewable sectors such as solar or wind, biofuels have not benefitted from the same cost declines or scale efficiencies. The International Renewable Energy Agency indicated that the levelised cost of energy for biofuels has remained stagnant at about US$0.90 a kilowatt-hour over the past 15 years, even as solar and wind costs have plunged by 90 and 70 per cent, respectively.

The reason lies in the capital-intensive nature of biofuel projects. Refinery construction, feedstock collection and refining technologies all require heavy upfront investment – often too risky for private financiers.

At the research and development (R&D) and pilot phases, venture capital plays a catalytic role. But as companies scale, concessional debt and corporate investments still dominate – accounting for nearly three-quarters of total financing at maturity. This shows that public or quasi-public capital remains indispensable for de-risking private participation.

Building business resilience through circularity: Beyond financing, biofuel producers need business models that can withstand cost volatility and feedstock fluctuations. SGFIN’s research points to circular business models as a promising way forward.

By turning waste into resources, producers can diversify revenue streams and reduce operating costs. For example, they can collect tipping fees from agricultural waste, sell surplus heat or electricity generated during refining, or reuse by-products such as biochar as fertilisers or catalysts.

Such circular practices create a self-reinforcing system in which waste becomes value, improving profitability while enhancing environmental sustainability.

In short, sustainability and commercial viability can coexist – but only if producers receive support through the early, most difficult stages of scaling up.

Incentivising R&D and innovation: Technology remains another bottleneck. Advanced biofuels made from waste, algae or genetically modified feedstocks are more sustainable but also more complex to produce.

Direct support, such as R&D grants or production credits, could help unlock innovation. Financial instruments that hedge against feedstock price swings would also give investors more certainty.

Providing supply-side support: While countries such as the US and Brazil have provided substantial subsidies for biofuel producers, Singapore has so far focused mainly on demand-side measures such as mandates and levies.

That may need to change. Introducing supply-side incentives could reduce production costs and business risks, which in turn would attract more private investors and stimulate local and regional production capacity from biofuel producers headquartered in Singapore.

Going beyond Singapore

The sustainable aviation fuel levy is a meaningful first step. It demonstrates the country’s commitment and lays the foundation for cleaner fuels in aviation.

While Singapore remains a relatively small player in biofuel production, it sits at the heart of a region rich in biomass and agricultural residues. Across Asean, the potential for sustainable feedstocks is vast, from agricultural waste in Indonesia and Malaysia to sugarcane bagasse in Thailand and rice husks in Vietnam.

This presents a strategic opportunity for regional collaboration. Singapore could act as a convener – working with Asean policymakers to harmonise standards, strengthen supply chains and build a cross-border biofuel market.

Such cooperation would not only boost regional energy security but also reinforce Singapore’s role as a trusted hub for sustainable finance, technology innovation and international trade.

The carriers won’t support expansion if it requires a hefty levy on fares, but Heathrow’s investors won’t sanction expansion unless it does.
Why on earth would Heathrow’s investors agree to put money into someone else’s scheme?
‘No evidence’ for economic growth Any legal challenge to Heathrow’s expansion could be bolstered by the recent warning from a cross-party group of MPs that the UK’s net zero target is in ""serious jeopardy” from airport expansion.
They also criticised the DfT for not having revised its Airports National Policy Statement in advance of committing to Heathrow expansion, arguing this “does not allow proper consideration and scrutiny of airport expansion proposals”.","The Department for Transport (DfT) announced a speed-up in development of a third runway at Heathrow in mid-October with transport secretary Heidi Alexander announcing a “swift and robust review” of the government’s Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) “to deliver Heathrow expansion”.

Alexander claimed the process would “be three years faster” as a result, telling Parliament that a draft ANPS setting out the case for expansion would be ready for consultation next summer and restating the government’s ambition to see “flights take off from a new runway by 2035”.

It’s unusual for a consultation to be announced more than six months in advance. They are often announced with little fanfare, so the timing was interesting.

The announcement was almost certainly geared to the Budget on November 26, with the government keen for the Office for Budget Responsibility to factor in the economic impact of Heathrow expansion to its GDP forecasts for the Treasury.

But the reality is that development of a third runway will move at its own pace – dependent not only on planning permission and the certainty of legal challenges but also on a deal on funding between major airlines, Heathrow investors and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

The carriers won’t support expansion if it requires a hefty levy on fares, but Heathrow’s investors won’t sanction expansion unless it does.

The CAA has already stated that “any approach we adopt will involve the costs of capacity expansion being recovered through airport charges” so the airlines won’t be happy.

Iata reiterated the carriers’ approach following the DfT’s announcement, suggesting: “The political haste to move quickly to capture the economic benefit of construction will seriously handicap the UK if it fails to build something that is affordable.”

It criticised “Heathrow’s long addiction to gold-plated construction costs” and warned: “The cost impact of Heathrow’s current proposal will make the airport unaffordable.”

On Heathrow’s part, chief executive Thomas Woldbye had already warned the airport “would not be able to make the necessary investments” without passing on the costs.

So, the government’s speedier delivery of its Airports National Policy Statement is neither here nor there.

Alexander confirmed the government will decide which of two runway schemes to proceed with – Heathrow’s or that of property and construction group Arora – by the end of November. But it would be a surprise if it jettisoned Heathrow’s plan.

Why on earth would Heathrow’s investors agree to put money into someone else’s scheme?

The government also confirmed it’s pressing ahead with reform of the UK’s planning system to try to boost economic growth, through a Planning and Infrastructure Bill aimed at speeding up delivery of major infrastructure projects.

‘No evidence’ for economic growth

Any legal challenge to Heathrow’s expansion could be bolstered by the recent warning from a cross-party group of MPs that the UK’s net zero target is in ""serious jeopardy” from airport expansion.

The Environmental Audit Committee accused the government of being unable to provide “any evidence” for its assertion that expanding airports will bring economic growth.

It’s report in October asserted: “The government has not demonstrated economic growth from airport expansion provides enough benefit to outweigh the negative climate and environmental impacts.”

The MPs noted aviation is already “one of the slowest decarbonising sectors” and that the government “is not supportive of demand management” despite its own advisory body, the Climate Change Committee, declaring that such management is “fundamental” to delivering net zero.

They also criticised the DfT for not having revised its Airports National Policy Statement in advance of committing to Heathrow expansion, arguing this “does not allow proper consideration and scrutiny of airport expansion proposals”.

The MPs noted previous aviation minister Mike Kane had confirmed there would be no decision on Heathrow before publication of an update ANPS. However, Kane was replaced in September.

The committee also warned the government that it is relying on measures to decarbonise flying – sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), improved efficiency and carbon offsets – which have limits that are “not factored in”.

It said this “puts the government’s delivery on carbon budgets and Net Zero in serious jeopardy”.

The MPs pointed out the government likewise continues to ignore non-CO2 impacts such as condensation trails (contrails) which could double the impact of flying on global warming.

They noted aviation was projected to become the UK’s largest contributor to climate change by 2040 before ministers committed to expansion at Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton and London City and pointed out: “There is a significant divide as to the necessity and level of support for airport expansion [and] considerable disagreement over the estimated costs and benefits.”

The committee’s report concluded: “The government’s Jet Zero Strategy... requires significant carbon savings from the rollout of technology that has yet to be seen on a commercial scale.”

It also concluded: “The aviation sector does not fully pay for its carbon emissions [which] makes aviation artificially cheap and provides the industry with benefits other essential sectors don’t benefit from.

“The government should ensure the aviation sector pays its fair share.”

Heathrow chief financial officer Sally Ding nonetheless urged ministers “to move forward” on expansion as she reported record passenger numbers of 63.3 million for the nine months to September, saying: “We’re working to unlock a third runway which can be operational within a decade.”

Separately, Gatwick warned its plan to bring a second runway into use could be threatened by a hike in business rates, saying this would have “consequences” for investors “before we commit ourselves” to expansion.

Stewart Wingate, managing director of Gatwick parent company UK Airports, suggested the airport was “looking down the barrel” of a 300% rise in its current bill for business rates of £40 million a year following a revaluation by the Valuation Office Agency.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/378/shutterstock-heathrow-runway1_Thumb.webp,N,,2025-11-03 08:17:29.481717

Introduction

India stands at a pivotal moment in global climate governance, facing the dual challenge of ensuring inclusive development for 1.4 billion people while fulfilling ambitious climate targets. This dual responsibility has positioned the country as both a vital stakeholder and an emerging leader in shaping international climate diplomacy.[1] While India is the world’s third-largest emitter in absolute terms[2], its per capita emissions remain far below the global average, lending weight to its long-standing call for ‘equity and climate justice’ on the world stage.

Domestically, India has matched its commitments with action. It has pledged to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45% from 2005 levels by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. Notably, the country has already exceeded its Nationally Determined Contribution (“NDC”) of sourcing 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels well before the 2030 deadline.[3] This delivery record enhances India’s international credibility and supports its growing role as a solutions provider, particularly for the Global South.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has aptly summed the Indian stance as below[4]:

“Beyond mere adherence to international agreements, India’s pursuit of sustainable development reflects the complex interplay between environmental conservation, social equity, economic prosperity and climate change. Its national goals in this regard require a holistic understanding of sustainable development that balances immediate needs with long-term sustainability, ensuring that present actions do not compromise the well-being of future generations. It acknowledges that solutions to today’s challenges must not only address pressing issues but also lay the groundwork for a resilient and equitable future.”

Even the central regulator of the country’s monetary system, the Reserve Bank of India, is committed to supporting green initiatives and is working steadfastly to realise the vision of building a financial system that can not only withstand future climate shocks, but also actively contribute to India’s journey towards a sustainable and resilient future.[5]

This article explores how India is capitalising on this momentum in climate diplomacy through its flagship multilateral initiatives, including the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, and the Global Biofuels Alliance, among others. These platforms demonstrate India’s strategic shift towards promoting fair cooperation, technology sharing, and South-South partnerships, which are increasingly vital for driving collective global climate action.

The International Solar Alliance (ISA): Charting a New Era in Global Climate Diplomacy

Introduction and Genesis

The creation of the ISA represents a watershed in global climate governance, reflecting both the urgency of energy transition and the promise of South-South cooperation. Initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and launched in collaboration with then-President Francois Hollande of France on 30 November 2015 at COP21 in Paris, the ISA emerged from the strategic need to implement the Paris Agreement.[6] It also holds the distinction of being the first treaty-based intergovernmental organisation headquartered in India, located in Gurugram, Haryana.

The ISA’s founding vision was based on the shared reality of solar-rich nations located between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn; countries blessed with plentiful sunlight but burdened with energy poverty and high investment risks. India referred to these nations as “Suryaputra” or “Sons of the Sun,” emphasising their collective potential. The primary objective was clear: to increase demand for solar technologies and financing across developing economies, thereby lowering costs, reducing policy uncertainties, and attracting the private capital necessary for a clean energy transition.

Strategic Mandate and Importance

The ISA’s mission is embodied in its ‘Towards 1000’ strategy, which aims to mobilise over USD 1 trillion in solar investments by 2030 and to support the deployment of 1,000 GW of new solar generation capacity.[7] Its strategic relevance can be assessed through three critical dimensions:

Climate Mitigation and Energy Access (SDGs 7 & 13): By prioritising solar deployment, the ISA directly promotes Sustainable Development Goals 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and 13 (Climate Action). For developing nations, solar energy offers a dual benefit: (i) supporting industrialisation while avoiding carbon lock-in, and (ii) providing decentralised, clean power to nearly one billion people who still lack reliable electricity.

Market Aggregation and De-risking: At its core, the ISA is an innovative force in the economy. By consolidating demand for solar technology and facilitating collective procurement, it achieves economies of scale that lower the Levelized Cost of Electricity (“LCOE”). More importantly, it acts as a de-risking platform, making volatile political and financial markets more appealing for foreign direct investment. This role is crucial for driving solar infrastructure development in regions that have traditionally been overlooked by global capital.

South-South Cooperation: Unlike traditional aid frameworks between the more developed and the less developed or developing economies, the ISA embodies a horizontal model of partnership. Its initiatives, such as the STAR-C programme[8] for capacity building, foster knowledge exchange, technology transfer, and collaborative innovation across the Global South. This positions the ISA not merely as a donor-recipient model, but as a platform for shared problem-solving.

Challenges and Constraints

Despite its ambitious mandate, the ISA confronts significant constraints that temper its transformative potential.

Financial Mobilisation: The ISA’s USD 1 trillion target remains formidable. Actual capital inflows, especially to Least Developed Countries (“LDCs”) and Small Island Developing States (“SIDS”), have been slow. Conventional policy harmonisation is inadequate to bridge the financing gap. Without effective risk-mitigation mechanisms, private investors remain hesitant to commit to projects in fragile markets.

Geopolitical Limitations: Although the ISA enhances India’s global stature, its influence is limited by structural realities. India does not dominate low-cost solar manufacturing, which is primarily led by China, and cannot yet match the scale of concessional finance provided by Western institutions. These restrictions currently hinder its ability to turn diplomatic capital into tangible economic benefits.

Policy and Regulatory Barriers: Within member states, bureaucratic inertia, inconsistent grid infrastructure, and retroactive policy changes weaken investor confidence. Such governance challenges risk delaying project implementation despite ISA’s efforts at aggregation and standardisation.

Challenges in Cross-Border Grid Connectivity: The ISA’s primary focus on off-grid solar projects has raised concerns about its ability to handle the much more complex task of developing cross-border grid links.[9]

Potential, Impact, and Future Role

The ISA’s long-term potential lies in its ability to promote systemic change. Initiatives such as One Sun, One World, One Grid (“OSOWOG”), first proposed by the Prime Minister of India at the inaugural assembly of the ISA,[10] although technically complex, exemplify this goal; imagining a globally connected solar grid where the sun’s energy is harnessed continuously across different time zones.

By anchoring its mandate in solar energy, the most abundant renewable resource across its member states, the ISA is uniquely positioned to advance decarbonisation while simultaneously promoting inclusive development. Its impact will ultimately be measured not merely in gigawatts installed but in avoided emissions, improved energy security, and the creation of sustainable livelihoods. In this sense, the ISA’s promise extends well beyond infrastructure. It is a vehicle for reshaping the global energy order.

Recommendations for Enhanced Effectiveness

To realise its full potential, the ISA needs to refine its institutional and financial architecture. Three scholarly recommendations are especially noteworthy:

Establish a Risk-Guarantee Fund: The ISA should set up an internationally supported Solar Risk-Guarantee Mechanism, collaborating with Multilateral Development Banks (“MDBs”) and donor countries. By offering first-loss guarantees, this fund could bridge the trust gap between cautious financiers and high-risk markets, particularly in LDCs and SIDS.

Promote Local Manufacturing and Technology Transfer: To reduce reliance on limited sources within the global supply chain, the ISA should actively support the development of regional solar manufacturing hubs in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. This would diversify production, foster local industrial ecosystems, and enable member states to collaborate effectively in adding value to the solar economy.

Integrate Storage and Grid Solutions: The intermittency of solar power remains a core challenge. The ISA should lead the development of a Global Storage Facility and invest in advanced battery technologies to transform solar energy from intermittent to a reliable base-load source. It is also worth noting that the Minister for New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India, has recently stated that the country is developing some of the world’s most advanced high-efficiency cells, such as TOPCon or Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact. Additionally, research institutes are advancing Perovskite technology, refining it for practical use, which is all part of the broader vision for a fully integrated Swadeshi infrastructure.[11]

As the urgency of climate action intensifies, the ISA offers a pragmatic yet ambitious pathway, one where the sun becomes not only a source of light but a cornerstone of global climate justice.

The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI): Towards Global Risk Governance

Introduction and Genesis

Following the ISA in 2015, the establishment of the CDRI in 2019 marks a significant milestone in India’s progressive climate diplomacy. The CDRI seeks to address the systemic vulnerabilities of global infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks. Launched by the Prime Minister of India at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September 2019, the CDRI became an international organisation in 2022. It is a multi-stakeholder partnership involving national governments, UN agencies, MDBs, the private sector, and academic institutions, operating with an interim secretariat in New Delhi, India.

The foundational idea for the CDRI was inspired by a crucial policy realisation that the cascading failure of infrastructure systems (power, transport, telecommunications, water) during extreme events accounts for a significant portion of economic losses and disrupts vital services, hindering long-term development progress.[12] This realisation was reportedly prompted by India’s experience, especially the aftermath of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake. The concept was officially outlined during the 2016 Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, placing resilient infrastructure at the centre of sustainable development. The CDRI was thus established to change the global approach from a reactive, disaster-response model to a proactive, prevention-focused strategy emphasising capacity building before a catastrophe occurs.

Strategic Mandate and Importance

The primary aim of the CDRI is to enhance the resilience of both new and existing infrastructure systems against climate and disaster risks, thereby supporting sustainable development across all member states. Its mandate is closely aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (SDG 13), and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.[13]

The significance of the CDRI can be examined through three functional pillars:

Systemic Risk Mitigation: Disasters highlight the interconnectedness of modern infrastructure. A failure in the power grid can disrupt telecommunications, impact water supply pumps, and halt transport systems. The CDRI prioritises systemic resilience, moving beyond protecting individual assets to understanding and managing cross-sectoral dependencies. By concentrating on critical sectors such as power, transport, health, and telecommunications, the CDRI aims to safeguard society’s essential “lifelines”.

Global Knowledge Platform: The CDRI serves as a vital hub for knowledge generation and exchange. It develops global methodologies, such as the Infrastructure Resilience Review (IRR) methodology, in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), and formulates guidance like the framework for heat-resilient infrastructure. This technical capacity building assists countries, especially Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the latter supported through the Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) initiative, in updating their national codes, standards, and policy frameworks to incorporate disaster risk reduction (DRR).

Financial De-risking: The global average annual loss (AAL) due to infrastructure damage from disasters is estimated to be hundreds of billions of dollars, representing a significant fiscal challenge. The CDRI works to embed resilience into investment decisions by making the economic case for prevention. By providing tools for cost-benefit analysis and advocating for risk-informed financial taxonomies, it aims to attract private capital and MDB support, establishing resilient infrastructure as a distinct and viable asset class.

Challenges and Constraints

Despite its clear mandate and high-level support, the CDRI faces complex and multifaceted challenges.

Institutional and policy fragmentation within member countries creates a significant challenge. Infrastructure planning, DRR, and climate change adaptation often function separately, causing bureaucratic delays and inconsistent application of resilience standards. Addressing this fragmentation requires profound institutional reform that the CDRI can only suggest, not enforce.

The financing gap for resilience remains significant. Although the economic case for investing in resilience is evident, with returns estimated at up to 6:1 in avoided losses, converting this into bankable projects for risk-averse private investors, particularly in high-risk regions, is challenging. The difficulty lies in moving beyond policy documents to establishing resilient, sovereign-backed risk-sharing mechanisms that lower the capital costs for such projects.

Data and technological hurdles remain. Effective resilience planning demands detailed, multi-hazard risk data and advanced modelling, which are often unavailable or inaccessible in developing countries. Closing this data gap to guide resilient design and policy is essential for CDRI’s success.

Potential, Future Role, and Recommendations

The CDRI is poised to play an increasingly vital role in the future, especially in tackling the interconnected challenges of climate change and pollution. By promoting infrastructure capable of withstanding extreme weather events, CDRI also supports climate adaptation and resilience. Additionally, resilient infrastructure, such as distributed and climate-resilient power grids, enables the continuous operation of green technologies, including electric vehicle charging networks and water treatment plants, which are crucial for reducing pollution and achieving net-zero targets. Emphasising the resilience of existing infrastructure is a key part of sustainable development, ensuring that new investments avoid repeating the mistakes of previously vulnerable, carbon-intensive practices.

To maximise its effectiveness, the following recommendations are suggested:

Mandate Resilience Audits: The CDRI should promote the global adoption of compulsory, systemic resilience audits for all significant public infrastructure investments, directly linked to MDB lending conditions.

Establish a Sovereign Risk-Sharing Facility: To address financing constraints, the CDRI should advocate for the creation of a pooled, multilateral Sovereign Resilience Investment Fund. This fund would offer concessional financing and credit guarantees specifically for resilience-enhancing retrofitting and new DRI projects in vulnerable nations, effectively bridging the gap in risk-return expectations for private finance.

Promote Nature-Based Solutions (NBS): The CDRI should strengthen its focus on integrating NBS, such as restoring wetlands, mangroves, and urban green spaces into infrastructure planning. These solutions often deliver resilience benefits (e.g., coastal protection and flood attenuation) alongside co-benefits in pollution reduction and biodiversity enhancement, providing a holistic approach to sustainable infrastructure.

By adopting these strategic enhancements, the CDRI can reinforce its position as the leading global partnership, fostering systemic resilience and ensuring that the infrastructure supporting human progress remains secure against future threats.

The Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA): Towards Energy Transition

Introduction and Genesis

Following the ISA and CDRI, a third India-led initiative was launched at the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Summit on September 9, 2023, in the form of the GBA. Its creation marks a significant collaborative effort among major biofuel producers (such as the United States, Brazil, and India) and consumers, aimed at accelerating the global development and adoption of sustainable biofuels. The GBA is organised as a multi-stakeholder partnership involving governments, international organisations (including the IEA and World Bank), and industry bodies.[14] Its main aim is to position biofuels as a key element of the global energy transition, advancing beyond fossil fuels to reach net-zero emission targets.[15]

The core idea behind the GBA stemmed from two main goals: improving global energy security and addressing climate change, especially in the difficult-to-decarbonise transport sector. Major biofuel-producing nations, such as India, aimed to utilise their domestic biomass resources to decrease reliance on expensive imported crude oil, a realisation strengthened by global geopolitical instability. This merging of energy security and climate objectives, facilitated through the G20 platform, positioned the GBA as a vital mechanism for unifying disparate national biofuel policies and establishing international standards for sustainability and trade.

Strategic Mandate and Importance

The core objective of the GBA is to encourage sustainable use of biofuels by catalysing policy exchange, technical assistance, and the adoption of internationally recognised standards.[16] Its strategic significance resides in three key areas:

Decarbonisation of Challenging Sectors: Biofuels, especially Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and bio-based diesel, provide some of the few viable, commercially available solutions for decarbonising heavy transport, aviation, and shipping, where direct electrification is not yet practical. The GBA supports the necessary technological progress, such as second-generation and third-generation biofuel processes, which utilise non-food feedstocks like agricultural residue and algae, thereby addressing the food versus fuel dilemma.

Market Mobilisation and Standardisation: The GBA aims to establish a global virtual marketplace, enabling the mapping of demand and supply and reducing reliance on fragmented regional markets. By developing strong sustainability codes and certification procedures, the GBA intends to minimise investment risks, encourage international trade, and unlock the significant growth potential forecasted by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which predicts a required 3.5 to 5-fold increase in biofuels by 2050 to reach net-zero targets.

Global South Empowerment: By emphasising capacity building and technology transfer, the GBA offers developing nations and emerging economies a pathway to energy self-sufficiency, rural economic growth, and lower import costs, thereby aligning the energy transition with the SDGs.

Challenges and Constraints

Sustainability Paradox: Despite its ambitious mandate, the GBA faces significant challenges. The primary issue is the ‘Sustainability Paradox’. While biofuels produce lower end-use emissions than fossil fuels, unsustainable production practices, such as converting highly biodiverse land for energy crops, can lead to high indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, potentially offsetting the climate benefits. The alliance must ensure a comprehensive life cycle assessment is mandated to prevent carbon leakage.

Financing and Technology Gap: Advanced (second and third generation) biofuel technologies are capital-intensive and lack economies of scale, making them less competitive than subsidised fossil fuels. Mobilising large-scale private capital for infrastructure, such as bio-refineries and distribution networks, especially in risk-sensitive developing nations, remains difficult without strong sovereign guarantees.

Supply Chain Risks: Feedstock security and variability present challenges that demand international policy coordination to mitigate.

Potential, Future Role, and Recommendations

The GBA is poised to play an increasingly vital role in reaching global climate goals. By encouraging feedstocks made from waste (e.g., agricultural residue, municipal organic waste), GBA directly helps reduce pollution, providing solutions like Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) that tackle issues such as crop stubble burning and methane emissions. Its success is crucial for closing the 2050 Net Zero Emissions pathway gap identified by the IEA, especially in sectors that are difficult to electrify.

To maximise its effectiveness, the following recommendations are suggested:

Implement robust ILUC and Water Use Mandates: The GBA must immediately define and enforce strict, measurable metrics to exclude high-risk land-use changes and water-intensive feedstocks from its approved certification standards.

Establish a dedicated R&D and de-risking facility: a specialised fund should be set up to offer concessional finance and risk guarantees for scaling 2G and 3G biofuel technologies, thereby lowering the cost of capital and enabling rapid commercial parity with conventional fuels.

Integrate Biofuels into Carbon Pricing: The GBA should promote international carbon pricing systems that explicitly recognise the verified life-cycle carbon reductions of sustainable biofuels, establishing a clear economic benefit over fossil fuels.

By adopting these strategic policy instruments, the GBA can evolve from a policy forum into a leading force promoting global, sustainable bioenergy deployment, thereby ensuring a cleaner and more secure energy future.

Conclusion

Carbon neutrality goals are admirable, but their realisation requires not only ambition but also strong institutional capacity and practical initiatives. For developing nations, this challenge is increased by the need to address urgent development priorities. The task, therefore, involves finding a careful balance, progressing with climate transitions while also strengthening resilience to protect growth.

The establishment of the GBA at the G20 Summit marked the culmination of a new era in Indian climate diplomacy, building on the achievements of the ISA and the CDRI. These three initiatives collectively signify a clear and decisive shift in India’s international stance. Where India’s foreign policy on climate was once primarily defensive, advocating for the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR), it has now confidently shifted to a proactive role as a global leader and architect of practical, scalable solutions. This embodies India’s ‘Resource Diplomacy’.

The ISA mobilises solar finance across the Global South; the CDRI concentrates on infrastructure resilience, a vital yet often neglected aspect of climate adaptation; and the GBA advocates for the deep decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors through sustainable waste-to-fuel technologies. By integrating its national goals—such as reducing dependency on crude oil, alleviating urban pollution, and increasing rural incomes—into these global frameworks, India ensures that the energy transition remains inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the needs of developing countries. This proactive multilateral approach not only accelerates global climate action but also strategically positions India as an essential leader, capable of mobilising consensus and driving constructive change within the emerging world order.

“They just need to see that Qantas is listening, caring and empathetic to the travellers.”","Qantas Captain Richard de Crespigny has urged the aviation industry to abandon its quest for net zero carbon emissions, calling sustainable fuel a “fad” which will never replace high-density jet fuel.

The outspoken retired captain was speaking ahead of the 15th anniversary of flight QF32 which suffered an uncontained engine failure over Indonesia on November 4, 2010.

Richard said it was concerning that, as a nation, Australia appeared to becoming less resilient, particularly in the area of energy as there was only 20 to 30 days of fuel available at any stage.

“We have seen people fight over toilet paper in a crisis, so you can imagine what might happen if we run out of fuel,” Mr de Crespigny said.

He shared his controversial views on the airline industry’s push to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, saying it was unrealistic unless “people stop flying”.

“I think sustainable fuel is a bit of a fad in that it requires crops to be displaced from growing food to growing energy,” he said.

“It’s a remarkably inefficient way to make energy by growing crops; it’s less than 1 per cent efficient and then you’re taking that fuel and burning it in an internal combustion engine, creating exhaust.”

“At the moment aviation contributes 4 per cent of the CO2 in the world, which means we can solve 96 per cent of the CO2 problem if we look at things other than aviation,” he said.

“Aviation contributes an enormous percentage towards the GDP of a country, and it can’t just be shut down. Short distances we can go to battery-powered aircraft but long distance there is no alternative to the current aviation fuels.”

Qantas is committed to net zero emissions by 2050, and is buying SAF to help reduce emissions on flights from London and the US with the help of a corporate “green team”.

Mr de Crespigny said the airline was in good hands with chairman John Mullen at the helm but it still needed “someone with operational experience on the board”.

“Everyone at some stage of their life has loved Qantas and things have happened that have challenged that, but I think Australians would love to go back to loving Qantas,” he said.

Neste has been transforming from a local oil refiner in Finland to a global frontrunner in renewable and circular solutions. Today, Neste is the world's leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, enabling its customers across a variety of sectors to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels with Neste’s renewable solutions.

This year, Neste marks two significant milestones: the 15th anniversary of its renewable products refinery in Singapore and the 60th anniversary of its Porvoo refinery in Finland, showcasing a legacy of refining that has grown from local operations to make a global impact.

15-year-old state-of-the-art Singapore refinery, a crucial hub in global operations

Neste's investment in the Singapore refinery marked a pivotal milestone as the company’s first major renewable products focused investment in Asia and outside of Finland. In 2010, Neste’s refinery in Singapore commenced operations as the world's largest renewable diesel refinery.

A subsequent expansion in 2023 integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production capabilities into the refinery operations, elevating the total production capacity of renewable products to 2.6 million tons annually, encompassing renewable diesel, SAF, and renewable raw materials for polymers and chemicals.

Investments in Singapore have solidified Neste's role as a significant global player in renewable fuels, enhancing its global footprint and strengthening ties with its Asia-Pacific customers.

“The Singapore refinery's 15th anniversary is a testament to Neste’s refining expertise and the dedication of our talented employees in Singapore. Their commitment to pioneering renewable solutions and our strategic growth in the region make this refinery a cornerstone of our global operations, giving us an advantage in global competition and enabling us to continue helping our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,” says Jukka Kanerva, Senior Vice President, Refining, Renewable Products at Neste.

60-year-old Porvoo refinery, a cornerstone of Neste’s innovative refining

Neste’s Porvoo oil refinery in Finland began operations in 1965 with the purpose to secure Finland’s oil supply. After its expansion, it became the largest oil refinery in the Nordics already in the 1970s.

The basis for Neste’s fuel innovations was built at the Porvoo refinery. Lead-free and sulfur-free fuels were Neste’s first steps towards improving products' environmental performance, and in the 1990s, Neste’s NEXBTL technology for renewables production was developed and NEXBTL refining units started-up in 2007 and 2009 at the Porvoo refinery.

“The Porvoo refinery is one of the most complex refineries in Europe. It was built that way to ensure flexibility in producing more than 100 products from a variety of raw materials, including different crude oil qualities. Now 60 years after its start-up, Neste proudly showcases a very unique oil refinery with the capability of processing not only crude oil but also renewable and recycled raw materials”, says Jori Sahlsten, Executive Vice President of Oil Products at Neste.

“We want to thank our customers and partners for collaborating with us to develop high-quality products for diverse sectors and applications. Above all, we are incredibly proud of our teams, whose expertise and commitment ensure that our refineries continue to serve Neste customers worldwide for years to come,” Jori Sahlsten and Jukka Kanerva state about the refineries’ achievements.

The agreement, in which Xpansiv has wholly acquired Evident, follows an earlier, minority investment by Xpansiv in the registry operator and certification body. It combines Evident's international renewable energy for electricity “I-REC(E)” and other registries with Xpansiv’s North American Renewables Registry (NAR™) and Tradable Instrument for Global Renewables Registry (TIGR™) to establish a preeminent, global REC network with over 300 GW of capacity and more than 4,000 participating companies.

“Today’s announcement reflects the shared goals and close relationship we have developed with Evident as we work to build energy transition solutions at scale, centering on transparent, independent certification and robust infrastructure,” said John Melby, CEO, Xpansiv. “It is also a milestone in our diversification strategy to build out our renewable energy and power markets portfolio to more fully support the global energy transition. Along with our exchange, market execution, and portfolio integration capabilities, we’re making it easier than ever for companies to transact clean energy certificates and meet their sustainability goals.”

Evident’s role as an independent certification body and its governance under the I-TRACK Foundation remain unchanged. Evident will continue to operate as an independent market facilitator for I-REC(E) and other products, under the ongoing oversight of the I-TRACK Foundation and in alignment with the International Attribute Tracking Standard. This governance structure ensures the highest levels of transparency and market integrity.

“The I-TRACK Foundation is looking forward to continuing to support Evident, as an Accredited Code Manager under the I-TRACK Foundation's International Attribute Tracking Standard, as it grows its impact, reach, and innovation across vital and trustworthy EAC markets,” said Dirk Van Evercooren, Chairman of the Board, I-TRACK Foundation.

Users of Evident’s infrastructure can remain confident that the robustness, quality, and reliability of its services will not only be maintained but enhanced. The acquisition will serve as a platform for even greater innovation and continued advancement within the global REC registry sector.

""Through the talent and expertise of our fantastic team, Evident has become the pre-eminent trusted partner for sustainable energy certification across more than 60 countries,” said Ed Everson, Co-Founder, Evident. “Thank you to all those within Evident who have made that success possible.""

The acquisition comes as global demand for renewable energy and RECs is growing sharply, driven by electricity consumption by data centers, electric vehicles, and other sources. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects global renewable electricity capacity will double by 2030, adding 4,600 GW, equal to the combined installed power capacity of China, the European Union, and Japan.

This year, more than 300 million I-REC(E)s were issued by Evident through September, up from 2024’s 290 million full-year total. Since 2015, Evident has grown from supporting a single market to more than 60 countries, serving over 95% of the voluntary renewable energy certificate market outside Europe and North America. In September, the company issued its one billionth I-REC(E). Evident also operates registries for methane emission reduction and sustainable aviation fuel.

“The acquisition of Evident, a premier global registry provider in the fast-growing renewable energy markets, underscores our strategy to expand our comprehensive platform through acquisitions and organic growth,” said Nathan Rockliff, Chief Strategy Officer, Xpansiv.

Xpansiv’s renewable energy network, which also includes leading U.S. compliance registries MIRECS, NC-RETS, NEPOOL, and NYGATS, is integrated via the Xpansiv® Connect™ multi-registry portfolio management system and CBL® spot exchange.

Governments in Westminster and elsewhere must step up progress in developing cleaner alternatives to traditional jet fuel, according to a report today from Blair’s think tank, seen by POLITICO.

“Aviation is and will continue to be one of the world’s most hard-to-abate sectors. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates in Europe and the U.K. are ramping up, but the new fuels needed are not developing fast enough to sufficiently reduce airline emissions,” the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) said, referring to policies designed to force faster production of cleaner fuel.

The U.K. has made the rollout of SAF central to hitting climate targets while expanding airport capacity.

It is the third intervention on U.K. net-zero policy from the former prime minister this year.

Earlier this month, the TBI urged Energy Secretary Ed Miliband to drop his pursuit of a clean power system by 2030 and focus instead on reducing domestic bills. This followed a report in April claiming the government’s approach to net zero was “doomed to fail” — something which caused annoyance at the top of the government and “pissed off” Labour campaigners then door-knocking ahead of local elections.

Aviation contributed seven percent of the U.K.'s annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, equivalent to around 29.6 million tons of CO2. The Climate Change Committee estimates that will rise to 11 percent by the end of the decade and 16 percent by 2035.

SAFs can be produced from oil and feedstocks and blended with traditional fuels to reduce emissions. The U.K. government’s SAF mandate targets its use in 40 percent of jet fuels by 2040 — up from two percent in 2025.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in January that U.K. investment in SAF production will help ensure planned airport expansion at Heathrow — announced as the government desperately pursues economic growth — does not break legally-binding limits on emissions.

The TBI said that, while it expects efficiency gains and initial SAF usage will have an impact on emissions, a “large share of flights, both in Europe and globally, will continue to run on conventional kerosene.”

A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said the government was “seeing encouraging early signs towards meeting the SAF mandate.”

They added: “Not backing SAF is not an option. It is a core part of the global drive to decarbonise aviation. SAF is already being produced and supplied at scale in the U.K., and we recently allocated a further £63 million of funding to further grow domestic production.”

The TBI said carbon dioxide removal plans should be integrated into both jet fuel sales and sustainable aviation fuel mandates, placing “the financial responsibility of removals at the feet of those most able to pay it.”","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31/GettyImages-2242216570-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-11-02 23:16:31.142865

Beyond cost and performance gains, AAR presents a major climate opportunity, complementing Sustainable Aviation Fuel and hydrogen by cutting emissions now, as aviation demand is set to double by 2044 amid growing pressure to decarbonise.

Safety and certification remain the biggest hurdles, but innovative reverse-role concepts — where the tanker operates behind the receiver — could make commercial AAR viable, with cargo carriers serving as the ideal testbed for large-scale adoption.

The Royal Air Force has long followed a simple maxim: “maximum payload, minimum fuel.” At first glance, it sounds counterintuitive—how can you fly with minimum fuel? The answer lies in Air-to-Air Refuelling (AAR). Military aircraft carry only enough fuel to reach the first tanker, where they top up mid-flight. This reduces weight at take-off, increases payload, and delivers faster, longer-range operations.

For the air cargo industry, the same logic could be transformative. If airlines could adopt a safe, commercially viable form of AAR, they might cut costs, extend aircraft life, and take a serious step toward meeting sustainability targets.

Imagine two identical widebody aircraft taking off from Heathrow, each with the same payload but different fuel strategies. One is military, one civilian.

Research by Dr Raj Nangia shows that, on a 9,000-nautical mile route, the military aircraft—refuelled three times in flight—burns 60 percent less fuel than the civilian one. Even after accounting for the fuel used by the tankers, the saving comes to 54 percent. For any carrier, that’s a massive operating cost reduction.

The logic is simple. Why carry tonnes of fuel for the entire journey when you could refuel en route? Motorists understand this instinctively—you don’t drive a car with a roof tank full of petrol “just in case.”

Beyond fuel savings

Beyond fuel savings, the advantages of air-to-air refuelling stretch into every corner of aircraft performance and operations. An aircraft minimising landings and take-offs through AAR undergoes fewer pressurisation cycles, easing structural stress and therefore extending overall airframe life. Engines aren’t forced to work at maximum thrust so often, which reduces wear, while tyres and landing gear also benefit from proportionately fewer landings.

Lower take-off weights give airlines greater operational flexibility, making it possible to serve airports with shorter runways and enabling more direct, point-to-point routes. Lighter departures also help counteract reduced lift in hotter conditions, an increasingly important factor as global temperatures climb.

As Dr. Nangia highlights, the payload-to-maximum take-off weight ratio of a refuelled aircraft is nearly double that of a conventional long-range aircraft—proof that the efficiency gains are built into the physics itself.

A climate imperative

AAR is hardly new—the military has used it for over 80 years. But the urgency of climate change makes its potential commercial application worth revisiting.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been heralded as the industry’s silver bullet, yet the reality looks more limited. Research published in August 2025 suggests SAF may deliver less than a 50 percent reduction in climate warming impact compared to Jet A. Supply constraints and political headwinds—particularly in the US—will limit its scale.

Meanwhile, the Grantham Institute at Imperial College recently linked climate change to tripling the number of heat-related deaths in London during the June–July 2025 heatwave. Aviation may not be the largest contributor to warming today, but its share will grow as global demand rises. Airbus forecasts an extra 10 trillion Revenue Passenger Kilometres by 2044—doubling traffic in less than 20 years. If radiative forcings are fully counted, aviation’s contribution is already higher than official figures suggest.

Making it work for civil aviation

The main challenge for commercial air-to-air refuelling lies in safety and certification. Traditional military methods, such as the probe-and-drogue or flying boom systems, require the receiver aircraft to fly just 50–70 feet behind the tanker, navigating turbulent air with extreme precision—a level of manoeuvring that would be impractical and unsafe for commercial operations.

One potential solution is to reverse the roles: the tanker would remain behind the receiver, managing the entire refuelling process much like ground crews handle traditional fuelling. In this approach, the receiver deploys a lightweight cable on a motorised drum, equipped with a steerable drogue. The tanker crew then remotely guides the drogue to connect with a probe on their fuel hose, after which the receiver reels in the hose to link with its fuel inlet.

Once the connection is secure, the tanker can safely increase separation by extending additional hose, achieving the distance required for certification. This setup keeps the technical complexity and training requirements with the specialist tanker crews, rather than burdening commercial pilots, offering a viable path toward safe, efficient in-flight refuelling.

A place to start

Is this the ultimate solution? Perhaps not. Yet the potential cost savings, efficiency gains, and climate benefits are simply too significant to overlook. If air-to-air refuelling is ever to be tested commercially, cargo flights offer the most logical proving ground. The sector already values payload flexibility, faces fewer complexities around passenger safety, and operates on tighter margins where efficiency improvements have an immediate impact. While AAR may never replace Sustainable Aviation Fuel or hydrogen, it could serve as a powerful complement—buying the industry time while cutting emissions at scale as longer-term solutions mature.

Aviation faces a stark reality: demand is poised to soar just as climate impacts become increasingly severe. Meeting this challenge cannot rely on incremental improvements or unproven fuels alone. Sometimes the answers lie in ideas we’ve had all along, waiting to be applied in a new way. Perhaps now is precisely the moment to ask whether the principle of “maximum payload, minimum fuel” should guide not only fighter jets, but cargo holds as well.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/page-5-shutterstock_19572895-1080x718.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 20:16:39.001278

Both recognise that green aviation is more than fuel – it’s about energy, design, transport links and the whole ecosystem.
And regulatory policy will matter: how will governments enforce SAF mandates, incentivise airport green operations and integrate aviation into broader national climate agendas?","In 2025, both Malaysia and Cambodia are significantly advancing green airport initiatives that reflect rising global pressure for the aviation sector to decarbonise and embrace sustainability. Malaysia is pushing ahead on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, greening airport operations, and policy frameworks to become a SAF hub and reduce aviation emissions. Meanwhile, Cambodia has opened and is operationalising the Techo International Airport with a strong emphasis on architectural sustainability, renewable energy and eco-friendly airport design. Together, these efforts mark a pivotal shift in how airports in Southeast Asia are approaching the future of aviation and environmental responsibility.

Malaysia has laid out a comprehensive strategy to make its aviation sector greener. Under its “Green Skies” agenda, Malaysia is committing to reducing CO₂ emissions from aviation. Key components include: the SAF push: Malaysia is set to begin the domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel by end-2025 at its first bio-fuel refinery in Johor, positioning itself to become a major SAF hub.The Edge Malaysia+2BioEnergy Times+2 The country’s state energy company, Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas), delivered the first batch of locally-blended SAF in September 2025 for the national carrier operating out of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, marking a concrete step in integrating SAF into regular operations.Reuters+1 Malaysia is also advancing airport operations sustainability: in May 2025 it expanded the use of palm-based biodiesel from B10 to B20 in ground transport vehicles at its main international airport, signalling a commitment to decarbonising non-aircraft operations too.Reuters On the regulatory and strategic side, the country has announced plans to meet the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Long-Term Aspirational Goal of carbon-neutral growth, and to build a national SAF framework with phased targets toward 2050.BioEnergy Times+1

These actions signal that Malaysia is not only targeting fuel supply but also a broader remit of airport operations in the sustainability domain. The synergy of SAF production, regulatory frameworks and operational changes contributes to the idea of a “green airport ecosystem.”

The takeaways for Malaysia are that its SAF initiative is a strategic industrial effort aligned with energy security and decarbonisation; the airport ground operations note illustrates how airports can decarbonise non-aircraft segments; and the national policy framework creates clarity and sets targets. At the same time, important challenges remain: ensuring sustainable feedstocks (especially palm oil), the cost of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel, and scaling capacity and logistics at airports.

In Cambodia, the most visible green-airport advance is the launch of the Techo International Airport in September 2025. The terminal was designed by Foster + Partners and is described as aspiring to be “one of the greenest airports in the world” through its integration of architectural design and engineering to significantly reduce its carbon footprint.ArchDaily+1 The airport opened operations on 9 September 2025 and replaces the older Phnom Penh airport.International Airport Review+1 Sustainability-centric design features include large-scale on-site photovoltaic solar farm, natural daylight and ventilation, vertical gardens and rooftop greenery, rain-water harvesting and landscaping, all built into the core of the infrastructure.news.cgtn.com+1 The initial capacity is for 13 million passengers per year with plans to expand to 30 million by 2030 and up to 50 million by 2050.www.ndtv.com+1

In the context of “green airports”, Cambodia’s Techo represents an airport whose infrastructure and operations are built with sustainability in mind, not just an afterthought. The integration of renewable energy, landscape architecture, passive design principles and future-ready transport links positions it as a model for large-scale infrastructure.

From the Cambodia side: launching a new airport allows leap-frogging – instead of retrofitting old terminals, this one is built from scratch with green architecture. It ties aviation infrastructure to tourism growth and national connectivity, showing sustainability and growth can go hand-in-hand. The physical design and environment deliver both aesthetic value and functional sustainability benefits. But the challenge will be in operationalising all the green systems, ensuring the renewable energy generation delivers as planned, and scaling to full capacity without compromising on the green goals.

When comparing the two countries, several patterns emerge: Their focus areas differ – Malaysia emphasises fuel and operations (SAF production, blending, ground vehicle diesel, policy). Cambodia emphasises infrastructure and design (building a new airport with sustainability embedded). In terms of scale and timing: Malaysia is rolling out industry-wide frameworks and already delivering results (Petronas SAF), while Cambodia is at the launch phase of a major new airport whose sustainability features are built in but long-term operational data are still unfolding. Both demonstrate ambition: Malaysia tying to ICAO goals and becoming a SAF hub; Cambodia aiming for one of the greenest airports in the world. Both recognise that green aviation is more than fuel – it’s about energy, design, transport links and the whole ecosystem.

These initiatives also carry strong economic framing: they aren’t just green PR moves. In Malaysia the SAF push links to industrial strategy and palm oil value-chains; in Cambodia the airport is tied to tourism and connectivity. Yet each faces challenges: in Malaysia, sustainable feedstocks, cost dynamics of SAF, logistics; in Cambodia, ensuring design features translate into operational sustainability and that scaling doesn’t compromise the green credentials.

This matters because the aviation sector is under rising scrutiny: as passenger numbers rebound post-pandemic, pressure to decarbonise is intensifying. Airports are no longer just terminals; they are critical nodes in the larger transport-energy-environment nexus. Green airport initiatives can significantly reduce emissions not just from aircraft but from ground operations, infrastructure, transport access and lifecycle energy use. For emerging economies in Southeast Asia, there is a window to design and build the next generation of airports or fuel-systems with sustainability from the start rather than retrofit old systems.

Looking ahead, some key indicators to track for Malaysia and Cambodia include: SAF blending rates (what percentage of flights at Kuala Lumpur International Airport use SAF in 2026 and beyond? Will the 1% SAF blending mandate for international flights be met?). Renewable energy generation at Techo International Airport (how much of its power demand is met by onsite solar farm? What is the reduction in grid-energy consumption?). Operational performance (how efficiently are natural ventilation, landscaping, water harvesting features performing? Are energy costs and emissions falling?). Scaling infrastructure (will Cambodia’s airport reach its phased capacity while maintaining green credentials? Will Malaysia scale SAF production and supply chain domestically?). Certification & accreditation (will airports achieve recognised green-airport certifications and use them as benchmarks?). Feedstock sustainability will be critical (particularly for Malaysia: how will palm-oil based SAF feedstocks be managed to avoid deforestation or negative social impacts?). And regulatory policy will matter: how will governments enforce SAF mandates, incentivise airport green operations and integrate aviation into broader national climate agendas?",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7967.jpeg,N,,2025-11-02 20:16:50.650856

Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

Zhang has developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, and he said SAF provides a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he concluded.",https://www.morningagclips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2025-11-02T164532.506-e1762120235931.png,N,,2025-11-02 19:02:17.875509

The announcement was made during Vietnam’s General Secretary To Lam’s official visit to the United Kingdom, marking a pivotal moment in advancing sustainable air travel solutions.

Led by Professor Myles Allen, Director of Oxford Net Zero, the study examines the potential of Geological Balance Fuel (GBF), a novel form of aviation fuel that offsets carbon emissions through the long-term geological storage of CO₂. Early findings from the research suggest that GBF could serve as a viable and scalable pathway for the aviation sector to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century.

The exchange of research findings was witnessed by Vietnam’s General Secretary To Lam and Professor Irene Tracey, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, along with Ho Ngoc Yen Phuong, Vietjet’s Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Professor Myles Allen. The collaboration between Vietjet and Oxford highlights an innovative approach that combines scientific research, technological development, and policy alignment to address one of aviation’s most significant challenges.

A significant advantage of GBF lies in its cost-effectiveness and ability to integrate seamlessly into existing global fuel supply systems. This means the technology could minimize disruption to current energy infrastructure while maintaining affordability for the aviation and fuel industries.

The initiative also catalyzes broader educational and human capital collaboration between Vietnam and the United Kingdom. As part of the project, Oxford Net Zero will establish new research fellowships and post-doctoral programs to deepen academic and technological partnerships between the two nations.

The research builds on Vietjet’s long-term “Fly Green” sustainability strategy, which focuses on creating “a green future under a blue sky.” Through the integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), carbon offsetting, reforestation initiatives, renewable energy investments, and AI-driven operational efficiencies, Vietjet has already achieved a 38% reduction in average emissions per passenger compared with previous-generation aircraft.

Plug Power Inc. has signed a binding agreement with Allied Biofuels FE LLC for the supply of up to 2 gigawatts (GW) of GenEco proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer systems for a major electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) project in Uzbekistan. This commitment is part of a broader set of strategic collaborations between Plug Power and the Allied group, which is already active through the 3 GW project led by Allied Green Ammonia in Australia.

Allied Biofuels’ site in Uzbekistan is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), eSAF, and green diesel. Located at a key logistical hub for global sustainable fuel markets, the facility will use Plug Power’s technology to power its entire production process. The final investment decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2026, according to the two companies.

Strengthening Plug Power’s presence in Central Asia

The agreement was signed in Australia during a visit by Plug Power Chief Executive Officer Andy Marsh, who met with regional partners to explore new opportunities in hydrogen and liquid fuels. The deal represents one of the largest electrolyzer supply contracts announced in 2025 and confirms Plug Power’s strategy to position itself as a central player in large-scale utility hydrogen projects.

The combined 5 GW capacity, spread across projects in Australia and Uzbekistan, reinforces Plug Power’s role as a key provider of electrolyzer solutions for industrial applications in the synthetic fuels sector. The Uzbek site will mark the first commercial deployment of this scale in the region.

Continued expansion in Asian markets

Alongside this agreement, Plug Power is continuing to grow its operations in Asia, including in South Korea, India, and Japan, where its technologies are being deployed in hydrogen production, power generation, and industrial applications. The company is targeting these markets to meet growing demand for hydrogen-based energy solutions.

The hydrogen technology firm continues to announce substantial contracts while simultaneously facing investor apprehension over its financing strategies and ongoing financial performance.

Financial Headwinds Dampen Market Sentiment

The company’s recent financial metrics reveal significant challenges. In the latest quarterly report, Plug Power posted a net loss of $0.20 per share against revenues of approximately $174 million. Particularly concerning to market observers is the negative 90.22% return on equity, indicating substantial erosion of shareholder value.

These financial pressures have prompted strategic capital-raising measures, including a warrant transaction in early October that secured $370 million in funding. This move immediately sparked dilution concerns among investors, reflecting worries about the potential impact on existing share values. The apprehension appears well-founded, as institutional investors are showing signs of caution – Pinnacle Associates notably reduced its position by 21.6 percent.

Strategic Expansion Through Major Projects

Despite these financial challenges, Plug Power continues to demonstrate ambitious growth initiatives. In late October, the company secured a binding agreement for up to 2 gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity with Allied Biofuels, supporting a sustainable aviation fuel project in Uzbekistan. This substantial commitment represents one of the larger deals in the clean energy sector.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Plug Power?

Just one week prior to the Uzbekistan announcement, Plug Power revealed a partnership with Edgewood Renewables for a facility in Nevada. These developments signal a strategic broadening beyond traditional hydrogen applications into the expanding clean fuels marketplace. The geographical spread of these projects – from Central Asia to the American West – underscores the company’s global aspirations and its positioning within the international green energy transition.

Balancing Act Between Promise and Performance

The fundamental question facing Plug Power investors revolves around execution capability. Can the company successfully translate its impressive project pipeline into sustainable profitability, or will the substantial capital requirements continue to pressure its financial standing?

Market analysts are closely monitoring whether these gigawatt-scale announcements will eventually translate into improved financial metrics. The contrast between operational expansion and financial performance creates a tension that will likely determine the stock’s trajectory in coming quarters. As the clean energy sector evolves, Plug Power’s ability to navigate this delicate balance between growth ambitions and fiscal responsibility remains the critical variable for long-term success.

The suspension, which affects all express bus services operated by Zulco Sdn Bhd, will take effect from November 6 to December 5.

In a statement, APAD said the action was taken after the operator was found to have misused its operating licence by picking up and dropping off passengers at unauthorised locations.

The agency added that the company’s buses were also found to have been operating outside approved terminals without APAD’s permission on February 3, May 21, and October 10.

“APAD emphasises that the suspension of the Operator’s Licence and Vehicle Permit is in accordance with Section 27 of the Land Public Transport Act 2010, as the company failed to comply with the conditions of its licence, particularly Articles 16 and 19 of the General Terms for Express Bus Service Level Requirements,” the statement said.

APAD said the Licence Suspension and Cancellation Committee had, on October 21, determined that the company was guilty of repeated violations and imposed a 30-day suspension of its operating licence.

As a result, Zulco Sdn Bhd is prohibited from operating any services under the suspended licence during this period.

“This action is aimed at ensuring passenger safety, reducing traffic congestion in urban areas, and supporting the efforts of local authorities, including Kuala Lumpur City Hall and other municipal bodies, to create a more orderly, safe, and efficient urban environment,” APAD said.

The agency added that the company had been repeatedly advised to move its operations to approved terminals but failed to comply, leading to three show-cause letters being issued between March 13 and October 10 for repeated violations.

This is made possible by researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the US who developed a process that produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without blending it with fossil fuels, meeting industry standards.

How did we turn food waste into an innovative sustainable fuel?

This solution tackles two major problems, mainly food waste and greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. It was led by transforming the food waste directly into biocrude oil, for which the research team used hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Then a two-fold process was adopted to achieve the SAF:

Simple impurities like moisture, ash and salt were removed. Then unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur were eradicated using catalytic hydrotreating, leaving behind pure hydrocarbons.

To finally meet the industry standards of jet fuel, cobalt molybdenum was used as a catalyst to refine oil into pure hydrocarbons. Further optimisation was conducted by adjusting key variables to eventually progress the fuel to the final production stage.

How does it meet industry standards?

The resultant fuel was tested to meet the rigorous standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It did not require any blending of fossil fuels or additive elements. Therefore, meeting the industry standards, successfully clearing both Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests.

Alongside, we are solving the major issue of ‘food waste’ as stated under the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations. According to the SDG report, in 2022, globally 19% of food was wasted amounting to 1.05 billion tonnes. This wasted food then adds to the global greenhouse gas emissions when it decomposes in landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

Since this wasted food could be recycled on a large-scale, it could open up opportunities for fuel production. The researchers also stated that this process can be adapted to other oils to produce SAF.

Usually innovations pose a hindrance for commercial production however, this solution has the potential to serve the market as well as create replacement for petroleum-derived compounds in plastics. How drastically can this innovation change the future of sustainability in the aviation sector? Let us know in the comments below!

Con esa advertencia sobre la mesa, el rearme europeo se entiende también como un ejercicio de capacidades concretas.","Europa ha entrado en una nueva era de rearme. La invasión rusa de Ucrania reabrió una carrera armamentística que parecía superada, y los gobiernos del continente han vuelto a mirar a su industria de defensa con urgencia. En ese mapa de fábricas reactivadas, contratos millonarios y programas multinacionales, España ocupa un lugar importante.

De Navantia a Indra, de ITP Aero a Escribano, el país cuenta con una red de compañías que diseñan fragatas, radares, motores o sistemas de inteligencia para los proyectos más ambiciosos de Europa. Este es el retrato de quién es quién en la defensa española, cuánto pesan realmente y qué papel juegan en el rearme del continente.

Oportunidades y desafíos en el rearme europeo

Un estudio elaborado por PwC para la patronal TEDAE ofrece una panorámica precisa del peso industrial que la defensa tiene hoy en España. Según ese informe, publicado en 2024, las industrias de Defensa, Seguridad, Aeronáutica y Espacio generaron 21.919 millones de euros de PIB (1,4% del PIB nacional) y 260.049 empleos entre directos, indirectos e inducidos. El documento no establece un ranking, pero sí deja claro que el ecosistema español de defensa es uno de los más diversificados de Europa. Su lectura ayuda a dimensionar la magnitud de un tejido industrial que sostiene buena parte del rearme europeo.

El impulso del sector no avanza sin fricciones. En una entrevista con El País, el presidente de Indra, Ángel Escribano, reconocía que España aún carece de un gigante comparable a Rheinmetall, Thales o Leonardo. “Necesitamos una mayor dimensión”, señalaba, y añadía que el objetivo no es crear un “campeón nacional”, sino consolidar un tejido donde las empresas cooperen y compartan capacidades. Una visión que refleja tanto las ambiciones como las tensiones internas del proceso de integración en la defensa española.

La reactivación industrial no basta por sí sola para garantizar una defensa sostenible. El Real Instituto Elcano advierte de que el esfuerzo de rearme no puede medirse solo en cifras de inversión o contratos firmados. En uno de sus análisis recientes, señala que “la revitalización de la defensa española sólo será sostenible si se basa en criterios estratégicos y de seguridad nacional”. Para ello, propone reforzar la llamada “cultura estratégica”, una visión a largo plazo que trascienda la lógica industrial y que permita definir con claridad qué papel quiere desempeñar España en el entramado de seguridad europeo.

Con esa advertencia sobre la mesa, el rearme europeo se entiende también como un ejercicio de capacidades concretas. Detrás de cada contrato, de cada programa europeo, hay fábricas, ingenierías y astilleros que sostienen el esfuerzo de modernización. España no parte de cero: cuenta con una red de empresas que han crecido al calor de los grandes proyectos de la OTAN y la Unión Europea. Algunas de ellas son públicas, otras privadas, pero todas forman parte de un mismo ecosistema que hoy vuelve a cobrar protagonismo.

Los nombres que están definiendo la nueva industria de defensa en España

Navantia es el principal referente de la industria naval española y una pieza esencial en el rearme europeo. De sus astilleros en Ferrol, Cartagena y Cádiz han salido buques para la Armada española y para marinas de todo el mundo, como las fragatas F-100 o las corbetas Avante. En la actualidad, concentra esfuerzos en dos programas estratégicos: las fragatas F-110, con un contrato de 4.325 millones de euros, y los submarinos S-80. La F-111 “Bonifaz”, primera unidad de la serie F-110, fue botada el 11 de septiembre de 2025 y la entrega del primer buque está prevista para 2028. En submarinos, el S-82, la segunda unidad de las clases S-80, fue amadrinado el 3 de octubre de 2025.

Pero hay más. Con unos ingresos de 1.528 millones de euros en 2024 y más de 5.600 empleados, la compañía pública apuesta por el modelo “astillero 4.0” para modernizarse y así responder a la creciente demanda de capacidades marítimas de sus clientes.

Indra actúa como columna vertebral tecnológica de la defensa española: integra sistemas C4ISR, radares, guerra electrónica y simulación, y es el coordinador nacional en el programa FCAS para los pilares de sensores y nube de combate. Su legado en Eurofighter —con aviónica, ayudas defensivas y modernizaciones— se complementa con contratación sostenida en defensa. Indra cerró 2024 con 4.843 millones de ingresos y una cartera de 7.245 millones. A ello suma demostradores de “combat cloud” con el Ejército del Aire y del Espacio.

ITP Aero es el motor literal y figurado de la defensa española. Especializada en diseño, fabricación y mantenimiento de turbinas, forma parte de los programas más avanzados de Europa, desde el Eurofighter hasta el futuro sistema FCAS, donde lidera en España el desarrollo del motor de nueva generación. En 2024 destinó 102 millones de euros a I+D —un 55% más que el año anterior— y cerró el ejercicio con 1.612 millones de ingresos. Su expansión industrial incluye la planta de Ajalvir, con una inversión millonaria para mantenimiento de motores GTF, y el refuerzo de su centro de Zamudio. Estas inversiones consolidan su papel como proveedor estratégico de propulsión en la OTAN y la UE.

SAPA es el gran especialista español en movilidad de vehículos blindados y una de las pocas empresas europeas con capacidad propia para desarrollar transmisiones de nueva generación. Su tecnología equipa al vehículo 8×8 Dragón del Ejército de Tierra. Además, ha sido seleccionada por General Dynamics Land Systems para suministrar transmisiones a programas del Ejército de Estados Unidos vinculados al reemplazo del Bradley (XM30), un acuerdo industrial de largo recorrido valorado por la prensa en hasta 5.000 millones de euros. Con sede en Guipúzcoa, la compañía trabaja en sistemas híbridos y eléctricos para plataformas militares, en línea con las tendencias.

Escribano Mechanical & Engineering representa la cara más dinámica del nuevo tejido industrial español. Especializada en estaciones de armas remotamente controladas (RWS), optrónica y munición inteligente, la compañía ha logrado posicionarse como proveedor clave del vehículo 8×8 Dragón y de la Armada.En 2024 alcanzó una facturación de 355 millones de euros e invirtió 62 millones en I+D, reforzando su independencia tecnológica con la apertura de una nueva planta en Linares. Su crecimiento ha despertado el interés de Indra, que ha iniciado un proceso de adquisición para integrar capacidades.

GMV es uno de los grandes nombres españoles en sistemas de mando, control y ciberdefensa. Con 454 millones de euros de facturación en 2024 y una presencia internacional que supera el 75% de su negocio, la empresa combina capacidades civiles y militares en áreas clave como navegación por satélite, seguridad espacial y comunicaciones seguras. Participa en seis proyectos del Fondo Europeo de Defensa, coordinando dos de ellos —PRECISE y MYRIAD—, y mantiene contratos con la Agencia Europea del Espacio (EUSPA) para servicios de alerta y vigilancia del sistema Galileo. Su perfil dual la convierte en un socio esencial para la autonomía estratégica europea en materia de ciberseguridad y espacio.

Sener Aeroespacial, filial del grupo SENER, combina ingeniería de precisión y visión industrial en los ámbitos aeroespacial y de defensa. Participa en una veintena de proyectos financiados por el Fondo Europeo de Defensa, entre ellos el desarrollo del sistema de misiles hipersónicos HYDEF y el programa COMMANDS para convoyes autónomos. Con 710 millones de euros de ingresos en 2024 y más de 4.000 empleados, la compañía mantiene su sede en Zamudio y una red internacional que abarca espacio, guiado, control y sistemas no tripulados. Su estrategia pasa por integrar capacidades duales —civiles y militares— y reforzar su presencia en los proyectos europeos que definirán la defensa del futuro.

Tecnobit, perteneciente al Grupo Oesía, es uno de los principales proveedores españoles de aviónica, optrónica y sistemas de comunicaciones seguras. Con sede en Valdepeñas y más de 3.000 empleados en el conjunto del grupo, participa en programas como el FCAS y el Eurofighter, aportando electrónica de misión, enlaces de datos y simulación. En 2024 reforzó su posición en el mercado europeo con nuevas inversiones en sensores infrarrojos y tecnologías de visión artificial.

La defensa española encara una década decisiva. El auge del gasto y los programas europeos ofrecen una oportunidad de crecimiento sin precedentes, pero también la obligación de coordinar un ecosistema todavía fragmentado. Como señalan algunos expertos, la autonomía tecnológica europea no se logrará solo con inversión, sino con una estrategia que combine soberanía, innovación y eficiencia industrial.

Siemens Group and RIC Energy have signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop projects related to renewable hydrogen, green ammonia, and synthetic fuels in Spain. The agreement is part of the Compostilla Green project, located in Cubillos del Sil, which was ranked as the top initiative under the Hydrogen Valleys programme.

A cross-sector partnership structured around technology and financing

The agreement involves several Siemens Group entities, including Siemens S.A., Siemens Industry Software, Siemens Financial Services, and Siemens Innovation Strategies. The partnership covers both technical and financial aspects, with a particular focus on developing joint solutions and exploring structured financing mechanisms for the projects.

The two companies aim to improve operational efficiency, industrial decarbonisation, site safety, and the advanced digitalisation of infrastructure. These priorities form part of a long-term industrial deployment strategy supported by digital technologies and integrated financial approaches.

Large-scale projects across two Spanish industrial regions

In addition to Compostilla Green, the agreement also includes the Besaya project, located in Torrelavega in the Cantabria region. This second site is aligned with the development of sustainable industrial fuels and aims to mobilise new technological and logistical capacities in the region.

Both partners plan to implement a joint communication strategy to highlight the economic impact of these projects on the regions involved. They are also considering the establishment of vertically integrated consortiums to facilitate execution of the planned initiatives.

Strengthening industrial cooperation in alternative fuels

The leaders of both companies welcomed the formalisation of this alliance. José Luis Moya, Chief Executive Officer of RIC Energy, described the agreement as an opportunity to “accelerate the deployment of transformative projects in the field of hydrogen and its derivatives”.

Fernando Silva, Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Spain, stated that the partnership confirmed the group’s commitment to “supporting large-scale industrial initiatives in Spain within the sustainable fuels sector”.

Estrategia Española de Economía Circular: España Circular 2030.
Estrategia España Turismo 2030.","En el extenso lapso de tiempo que media entre enero de 2019, cuando se dieron a conocer las “Directrices Generales de la Estrategia de Turismo Sostenible de España 2030”, y la aprobación el pasado 21 de octubre de 2025 en Consejo de Ministros de la “Estrategia España Turismo 2030”, encontramos, en lo que respecta al tema que aquí se aborda, la “Estrategia Española de Economía Circular: España Circular 2030”, aprobada por el Consejo de Ministros el 2 de junio de 2020. Veamos cómo se articulan para diseñar un marco de transformación para este sector.

La “Estrategia España Turismo 2030” sitúa la economía circular como uno de los pilares fundamentales para la transformación del modelo turístico nacional. En un contexto marcado por la emergencia climática, la presión sobre los recursos naturales y la necesidad de transiciones ecológicas y digitales, el documento plantea una reconfiguración profunda del sector turístico, orientada a la sostenibilidad ambiental, social y económica. Esta estrategia no solo reconoce los impactos negativos del modelo lineal tradicional, sino que propone mecanismos para avanzar hacia un modelo circular que reduzca el consumo de recursos, prolongue la vida útil de productos y servicios, y promueva la reutilización y el reciclaje.

La economía circular aparece como una meta estratégica específica (Meta 6), lo que representa una novedad relevante en el marco de las políticas turísticas españolas. El documento afirma que “las empresas del sector contribuyen ya a la disminución de las emisiones y promueven la economía circular en toda la cadena de valor turística. Pero hay que profundizar en esta meta, pues es un paso crucial para avanzar en la senda de un turismo responsable con el medio ambiente y comprometido con la preservación de nuestro planeta” (p. 75). Esta declaración refleja el compromiso institucional con la circularidad como eje vertebrador de la sostenibilidad turística.

Entre las medidas que se proponen, destacan aquellas orientadas a la gestión eficiente de los recursos hídricos, la reducción del desperdicio alimentario, la minimización del uso de plásticos y envases, y la mejora de la eficiencia energética en los establecimientos turísticos. En relación con el agua, se señala que “es necesario avanzar en sistemas de reutilización de agua (para riego o baldeo, mediante recuperación de aguas grises en alojamientos…), en la eficiencia del uso del agua en el consumo turístico, para lo que resulta necesario medir y trazar el consumo turístico con indicadores específicos (litros por pernoctación, auditorías, reducción de fugas)” (p. 60). Esta propuesta implica una sofisticación en la medición y trazabilidad del consumo, apoyada en tecnologías digitales y soluciones basadas en la naturaleza.

En cuanto al desperdicio alimentario, la Estrategia se alinea con la Ley 1/2025 de prevención de las pérdidas y el desperdicio alimentario, promoviendo prácticas sostenibles en el sector de la restauración turística. Se reconoce que “el sector turístico tiene potencial de mejora, ya que aún hay hábitos o factores como el exceso de producción, la gestión del inventario, o los hábitos de consumo, en los que se puede incidir” (p. 60). Esta afirmación subraya la necesidad de intervenir en los procesos operativos de las empresas turísticas para reducir los excedentes y optimizar la gestión de recursos.

Respecto a los plásticos y envases, el documento recoge la normativa europea que establece metas de reducción y reciclaje, y propone la incorporación del sector turístico a la “Global Tourism Plastics Initiative”. Se destaca que “existe un potencial de colaboración por explorar entre la industria del envase y sectores como el turístico para facilitar la inversión en soluciones tecnológicas alineadas con la nueva regulación europea” (p. 61), lo que abre la puerta a alianzas intersectoriales (o simbiosis industrial) para la innovación circular.

La Estrategia también contempla la descarbonización del transporte turístico como parte de la transición hacia la circularidad. Se menciona el impulso de combustibles alternativos, como el SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), y la electrificación del parque automovilístico, así como la promoción de la movilidad urbana sostenible mediante Zonas de Bajas Emisiones. Estas medidas se articulan con el Plan Nacional Integrado de Energía y Clima (PNIEC 2021-2030) y con el Reglamento (UE) 2023/2405 sobre transporte aéreo sostenible.

Además, se propone el desarrollo de un prototipo de plan de gestión de residuos para el sector turístico, la incorporación del sector a iniciativas internacionales sobre plásticos, y la implementación de proyectos piloto en destinos y establecimientos turísticos apoyados por el Sistema de Sostenibilidad e Inteligencia Turística Integral (SSITI). Estas acciones se complementan con incentivos para que las empresas calculen su huella de carbono y la compensen a través del Registro de Huella de Carbono del MITECO.

En términos institucionales, la Estrategia asigna responsabilidades a la Secretaría de Estado de Turismo, SEGITTUR, Paradores de Turismo y otros ministerios como el de Transición Ecológica y el de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación. Esta articulación interministerial y público-privada refuerza la gobernanza colaborativa como condición para la implementación efectiva de la economía circular en el turismo.

Este enfoque es complementario al documento “España Circular 2030”, que establece un marco estratégico nacional para la transición hacia una economía circular en todos los sectores productivos, incluyendo explícitamente al turismo como uno de los sectores prioritarios. En dicho documento se afirma que “aunque la Estrategia Española de Economía Circular está dotada de un carácter transversal y multidisciplinar, se ha decidido realizar una planificación y un seguimiento especial de algunos sectores debido a su relevancia: […] el turismo” (España Circular 2030, p. 7). Esta inclusión refuerza la coherencia entre ambas estrategias, al reconocer que el turismo, por su peso económico y su impacto ambiental, debe ser objeto de políticas específicas de circularidad.

Desde la perspectiva académica, los trabajos de Vargas-Sánchez han anticipado y analizado críticamente muchos de estos planteamientos. En su artículo “Innovación y Economía Circular en el Turismo” (2022), se destaca que “la toma de conciencia entre los empresarios parece existir, pero se echa en falta una acción colectiva a nivel de destino que la canalice en acciones concretas articuladas en un plan”. Esta observación pone de relieve una brecha entre el reconocimiento conceptual de la circularidad y su implementación práctica en muchos destinos. Asimismo, en una publicación de 2020 sobre “Simbiosis industrial en destinos turísticos”, Vargas-Sánchez propone modelos de colaboración interempresarial que permiten cerrar ciclos de recursos a nivel local, en línea con los principios de la economía circular.

En otro trabajo, “The new face of the tourism industry under a circular economy” (2021), el autor plantea escenarios estratégicos para la transición hacia una economía circular turística, combinando enfoques de gestión estratégica y de teoría institucional. Más recientemente, en “Toward a Circular Tourism Industry: The Importance of a Start-Up Ecosystem” (2023), se analiza el papel de las startups tecnológicas como catalizadores de la circularidad en el turismo.

Estos trabajos no solo se alinean con los objetivos de las estrategias nacionales, sino que también aportan una visión territorializada y operativa que puede enriquecer su aplicación. En particular, la insistencia en la necesidad de gobernanza colaborativa, innovación organizativa y planificación estratégica a nivel de destino turístico refuerza la idea de que la circularidad no puede ser solo una aspiración normativa, sino una práctica articulada desde lo local.

En definitiva, la “Estrategia España Turismo 2030” y la “Estrategia Española de Economía Circular: España Circular 2030” se complementan en la construcción de un nuevo modelo turístico basado en la sostenibilidad y la circularidad. Ambas estrategias comparten principios, objetivos y mecanismos de implementación, y ofrecen un marco coherente para que el turismo español se transforme en un sector resiliente, competitivo y comprometido con la transición ecológica. Los aportes académicos, como los citados y muchos otros, refuerzan esta visión, al ofrecer evidencia empírica y propuestas concretas que pueden servir de guía para la acción.

He said the inclusion of the stance in the agreed statement was an example of the maturity with which Z Energy had approached the litigation.","Fuel retailer Z Energy has apologised for any confusion caused by a 2022 advertising campaign that said it was in the business of getting out of the petrol business.

Consumer NZ and two environmental groups took legal action claiming the campaign was misleading and greenwashing.

During 2022 and 2023 a large scale 'Moving With The Times' campaign was conducted through print, television, billboards and social media outlined Z Energy's commitment to alternative fuels and emission reductions.

But in 2023 Consumer NZ, Lawyers for Climate Action New Zealand, and the Environmental Law Initiative sought High Court declarations that Z Energy had misled New Zealanders with its messaging in the campaign.

All parties have now agreed to settle the action with an agreement to disagree, but with no admission of liability nor payments.

Z's chief executive, Lindis Jones, said the campaign was meant to be provocative but not misleading.

He said the company would keep selling fuel, but was working to be a lower carbon business such as extending its electric vehicle charging network.

A shared statement from each party was published in the Sunday Star Times and New Zealand Herald on Sunday.

""Z apologises for any confusion caused by parts of its campaign and to any customers who thought Z was going to stop selling petrol any time soon,"" a joint statement said.

All parties said they were concerned about greenwashing, and backed the need for accuracy of communication which consumers could rely on.

They jointly called on the government to back ""bipartisan policies and strategies to ensure that NZ's emissions reductions targets will be achieved"".

Z campaign provocative but not misleading

Z Energy chief executive Lindis Jones said he had no problem apologising for any confusion, but stood by its contention that Z was participating in energy transition.

""I don't believe any customer should be confused by anything we say now or in the future, and the fact some might have been confused was good enough for me for an apology.

""But that message was designed to be provocative, and called on customers to think of Z Energy as more than just a fuel retailer,"" Jones said.

He said the background information at the time about biofuels, Z's emissions reduction, and investment in EV charging supported its broader message of being part of the change process.

Statements increased Z Energy market share: Lawyer

Last year lawyer James Every-Palmer told the High Court in Wellington the fuel supplier touted the ownership of a biofuel plant that had actually shut down in 2022 and investment in EV charging facilities which were ""insubstantial by any measure"".

He said the company was New Zealand's second highest greenhouse gas emitter - accounting for nearly 15 percent of the country's emissions.

Apology 'sends a message': Consumer NZ

Chief executive of Consumer NZ, Jon Duffy said both sides had made compromises in accepting a settlement.

""What Z's apology does do is it sends a message to other entities that may be considering advertising - that gets close to greenwashing - and my hope is that they will think twice,"" Duffy said.

He said the settlement allowed for a statement to be made in a more timely fashion - instead of waiting until 2028 for a decision to be reached.

""That's nearly six years from when the actual advertising went out in the public. It isn't good enough, given the urgency of climate change.""

A joint call for government leadership on climate change

Duffy said an important element of the settlement was all parties jointly calling for greater leadership from the government on transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

""So to have a major fossil fuel emitter come out and acknowledge both that greenwashing has been underenforced and that there's a lack of leadership from government on climate change, is a pretty big deal I think,"" Duffy said.

He said the inclusion of the stance in the agreed statement was an example of the maturity with which Z Energy had approached the litigation.

Z's Jones cited sustainable aviation fuel as an area the government could lead on and ensure suitable policy settings.

""The airlines, the energy companies like Z, and the government have to work together and collaborate and not just wait for each other and that's absolutely essential to meet challenging and significant problems when it comes to climate change.""

A line in the sand

The Environmental Law Initiative's director of research and legal, Matthew Hall said the precedent set by the settlement drew an important ""line in the sand"" for corporate conduct in New Zealand.

""We saw this campaign and we wanted to call it out and the settlement that we've achieved has these components that we think are important to put corporate New Zealand on notice that if greenwashing occurs then we are prepared to scrutinise company's claims and hold them publicly to account.

""Obviously Z has not admitted liability - and doesn't think this is greenwashing - but we think that the settlement does achieve a large part of what we set out [to] at the beginning,"" Hall said.

Government provides statement

Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Scott Simpson said the government was progressing changes to the Fair Trading Act to strengthen it's enforcement regime.

""The Fair Trading Act 1986 applies to all businesses and requires them to be truthful when it comes to all types of claims, including environmental claims.

""Any statements about environmental credentials must be truthful, backed by evidence, and not misleading, regardless of whether the business is subject to mandatory reporting requirements,"" Simpson said.

He said Commerce Commission guidelines were available to give businesses practical advice to help them comply with the Act.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--dTcSIZL2--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1643244757/4P8HWTZ_image_crop_5183?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-11-02 08:56:18.346434

New York – La spinta americana verso l’energia pulita ha subito una battuta d’arresto nel 2024. Secondo un nuovo rapporto dell’Energy Information Administration (Eia), l’aumento della capacità di produzione di biocarburanti negli Stati Uniti è notevolmente rallentato, con un tasso di crescita inferiore a un terzo rispetto agli anni precedenti (2022 e 2023). Un segnale preoccupante per le ambizioni climatiche di Washington, soprattutto nel cruciale settore dei trasporti.

Il segmento più colpito da questo rallentamento è quello del diesel rinnovabile e degli “altri biocarburanti”, una categoria che include il fondamentale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Saf), essenziale per decarbonizzare l’aviazione. Insieme, questi comparti hanno registrato un aumento di capacità di appena 391 milioni di galloni all’anno, un dato significativamente al di sotto delle proiezioni. Nell’intero anno, sono stati completati solo due grandi progetti in California, tra cui la conversione della raffineria Phillips 66 Rodeo. Tuttavia, i guadagni sono stati in parte erosi dalla chiusura di otto impianti di biodiesel in tutto il Paese, costretti a interrompere le operazioni a causa di margini operativi ridotti e della difficoltà di sostenere i costi di produzione.

Questa frenata inattesa si scontra con il forte sostegno politico e i massicci incentivi fiscali previsti dall’Inflation Reduction Act (Ira). Nonostante l’Ira sia una solida base per il supporto finanziario e i crediti d’imposta per la produzione di biocarburanti a basse emissioni, la complessità burocratica, le incertezze normative sull’uso delle materie prime e gli elevati costi di costruzione e start-up dei nuovi impianti stanno rallentando gli investimenti e la messa in opera dei progetti annunciati.

Solo il settore dell’etanolo da carburante, che costituisce il 73% della capacità totale di biocarburanti, ha mostrato un incremento, ma il surplus produttivo è destinato in gran parte alle esportazioni, dal momento che il consumo interno di etanolo si mantiene stabile. La contrazione nella crescita del diesel rinnovabile e del Saf solleva, dunque, interrogativi sulla capacità degli Stati Uniti di rispettare i propri impegni internazionali e di accelerare la transizione energetica in settori ad alta intensità carbonica.",https://www.shipmag.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/biofuel.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 12:00:52.358049

Email address Thank you!

One person’s trash is another person’s… jet fuel? Strange as it might sound, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign believe that they’ve figured out a process to make that unlikely scenario a reality–at least on a small scale.

Writing this week in Nature Communications, the agricultural engineers outlined a strategy for taking excess food waste, converting it into biofuel, and then “upgrading” that fuel into jet fuel that can go straight into a plane without requiring additional changes to the aircraft’s infrastructure. They compared their food-waste-derived fuel against industry benchmarks and found that it met all the necessary standards for conventional jet fuel.

Though these findings are still more of a proof of concept, they open up the exciting possibility of using food waste (which there’s certainly no shortage of) to help the aviation industry move closer to its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions within the next three decades.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang said in a statement.

Planes lag behind cars in emission reductions

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that transportation accounted for roughly 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2022 alone. Of that, about seven percent came from commercial aircraft. Modern cars have reduced emissions in recent years, in part thanks to the shift toward electric battery power. And while battery-powered airplanes are theoretically possible for some short flights, they simply don’t provide enough energy to power a passenger jet traveling across the country(jet fuel carries around 50 times more energy per kilogram than conventional lithium-ion batteries. As a result, jets have lagged behind cars in reducing emissions.

But what about so-called biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)? Some estimates suggest that SAF, which largely refers to fuels derived from organic materials, could reduce emissions from flying by up to 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. While ethanol and other biomass-based derivatives have been available for cars for decades, they have remained more elusive for airplanes because their chemical composition does not meet the much stricter requirements necessary for jet fuel.

Upgrading biomass to jet fuel

Meeting these requirements is where food waste comes in. In this new experiment, the team started by collecting food waste from nearby food-processing plants. They then used a chemical process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which essentially mimics the way the Earth naturally creates crude oil from organic matter over millions of years, except without all the waiting. HTL kind of acts like an advanced “pressure cooker” to fast-forward nature’s timeline.

With plenty of crude oil extracted from the food scraps, the researchers then set out to convert it into jet fuel through a two-part process. The first step involved removing salt, ash, moisture, and other impurities. After that, they used a cleaning process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate other undesirable elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. What remained were the specific hydrocarbons required to make jet fuel. They tested different catalysts and found that cobalt–molybdenum stood out as the most effective and commercially available metallic catalyst for driving the chemical reactions needed to refine the oil into aviation fuel.

The team took their food-waste derived aviation fuels and tested it against current fuel standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. It passed the screening test and met industry requirements without needing to introduce any special additives. That means, the fuel would theoretically power a commercial airplane.

The findings are a first step to show aviation fuel derived from food waste is at least possible. Actually making enough of it to supply an entire passenger jet, however, is another beast altogether. Scaling up at this level requires time, resources, and deep pocket books outside of academia.

The world has been grappling with the reality that the conventional oil and gas sectors are coming to a climactic end in the near future. As demand for conventional energy production declines due to decarbonization goals and an increase in renewable energy production, Europe’s refineries have been urged by industry experts to modernize operations to integrate the renewable energy sector or face a grim future.

The world is entering a new phase that calls for aging energy infrastructure to adapt or die

The entire planet has been consumed by the calls for a more diversified energy market that can ensure a more integrated energy supply that does not rely on one specific energy generation method. For far too long, the world has relied on coal and gas to meet energy needs, which has devastated the environment.

At the Argus Global Markets Conference, delegates contemplated the best methods to modernize the European energy market, with aging refineries being the major sticking point. It has been stated by industry insiders that European refineries need to embrace biofuel and renewable energy production to remain competitive in the face of a litany of hurdles in the sector.

Since early 2024, Europe has lost around 400,000 b/d of refining capacity and has seen five refineries closed in the past two years. March saw three such closures of refineries in Europe, with Eni’s 88,400 b/d Livorno refinery in Italy being repurposed as a hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) plant.

Argus Global Markets Conference identified factors influencing the closing of European refineries

While some in the energy industry have welcomed the increased reliance on renewable energy, others in the market have lamented a future without gas and coal. Industry panelists at the Argus Global Markets Conference have noted several mitigating factors that have affected the recent closures, including but not limited to:

IMO’s Emissions Control Areas

The European Union’s ReFuelEU aviation mandate

The EU’s recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED III)

The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)

These key factors will reduce oil product demand and weigh in on refining margins on the European continent. European energy stakeholders have made several statements that outline the issues faced by the sector.

“Refiners in Europe must adapt to this “hostile climate” for fossil fuel production by “teaching an old refinery new tricks. Co-processing biofuel feedstocks alongside crude oil is key to meeting mandates and keeping European plants competitive” – Lukasz Strupczewski, executive director of crude trading at Polish firm Orlen

As nations outside the European Union see billions of dollars of new investments coming their way, the European energy sector has been urged to heed the warnings coming from industry experts and develop innovative solutions to the potential crisis at hand.

Industry stakeholders have made several suggestions to adapt the European refineries network

One such stakeholder is Grazvydas Bajoras, director at Swiss-based aviation fuel supplier iFuel.

Honeywell has introduced a new technology designed to convert biomass into renewable fuels for the hard-to-decarbonize shipping and aviation sectors. According to Barron's, these two sectors collectively account for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure projected to rise.

Emissions from aviation have quadrupled since the 1960s, despite a doubling in energy efficiency. With only 10% of the global population currently using air travel, further emissions growth is anticipated. Maritime shipping, reliant on heavy fuel oil or bunker oil, would rank as the world's sixth-highest emitter if it were a country.

A common challenge for both sectors is the need for extremely energy-dense fuels to carry heavy loads over long ranges without frequent refueling. ""The energy density of oil-based fuels is particularly important in these sectors,"" according to Barron's. While biomass was previously not a feasible replacement due to insufficient waste oil supply, biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural wastes were identified as future possibilities.

Honeywell's new Biocrude Upgrading process technology is designed to run on byproducts from agriculture and forestry. The system converts this biomass into a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.

""With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessels range without requiring costly engine upgrades,"" Honeywell stated. The ability to use the fuel without changing engine infrastructure is a key feature. The company plans to deploy the technology through prefabricated modular plants to reduce risk and streamline implementation.

A paper from the scientific journal Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions noted that the existing infrastructure locks these sectors into ""high-carbon pathways for decades,"" and that alternative fuels are needed ""for disruption to break through carbon lock-in and path dependency.""",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2025-11-02 07:56:30.357124

The relationship between Brazil and Mexico has entered a phase of strategic consolidation. In a telephone conversation this week, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and President Claudia Sheinbaum reinforced Brazil-Mexico cooperation aimed at expanding ethanol production. A renewable fuel that plays a central role in the energy agenda of both countries. The initiative seeks to combine Brazilian technical expertise with Mexican efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and develop a domestic market for biofuels.

The dialogue also confirmed the mutual interest in transforming this partnership into a hub for regional sustainable development. expansion of agreements Bilateral agreements on biofuels, sustainable aviation, and social programs linked to energy security reflect a new stage in Latin American environmental diplomacy. The goal is to establish an integration model that combines technological innovation, sustainability, and economic strengthening between the region's two largest economies.

Brazil-Mexico Cooperation: A Strategic Energy Axis

Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and a global leader in the production of agricultural-based ethanol.

Mexico, under the leadership of Claudia Sheinbaum, intends to use this experience as a model to modernize its energy matrix.

Brazil-Mexico cooperation will allow for the transfer of technical knowledge, promote joint investments, and accelerate pilot projects for biofuels in Mexican territory.

The Declaration of Intent on Bilateral Cooperation establishes guidelines for the advancement of sustainable fuels, including ethanol and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel).

The plan also includes support for market regulation and the training of specialists in the energy sector.

This integration represents a decisive step towards expanding the regional influence of both nations in the field of clean energy.

Ethanol production as a tool for sustainable development.

Sheinbaum's request to strengthen Brazil-Mexico cooperation aims to expand local ethanol production and meet Mexico's growing domestic demand.

Biofuel is seen as a viable alternative to reduce carbon emissions and offer new economic opportunities to rural producers.

With the experience accumulated over four decades of flex-fuel automotive production and technology, Brazil emerges as a natural partner in this process.

Brazilian ethanol, internationally recognized for its energy efficiency, will serve as a basis for technology transfers and incentive programs in the neighboring country.

The exchange should include studies on agricultural productivity, soil quality, and the rational use of water.

Energy diplomacy and regional integration

The conversation between Lula and Sheinbaum reinforced not only the economic character, but also the geopolitical role of Brazil-Mexico cooperation.

Both governments consider energy integration to be fundamental to strengthening Latin America's autonomy amidst the global transition to clean energy sources.

The dialogue also addressed climate commitments and joint participation in COP30, which will be held in Belém.

Mexico will designate Minister Alicia Barcenas as its official representative at the event, while Lula reaffirmed his interest in consolidating multilateral agreements that position the continent as a protagonist in the environmental agenda.

Expectations and next steps for the partnership.

Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramón de La Fuente Ramírez will visit Brazil at the end of November to continue negotiations.

The expectation is to establish a new trade agreement that deepens the exchange of green technologies and boosts cooperation in industrial policies related to ethanol and decarbonization.

For the Brazilian government, this partnership represents an opportunity to project internationally the biofuel model that the country has mastered for decades.

A new Biocrude Upgrading process technology has been introduced that converts agricultural and forestry waste into ready-to-use renewable fuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and marine fuel. This development fundamentally changes the economics of the sustainable fuel supply chain by unlocking inexpensive, abundant, non-food biomass feedstocks that were previously difficult to process. The technology is delivered in a prefabricated modular plant, which allows the initial conversion of waste to biocrude to happen directly at the feedstock collection sites, keeping transport costs low and accelerating project timelines. The resulting fuels are drop-in replacements with higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives.

Analysis

This breakthrough is caused by a new Biocrude Upgrading process that efficiently converts complex lignocellulosic biomass into a stable, refinery-ready intermediate biocrude. The core dynamic is decentralization: instead of shipping bulky waste to a central plant, the modular unit performs the initial, volume-reducing conversion at the source. Manufacturers are expected to react by aggressively pursuing new projects, as the modular design reduces capital risk and simplifies construction.

Think of the modular plant like a decentralized pre-refinery: it converts low-value, high-volume waste into a high-value, low-volume liquid that is cheap to ship and easy to refine. This shifts the economic bottleneck from logistics to technology deployment.

Outlook

This technology implies a significant acceleration in the development of waste-to-fuel industrial clusters, particularly in regions with large forestry and agricultural sectors. The next simple thing to look for is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for the first commercial-scale modular plants and new long-term offtake agreements from major airlines or shipping companies. These agreements will signal that the market trusts the new feedstock pathway and is ready to commit capital based on the promise of lower, more stable production costs.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Eucalyptus-Gum-Nut-Development-Highlighting-Plant-Reproductive-Biology-for-Sustainable-Forestry-and-Biodiversity-Conservation.jpeg,N,,2025-11-02 11:16:35.111804

Moreover, aviation and maritime shipping share a common challenge to decarbonization – they carry extremely heavy loads and have very limited opportunities for refuelling.
The result is a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.
“Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, was quoted by Interesting Engineering.
The Trump administration got off to a rocky start in this regard, and only time will tell how future fuel standards and trade policies will unfold.","Shipping and aviation are considered to be some of the hardest to abate sectors when it comes to decarbonization. Together, these two sectors account for a whopping 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that figure is likely going to rise as more goods are shipped and more flights are booked each and every year. But a new biofuels breakthrough may provide a long-range fuel alternative for the heavy transport and aviation industries.

Emissions from the aviation sector have quadrupled since the 1960s, even as flying has become more than twice as energy efficient. And as incomes rise around the world and more and more people fly, emissions will continue to climb. Today, just 10% of the global population uses air travel, but that’s set to change in the near future as global economies continue to develop.

Maritime shipping, meanwhile, remains reliant on heavy fuel oil, also known as bunker oil, the second dirtiest fossil fuel in the world after coal. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if the maritime shipping industry was a country, it would rank as the sixth-highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.

Moreover, aviation and maritime shipping share a common challenge to decarbonization – they carry extremely heavy loads and have very limited opportunities for refuelling. As a result, they need fuels that are extremely energy dense. As a result, “the energy density of oil-based fuels is particularly important in these sectors,” according to Barron’s.

Until now, biomass has not been a feasible option for its replacement, as “the supply of waste oil feedstock is not sufficient to meet demand.” However, Barron’s noted in its 2020 report that “biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural wastes are possibilities for the future.”

Well, the future is now. Honeywell, a conglomerate corporation headquartered in the United States, has unveiled a new system that can reportedly convert biomass into ready-to-use renewable fuels. The novel Biocrude Upgrading process technology is designed to run on byproducts from agriculture and forestry to divert waste into a cheap and abundant source of biomass. The result is a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.

“With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s range without requiring costly engine upgrades,” Honeywell said in a press release posted earlier this week.

The ability to pivot to biofuels without changing engine infrastructure is a critical selling point of the new product. Plus, Honeywell is sweetening the deal by reducing risk and streamlining deployment of the new technology through prefabricated modular plants. One of the things that makes shipping and aviation so hard to abate is that the infrastructure and investments that uphold the sector are “locked into high-carbon pathways for decades.” As such, alternative fuel sources, including biofuels, are needed “for disruption to break through carbon lock-in and path dependency” according to a paper published in the scientific journal Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions in September of last year.

Making a biofuel that is easy to use and cost-effective is therefore critical to creating disruption and driving real change in the shipping and aviation industries. “Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, was quoted by Interesting Engineering. “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost-effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.”

The biofuels industry is coming off of several boom years in a row, but there is some concern that policy changes could put a damper on the sector. Continued free trade with Canada will be critical to the success of an endeavor like the Biocrude Updating technology, as the country is a critical source of feedstock from its agricultural and forestry sectors. The Trump administration got off to a rocky start in this regard, and only time will tell how future fuel standards and trade policies will unfold.

With the introduction of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) mandates under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, EU airlines are required to mix conventional jet fuel with sustainable alternatives. This bold step will not only significantly reduce carbon emissions but also foster a new era of green tourism, benefiting travelers and local economies across Europe.

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is setting clear, progressive targets. By 2025, airlines will be required to use at least 2% SAF in their fuel blend, with the percentage rising to 6% by 2030. Looking further ahead, the European Commission aims for 70% SAF use by 2050. This ambitious plan marks a crucial milestone in Europe’s journey to decarbonize aviation and aligns with its broader climate goals.

The Mandate and Its Implication

Europe’s drive to integrate SAF into aviation fuel is not just about reducing emissions—it’s about setting a global standard. The ReFuelEU mandate creates a clear demand for SAF, encouraging investment in sustainable fuel production. With the aviation industry currently accounting for about 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, the shift to SAF is seen as a game-changer.

However, challenges persist. The cost of SAF remains a barrier. The European Union’s cost projections show that conventional jet fuel costs around €816 per tonne, while biofuels (including SAF) cost approximately €2,768 per tonne. Synthetic SAF, or e-fuel, can cost up to €7,500 per tonne. This price disparity could increase the cost of travel for consumers, but it also presents an opportunity for sustainable tourism development in the long run.

For tourists, these price increases could be offset by an enhanced sense of responsibility and eco-conscious travel. Many travelers are increasingly seeking destinations that prioritize sustainability and environmental conservation. Europe’s leadership in this area positions it as a global tourism hub for the environmentally aware traveler.

The Role of Innovation in Achieving SAF Goals

Innovation is key to meeting the European Union’s SAF goals. While the most widely used SAF production pathway today is HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which uses waste oils and fats, there are several other emerging technologies. These include Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ), Fischer-Tropsch from biomass, and solar-to-liquid processes, all of which have the potential to revolutionize the industry.

The article mentions that Europe’s support for innovative SAF pathways will boost both production capacity and technological development. This aligns with the European Green Deal’s broader vision of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050. For travelers, this means that soon, flying will not only be more sustainable but also more affordable as production scales up.

Tourism and Economic Growth: A Greener Future

For Europe’s tourism industry, the transition to SAF could provide a significant boost. As the tourism sector becomes more conscious of its carbon footprint, travelers will increasingly gravitate toward destinations and airlines that adopt greener technologies. The introduction of SAF mandates offers European tourism an opportunity to market itself as a leader in sustainability.

In addition, European airports could benefit from the SAF revolution, which may create new jobs and infrastructure to handle SAF production and storage. Local economies will experience a boost as more eco-conscious travelers flock to green destinations that promote low-emission travel options. Airlines offering SAF-blended flights could market these offerings as environmentally friendly travel choices, giving them an edge in the competitive tourism market.

The Challenges Ahead for Europe’s SAF Transition

Despite the promising outlook, there are several challenges to overcome. Feedstock availability, high capital expenditures for SAF facilities, and the scalability of production remain major obstacles. Many SAF production plants are still in the “pre-commercial” phase, meaning they have not yet reached full-scale production.

The aviation sector, along with industry groups, has expressed concerns about the fairness of the mandates, particularly in regions where SAF production is still limited. However, Europe is committed to overcoming these hurdles by encouraging further investment and collaboration with private sector innovators.

For the travel sector, this means that while SAF adoption may lead to temporary increases in costs, it also signals a long-term shift towards cleaner, greener aviation. As the supply chain matures and production increases, costs are expected to fall, making SAF a viable and accessible fuel option for airlines across Europe.

A Greener Future for European Tourism

Europe’s push for SAF adoption is a pivotal step toward a more sustainable and resilient aviation industry. With the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, Europe is not only reducing emissions but is also leading the charge toward a greener tourism future. As the tourism sector continues to recover post-pandemic, green travel initiatives like SAF will play a key role in attracting eco-conscious tourists and supporting local economies.

By 2050, the goal is for 70% of jet fuel used in European airports to come from sustainable sources. While the challenges are significant, the benefits for both the aviation industry and tourism are undeniable. Tourists will soon be able to experience the beauty of Europe with the peace of mind that their travel is contributing to a greener planet.

Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation Future Europe’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change.","Europe is steadily advancing toward greener skies, with the aviation industry accelerating its shift towards sustainability. The key driver? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a biofuel made from renewable resources that reduces carbon emissions and is integral to achieving Europe’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals. With recent regulations, such as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, the aviation industry is witnessing a transformative shift in fuel consumption.

What Are SAF Mandates?

Since January 2025, European airports have been mandated to blend a minimum of 2% SAF with conventional jet fuel. This percentage will increase incrementally, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. These regulations are part of the European Union’s broader strategy to decarbonize the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviation, an EU regulation first drafted in 2021, aims to make SAF the primary fuel for aircraft departing from European airports, bolstering sustainable aviation while fostering innovation and growth in the biofuel sector.

The Role of SAF in Decarbonization

The EU’s SAF mandate plays a critical role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation contributes significantly to global emissions, and while carbon offsetting strategies exist, SAF provides a tangible solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. As SAF production scales, its environmental benefits will only increase, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and helping meet global climate goals.

Challenges to SAF Production and the Need for Investment

Despite the positive impact of SAF, production in Europe is not without its hurdles. SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.

Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs Strengthening

The current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped. While demand is increasing, the supply remains limited, creating an imbalance in the market. Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.

Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer Legislation

The aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.

At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050. The alliance called for a more comprehensive SAF industrial policy, increased financing, and a reduction in the regulatory burden.

The Future of SAF in Europe: Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Next-Generation Fuels

As Europe looks to expand its SAF production capabilities, next-generation fuels are gaining attention. Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, produced using green hydrogen and carbon feedstocks, offer a promising alternative to current SAF pathways. Europe is exploring these innovative solutions as part of its commitment to reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels. While PtL fuels hold significant potential, they are still in the pilot phase, and scaling up production will require substantial investment and technological advancements.

Opportunities for Travelers: A Greener Way to Fly

For global travelers, the shift towards SAF means cleaner air travel options in the future. Major airports in Europe, including Paris Le Bourget, London Luton, and London Farnborough, are leading the way in SAF adoption. As demand grows, airports and airlines are working to ensure SAF availability for passengers. This transition not only benefits the environment but also aligns with travelers’ increasing desire for sustainable travel options.

By supporting the adoption of SAF, travelers can contribute to a greener aviation industry while enjoying the benefits of cleaner, more sustainable flights. As Europe’s aviation industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, the future of air travel looks brighter and more eco-friendly than ever.

Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation Future

Europe’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change. While challenges remain in scaling production, the EU’s proactive approach is setting the stage for a greener future. By prioritizing SAF, Europe is not only reducing aviation emissions but also paving the way for a global shift towards sustainable travel.

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urban Champaign have developed a process that produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) meeting all current industry standards, without needing to be blended with fossil fuels.

The innovation, published in the journal Nature Communications, could help aviation achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. With commercial aviation contributing an increasing share of global greenhouse gas emissions due to growing demand for air travel, sustainable fuel alternatives are seen as crucial for decarbonizing the sector, reported by Newsweek.

Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural and biological engineering at the university, explained that their research addresses both scientific and engineering challenges and allows the industry to take next steps.

He also stated that this technology could be applied to other types of oils to produce SAF and could even replace petroleum-based compounds used in plastics.

He described this discovery as having great potential for business opportunities and economic development.

The researcher's technology is based on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a thermochemical process that converts organic waste into crude oil. This ""biocrude"" is then purified and refined using hydrogen and catalysts, removing elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur to produce jet fuel, reported by Newsweek.

For the study, the team used waste from a nearby food processing plant. Every year more than 30 percent of food production worldwide is wasted, from farms, transportation, stores, and homes. When this waste ends up in landfills or water treatment systems, it emits greenhouse gases upon decomposition. Converting it into jet fuel reduces these emissions and recycles materials that would otherwise contribute to climate change.

The HTL process isn't limited to food waste; it can use a variety of feedstocks. According to the researchers, the process mimics the natural geological conditions under which fossil fuels form, compressing wet biomass under high temperature and pressure to produce biocrude.

The team's final SAF product successfully passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration and meets all standards for use in aircraft engines without any admixtures.

The team suggests that their approach, which helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels for aviation applications and redirects otherwise discarded food waste from landfills where it generates more greenhouse gases, could help the aviation industry meet its “ambitious” goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

According to a statement detailing the innovative approach, the researchers utilized a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which employed a thermochemical reaction to convert ordinary food waste into a basic biocrude oil. This process is similar to how natural processes create crude oil, which is used to make a wide range of products, including automotive and aviation fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth,” explained the study’s lead author, Sabrina Summers, from the U of I. “It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil.”

Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I, said the goal of their research was to upgrade the biocrude oil generated during the HTL process into transportation fuels “that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure.”

The first step in the team’s process involved removing impurities from the biocrude oil. These unwanted contaminants included things like moisture, salt, and ash. Next, Summers and colleagues employed another process, called catalytic hydrotreating, to remove additional unwanted components of the biocrude oil, such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. The team stated that upon completion of these steps, the remaining biocrude was almost entirely composed of the hydrocarbons required to produce jet fuel.

The final step to make viable SAF involved catalyzing the hydrocarbons. According to the team’s statement, they tested several options before settling on cobalt molybdenum as the “most effective” catalyst to drive the needed chemical reactions. During the hydrotreatment portion, the research team also fine-tuned the catalyst and hydrogen loads, temperature, and overall retention time until they achieved the optimal conditions for producing the desired fuel.

Once the conversion process was completed, the team said they tested their final batch of SAF against the “rigorous standards” for quality and purity set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. As hoped, the team said their sample passed “Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests” and successfully met “all specifications for conventional jet fuel.” Notably, the team said their fuel met these standards without the need for any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

When discussing the versatility of their biocrude jet fuel, the team noted that the ability to use food waste as a fuel source is critical, since over 30% of the world’s food is wasted every year “at all levels” of the supply chain. Although the food waste for experiments came from a nearby food processing facility, Summers’ team said that the HTL process can be applied to other organic waste products. These include otherwise discarded materials, such as biowaste, algal blooms, sewage sludge, swine manure from farming, and other forms of agricultural residue that are high in base hydrocarbons.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonize jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” explained ABE professor and the study’s corresponding author, Yuanhui Zhang.

When discussing the potential applications of their research, Zhang noted that their work has helped solve the scientific and engineering problems associated with converting food waste into usable jet fuel, and it is now time for industry to “step in.”

“The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF,” he explained. “It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds, for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development.”

To highlight potential areas that could benefit from this type of biocrude-to-jet-fuel process, Zhang developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, in which he said SAFs provide a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away,” he explained. “In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm.”

On October 27, Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), called for the upcoming COP summit to adopt a global target to quadruple the production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035. He said the goal should be clearly reflected in the conference’s final declaration.

The proposal builds on recent analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which estimates that global output of biofuels and synthetic fuels could reach 28 exajoules by 2035, four times today’s levels, if existing policies are fully implemented. Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3 percent of global energy consumption, with nearly 80 percent derived from liquid biofuels.

Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3 percent of global energy consumption, with nearly 80 percent derived from liquid biofuels.

According to the IEA, these fuels have already helped cut global oil demand by 2.5 million barrels per day in 2024. They are also seen as one of the few practical options to decarbonize sectors that are hard to electrify, such as aviation, shipping, and heavy industry, while reducing countries’ reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Brazil, host of the upcoming COP and the world’s largest bioethanol producer, intends to make the summit a launchpad for an international coalition on sustainable fuels.

High costs remain a hurdle

Despite their potential, sustainable fuels still face major economic obstacles. The IEA estimates that biofuels currently cost 2.7 to 3.8 times more than conventional fossil fuels.

Even so, the impact on consumers would be limited, given the small blending ratios and the relatively low share of energy costs in final goods. Incorporating 15 percent of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into jet fuel, for instance, would raise ticket prices by only 5 to 7 percent, according to the agency.

The agency recommends bold policy measures combining production incentives with the integration of biofuels into carbon markets.

Meeting global production targets will also require massive investment, about $1.5 trillion between 2024 and 2035 under the IEA’s accelerated scenario. The agency recommends bold policy measures combining production incentives with the integration of biofuels into carbon markets.

Yet market signals remain mixed. Shell and BP recently scrapped bioenergy projects in Rotterdam, citing unfavorable economic conditions. For IRENA, such setbacks highlight the need for stable, coordinated international policies to attract capital and build investor confidence.

If governments can agree on a shared pathway and create supportive market conditions, biofuels could become a cornerstone of the global energy transition in hard-to-abate sectors. Without binding commitments, however, IRENA warns that the promise of sustainable fuels risks remaining symbolic.

Strange as it might sound, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign believe that they’ve figured out a process to make that unlikely scenario a reality–at least on a small scale.

Writing this week in Nature Communications, the agricultural engineers outlined a strategy for taking excess food waste, converting it into biofuel, and then “upgrading” that fuel into jet fuel that can go straight into a plane without requiring additional changes to the aircraft’s infrastructure. They compared their food-waste-derived fuel against industry benchmarks and found that it met all the necessary standards for conventional jet fuel.

Though these findings are still more of a proof of concept, they open up the exciting possibility of using food waste (which there’s certainly no shortage of) to help the aviation industry move closer to its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions within the next three decades.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang said in a statement.

Planes lag behind cars in emission reductions

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that transportation accounted for roughly 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2022 alone. Of that, about seven percent came from commercial aircraft. Modern cars have reduced emissions in recent years, in part thanks to the shift toward electric battery power. And while battery-powered airplanes are theoretically possible for some short flights, they simply don’t provide enough energy to power a passenger jet traveling across the country(jet fuel carries around 50 times more energy per kilogram than conventional lithium-ion batteries. As a result, jets have lagged behind cars in reducing emissions.

But what about so-called biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)? Some estimates suggest that SAF, which largely refers to fuels derived from organic materials, could reduce emissions from flying by up to 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. While ethanol and other biomass-based derivatives have been available for cars for decades, they have remained more elusive for airplanes because their chemical composition does not meet the much stricter requirements necessary for jet fuel.

Upgrading biomass to jet fuel

Meeting these requirements is where food waste comes in. In this new experiment, the team started by collecting food waste from nearby food-processing plants. They then used a chemical process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which essentially mimics the way the Earth naturally creates crude oil from organic matter over millions of years, except without all the waiting. HTL kind of acts like an advanced “pressure cooker” to fast-forward nature’s timeline.

With plenty of crude oil extracted from the food scraps, the researchers then set out to convert it into jet fuel through a two-part process. The first step involved removing salt, ash, moisture, and other impurities. After that, they used a cleaning process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate other undesirable elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. What remained were the specific hydrocarbons required to make jet fuel. They tested different catalysts and found that cobalt–molybdenum stood out as the most effective and commercially available metallic catalyst for driving the chemical reactions needed to refine the oil into aviation fuel.

The team took their food-waste derived aviation fuels and tested it against current fuel standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. It passed the screening test and met industry requirements without needing to introduce any special additives. That means, the fuel would theoretically power a commercial airplane.

The findings are a first step to show aviation fuel derived from food waste is at least possible. Actually making enough of it to supply an entire passenger jet, however, is another beast altogether. Scaling up at this level requires time, resources, and deep pocket books outside of academia.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel - a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point - it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company's agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass' cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass' line crosses his family's land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,"" he said, ""and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.""

Results of the Third Quarter It was the strongest quarter in terms of revenue in the history of the Lufthansa Group.
Operating profit for the first nine months amounted to 1.5 billion euros, up 300 million euros on the previous year.
Carsten Spohr, the CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, described the results as a “positive turning point” for the Lufthansa.
This had the positive effect of reducing the financial burden resulting from flight irregularities by more than 200 million euros.","The Lufthansa Group has reported another robust third quarter in operating profits as it’s increased its revenue by 4% year-on-year to 11.2 billion euros (last year was 10.7 billion euros). The Lufthansa Group reaffirmed its outlook of anticipating a significant increase in earnings for the year as a whole.

Results of the Third Quarter

It was the strongest quarter in terms of revenue in the history of the Lufthansa Group. The company generated an operating profit (adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT) of 1.3 billion euros, which was similar to the previous year.

The operating margin for this period was 11.9%, lower than the previous year that was at 12.5%. Operating profit for the first nine months amounted to 1.5 billion euros, up 300 million euros on the previous year.

Carsten Spohr, the CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, described the results as a “positive turning point” for the Lufthansa.

“We have had the best summer in terms of our flight operations in the last decade – with regularity of over 99 percent and a double-digit improvement in punctuality […] In combination with numerous digital innovations, upgraded services, and newly designed lounges, passenger satisfaction rose significantly in the third quarter. With employee satisfaction also reaching new highs across the Group […].”

Spohr also noted concerns about Germany’s competitive position as a business hub, saying,

“Germany as a location for business is benefiting less and less from our success, as shown by the fact that domestic flights within Germany have halved since 2019 due to regulatory cost developments.”

Improved Results in the First Nine Months

In the third quarter, the Lufthansa Group welcomed around 42 million passengers on board its passenger airlines, up from 40 million last year. Despite a 3% increase in seat capacity, load factor rose in the third quarter slightly to 87.5%.

Overall revenue for the passenger airlines grew slightly to 8.9 million euros in the third quarter, generating an operating profit of 1.2 billion euros.

For the first nine months of 2025, passenger airline revenue totalled 23 billion euros, 3% growth compared with the previous year. Adjusted EBIT improved by roughly 10% from the last year to 914 million euros.

There were some key factors for this positive development such as lower fuel cost, improved result from equity investments and the absence of the financial impact of strikes in 2024.

In addition, the Lufthansa Group also recorded an improvement in punctuality by 10% compared to last year, through the stabilisation of flight operations in the first nine months. This had the positive effect of reducing the financial burden resulting from flight irregularities by more than 200 million euros.

Employee satisfaction and outlook

The Lufthansa Group saw an improvement in employee satisfaction in its annual employee ‘involve me!’ survey, that showed the highest engagement levels within the last decade since it began. The engagement index scored an average value of 3.9 out of 5, as compared to last year, the survey recorded a 2.2 out of 5 score.

The outlook for the fourth quarter seems to indicate a more stable demand from the number of advance bookings. The current booking status for Lufthansa is on par with 2024.

With ongoing global uncertainties, the Lufthansa Group remain optimistic and confirmed its forecast for the full year and expects an operating result (adjusted EBIT) to be significantly above the previous year.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lufthansa_Airbus_A320-214_D-AIZL_MUC_2015_01.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 13:00:36.761939

In its formal comments submitted to the EPA, the organization warned that failure to act could cost U.S. soybean farmers between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion in crop value over the next two years, citing estimates from the World Agricultural and Economic Environmental Services (WAEES) model, reports Iowabiodiesel.org.

Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said that biomass-based diesel contributes about 10 percent of the value of each bushel of soybeans grown in the U.S., adding that this support is critical as farmers face record yields amid uncertain global markets.

The IBB’s comments also highlighted the vulnerability of Iowa’s independent biodiesel producers, who lack the financial strength of larger companies to cope with extended periods of policy uncertainty. Kimberley warned that losing these producers would be a major setback for the renewable fuels industry, eliminating years of investment and removing key local markets for Iowa’s farmers at a time when they can least afford it.

The organization urged the EPA to reallocate all small refinery exemptions for 2023 through 2027, finalize Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) before the next compliance year begins, and maintain strong volume targets to ensure stability for farmers and producers.

IBB expressed appreciation for the EPA’s recognition of the expanding production capacity and feedstock investments driving growth in U.S.-made biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. However, the group stressed that delays in finalizing the rule leave the biomass-based diesel sector uncertain and unable to plan future investments. Kimberley noted that Iowa farmers are already preparing for the next planting season and need clarity to make informed decisions.

According to a national study commissioned by Clean Fuels Alliance America, Iowa’s biodiesel industry supports 12,000 jobs and generates $3.5 billion in economic activity each year.

Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) economies can lead these efforts by reskilling and upskilling workers, redesigning jobs, and building trust in AI, so they are not caught on the backfoot, PM Wong said on Nov 1.

“By doing so, we can ensure that the returns from AI investments will accrue not just to the owners of capital, but also to workers, and importantly to all our people,” he said to leaders of the 21 economies around the Pacific Rim which make up the grouping.

Singapore’s focus is on the application and use of AI, he said.

As a small, compact and digitally connected city state, it cannot on its own develop leading-edge AI foundation models. But it can use them to develop and make applications with the “biggest impact” in areas like finance, logistics, healthcare and advanced manufacturing, PM Wong said.

Singapore cannot do this work alone, and is keen to cooperate and exchange best practices with other Apec economies, he added.

In a session themed Preparing For A Future-ready Asia-Pacific, PM Wong said that AI will drive the next wave of growth.

“It will uplift productivity, and transform the way we work and live,” he added, as he laid out ways to spearhead cooperation in harnessing the technology.

AI is already transforming industries in Singapore, he said on the second day of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting, the highest-level meeting at the annual summit which is running from Oct 31 to Nov 1 in Gyeongju, South Korea.

Outlining what needs to be done to unlock the technology’s potential, PM Wong said Apec economies must build up the capabilities of their workforces and prepare workers.

With every new wave of technology, some jobs will disappear and new jobs will be created, and historically, the net impact has been positive – meaning more net jobs have been created.

But there is no economic law that guarantees this will automatically happen, PM Wong said.

“Just because it happened in the past doesn’t mean it will also happen in the future. We cannot leave this to the market.”

Apec economies also need to build trust in AI, he said.

That is why Singapore is playing an active role in global efforts to advance AI standards – so that there is an overall framework for innovation and users know that they are using responsibly developed systems, he added.

To do so, Singapore has set up the AI Verify Foundation to set such standards in partnership with the private sector. It now has more than 170 members including companies like Hitachi, Google and OpenAI, he noted.

The foundation was set up in 2023 to boost AI testing capabilities and assurance to meet the needs of companies and regulators globally.

Earlier in 2025, Singapore also convened leading experts to formulate the Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities, a document aligning views on the development, assessment, and control of AI, he noted.

PM Wong also urged Apec economies to keep data corridors open, because data is what powers AI models.

Singapore supports the Apec Cross-Border Privacy Rules System, which facilitates the free flow of data with trust, in order to promote AI innovation, he said.

Trade pacts like

the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement

– which Singapore, Chile and New Zealand signed in 2020 – can also enable data flows.

On how Apec can take the lead on these efforts, PM Wong said the member economies have AI expertise and experience.

He commended 2025’s Apec summit host South Korea for convening the first Apec Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting.

The Apec AI Initiative is another step in the right direction, he said. It will promote greater cooperation on AI through policy exchanges and capacity-building projects, and foster investments in AI infrastructure.

“Singapore looks forward to working with Apec economies to ensure that our societies benefit from AI,” he said. “Together, we can put AI to work on the problems that matter most, so our people can prosper together.”

The informed professional has been wondering how the aviation and maritime industries can meet aggressive net-zero mandates when Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable marine fuel supply is limited and significantly more expensive than conventional fuel. The core challenge has been the lack of a scalable, cost-effective feedstock and the technical difficulty of converting raw, inconsistent biomass into a high-quality, “drop-in” fuel that performs like its petroleum counterpart.

Analysis

This innovation is driven by the market need for a cost-competitive, scalable SAF solution that does not compete with food crops. The scientific discovery centers on a new chemical process that efficiently handles the complexity of raw biomass. The existing challenge involves high logistics costs for transporting bulky agricultural and forestry waste to a central refinery. This new process converts the waste into a dense, lower-carbon biocrude at the collection site.

This on-site conversion dramatically cuts transport costs and solves the technical challenge of refining the biocrude into high-quality, ready-to-use fuel. Think of this new process like a decentralized coffee grinder that turns bulky beans into a dense, shippable concentrate right at the farm, making the final brewing (refining) process simpler and cheaper at the main facility.

Outlook

This technology implies a significant shift in the sustainable fuel supply chain, moving production closer to the feedstock source. The next signal to watch for is the announcement of major commercial-scale partnerships with large agricultural producers or forestry companies, and the first deployment of the modular plants. If the modular design proves to accelerate project timelines as promised, it will unlock a new, geographically distributed supply of low-cost SAF that can quickly scale to meet regulatory mandates.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-Resource-Management-and-Circular-Economy-Integration-in-Modular-Infrastructure-Design.jpeg,N,,2025-11-01 17:00:11.570769

The Rolls-Royce UltraFan is the world’s largest technology demonstrator jet engine. It is designed to test a range of new technologies for next-generation jet engines. The UltraFan has a massive fan diameter of 3.5 meters (140 inches), larger than the world’s most powerful jet engine, the GE9X (3.4 meters, 134 inches).

The company aims to test thrust performance and propulsive efficiency over a range of 25,000 to 110,000 bf thrust. The UltraFan promises greater fuel efficiency than existing engines, lower carbon emissions, and compatibility with alternative fuels.

Redefining propulsive efficiency through the design

The propulsive efficiency of a turbofan engine depends on various factors, the most important of which is bypass ratio. It is the ratio of the airflow entering the engine core to the airflow bypassing through the secondary duct.

With the ultra-large fan and a compact core, Rolls-Royce is set to hit a home run with the demonstrator design. A unique combination of carbon/titanium fan blades and a new engine core architecture will maximise fuel burn efficiency while reducing emissions.

The UltraFan design benefits from advanced manufacturing and material technologies. Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) techniques are used to produce major components of the engine. Such 3D techniques allow building of industrial objectives in successive layers using digital models.

Unlike traditional subtractive technologies that relied on grinding and machining of metal blocks, the ALM method reduces material waste and allows the creation of intricate designs. The technique also minimises component weight while increasing the accuracy and precision of complex parts.

The UltraFan’s Power Gearbox also holds a world record

The Ultrafan is a geared design featuring the world’s most powerful accessory gearbox, termed Power Gearbox (PGB). In 2021, UltraFan’s PGB set a world record by reaching 64 megawatts (87,000 horsepower) during a test in the company’s facility in Dahlewitz, Germany. Enough to power a small city, the Power Gearbox demonstrated sheer performance and durability – the two parameters essential for next-generation engines.

Dr. Holger Klinger, the subsystem executive of PGB at Rolls-Royce, stated,

“Reaching this record is another great achievement that showcases the performance and durability of this key component for our UltraFan programme. The power gearbox technology is central to the success of the next generation of Rolls-Royce jet engines, and I’m proud to see us pushing the engineering boundaries again.”

Apart from power, endurance, and reliability validation, the PGB demonstrated successful testing on the Altitude Rig, simulating different phases of flight.

First successful tests of the UltraFan

In November 2023, Rolls-Royce completed the first successful tests of its UltraFan demonstrator engine to maximum power. The manufacturer conducted the tests at its Testbed 80 facility in Derby, UK. The first tests were conducted using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), demonstrating strong compatibility with alternative fuels. Rolls-Royce stated that the tests were in line with expectations and that several futuristic technologies were tested during the run.

The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, states,

“Hitting full power with our UltraFan demonstrator sends a strong message that we are leading the way in the transition to more efficient and sustainable aviation. This fantastic milestone puts us in a strong position to support the plans of our customers as they develop the next generation of super-efficient aircraft.”

The Rolls-Royce UltraFan demonstrator is scalable to both widebody and narrowbody aircraft. Rolls-Royce states that commercial versions of the type may emerge in the early 2030s. The technologies built on the UltraFan enable 25% greater fuel efficiency than first-generation Trent engines, and 10% greater efficiency over the Trent XWB engine.
