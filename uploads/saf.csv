Sustainability is central to the New T1 programme. The terminal will operate on 100 percent carbon-free electricity. The adjacent Parking Plaza provides over 250 EV charging stations with an additional 250 EV-ready spaces, as well as more than 300 bicycle parking spaces. Airfield improvements reduce emissions through an underground fuel-delivery system, and a 900,000-gallon cistern captures and reuses stormwater. The facility is designed to withstand future climate impacts and is pursuing LEED-Gold certification.

Construction on Phase 1B will begin in early 2026. Three additional gates will open in spring 2026, with the remaining eight gates opening in early 2028, bringing the total number of gates to 30.

Beyond passenger amenities, the $3.8 billion New T1 project is estimated to generate over $4.5 billion for San Diego’s economy. Upon completion, the programme will have created 25,300 jobs paying $2 billion in wages. Local governments are expected to receive $127 million in tax revenues, supporting public services and infrastructure.

In the pursuit of net-zero by 2050, the aviation industry demands “fundamental innovation” in aircraft design. A partnership between aircraft giant Airbus and tech leader Toshiba is leading the charge.

According to the companies, they’ve developed a breakthrough superconducting motor designed for hydrogen-powered flight.

The Future of Hydrogen-Powered Transportation

Toshiba unveiled the superconducting motor in 2022, showcasing a potential solution to the need for high power with minimal weight. According to Fumitoshi Mizutani, who leads the motor development project at Toshiba, the initial prototype demonstrated remarkable efficiency.

In 2022, we succeeded in developing a prototype superconducting motor that is both lightweight and compact, but still capable of delivering high output of 2 megawatts,” Mizutani said. “It is one-tenth the weight of conventional products with the same output.”

The prototype’s compact size and favorable output drew the attention of Airbus. The company is developing zero-emission, hydrogen-powered aircraft that could utilize a superconducting motor.

According to engineers, the motor’s technology, specifically the electric method where hydrogen fuel cells generate power, is an ideal match for hydrogen propulsion. Superconductivity is the property of certain materials to achieve zero electrical resistance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures. They emphasize its ability to work in tandem with hydrogen storage.

If engineers want to use hydrogen as fuel, it must be liquified and stored at –253∘C.

Toshiba leaders consider themselves pioneers because the company has put over 50 years of research into this field. However, hydrogen’s availability remains a barrier. Despite the hurdles, they expect the superconducting motor to boost fuel efficiency and flight range. Additionally, it holds promising applications beyond aviation into shipping and space development.

Shibata and Mizutani said, “As engineers, there’s something truly romantic and exciting about developing next-generation aircraft.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/superconduction-robot.png,N,,2025-10-09 11:58:11.226561

“Our site provides vital infrastructure, reliable energy and integrated utility services essential for delivering large-scale, low-carbon projects.

“This partnership reinforces our commitment to enabling the UK’s energy transition and strengthens Wilton International’s strategic proposition in supporting industrial decarbonisation.”

Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen hailed the move as “another incredible vote of confidence in our region from Willis, helping Teesside lead the way in aviation services and pioneering fuels of the future.”

And Redcar MP Anna Turley said this was “exactly the kind of opportunities we want for our young people and skilled workforce here on Teesside”.

She added: “I’ve been proud to champion Willis’ plans from the start, working hard to help secure £2.9m in government funding and support to make sure Teesside was at the front of the queue. I’m delighted that they’ve chosen Wilton – a decision that underlines the strength of our area, our people, and our local expertise.”

The Wilton fuel plant will run in tandem with Willis’s expansion at Teesside International Airport, where a huge 50ft-high maintenance hangar is already rising on the north side of the site.

The 100m x 50m facility, capable of handling 737s and A320 family aircraft including the latest models, will significantly grow the company’s operations and establish the airport as a future hub for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul – creating more skilled jobs in the process.",https://teesbusiness.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WILTON-SITE-AERIAL-Willis-Aviation.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 11:58:16.104516

Building a domestic carbon removals market

Air New Zealand has become one of the first major corporates to invest in a new wave of homegrown, internationally verified carbon removals, committing to purchase 8,000 tonnes by 2030 through its partnership with My Native Forest.

The initiative aims to catalyse a robust voluntary carbon market in New Zealand by backing native forest regeneration verified to international standards — a step that could redefine how the country’s private sector contributes to climate targets and biodiversity goals.

My Native Forest provides a digital platform for investing in the restoration of indigenous ecosystems across Aotearoa in exchange for verified carbon removals. Unlike conventional avoidance credits, which prevent emissions elsewhere, removal credits represent carbon physically captured and stored by newly established forests.

Long-term climate strategy for hard-to-abate aviation

Kiri Hannifin, Air New Zealand’s Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer, said the decision reflects the airline’s commitment to begin climate action “in its own backyard” while preparing for a carbon market expected to mature later this decade.

“Native forest planting takes time, so it’s important to secure future supply now,” Hannifin said. “As New Zealand’s national carrier, the co-benefits for biodiversity and pest control here at home make this agreement even more powerful.”

She noted that aviation remains among the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. “Scaling sustainable aviation fuel, optimising our fleet, and developing alternative propulsion technologies are complex, expensive, and rely on multiple external factors. High-integrity carbon removals will play a significant role in reaching net zero by 2050 — and New Zealand is uniquely positioned with its land, ecosystems, and international reputation to supply them,” she added.

The airline’s purchase will be delivered in phases — 500 tonnes in 2028, 2,500 in 2029, and 5,000 in 2030 — with each verified credit representing one tonne of carbon removed. All credits will be issued via a global registry under recognised international verification frameworks.

Carbon finance for biodiversity and local resilience

Mitchell McLaughlin, co-founder of My Native Forest, said Air New Zealand’s early investment demonstrates the power of carbon finance to fund nature-based restoration at scale. Land parcels for the programme are being identified across Canterbury, Nelson, Marlborough, Tairāwhiti Gisborne, Waikato, Auckland, and Northland.

“Air New Zealand will provide capital in return for carbon removals that might otherwise have flowed offshore. Instead, it will stay here, directly funding native forest restoration,” McLaughlin said. “This partnership shows that planting native trees is no longer just a goodwill gesture — it’s a commercially viable pathway for landowners.”

He added that the benefits reach far beyond carbon accounting. “We’re creating income streams that reward integrity while restoring biodiversity, protecting waterways, and strengthening rural economies. Every tonne of carbon removed supports nurseries, contractors, pest-control operations, and local communities across Aotearoa.”

Strengthening credibility in the global carbon market

New Zealand’s voluntary carbon market has faced challenges in establishing verification systems that align with international standards, a key barrier to attracting institutional buyers. My Native Forest’s approach — combining digital monitoring tools, global registry issuance, and local ecological oversight — is designed to overcome that gap.

The move also positions New Zealand to play a larger role in global carbon markets as corporate demand for removals accelerates. Removal credits have gained traction among multinational buyers seeking to align with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidance and aviation’s global net-zero roadmap under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA scheme.

Hannifin said securing verified domestic supply early ensures Air New Zealand can meet future compliance and voluntary offset needs without relying solely on overseas projects. “Starting now helps ensure the market will be ready when we really need it,” she said.

Expanding local partnerships

Air New Zealand is in the final stages of negotiating a second contract with another New Zealand-based supplier of internationally verified, nature-based removals, expected to be finalised by the end of the year. Together, these partnerships aim to demonstrate how domestic, high-integrity removals can compete with — and complement — global supply options.

For investors and corporate sustainability leaders, the deal offers a case study in using carbon finance to drive local climate action while meeting international reporting and verification requirements.

By directing capital into native forest restoration rather than overseas offset schemes, Air New Zealand is testing a model that could help bridge the gap between national climate priorities and global market credibility — a space increasingly critical for hard-to-abate sectors worldwide.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Air-New-Zealand-invests-in-New-Zealand-nature-through-first-verified-carbon-removals.webp,N,,2025-10-09 12:57:53.233190

,,2025-10-09 12:05:30+00:00,Power Technology via Yahoo News,Microalgae: the biofuel feedstock of the future - Yahoo,Eve Thomas,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/microalgae-biofuel-feedstock-future-112459178.html,"Without an alternative feedstock, waste lipids threaten to stunt the biofuel sector’s growth.
As a biofuel feedstock, microalgae can be cultivated in controlled ponds or photobioreactors, which can be placed on non-arable land.
Instead, it describes microalgae as a biofuel feedstock solution as “…abundant, more evenly distributed, and scalable”.
As innovation continues to bring these associated costs down, the use of microalgae to ease supply bottlenecks for biofuel feedstocks will remain a medium-to-long-term conversation.
In the long-term however, Brambilla’s briefing concludes: “Microalgae, with its scalability, CO₂ absorption and high yields, represents the strongest candidate for tomorrow’s feedstock, with municipal solid waste and lignocellulosic biomass providing complementary roles.” ""Microalgae: the biofuel feedstock of the future "" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.","Biofuel has been touted as the cornerstone of a decarbonised future, but the complex supply chains and finite availability of waste lipids – historically the favoured feedstock – means that the sector faces an impending bottleneck.

As a result, biofuel producers are looking for new biomass feedstocks – and carbon dioxide (CO₂)-absorbing microalgae look to be the most sustainable, scalable solution in the long-term, according to GlobalData’s recent Next-Generation Fuels: Market Outlook, Trends and Opportunities report.

GlobalData is the parent company of Offshore Technology.

The waste lipid problem

Alternative fuels are a growing sector, spurred by the need to curb emissions associated with heavy transport industries such as aviation and maritime. These alternative fuels include sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, which GlobalData forecasts will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% between 2025 and 2030, with global capacity expected to double by 2030.

The recent rapid growth of alternative fuels has been powered by waste lipids, primarily animal fats and used cooking oil (UCO). By 2030, GlobalData expects that 5.6 billion gallons per year of animal fats will be used, with UCO utilised in the highest number of plants, at 65.

The popularity of waste lipids is considered in a recent analyst briefing written by GlobalData energy transition analyst Clarice Brambilla, who spoke to Offshore Technology to expand on her report.

“Animal fats and UCO have become the go-to feedstocks because they are well-known, abundant, and supported by robust collection networks built for biodiesel and renewable diesel production,” she said. “From a technical standpoint, they contain a high proportion of easily convertible lipids, which simplifies processing and reduces capital intensity compared to lignocellulosic or waste-based alternatives.”

Government policy has promoted the use of waste lipids as a biomass feedstock, putting support in place to boost the developing sector and avoid the ‘food versus fuel’ debate associated with crop-based biofuels. Instead of threatening food security, waste lipids from UCO and animal fats align with policymakers’ push for circular economy principles. As a result, frameworks such as the EU RED III double-counting mechanism and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard have emerged, allowing UCO and animal fats to receive 'double counting' credit and low carbon-intensity scores.

However, little can be done about the fact that waste lipids are finitely available and that the biofuel sector is going to hit a supply problem. The International Energy Agency doesn’t expect cooking oil supply yo ever exceed 20 million tonnes annually.

Without an alternative feedstock, waste lipids threaten to stunt the biofuel sector’s growth.

The microalgae answer

Solving this bottleneck is crucial to supporting the growth of alternative fuels. Brambilla’s briefing points to a new solution, suggesting that “microalgae stand out as the most promising option”.

Microalgae are defined as “microscopic single-celled photosynthetic microbes that can exist individually or in colonies, with sizes ranging from 1 to 10μm [micrometres]”. They differ from macroalgae not only because they are smaller but because they lack physical structures such as lamina, holdfast and haptera.

As a biofuel feedstock, microalgae can be cultivated in controlled ponds or photobioreactors, which can be placed on non-arable land. The efficient use of land gives microalgae an advantage over other biomass feedstocks such as non-edible oils and forest residue, which are land-intensive and take away from potential agricultural space.

Critics of other biomass feedstocks such as palm, soybean and vegetable oils have pointed to negative impacts on food security and water availability. However, microalgae biorefineries do not compete with food markets, making sustainable scaling possible.

The briefing explains that “unlike waste lipids, algae are not constrained by food systems, land availability, or fragmented supply chains”. Instead, it describes microalgae as a biofuel feedstock solution as “…abundant, more evenly distributed, and scalable”.

Microalgae biorefineries can be located conveniently for producers to optimise supply chains and reduce transport costs. In Chiclana, Spain, the EU-funded All-gas project uses municipal wastewater to grow microalgae cultures. Wastewater nutrients, residual biomass energy and CO₂ are used as biofuel inputs, utilising the full production chain of algae to biofuels. The project is designed to demonstrate the sustainable large-scale production of biofuels, which can be co-located near industrial or urban hubs.

Elsewhere, the FUELGAE project is targeting the production of advanced biofuels for emissions-heavy transport sectors. With €5m ($5.8m) in EU funding, the project is piloting integrated algae cultivation at a steel plant in Romania and a 2G ethanol facility in Spain. The briefing considers the project, noting: “While these efforts highlight the technical feasibility of algae as a feedstock, high production costs – driven by cultivation infrastructure, energy intensive harvesting and refining processes – continue to pose hurdles, underscoring the importance of sustained government support.”

Early days: microalgae's obstacles

With the technology still in research, development and pilot stages, Brambilla told Offshore Technology: “Significant scaling of algae-derived fuels is unlikely before the early-to-mid 2030s, and more realistically toward 2035–40, when production costs and conversion efficiencies are expected to improve. Today, algae fuel remains in the pilot and early demonstration phase, with high cultivation costs limiting commercial rollout.”

Indeed, the biggest obstacle to scalability is the expense associated with cultivating, harvesting and refining the microalgae. Investors need to overcome operational costs including the development and installation of specialised infrastructure, and costs associated with energy-intensive harvesting and drying techniques (such as centrifugation, filtration and flocculation for harvesting and dewatering for drying).

Optimising cultivation will maximise the lipid accumulation, so producers must also maintain carefully controlled environmental conditions. Microalgae require adequate light, CO₂ supply and a temperature of between 15°C and 30°C, all factors that are energy-intensive and therefore expensive to control.

As innovation continues to bring these associated costs down, the use of microalgae to ease supply bottlenecks for biofuel feedstocks will remain a medium-to-long-term conversation. For now, waste oils and animal fats will remain the main feedstocks of the biogas sector, expected to sustain renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel until 2030.

In the long-term however, Brambilla’s briefing concludes: “Microalgae, with its scalability, CO₂ absorption and high yields, represents the strongest candidate for tomorrow’s feedstock, with municipal solid waste and lignocellulosic biomass providing complementary roles.”

The microalgae answer

Solving this bottleneck is crucial to supporting the growth of alternative fuels. Brambilla’s briefing points to a new solution, suggesting that “microalgae stand out as the most promising option”.

Microalgae are defined as “microscopic single-celled photosynthetic microbes that can exist individually or in colonies, with sizes ranging from 1 to 10μm [micrometres]”. They differ from macroalgae not only because they are smaller but because they lack physical structures such as lamina, holdfast and haptera.

As a biofuel feedstock, microalgae can be cultivated in controlled ponds or photobioreactors, which can be placed on non-arable land. The efficient use of land gives microalgae an advantage over other biomass feedstocks such as non-edible oils and forest residue, which are land-intensive and take away from potential agricultural space.

Critics of other biomass feedstocks such as palm, soybean and vegetable oils have pointed to negative impacts on food security and water availability. However, microalgae biorefineries do not compete with food markets, making sustainable scaling possible.

The briefing explains that “unlike waste lipids, algae are not constrained by food systems, land availability, or fragmented supply chains”. Instead, it describes microalgae as a biofuel feedstock solution as “…abundant, more evenly distributed, and scalable”.

Microalgae biorefineries can be located conveniently for producers to optimise supply chains and reduce transport costs. In Chiclana, Spain, the EU-funded All-gas project uses municipal wastewater to grow microalgae cultures. Wastewater nutrients, residual biomass energy and CO₂ are used as biofuel inputs, utilising the full production chain of algae to biofuels. The project is designed to demonstrate the sustainable large-scale production of biofuels, which can be co-located near industrial or urban hubs.

Elsewhere, the FUELGAE project is targeting the production of advanced biofuels for emissions-heavy transport sectors. With €5m ($5.8m) in EU funding, the project is piloting integrated algae cultivation at a steel plant in Romania and a 2G ethanol facility in Spain.

China’s push to meet both domestic and global demand for renewable energy technology to achieve carbon neutrality has led to massive overcapacity.","China can decarbonise the world – but even that won’t fix its overcapacity problem

Alicia Gª Herrero (Natixis) | China is crucial role to the world’s green transition for two contrasting reasons: it is the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter – over 30 percent of the global total – and it is the world’s largest producer of green technology. China is vital especially for renewable energy products, manufacturing 92 percent of the world’s solar modules and 82 percent of wind turbines as of 2024. The fact that 90 percent of global emissions come from energy consumption underscores the importance of China’s dominant market share.

China’s leadership said in 2020 that it would achieve an emissions peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Although these goals have not been formally adopted in law, China has published a series of regulations to pave the way, including the Action Plan for Carbon Emission Peaking Before 2030 (NDRC, 2021) and the Energy Law of China. As a crucial part of its decarbonisation campaign, China aims to raise the share of energy consumption generated from non-fossil fuel sources to 20 percent by 2025, 25 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2060. Solar and wind power will meet the bulk of this increased demand. This share stood at 19.8 percent in 2024, only a nudge away from the 2025 target.

To meet its goals, China faces a steep curve for growth of non-fossil fuel energy consumption after 2030. With the world’s heavy reliance on China’s green technology exports, the question arises as to whether China can produce enough renewable technology to facilitate not only its own demands, but also the rest of world’s requirements for net-zero emissions. In the following sections, we provide estimates to answer this question.

Calculating the required installed capacity

We calculated the amount of renewable power generation needed to meet the global renewable energy demand forecast in the International Energy Agency’s NZE 2050 scenario (IEA, 2023), which makes projections based on the premise of reaching global net-zero emissions by 2050. We then estimated the installed capacity of solar and wind power that would be required by 2050, assuming the same utilisation hours per year as the average for 2020-2024.

Our projections show that despite being behind schedule, the stage reached in global installation of renewable power is not too far from the trajectory for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This means the growth upside for global renewable energy demand may be limited. Meanwhile, the regional breakdown shows a great imbalance: China is surpassing the required rate of installation, while the rest of world is moving too slowly. It thus seems straightforward for China to fulfil its own renewable energy requirements in order to achieve net-zero emissions.

Even in the case of increased global demand under NZE 2050, China will still be able to supply the world’s installation needs to the same degree as it is doing now. In 2024, China supplied 91 percent of the solar modules and 39 percent of wind turbines installed outside China. Assuming China maintains production at that level, and that China exports all products beyond what is needed to meet domestic demand, it will be able to provide approximately four-fifths of solar equipment and more than half of the wind turbines needed for the rest of world.

For wind, there seems to be clear scope for China to contribute more than it has so far. For solar, it seems China’s current production is not enough to cover the world’s future demand. However, considering China’s meteoric production capacity rise, there is no doubt that China will be able to meet global demand easily, without further expansion. Therefore, China can already produce enough renewable products for the world’s energy transition, even in the most aggressive scenario. In fact, China faces overcapacity because global demand remains far below the NZE 2050 level.

Removing green-tech manufacturing subsidies deals a blow to China’s economy

Chinese overcapacity in solar products has grown since 2023 as export prices have fallen while export volumes have continued to rise (García-Herrero and Xu, 2025). As external demand has subsided due to delayed installation and protectionism against Chinese green technology, Chinese manufacturers have turned to the domestic market, with irrational business practices, such as offering below-cost prices for orders. Installation has consequently surged, greatly exceeding actual energy needs.

Consequently, the profitability of Chinese solar manufacturers has plummeted, with a 200 percent fall in their operating income from 2022 to 2024. Given this, many have trimmed capital expenditure by 40 percent, on average.

In addition, China in February 2025 repealed the fixed feed-in tariff for renewable power, meaning newly built on-grid renewable projects since 1 June 2025 have to face market-determined prices. This triggered massive frontloading in the first half of 2025. After the cut-off date, installation declined rapidly and is expected to continue to decline.

With worsening financial performance, the ending of price support and frontloaded installation, China’s enthusiasm for renewables should cool in the remainder of 2025 and beyond. Structural overcapacity will decline gradually as the market consolidates through mergers and acquisitions.

Silver lining: spurring growth through grid investment

Although installation of renewable energy generation capacity in China has increased, it hasn’t been utilised effectively, because of the unstable nature of renewable power and, more importantly, the lack of infrastructure for renewable projects.

From 2020 to 2024, China installed an unprecedented 900 GW of renewable capacity, yet failed to reduce energy and carbon intensity by 13.5 percent and 18 percent, as called for in the government’s 14th Five Year Plan. In addition to the structural slowdown in the Chinese economy, China’s continued reliance on electricity from fossil fuels could be a major reason. Despite the higher share of renewable power in installed capacity, the share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources remains low, leaving the bulk of the power load to fossil fuels.

The root cause of this is the widespread underutilisation of installed renewable power capacity and increased curtailment, due to China’s underinvestment in the power grid. Since the dual carbon targets were announced in 2020, investment in power generation has surged while investment in the power grid has remained largely the same. The lagging investment in the power grid has put a cap on renewable power consumption as projects sit on a waiting list to connect to the grid (IEA, 2024).

The lack of grid capacity is especially apparent in inter-regional transmission, power dispatching and power load management, which creates further blocks to renewable power consumption. In some of China’s western provinces, where the largest renewable projects are located, the curtailment rate can reach over 30 percent because of insufficient grid capacity. Moreover, although China’s energy storage projects have picked up in the past two years, the total storage capacity remains minimal compared to the stock of renewables, meaning less flexibility in responding to demand fluctuations.

Conclusions: overcoming overcapacity and spurring the economy

China needs to increase its investment in power infrastructure to reduce renewable curtailment and curb its reliance on carbon-intensive power sources. This would create new growth momentum to counter the retreat of capital expenditure in renewable equipment manufacturing and renewable project construction.

First, China needs to ramp up investment in its national power grid to increase power transmission capacity. This has started already, with power grid investment increasing to 608 billion renminbi in 2024 from 528 billion renminbi in 2023 and continuing to grow by 12 percent year-on-year in the first seven months of 2025. With power demand projected to grow by 50 percent by 2050 and the need for improved west-to-east power transmission, China may need to double investment in its power grid by 2030 to fill the gap.

Second, China needs to set more ambitious targets for energy storage capacity to support the functioning of the power grid. With integrated or standalone storage solutions, renewable projects can better navigate the volatility of power demand. Energy storage allows the freedom to time power sales for maximum profit and can also serve as a stabiliser when the power grid faces overload or underload.

Finally, global demand for power infrastructure is rising. Given the rising share of renewable power, global power grid systems need to be upgraded as disturbances from weather events require greater grid stability. This will continue to boost China’s exports of electrical equipment, supporting the economy.

Beyond the fact that investing in power infrastructure will keep China’s green-growth engine running, there is the additional geopolitical advantage of shifting international attention away from China’s overcapacity in renewables and subsequent dumping of subsidised green technology on the global market. Power infrastructure may even replace renewable equipment as a new source of trade revenue, as it is less sensitive and thus less likely to be a target of sanctions.

China’s push to meet both domestic and global demand for renewable energy technology to achieve carbon neutrality has led to massive overcapacity. By pivoting investment from renewable energy capacity to power-grid upgrades and equipment, China can shore up an otherwise underwhelming domestic economy, keep on track for its net-zero.",https://thecorner.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/logotipo-the-corner-eu-1200-453.png,N,,2025-10-09 08:56:33.191566

For the December quarter, we expect total revenue growth of 2 percent to 4 percent over last year's record performance, with healthy sequential unit revenue improvement driven by continued Domestic strength and meaningful improvement in Transatlantic unit revenue,"" said Glen Hauenstein, Delta's president.

Record September quarter revenue reflecting the strength of Delta's brand: September quarter total revenue increased 4.1 percent over prior year to a record $15.2 billion, led by premium, corporate and loyalty. Adjusted total unit revenue (TRASM) growth improved 3.5 points sequentially, with the September quarter up 0.3 percent over prior year. Consistent with previous disclosures, year-over-year comparisons for the September quarter benefitted from lapping last year's CrowdStrike-caused outage, including 2.6 points on total revenue growth and 1.1 points on total unit revenue growth. The December quarter outlook for revenue growth of 2 percent to 4 percent reflects healthy sequential improvement in underlying revenue and unit revenue trends.

Diverse, high-margin revenue streams leading growth: Delta's diversified revenue base contributed 60 percent of total revenue in the third quarter and grew double-digits year-over-year. Premium revenue grew 9 percent compared to the September quarter of 2024, with improvement across all products. Loyalty revenue increased 9 percent year-over-year as SkyMiles members continue to deepen engagement beyond flight. American Express remuneration of $2 billion grew 12 percent over prior year, driven by double-digit co-brand spend growth.

Improving Domestic revenue environment: Domestic passenger revenue grew 5 percent year-over-year, supported by an acceleration in corporate sales, continued strength in premium cabins and an inflection in main cabin unit revenue growth. Domestic unit revenue grew 2 percent over prior year during the quarter and is expected to remain positive in the December quarter.

Corporate sales* rebounding with sequential improvement across all sectors: Corporate sales were up 8 percent over prior year in the third quarter. Recent corporate survey results indicate that roughly 90 percent of companies expect their travel volume to increase or remain steady in 2026, 5 points higher than last year's survey at this time.

Cost Performance and Outlook

""Our teams continue to deliver for our customers, achieving operational performance that has led the industry. Non-fuel unit cost growth was approximately flat compared to prior year, bringing year-to-date non-fuel unit cost growth to less than 2 percent, consistent with our low-single digit guidance at the start of the year even as we reduced capacity post summer to align to demand,"" said Dan Janki, Delta's chief financial officer.

Additional information concerning risks and uncertainties that could cause differences between actual results and forward-looking statements is contained in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and other filings filed with the SEC from time to time. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which represent our views only as of the date of this press release, and which we undertake no obligation to update except to the extent required by law.

Note A: The following tables show reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. The reasons Delta uses these measures are described below. Reconciliations may not calculate exactly due to rounding.

Delta sometimes uses information (""non-GAAP financial measures"") that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP""). Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The tables below show reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Forward Looking Projections. Delta is not able to reconcile forward looking non-GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort because the adjusting items such as those used in the reconciliations below will not be known until the end of the period and could be significant.

Adjustments. These reconciliations include certain adjustments to GAAP measures that are made to provide comparability between the reported periods, if applicable, and for the reasons indicated below:

Third-party refinery sales. Refinery sales to third parties, and related expenses, are not related to our airline segment. Excluding these sales therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.

MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges. Mark-to-market (""MTM"") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period, and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period.

MTM adjustments on investments. Unrealized gains/losses result from our equity investments that are accounted for at fair value in non-operating expense. The gains/losses are driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in certain companies, particularly those without publicly-traded shares. Adjusting for these gains/losses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.

Loss on extinguishment of debt. This adjustment relates to early termination of a portion of our debt. Adjusting for these losses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.

Realized gain on sale of investments. This adjustment relates to gains on the sale of investments generated in adjusted results that had previously been included in GAAP results. During the September 2024 quarter, we sold a portion of our investment in CLEAR. Adjusting for this gain allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.

Operating Cash Flow, adjusted. We present operating cash flow, adjusted because management believes adjusting for the following item provides a more meaningful measure for investors:

Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities. We adjust for these items, which were primarily funded by cash restricted for airport construction, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's operating cash flow that is core to our operations in the periods shown.

Adjusted Non-Fuel Cost and Non-Fuel Unit Cost or Cost per Available Seat Mile, (""CASM-Ex"")

We adjust operating expense and CASM for certain items described above, as well as the following items and reasons described below:

Aircraft fuel and related taxes. The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.

Profit sharing. We adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.

Adjusted Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (""EBITDAR""). We present adjusted debt to EBITDAR (""gross leverage"") because management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company's overall debt profile. Adjusted debt includes total operating lease liabilities (including fleet, ground and other) and sale-leaseback financing liabilities. We calculate EBITDAR by adding depreciation and amortization to operating income, adjusted and adjusting for the fixed portion of operating lease expense.

Adjusted Net Debt. We use adjusted gross debt, including fleet operating lease liabilities (comprised of aircraft and engine leases and regional aircraft leases embedded within our capacity purchase agreements) and unfunded pension liabilities (if applicable), in addition to adjusted debt and finance leases, to present estimated financial obligations. We reduce adjusted total debt by cash, cash equivalents, and LGA restricted cash, resulting in adjusted net debt, to present the amount of assets needed to satisfy the debt. Management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company's overall debt profile.

Gross Capital Expenditures. We adjust capital expenditures for the following item to determine gross capital expenditures for the reason described below:

Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in capital expenditures. We adjust for these items because management believes investors should be informed that a portion of these capital expenditures from airport construction projects are either funded with restricted cash specific to these projects or reimbursed by a third party.

Free Cash Flow. We present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Free cash flow is also used internally as a component of our incentive compensation programs. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities and net cash from investing activities, adjusted for (i) pension plan contributions, (ii) net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and (iii) net redemptions of short-term investments. These adjustments are made for the following reasons:

Pension plan contributions. Cash flows related to pension funding are included in our GAAP operating activities. We adjust to exclude these contributions to allow investors to understand the cash flows related to our core operations.

Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities and capital expenditures. We have adjusted for these items, which were primarily funded by cash restricted for airport construction, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow and capital expenditures that are core to our operations in the periods shown.

Net redemptions of short-term investments. Net redemptions of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow generated by our operations.

First, chemical engineers refined electrofuels, or e-fuels, manufactured with hydrogen produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide.

Then through a series of hydroprocessing reactions over several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They produced a small batch – about a barrel of fuel.

SwRI’s fuels and lubricants specialists then tested and characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI’s propulsion and energy specialists then used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time and risks for our clients.”

“Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,” said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI’s Mechanical Engineering Division. “With this project we’re gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.”",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Low-Res_advancing-sustainable-aviation-fuels-research-18-Full-size-RGB-JPG-1.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-09 06:58:31.413862

Emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere need to be avoided to prevent dramatic climate change. In fact, Europe leads the way by targeting net-zero emissions and, thus, full climate neutrality by 2050. Capturing CO2 from industrial processes (or air) and subsequent utilisation or storage of this gas (CCU/S) is necessary to reach those targets. However, CCU/S comes at a steep energetic cost itself, so this process should not only be accelerated in terms of deployment, but also be made more sustainable to reach net-zero industrial emissions.

The ConsenCUS project

Since 2021, a consortium of 19 industrial and academic partners has been working on ground-breaking innovations that all aim to make CCUS compatible with a net-zero world. The core strategy revolves around using electricity for the capture and conversion processes, which is much easier to decarbonise than the heat-powered solutions on the market. In a nutshell, the ConsenCUS project aimed to achieve its acronym: CarbOn Neutral cluSters through Electricity-based iNnovations in Capture, Utilisation and Storage. Now, the project is in its final months. It has demonstrated the technical feasibility of the solutions with a three-stage pilot campaign and its economic, environmental, and societal impact potential if the innovations are implemented at full scale through multidisciplinary analyses.

Carbon capture and utilisation demonstrated

The ConsenCUS carbon capture technology uses the natural equilibrium between CO2 and water: at high pH, a potassium hydroxide solution absorbs the CO2 directly from factory exhaust fumes passing through an absorption column. In a separate regeneration module, the pH is lowered using electrochemically active membrane stacks, which bubble out the CO2 and recycle the solvent for the absorption process.

The central challenge in the project was to bring this concept, not demonstrated for carbon capture before, from the lab scale to a real industrial environment. After careful design and construction, the demonstration modules proved capable of dealing with starkly different flue gas compositions at the sites of a cement production plant in Aalborg (Denmark), a refinery near Ploiesti (Romania), and a magnesite production plant in Yerakini (Greece). The main challenges that were addressed: reaching low energy consumption and high CO2 capture efficiency, so that the technology can compete with benchmark technology when applied at full scale.

The captured CO2 was used to feed the adjacent CO2 utilisation module, where the CO2 was pressurised and converted into potassium formate, also using electricity. This biodegradable product is a preservative with an associated billion-dollar market, but can also be used to produce formic acid or in protein or fuel production to further increase its value. Even at this pilot scale, this process was found to be less energy-intensive than the conventional fossil route to produce potassium formate and formic acid, with the potential for full sustainability when renewable electricity is used.

As shown in the picture, the capture process consists of:

1. The CO2 absorption column;

2. Solvent regeneration and CO2 separation module; and

3. CO2 utilisation module deployed to convert CO2 into useful chemical building blocks.

Net zero industry needs safe CO2 pipelines and storage

Even with carbon capture and utilisation technology fully developed and decarbonised, CO2 would need to be moved to the optimal location for conversion or storage to achieve net-zero industries. The ConsenCUS project results contribute to three important prerequisites:

Safety assessment of permanent underground CO2 storage locations (e.g., Stenlille, Denmark) and the gas quality and geological characteristics of temporary underground CO2 storage during multiple on- and offloading sequences, which may be relevant in the future.

Risk assessment on CO2 pipeline transport, specifically with regard to rupture in varying weather conditions.

A mathematical model for optimisation of the logistics of CO2 between emitters and users or storage locations, applied to case studies of sustainable aviation fuel production and Southeast Europe as a net-zero industrial cluster.

People and planet

ConsenCUS field research through online and town hall meetings, visits to schools and community centres provided insight into the level of awareness and acceptance of CCU/S among the general public. It was found that social awareness of any CCU/S technology is low, and acceptance of CCU/S depends on the high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and diversity with regard to each unique project’s specifics. Community members still preferred to have early and highly transparent engagement, even for pilot projects such as ConsenCUS. Honest communication on technology benefits and disclosure of risks was found to be a desirable strategy, but enabling community members with the means to participate (time or financial compensation) is necessary for this. Without this, the identified challenges of engagement fatigue, token engagements, and unequal partnerships are difficult to overcome.

Local acceptance is, perhaps unsurprisingly, connected to local environmental concerns. Water consumption worried community members in Greece, where alternative CO2 mitigation projects such as forestation were therefore seen more positively. While the ConsenCUS capture and conversion technologies decarbonise CCU by enabling renewable energy usage, it is important for the environmental performance as well as the social acceptance that other strains on the planet’s resources are known and taken into account. Full life cycle analysis of environmental strains and a dynamic life cycle cost analysis demonstrate the benefits and potential economic value of the ConsenCUS solutions, although the carbon footprint and price of the electricity that is being used are critical in these two aspects.

Industrial carbon management in the EU

Based on early project results, the consortium advocated for CCU/S development and deployment to be accelerated, and the consideration of the (carbon) footprint of CO2 emission mitigation strategies in planning for a net-zero future. With the Net Zero Industry Act and the Clean Industrial Deal and Industrial Carbon Management strategy of the EU now in place, the support for CCU/S has seen a major uptick over the course of the four-year project. To achieve the goals the Union has set for itself, we have further recommendations on how to maximise the impact of innovation within the EU member states.

Five recommendations for the EU’s industrial carbon management (ICM) policy

1. Support for ICM technologies should enable both next-generation technologies and the deployment of existing mature technologies.

2. The EU’s research and innovation (R&I) frameworks must acknowledge the importance of demonstrating, not just developing, innovative ICM technologies. This means fostering ‘learning-by-doing’, providing resource flexibility, and aligning project success indicators with the long timelines for demonstrating new technologies in real operational conditions.

3. Mechanisms to mitigate the high energy costs faced by industry, while still maintaining climate ambition, will be essential to ensure the operational feasibility of carbon capture.

4. Support for ICM demonstration and deployment must acknowledge the trade-offs between technology characteristics such as cost, environmental footprint, capture efficiency, energy consumption, scalability potential, and others.

5. To improve the EU’s competitiveness in ICM, R&I frameworks must be relatively unbureaucratic and allow flexibility for project consortia to recruit expertise with minimal administrative constraints, supported by appropriate human and knowledge resources from EU agencies.

As the ConsenCUS project is ending in 2025, the consortium is confident that CCU/S has improved its position as a viable and necessary strategy to prevent global climate change, while maintaining European industrial competitiveness and relevance. Scaling up the electrochemical CO2 capture and utilisation technology to full commercial scale, in collaboration with local communities and governments to optimise its logistics and place in the energy system, fits well in the net-zero future of Europe.

Thailand’s energy giant Bangchak Corporation will allocate part of its USD 30 million budget to develop e-fuel technology, aiming to reduce transportation carbon emissions. Executives from the Thai company recently visited ENEOS Corporation’s prototype e-fuel plant in Yokohama, Japan, as Bangchak actively seeks potential partners for future collaboration.

A major player in biofuels, Bangchak has begun producing Bio-VLSFO, a marine fuel blend containing 24% UCOME (Used Cooking Oil Methyl Ester) and marketed as B24. The first delivery was completed in February 2025. Aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, the company also inaugurated its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production unit in April, with an initial capacity of 1 million liters per day, converting fatty acids and vegetable oils into neat SAF.

Bangchak develops e-fuel to replace conventional fuels

Currently, Bangchak is looking beyond biofuels to synthetic e-fuels. E-fuel production involves extracting hydrogen through electrolysis powered by renewable energy, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then combined with captured CO₂ to produce synthetic hydrocarbons. After refining, these can be turned into e-gasoline, e-diesel, e-kerosene, e-methanol, and other variants that serve as drop-in substitutes for conventional fuels and can be blended in any ratio.

How e-fuels are made: turning renewable power and captured CO₂ into carbon-neutral fuels. (Illustration: eFuel Alliance)

The use of e-fuels is considered carbon-neutral, as they emit only as much CO₂ during combustion as was previously captured in their production. E-fuels also help overcome the challenges of storing and transporting renewable energy, since they can be shipped at room temperature and pressure.

Although e-fuels remain costly to produce, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that the price of e-kerosene could fall significantly by 2030, enabling it to compete with biomass-based SAF. Currently, global aviation fuel demand is still dominated by conventional jet kerosene, while SAF represents less than 0.1% of total consumption. Nevertheless, manufacturers and airlines are increasingly testing flights powered entirely by SAF.

Thailand’s e-fuels market to reach USD 250 billion by 2050

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimates that e-fuels could supply 3 to 17% of global aviation fuel by 2035, rising to as much as 55% by 2050 if technology and policy continue to advance. In Thailand, the e-fuel market is projected to reach USD 250 billion by 2050, reflecting an average annual growth rate of around 20% from 2024.

To advance its e-fuel research and development, Bangchak is drawing on the experience of Japan’s ENEOS Corporation, which currently produces one barrel (159 liters) of e-fuel per day and plans to scale up to 10,000 barrels daily by 2040. ENEOS is also testing its new fuel on buses for the Osaka Expo 2025.

""We do not want to do R&D from scratch but prefer to join hands with energy firms to speed up work in this field,"" said Chaiwat Kovavisarach, chief executive and president of Bangchak.

Bangchak plans to establish its own research center to support the development of e-fuel projects. The company will allocate part of its USD 30 million budget for the construction and aims to seek additional funding from Thailand’s Office of National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation to help implement the project.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/meta/1760000030518814443.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 06:59:03.631783

Maritime energy demand forecast

DNV forecasts the maritime sector will cut its CO2 emissions by 77% by 2050. While not fully ‘net-zero by or around 2050’, as per the goal of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime looks set to decarbonize faster than all other transport subsectors. This abatement arises from a levelling off in demand for maritime transport from the 2030s, more efficient shipping, and a transition to low-GHG fuels and onboard CCS driven by the IMO’ s Net-Zero Framework (NZF), approved in April 2025 (IMO, 2025).

According to the report, efficiency measures like slow steaming, AI routing and wind-assisted propulsion will drive decarbonization. Fuel diversification is also underway, LNG is already in use; biofuels will reach 4% market share by 2030, followed by e-methanol (2037) and ammonia (2039).

Onboard carbon capture is expected to handle 4% of fossil fuel emissions by 2042. Nuclear propulsion may gain traction in the 2050s. Full details are available in DNV’s Maritime Forecast reports.

Plateauing demand for shipping

Total demand for maritime transport in tonne-miles will grow by 10% by 2030, but will then plateau before slowly declining back to today’s levels (Figure 2.11). This decoupling from global GDP, which is set to double by 2060, separates the maritime sector from all other transport subsectors. There are multiple contributing factors to this effect.

Ships mainly transport physical goods, not passengers or services. Future growth of the global economy will steadily become more service oriented: the economy will grow more than the production and shipping of goods (UNCTAD, 2024).

Additionally, some production will be home-shored and some supply chains will become more localized, reducing the need for shipping of produced goods. This is being done to increase self-sufficiency and cut costs from more expensive fuels. On the other hand, recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine have disrupted trade patterns, leading to increased shipping distances, for example, for Russian oil.

Breaking it down into the separate shipping segments, today, fossil cargo makes up one third of shipped goods. The transition to renewables will reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels, and thereby the need to ship them, starting in 2030.

However, the share of seaborne natural gas will temporarily increase significantly due to energy security and supply-demand patterns. Gas trade will almost double from today to 2040, before starting to decline.

In contrast, container shipping will continue to grow, thanks to increased containerization and a growing economy. Non-coal bulk and other cargo will also grow, albeit to a lesser extent. The sum of non-fossil shipping will plateau in the 2050s, up about 25% from today.

SMR technology is often promoted as the next generation of nuclear power

Small modular reactors (SMRs) used for direct propulsion on ships potentially offer a long-term energy solution compared with costly biofuels and e-fuels. However, significant technological, commercial, and regulatory challenges mean that nuclear in shipping only scales from 2045 in the forecast, though it accounts for 10% of the maritime fuel mix by 2060.

Future fuels for hard-to-electrify sectors

Sectors like aviation, maritime shipping, and long-haul trucking require energy dense fuels for long-distance travel. Fossil fuels provide a level of energy density that current and expected battery technologies cannot match.

Alternative liquid and gaseous fuels will emerge: Biofuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), will grow in the near term and are expected to constitute around 25% of the maritime and aviation fuel mix by 2060.

In the long term, hydrogen and its derivatives, like ammonia, will be critical. They are projected to power 10% to 35% of hard to electrify sectors such as aviation and maritime by 2060. The concept of onboard carbon capture is also being explored in shipping, and is forecast to capture 100 Mt of CO2 annually by 2060.

Hydrogen demand

Renewable and low-carbon hydrogen derivatives will be central to decarbonizing international shipping. EU measures are already reshaping the sector: the Emissions Trading System (ETS) has applied to large ships since January 2024, with full allowance surrender from 2027, and FuelEU Maritime introduces penalties for not meeting well-to-wake GHG requirements from January 2025.

Globally, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) updated GHG Strategy — reinforced in 2025 with new emissions caps and carbon pricing plans — is adding further pressure to adopt zero- or near-zero- GHG fuels and technologies. These policies are boosting demand for hydrogen derivatives, but large-scale uptake will hinge on lower production costs, robust lifecycle emissions verification, and expanded port infrastructure.

Electrification will remain limited to shore power at berth and short-range operations such as ferries. This leaves hydrogen-based fuels — notably ammonia and e-fuels — as the dominant zero-emission options by 2060. DNV projects e-fuels, mainly e-methanol, to account for 100 PJ (1% of the fuel mix) by 2030, 800 PJ (6%) by 2040, and 1,500 PJ (14%) by 2060.

Ammonia, while costlier to produce, can use much of the existing infrastructure and benefits from relatively simple CO2 capture when made from natural gas. This makes low-carbon ammonia the leading candidate in our long-term forecast, surpassing e-methanol in the overall fuel mix, at 21% and 14% respectively.

DNV expects toxicity concerns will be resolved, enabling large-scale trade from low-cost production regions to global bunkering hubs. Furthermore, DNV forecasts uptake at 10 PJ (0.1%) by 2030, 700 PJ (5%) by 2040, and 2,300 PJ (21%) by 2060, with faster growth in later decades as biogenic CO2 for e-methanol becomes harder to source.

While significant, these volumes fall short of the IMO’s decarbonization pathway. Although ammonia combustion is carbon-free, it produces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions which contributes to air pollution and causes significant environmental and health impacts. However, this can be effectively mitigated through advanced engine and emissions-control technologies.

The turning point for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has arrived

Capture and storage capacity expected to quadruple by 2030. After 2030, growth in hard-to-decarbonize sectors will accelerate, with CCS deployment in manufacturing rising nearly ten-fold and making up about 25% of all captured emissions by mid-century.

CCS will grow to capture 6% of global CO2 emissions in 2050, falling significantly short of what is required for any net-zero outcome. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will capture 610 MtCO2 in 2050 — 38% of total captured emissions.

Bioenergy’s rise

Biofuel is already used in maritime transport by blending biofuels with fossil. Its use will grow steadily from a very low volume to reach a 5% share in 2030. By 2060 bioenergy will be the biggest non-fossil energy source in the sector, supplying 26% (3 EJ/yr) of total maritime demand. At this level, it surpasses the remaining use of fossil fuels (25%).

Net-zero emissions in our forecast is only achieved towards the end of this century, and the accumulation of emissions until then takes us beyond 2°C of warming by 2100. Science has shown beyond any doubt that humanity will then be experiencing, to its great cost, how critical each tenth of a degree of global warming is to our planet and society.

“Ultimately, people need to sell, need to fill the beds. Ideally, we want that happening earlier, but people will book when they’re ready to book. We can encourage them all we want to,” he said.

He noted rising business costs over the past year, with elements such as national insurance, minimum wage and SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] but commented: “I’m hopeful that we won’t see anything happening there [in the Budget].

“I still believe, underlying it all, that it will take a lot for people to give up their travel – maybe they’ll modify and go for shorter lengths or different board basis but, ultimately, they will still want to do it.”

He described Tui’s capacity increase of 2% as “modest”, adding: “I think we can do that.”

“The key piece at our disposal is around the quality of the product, and if you know that’s what you want, then you’ve got a better chance of getting what you want early,” he said.

“Also, people can manage their budgets…a lot of the market now offers direct debit options where you can spread the cost.

“But, ultimately, if someone doesn’t want to book until January, the chances of getting them to book in the previous August are tough.”

However, he continued: “The summer holiday peak is still massive. The January booking peak, I can promise you, will still be absolutely massive.

“That’s part of the tradition of ‘you’re finished with Christmas then I want to book a holiday’ and long may that continue.”

• Swanson also commented on a protest during the convention with animal rights campaigners urging the Tui group to stop selling tickets for marine parks.

“It is an incredibly sensitive issue, and I understand that it is very important to a lot of people,” he said.

“Everyone has got the right to say what they are thinking about and…we do take it seriously.

“We only work with marine parks who we audit regularly. They need to adhere to global welfare guidance for animals…and if they don’t, then we don’t work with them.

“We are keeping that under constant review and seeing how things develop.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/076/Budget-suitcase-crop_Thumb.png,N,,2025-10-09 06:59:23.860835

Although the company has provided few specifics, our understanding is that the refinery’s hydrocracker, which is used to convert gas oils into higher-value products, including jet fuel and distillates, was the main unit impacted. (News reports indicated that several units at the refinery were shut after the fire, including the catalytic reformer and fluid catalytic cracker, but did not note any damage to them.)

Chevron said in the days following the fire that it would be making operational adjustments to meet fuel demand and indicated on October 7 that the refinery “continues to operate and create transportation fuels, although at diminished rates.” With a capacity of 291 Mb/d, El Segundo is the second-biggest refinery in California and produces about 40% of the jet fuel and 20% of the motor vehicle fuels consumed in Southern California.

“A Fragile Thing” was written by Robert Smith and appears as the third song on side one of The Cure’s 14th studio album, Songs of a Lost World. The Cure’s Robert Smith has stated the song is about “how love is the most enduring of emotions.” Released as the album’s second single in October 2024, it went to #6 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Airplay and #22 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay Singles charts.

Largest greenfield airport

The Navi Mumbai International Airport is India's largest Greenfield airport project, developed under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). As the second international airport for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, NMIA will work in tandem with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to ease congestion and elevate Mumbai into the league of global multi-airport systems. The airport, designed to be among the most efficient in the world with 1160 Ha area, will eventually handle 90 million passengers annually (MPPA) and 3.25 million metric tonnes of cargo.

Among its unique offerings is an Automated People Mover (APM), a transit system planned to connect all four passenger terminals for smooth inter-terminal transfers, as well as a landside APM linking the city-side infrastructure.

In line with sustainable practices, the airport will feature dedicated storage for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), solar power generation of approximately 47 MW, and EV bus services for public connectivity across the city. NMIA will also be the first airport in the country to be connected by Water Taxi.

In Q3 of this year, many shared that they are “writing off” 2025, delaying capital projects, and looking to 2026 for clarified policies and stronger markets. Firms making lumber, panels, pellets, paper products and whole log chips reported operating at 50%-60% in multiple regions.

Given market sentiment and operating rates, in addition to recent mill closures and curtailments, how has demand for wood fiber changed recently and over the past 10 years?

Changes in Pulp and Paper Capacity

According to data from Forisk’s North American Mill Database and analysis led by Amanda Lang, total capacity of the wood-using U.S. pulp and paper sector declined 18% in the past 10 years. This decline is specific to wood-using mills, excluding facilities that rely exclusively on recycled fiber, but the sector reported drops in all end uses, with reductions in printing and writing capacity falling 49%. This represented over half of the lost capacity nationwide. Newsprint, household/sanitary, and market pulp segments also had notable declines, each representing 10%-16% of the lost capacity.

Regionally, capacity reductions in the U.S. South accounted for most of the volume lost (64%), with the U.S. West and North each representing 18%. The West experienced the largest and most severe drop in capacity for a given region, with pulp and paper mill closures and reductions decreasing capacity by 26%.

Use of Recycle Fiber Increases

Pulp producers have a variety of feedstocks to choose from, including Old Corrugated Containers from recycling markets, roundwood pulp logs and residual wood chips produced in lumber manufacturing. The data indicates that pulp mills and paper mills in the U.S. increased consumption of recycled fiber even as they reduced production. According to AF&PA, pulp mills and paper mills in the U.S. increased recycled fiber consumption from 38% in 2015 to 48% of their fiber mix in 2024 (Figure 1).

Paper and paperboard production declined 14%, with declines coming from paper products made with virgin fiber (wood). Recycled feedstock consumption rose from 7,766 thousand short tons in Q3 2015 to 8,221 thousand short tons in Q4 2024, an increase of 6%. Paper and board made from virgin fiber declined 27% from 12,413 thousand short tons in Q3 2015 to 9,055 thousand short tons in Q4 2024.

Wood Feedstock Price Trends

Raw material prices are reported per ton of pulp produced, reflecting the inputs required: pulp mills typically need about 3.5 tons of wood to produce one ton of pulp, compared with just over 1 ton of OCC for each ton of pulp. According to the Wood Fiber Review, over the past eight years, wood costs for roundwood and chips have been relatively stable. OCC has been more volatile, swinging from $180 per ton of pulp produced to $27 per ton.

Pulp and paper companies have invested in mill capacity to use OCC and recycled materials to take advantage of lower costs. Companies in the U.S. converted wood-using mills to 100% recycled mills and built new greenfield mills to buy recycled feedstocks. New builds and conversions to 100% recycled mills added 3.6 million tons of pulp and paper capacity since 2017, about 5% of current pulping capacity in the U.S. Other investments added recycled production lines to wood-using mills. This happened during a time when several wood-using pulp mills closed.

Despite ambitious net-zero pledges, the aviation industry is expanding faster than it is decarbonising. With sustainable aviation fuels still scarce, carbon trading under scrutiny, and global cooperation faltering, both politicians and passengers are largely abandoning efforts to make flying greener.

Key takeaways

Airport expansion outpaces climate targets: Governments in the UK and across Europe are approving new runways and airport projects, prioritising economic growth despite aviation’s rising share of national emissions.

Technological solutions lag decades behind: Hydrogen-powered planes remain distant, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is costly, limited in supply, and far from meeting the scale regulators demand.

Offset schemes face credibility issues: The ICAO-backed Corsia system relies heavily on questionable carbon credits — such as those tied to Guyana’s deforestation projects — undermining confidence in aviation’s offsetting claims.

Global taxation efforts have collapsed: Political resistance, led by the U.S. under Donald Trump, has derailed EU ambitions to impose carbon taxes on long-haul flights, leaving aviation fuel largely untaxed worldwide.

Airlines push for “growth with guilt”: Carriers argue that flying brings economic and social value, yet current measures allow emissions to rise through traffic growth even as cleaner fuels are introduced.

New ideas shift focus to behavior and flight paths: Researchers are testing AI-assisted contrail avoidance to cut warming, while governments consider levies on frequent flyers and private jets to target aviation’s biggest polluters.

Climate justice concerns grow: Activists warn that without structural change, aviation will remain a symbol of inequality — where a small share of frequent travelers drives most emissions while others bear the climate cost.

Hotels face new sustainability scrutiny: As aviation’s footprint grows, more pressure may fall on hotels to demonstrate measurable environmental responsibility, from energy use to supply chains, to offset the sector’s wider carbon imbalance.",https://www.hospitality.today/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-09 02:56:58.251626

However, truly effective reductions in the environmental impacts of aviation require innovation that goes beyond fuel to embrace the entire aircraft system. Key to this is the superconducting motor that Toshiba has developed for next-generation aircraft and other large mobility applications; a motor that is smaller and lighter than conventional motors and that achieves high output—offering a breakthrough that could change the future of flight.

Among the first to recognize the potential of this motor was Airbus, the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer, which is working to develop a hydrogen-powered aircraft with zero CO₂ emissions. Airbus took particular interest in Toshiba’s first prototype superconducting motor, unveiled in 2022. Then in 2024, the two companies announced a joint research initiative to explore the use of superconducting motor technology for next-generation hydrogen aircraft. With these two companies joining forces, how might the future of aviation be transformed?

Superconducting motors are perfect for hydrogen aircraft

In October 2024, at the Japan International Aerospace Expo 2024, Airbus and Toshiba announced that they would conduct joint research on superconducting motor technology. Airbus has long been working on the development of hydrogen aircraft—seen as a promising solution for zero-CO₂ aviation—and Toshiba’s superconducting technology caught its attention.

Fumitoshi Mizutani, who leads the superconducting motor development project at Toshiba, explains the key features of the technology: “In 2022, we succeeded in developing a prototype superconducting motor that is both lightweight and compact, but still capable of delivering high output of 2 megawatts. It is one-tenth the weight of conventional products with the same output. These features of Toshiba’s unique technology aligned closely with Airbus’s ideal specifications for hydrogen aircraft, which led to our collaborative research.”

There are two ways to use hydrogen as a source of propulsion for aircraft. The first is to burn hydrogen in gas turbine engines, essentially replacing the fossil fuels used in today’s jet aircraft with hydrogen. The second approach uses fuel cells to convert hydrogen into electricity that powers the plane’s engine. Toshiba’s superconducting motor technology is expected to play a central role in enabling this second, electric propulsion method.

All considerations about installing engines on jet aircraft must confront a fundamental trade-off: achieving high output while keeping weight to a minimum. In this respect, superconducting motors are an ideal solution. What’s more, they offer an unexpected advantage. Hydrogen, which is a gas at room temperature, must be stored as a liquid at the extremely low temperature of -253°C in order to be used as aircraft fuel.

That requirement fits well with superconductivity technology, the phenomenon whereby metals and alloys exhibit zero electrical resistance and perform at their best when cooled to extremely low, cryogenic temperatures. That is achieved at ground level by using liquid helium (liquid at minus 269°C) and liquid nitrogen (minus 196°C).

Using liquified hydrogen on board an aircraft both as fuel and to cool the superconducting motor realizes maximum efficiency in the limiting conditions of being in the air. It is a situation where the characteristics of superconductivity and the restrictive conditions of using it in a hydrogen aircraft produce a perfect match.

Kyohei Shibata of Toshiba’s New Business Development Department, which works in tandem with Toshiba’s R&D teams, recalls the early work on the motor. “We developed the superconducting motor by bringing together engineers working in related fields at our Keihin Operations, where we develop and manufacture generators for power plants. We have been researching superconductivity for over 50 years, since its early days around 1970. We have leveraged that knowledge to build up a track record in industrial superconducting equipment, and that gives us strengths other companies do not have.”

Superconductivity is a technology with a lot of promise. If adopted in aircraft, it is expected to boost fuel efficiency and extend flight range. It also has the potential for future expansion and application in other areas, including the shipping and space industries—marking the next stage in its evolution.

Dreaming beyond aircraft, into space

The introduction of hydrogen aircraft is widely anticipated as a way to achieve carbon neutrality. Looking back on the work to develop the prototype, Mizutani is enthusiastic about the prospects for social implementation of hydrogen-powered aircraft with superconducting motors. “I was really happy when we finally completed the first prototype and it started rotating, back in 2022. With the joint research with Airbus, I really hope we can speed up the real-world application of hydrogen aircraft development, if only by a little. My dream is to one day fly in a hydrogen aircraft powered by a superconducting motor that I developed.”

But the truth is that most aircraft still fly on jet fuel, and there are barriers to the motor’s introduction—it will be difficult without changes in the overall structure of the economy. Shibata says that Toshiba hopes to play a part in that transformation. “Hydrogen’s availability is still limited, and there are issues connected to transportation and storage. This may not be something we can achieve right away, but if we can make hydrogen aircraft a reality, it will give us a powerful tool for achieving carbon neutrality, so I think it is a project to realize a dream.”

Beyond that, the superconducting motor might well prove to be a dream solution in other areas, as Mizutani explains: “We first of all want to use it in aircraft, but going beyond that we also want to make it technology that can be brought into ships and even, eventually, into space development.”

The evolution of technology will greatly change the shape of future mobility. Toshiba’s superconducting motors are in the vanguard of this trend, the key to paving the way to a sustainable future for the aviation industry. Toshiba’s R&D team is looking forward to changing what we take for granted in mobility, and Shibata is enthusiastic for the future.

“The spirit we bring to this development work is that we are the pioneers paving the way. We do not stop to search for the right answer, but act on the belief that we are choosing the best path to the future we want to see.”",https://www.toshiba-clip.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/img_251009_1.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 02:57:18.478223

Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Modi described NMIA as a ""glimpse of Viksit Bharat"", or developed India, that will help make the Mumbai region Asia's biggest connectivity hub.

The first phase of NMIA has been built at a cost of Rs 19,650 crore and is set to be operational in December, reported PTI. Spread across 1,160 hectares, the airport will have one terminal and one runway in the first phase with an annual passenger handling capacity of 20 million. This is the second airport in Mumbai region.

""The long wait of Mumbai is over as the city has now got its second airport, which will also help Maharashtra's farmers get connected with supermarkets in Europe and the US,"" Modi said after inaugurating the aviation project.

The airport will play a significant role in making the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Asia' biggest connectivity hub, the PM declared.

NMIA is set to significantly boost India's aviation capacity and ease the heavy traffic burden on Mumbai's existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

""This is a project that has a glimpse of Viksit Bharat (developed India). The airport will attract fresh investments and create new job opportunities, the PM noted.

Modi also highlighted the growth of the country's aviation sector and pointed out how it has evolved and expanded under his leadership since 2014.

India, which is the world's third largest domestic aviation market, had just 74 airports in 2014, but their number has gone up to more than 160 in the last 11 years, the Prime Minister said, suggesting his government's focus on the key sector. According to him, lakhs of people have taken to the skies with the government's regional air connectivity scheme UDAN.

Highlighting that Indian airlines have placed orders for more than 1,000 new aircraft, Modi said the target is to make the country a global MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) hub.

Speaking on the occasion, Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu said NMIA will help create around two lakh job opportunities and make Mumbai the country's aviation capital.

Maharashtra Governor Acharya Devvrat, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani and Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol also attended the ceremony.

NMIA received the aerodrome licence from the regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30.

First airport connected by water taxi

According to a release from the Prime Minister's Office, NMIA will be the first airport in the country to be connected by water taxi.The entire project is being developed in multiple phases by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd (NMIAL), a company in which the Adani Group has a 74 per cent stake with the remaining 26 per cent held by the Maharashtra government's town planning and development agency CIDCO.

NMIA, upon completion of all phases, will have four terminals with a capacity of 90 million passengers per annum and a cargo capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes, making it one of the largest aviation hubs in Asia.

The airport will have an Automated People Mover (APM), a transit system planned to connect all four passenger terminals, landside APM linking the city-side infrastructure and a dedicated storage for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), among others, the statement had said.

That’s why we’re proud to announce a new agreement with Twelve, a pioneer in carbon transformation technology, to procure power-to-liquid sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This collaboration builds on our commitments through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the First Movers Coalition (FMC), as well as through our membership with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA).

Why SAF, why now

Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. SAF—particularly power-to-liquid (PtL) fuel—offers one of the most promising pathways to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil jet fuel. Yet adoption has been slowed by limited supply and high costs.

Our agreement with Twelve addresses both challenges. Autodesk is securing SAF certificates well in advance, avoiding exposure to the spot market while at the same time seeding climate innovation to scale. The SAF certificates will be sold to airlines and operators set to receive physical deliveries once production begins.

Together, these efforts reflect a holistic model of collaboration—providing not just capital, but tools, expertise and storytelling power.

Building the market

Twelve’s PtL SAF is competitively priced in today’s challenging SAF environment. This reflects the reality of scaling new climate technologies: up-front costs are often higher, but long-term reductions depend on the willingness of early investors.

Like other forward offtake agreements (for example, the Frontier advance market commitment for carbon removal), the structure of our deal provides downside protection against short-term price volatility, with payments weighted toward the end of the decade. For Autodesk, this isn’t just about buying fuel—it’s about helping to bend the cost curve for the entire industry.

Strong foundations

This new agreement marks a new chapter in Autodesk and Twelve’s history.

Philanthropic support: Since 2017, Twelve has received in-kind support as a portfolio company of Autodesk Foundation partners Prime Coalition and MCJ Collective.

Software donations: Twelve has leveraged Autodesk design tools since 2019 to develop their facilities.

Pro bono consulting: Autodesk’s Media & Entertainment industry consultants are currently producing a visualization video to help Twelve showcase its breakthrough technology.

Looking ahead

By securing high-quality SAF with Twelve, Autodesk is reinforcing our corporate impact strategy, supporting our customers and investors who care deeply about climate impact, and aligning with our go-to-market vision for enabling low-carbon innovation.

We know that no one company can solve the climate crisis alone. By leaning into our climate commitments—and collaborating across industries—we can help scale the critical solutions the world needs most.

Building the market

Twelve's PtL SAF is competitively priced in today's challenging SAF environment. This reflects the reality of scaling new climate technologies: up-front costs are often higher, but long-term reductions depend on the willingness of early investors.

Like other forward offtake agreements (for example, the Frontier advance market commitment for carbon removal), the structure of our deal provides downside protection against short-term price volatility, with payments weighted toward the end of the decade. For Autodesk, this isn't just about buying fuel-it's about helping to bend the cost curve for the entire industry.

Strong foundations

This new agreement marks a new chapter in Autodesk and Twelve's history.

Philanthropic support: Since 2017, Twelve has received in-kind support as a portfolio company of Autodesk Foundation partners Prime Coalition and MCJ Collective.

Software donations: Twelve has leveraged Autodesk design tools since 2019 to develop their facilities.

Pro bono consulting: Autodesk's Media & Entertainment industry consultants are currently producing a visualization video to help Twelve showcase its breakthrough technology.

Looking ahead

By securing high-quality SAF with Twelve, Autodesk is reinforcing our corporate impact strategy, supporting our customers and investors who care deeply about climate impact, and aligning with our go-to-market vision for enabling low-carbon innovation.

We know that no one company can solve the climate crisis alone. By leaning into our climate commitments-and collaborating across industries-we can help scale the critical solutions the world needs most.

The global race for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been hard and long but might be on the threshold of a major breakthrough thanks to work by Oregon State University (OSU) in the United States.

One of its clean fuel teams is drawing international attention for breakthrough research that could help transform forestry residues and agricultural waste.

OSU’s College of Forestry is leading catalytic research in Oregon’s Clean Fuel Initiative, a multimillion-dollar program funded by the State of Oregon to develop low-carbon fuels from local biomass.

Leading the team is Dr. Alhassan Ibrahim, a Postdoctoral Scholar at OSU, whose work has already demonstrated measurable efficiency gains, making crude bio-oils cleaner and more stable for use as jet fuel.

According to experts, while raw bio-oil from forest waste is like a dirty soup that clogs machines, the research being undertaken will develop catalytic chemical helpers that clean and stabilize this oil so it can become renewable jet fuel.

With Ghana and other developing countries looking to other more sustainable and climate-friendly forms of energy, such catalytic innovations promise a low-carbon future for aviation and beyond.

“Dr. Ibrahim’s work is a game-changer for sustainable fuels,” said Prof. Gerald Presley, one of his project leaders at OSU. “He is helping Oregon lead the way in turning forest waste into renewable energy.”

The Clean Fuel Initiative is a collaborative program supported by the Oregon State Legislature (HB 3409, 2023 session), OSU College of Forestry, Oregon Department of Forestry, and Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.

Its mission is to develop renewable, low-carbon fuels from regional biomass resources to meet state and national decarbonization goals.

Dr. Ibrahim’s findings have been published in respected journals such as Catalysts and Energies, and have already been independently cited by research teams worldwide.

His contributions were recognized with the Outstanding Ph.D. Student Award at Mississippi State University. Back home in Ghana, his works have been featured across a number of public and private news portals.

Beyond research, Dr. Ibrahim was selected to judge presentations at the 2025 FPS-SWST International Conference, a role typically reserved for senior experts further evidence of his professional standing.

Dr. Ibrahim’s future plans include scaling catalyst testing to pilot plants and working with U.S. industry partners to accelerate SAF commercialization.",https://i0.wp.com/www.gbcghanaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clean-Fuel.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:56:36.648297

It has proposed a fuel-exempt model. A consultation on the proposals ended on 19 August. The Commission is currently conducting a review before presenting a final draft to its technical, with the aim of adopting the proposals under an implementing decision in autumn 2025. It is currently unclear the extent of any changes to the SUPD proposals resulting from the consultation

The lack of clarity over the EU’s approach had delayed some investment decisions in 2024 and H1 2025.

Nevertheless, while this goes some way to clarifying one of the key regulatory uncertainties facing the market, there remain areas of legislative doubt that continue to negatively impact demand and investment decisions. These include:

Definitions of waste and recycling under Directive 2008/98/EC - also known as the Waste Framework Directive – which forms the basis of the majority of EU recycling legislation definitions

The End-of-life Vehicles Regulation (ELVR) and whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards proposed targets, and what those proposed targets will be

Whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) targets

This was underscored on Aug. 5 by OMV, whose CEO told ICIS that it needs a more secure regulatory environment before it is willing to risk further investment in scaling up its chemical recycling facilities.

With Europe the first region to detail its approach to mass-balance accounting, there are also concerns over the impact of a fuel-exempt approach on cost-competitiveness with other regions – should they adopt more lenient mass-balance accounting practices such as free-allocation – along with the negative impact on profitability domestically compared with a free-allocation approach.

Legislation surrounding renewable fuels, meanwhile, enjoys greater clarity, and targets under legislation such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III and the Fit for 55 package are encouraging the use of pyrolysis oil as fuel (under the Fit for 55 package fuel derived from plastic waste can count towards targets such as those for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provided it meets certain criteria such

as demonstrating emissions reduction).

This continues to encourage tyre-based pyrolysis oil producers to separate out bio-attributed content and polymer content in pyrolysis oil production, with bio-attributed content attracting premiums compared with polymer-derived tyre-based pyrolysis oil. This is a trend expected to continue in H2 2025 and further in to the mid term.

The wider investment climate remains challenging, particularly given the consolidation of cracker volumes in Europe. Nevertheless, despite both regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty, investment into pyrolysis oil continues, and brand owners still see pyrolysis oil as a key solution for mass-scale food-contact recycled packaging.

Prices have proved resilient so far in 2025 to the wider macroeconomic malaise afflicting the European chemical sector – particularly for plastic-derived grades - which is at least in part due to structural shortages.

Pyrolysis is expected to be the world's largest chemical recycling technology by capacity. Europe has a current plastic-derived pyrolysis oil installed input capacity of approximately 150,000 tonnes/year, according to the ICIS Recycling Supply Tracker - Chemical. There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.

A number of pyrolysis oil plant start-ups have faced delays in 2023-2025 as a result of:

Access to suitable quality waste

Challenges managing the variability of feedstock properties

Delays in environmental permits

Longer than expected commissioning phases for process optimization

Negative macroeconomic conditions creating financing challenges and changing cost structures

This has created a challenge for upstream recycled agglomerate players. Many waste managers have added agglomeration capacity in recent years with a view to serving the burgeoning pyrolysis oil market.

Nevertheless, plant start-up delays has meant the while agglomeration capacity has come onstream, the pyrolysis oil capacity this feedstock was intended to serve has not. This has meant a reduction in investment in agglomeration, and some lines being idled.

There are concerns that this could create challenges for the pyrolysis oil industry as it grows, with access to sufficient high quality waste continuing to be seen as one of the core potential barriers to market scale.",https://s3-prod.sustainableplastics.com/styles/1200x630/s3/1580124237511.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 17:57:20.084034

The carbon dioxide will be sent to a carbon sequestration site in Wyoming.
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) can reduce an ethanol plant's carbon intensity score by roughly 33 points.
David Miller, chief economist at Decision Innovation Solutions, said his modeling looked at CCS with the 45Z tax credit adding about 48 cents per gallon for Iowa ethanol plants.
Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law last March that bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipeline projects.","OMAHA (DTN) -- Iowa biofuel and farm leaders are warning that the state could lose its long-held competitive edge in ethanol production without access to infrastructure to capture carbon dioxide and ship it to a sequestration site.

That lack of carbon-capture infrastructure in Iowa -- the country's largest ethanol-producing state -- also adds greater risks to a weakened farm economy.

IOWA LOSES GROUND ON CARBON CAPTURE

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA), said Iowa ethanol producers are now losing ground as Nebraska's Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline begins operations.

""Carbon capture and sequestration is real -- it's happening to our east, west and north, and it has enormous economic consequences for Iowa,"" Shaw said during a Wednesday press call. ""Since 2000, Iowa has worn the crown as the world's best place to turn corn into ethanol. Last week, we got knocked off.""

The $1.5 billion Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline -- a converted natural gas pipeline -- went live last week. Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland (MAAPW) started carbon capture at its ethanol plant in Madrid, Nebraska, on the western edge of the state, using the Tallgrass pipeline. The carbon dioxide will be sent to a carbon sequestration site in Wyoming. MAAPW became the first ethanol plant to use the Tallgrass pipeline, which is expected to connect at least 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska.

That opens up MAAPW to not only sell ethanol with a lower carbon intensity into states such as California but also to tap into the federal 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

ECONOMIC STAKES FOR FARMERS AND PLANTS

Shaw said the issue is not a competition between Nebraska and Iowa, noting that ethanol plants in North Dakota and Illinois are also sinking carbon in the ground. But the competitive gap will have real financial consequences.

""Quite frankly, I'm jealous. They got it done first, and that is, for the plants that are hooked up there and doing that, it's a great advantage.""

Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) can reduce an ethanol plant's carbon intensity score by roughly 33 points. The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit could add about 66 cents a gallon in value to ethanol. Given that a bushel of corn produces roughly three gallons of ethanol, that's the potential of $1.98 a bushel in added value.

If Iowa's ethanol plants were sequestering carbon, that would translate into more than $3 billion in added value to the state's ethanol production each year, Shaw said.

""There are very real economic consequences from that,"" he said.

David Miller, chief economist at Decision Innovation Solutions, said his modeling looked at CCS with the 45Z tax credit adding about 48 cents per gallon for Iowa ethanol plants. It would also open the door for another 10 points in lower carbon intensity scores through farm-level conservation practices. That would generate about $2.1 billion per year for Iowa plants. ""But unless a plant is under a 50 CI score, those opportunities don't exist.""

FARM ECONOMY IS ALREADY UNDER STRESS

The consequences are felt by corn farmers whose financial struggles continue to gain attention.

""Right now, the Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,"" said Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association. ""Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.""

Kuiper noted that agricultural lenders are paying close attention to farmers' balance sheets and liquidity. ""There are some folks that potentially could be having to liquidate some land or equipment ... at the end of the year, and this affects the whole state.""

PIPELINE POLITICS DIVIDE IOWA

Corn may be king in Iowa, but carbon pipelines have become a politically charged issue across the state. Just this past weekend, Republican candidates running for governor spoke at an event in a rural county that included state lawmakers who have been actively opposing the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported. Republicans in Iowa have been split on the issue. Gov. Kim Reynolds in June vetoed a bill that would have limited the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines.

Summit's plans have been to build a pipeline across Iowa that would also extend across South Dakota to reach a sequestration site in North Dakota. That has become increasingly more complicated because South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law last March that bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipeline projects.

Nebraska, by contrast, has no regulatory commission overseeing carbon pipelines.

Despite the rural resistance in some areas and debate over landowner rights, Kuiper said landowners already must deal with natural gas and oil pipelines along with other infrastructure. Kuiper defended the safety and compensation structure of carbon pipelines. ""A carbon pipeline doesn't scare me as much as a 36-inch natural-gas line,"" he said. Kuiper added, ""Farmers who allow these projects are compensated very well, and it strengthens their financial position.""

NEBRASKA POISED FOR EXPANSION

Seth Harder, CEO of Husker Ag in Plainview, Nebraska, and Lincolnway Energy in Nevada, Iowa, said carbon sequestration adds about $60 million a year in income to a typical 100-million-gallon ethanol plant. The ethanol industry in Nebraska sees the potential to grow right now.

""We see the opportunity for things to, maybe not really an opportunity but a paradigm shift, if you will, as Nebraska sees this influx of funds. We hear plants are talking about not only expanding but doubling (capacity).""

Harder also spotlighted California Gov. Gavin Newsom signing E15 legislation last month, creating a potential 700 million gallons more in domestic ethanol sales.

Shaw also emphasized the need to press Congress to pass legislation to permanently allow year-round E15 nationwide.

The overall message, Shaw said, is that Iowa's ethanol plants need the ability to do CCS, but he's concerned about the increasing push to take away that option.

""There are economic realities if Iowa is permanently shut out of the CCS ability.""

Miller also said CCS in Nebraska opens the door for that state to move forward on producing sustainable aviation fuel as well.

""For the Nebraska plants on the pipeline, that door has now been open,"" Miller said. He added, ""We think Nebraska is going to move forward and be a mover on ethanol-to-jet.""

No longer is the act of traveling limited to simply reaching a destination. Technological progress, evolving cultural expectations, and heightened environmental awareness are drastically altering how people experience their journeys. The travel industry is stepping up to meet these challenges by embracing innovative solutions designed to provide travelers with more sustainable, personalized, and unique travel options. With these changes, the focus is no longer just on where people travel, but how they engage with the world. As emerging trends such as sustainable aviation, artificial intelligence (AI), and eco-conscious tourism take shape, travelers can expect experiences that redefine how they interact with the world around them. This article explores the key trends influencing the global travel industry and their impact on travelers worldwide.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Leading the Charge for Greener Travel

As global concerns about climate change grow, the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to address its environmental impact. One of the promising solutions that has emerged is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional jet fuel, which relies on fossil fuels, SAF is produced from renewable sources such as algae, waste oils, and crops. This fuel has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon emissions associated with air travel, making it a key player in the quest for more eco-friendly aviation. Although the cost of SAF remains a significant barrier, the growing adoption of this fuel suggests that it could eventually become the norm in air travel. As more airlines incorporate SAF into their operations and its cost decreases, passengers may begin considering the environmental impact of their travel choices, leading to increased demand for greener airlines. This shift could drastically reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry and help the world move closer to more sustainable travel.

Impact: The integration of SAF could drastically lower the carbon emissions from aviation, making air travel more environmentally sustainable and driving a global shift toward greener travel options.

Contactless Travel: Revolutionizing Efficiency and Speed

The rise of contactless technology has significantly transformed the travel experience. Digital boarding passes, mobile check-ins, and keyless hotel rooms are no longer luxuries but are now the standard for most travelers. These touchless systems make traveling faster and more efficient, reducing wait times and eliminating the need for physical documents. As airports and hotels adopt these technologies, travelers can enjoy smoother, more seamless experiences without the need for direct human interaction. However, this shift toward contactless travel has led to concerns about the loss of human connection. Some travelers miss the personal touch of interacting with hotel staff or checking in with physical tickets. Despite these concerns, the shift toward digitalization in travel is likely to continue, as the convenience and efficiency provided by these systems are too significant to ignore.

Impact: While contactless technology simplifies the travel process and reduces wait times, it risks making the experience less personal, changing the dynamic of how travelers interact with the world.

AI-Powered Personalization: Creating Tailored Travel Experiences

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way travelers plan and experience their journeys. Through advanced algorithms, AI can offer highly personalized travel suggestions based on individual preferences. AI-driven tools now enable travelers to receive recommendations for destinations, hotels, and activities, as well as real-time itinerary adjustments. Chatbots and other AI-powered services are increasingly common, helping travelers to manage their bookings and provide instant recommendations during their trip. While these personalized services enhance convenience, they also raise questions about the role of spontaneity in travel. As travelers rely more on AI to organize their trips, they may lose out on the joy of unplanned, impromptu adventures. The growing reliance on AI raises the question: Does the rise of technology diminish the opportunity for travelers to explore the unknown?

Impact: AI enhances the personalization of travel but may reduce spontaneity, making travel experiences feel more structured and less open to surprise.

Work-from-Anywhere Culture: Shifting the Work-Life Balance

Remote work has evolved from a temporary measure during the pandemic into a lasting trend. Many professionals now have the flexibility to work from virtually anywhere, leading to the rise of the workcation. Combining work with leisure, individuals can travel to destinations ranging from mountain cabins and beach resorts to city lofts while still meeting their professional responsibilities. The demand for destinations offering a balance of both work facilities and relaxation has surged, transforming the way people view vacations. As work-from-anywhere opportunities grow, travelers are no longer confined to taking time off for vacations—they can explore the world while continuing their careers. This shift has led to a more flexible approach to both work and travel, allowing individuals to balance business obligations with leisure in new and exciting ways.

Impact: Remote work is expanding travel opportunities, allowing individuals to explore new destinations without the need for extended breaks, and providing greater flexibility for both professional and personal growth.

Space Tourism: A New Frontier of Exploration

What was once imagined as a dream of the future, space tourism is beginning to become a reality. Private companies are now offering suborbital space trips, allowing travelers to experience weightlessness and enjoy breathtaking views of Earth’s curvature. Though the cost of these experiences remains astronomically high, the advent of space tourism represents a major leap forward for the travel industry. While space travel is still out of reach for most people, it marks the beginning of a completely new sector in luxury travel. As technology advances and the sector matures, the potential for more affordable space travel could open up entirely new possibilities for exploration, offering the ultimate adventure for those who can afford it.

Impact: Space tourism introduces a whole new dimension of travel, catering to the elite for now but potentially becoming more accessible as the industry grows and matures.

Hyperloop and High-Speed Rail: Changing Ground Transportation

Hyperloop and advanced high-speed rail systems are poised to revolutionize the way we think about ground travel. These technologies promise to dramatically reduce travel times between major cities, potentially making city-to-city commutes as quick as flying. While these technologies are still in development, their ability to offer faster, more efficient travel is promising. Not only do these innovations have the potential to reduce congestion at airports, but they could also offer a more sustainable alternative to short-haul flights. Once implemented, Hyperloop and high-speed rail could change the landscape of domestic travel, making long-distance commutes significantly faster and more convenient.

Impact: Hyperloop and high-speed rail technologies could fundamentally transform ground transportation, providing more efficient, sustainable travel alternatives and reducing reliance on air travel.

Regenerative Tourism: Restoring What Was Taken

While sustainable tourism aims to reduce harm, regenerative tourism goes a step further by focusing on restoring and improving the environments travelers visit. This approach encourages travelers to leave destinations better than they found them through actions like supporting eco-resorts, restoring ecosystems, and empowering local communities. Rather than simply minimizing harm, regenerative tourism seeks to create a positive impact, actively benefiting the destinations and cultures visitors engage with. This movement has gained traction as travelers increasingly seek to leave a meaningful legacy wherever they go, ensuring their visits leave behind a positive mark.

Impact: Regenerative tourism encourages travelers to make a positive impact on the places they visit, fostering a more holistic and responsible approach to travel that benefits both the environment and local communities.

Biometric Security: Enhancing Travel Efficiency

Biometric security systems, such as facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, are becoming increasingly prevalent at airports and other travel hubs. These systems replace traditional identity verification methods, speeding up the security process and improving overall travel efficiency. While these technologies promise to reduce waiting times and make travel smoother, they also raise concerns regarding privacy. As more airports and travel-related companies implement biometric verification, travelers will need to adapt to new forms of identity verification. The growing presence of biometric technology signals the need for a careful balance between efficiency and privacy in the travel experience.

Impact: Biometric security systems streamline the travel process, reducing delays but also raising concerns about the management of personal data.

Ultra-Personalized Health Travel: Tailoring Wellness to Individuals

Wellness tourism has moved beyond traditional retreats focused on relaxation to become a highly personalized and scientifically tailored experience. With advancements in health technologies and genetics, wellness tourism now includes services such as DNA-based nutrition plans, customized spa treatments, and personalized sleep retreats. This shift toward personalized health travel caters to travelers seeking specific wellness solutions designed to enhance their physical and mental health. While traditional wellness escapes focused on relaxation, today’s wellness travel offers more targeted interventions designed to improve well-being at the individual level.

Taking public comments We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel.","We are embarking on a new statewide study to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts surrounding the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel—including measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Our broad statewide studies, also called programmatic environmental impact statements, are required by state law. In June, we released three studies evaluating utility-scale onshore wind and solar energy projects, and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.

As part of the scoping process, we are seeking input from interested parties, including the public, regarding the range of actions and impacts we should study.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

To help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to power aircraft engines. The fuel is derived from low-carbon sources such as biomass, organic waste and clean synthetic feedstocks using a wide range of production methods and technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.

Scoping our study to be impactful and efficient

While these fuel projects are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the state economy, they can still have negative environmental impacts that need to be considered—including ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate those impacts.

Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from a variety of renewable resources and transported using various distribution methods, our study will not be able to evaluate every possible option. This means your input is critical. It will help us determine where to focus our analysis to develop the most useful, timely report that will support the future development of sustainable aviation fuel projects in Washington.

The study will evaluate the potential impacts on natural and built resources at a broad level. Developers and agencies can use the findings to help avoid and reduce impacts through siting and design choices. It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.

Taking public comments

We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel. In October, we will hold two virtual meetings where interested parties can make public comments:

All the comments we receive will be valued equally. They help us determine our approach to the programmatic impact statement, or study. Comments addressing specific pathways, impacts or issues are the most useful. We have prepared a fact sheet about providing effective public comments.

We are also taking written public comments until Wednesday, Nov. 5, at 11:59 p.m. Interested parties can submit comments using our online public comment form or send them by mail to:

‘’This project stands at the crossroads of two global challenges—waste management and decarbonization of transportation. Our Phase-1 completion confirms that we can turn trash into clean jet fuel at scale in Ghana 🇬🇭, with measurable environmental and economic impact,” said Mr. Frederick Opoku Agyekum, Project Development Director of F&B Bio Recyclage Ltd.

The project has already attracted strong interest from international SAF off takers, infrastructure investors, and development finance institutions due to its replicable model, positive carbon intensity profile, and scalability across emerging and developed markets alike. In addition, we have established strong partnerships with local governments, waste management authorities, as well as leading technology and engineering partners to ensure smooth project implementation. These collaborations position us to deliver the project effectively, while creating both economic and environmental value.

Technology and Process The project leverages state-of-the-art gasification technology to convert solid waste—such as municipal solid waste or industrial residues—into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This syngas is then processed through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven catalytic process developed in the 1920s and refined over decades, to produce liquid hydrocarbons suitable for use as SAF and biodiesel. These fuels offer a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels, with the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels.

The Fischer-Tropsch process is particularly well-suited for this application due to its ability to produce high-quality fuels from diverse feedstocks, including biomass and solid waste. Recent advancements in catalyst formulations and reactor designs have further improved the efficiency and scalability of this technology, making it a cornerstone of modern biofuel production.

Beyond commercial aircraft, the performance of Airbus's Defence and Space and Helicopters divisions will be important for overall financial health.","Toulouse, France – Airbus (EPA: AIR) has reported a robust performance in the first nine months of 2025, delivering 507 commercial aircraft and affirming its dominant position in the global aviation market. This significant milestone was underscored by a record-breaking September, where the European aerospace giant handed over 73 jets, indicating a notable improvement in crucial engine supply chains. The strong delivery figures place Airbus firmly on track to achieve its ambitious full-year target of approximately 820 aircraft, further widening its lead over rival Boeing (NYSE: BA).

The 507 deliveries from January to September mark an increase from the 497 aircraft delivered during the same period in 2024, demonstrating a consistent upward trajectory despite ongoing industry challenges. This impressive output comes as Airbus continues to navigate a complex operating environment, particularly concerning engine delivery delays from key suppliers like CFM International (a joint venture of GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) and Safran (EPA: SAF)) and Pratt & Whitney (a division of RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX)). However, the recent surge in deliveries, coupled with a reported decrease in ""gliders"" – fully assembled aircraft awaiting engines – suggests that these supply bottlenecks are easing.

Detailed Coverage: Airbus's Resilient Ascent Amidst Headwinds

Airbus's provisional 507 commercial aircraft deliveries in the first nine months of 2025 represent a 2% increase from the 497 deliveries in the same period of 2024. This cumulative figure turned positive in September 2025, surpassing the equivalent total for 2024 for the first time. September itself was a record-breaking month for Airbus, with approximately 73 jets delivered, up from 50 deliveries in September 2024 and exceeding earlier analyst forecasts. This strong performance signals Airbus's improved capacity to meet its full-year delivery target of around 820 commercial aircraft across all models by year-end.

Despite this impressive output, Airbus continues to grapple with significant supply chain issues, particularly concerning engine availability. Both CFM International and Pratt & Whitney have faced difficulties in ramping up output due to lingering labor shortages, production difficulties, and component availability issues. Pratt & Whitney's GTF (geared turbofan) engines, especially for the A320neo family, have experienced complications stemming from a metal powder defect, leading to a large-scale recall and the grounding of hundreds of aircraft. CFM International has also encountered production difficulties, contributing to shortages that persisted into 2025. These engine bottlenecks have significantly constrained Airbus's ability to accelerate production, despite robust demand for its aircraft.

Earlier in 2025, Airbus faced a growing backlog of ""gliders"" – fully assembled aircraft awaiting engine installation – with reports indicating up to 60 units parked outside its factories by July, absorbing approximately €1 billion in inventory costs. However, recent indications suggest that the ""glider"" issue has started to ease, with the number reportedly dropping from its peak. This improvement, coupled with the strong September delivery numbers, is crucial for Airbus to meet its delivery targets and reduce financial strain from incomplete aircraft. Airlines, in some cases, have even accepted ""glider"" deliveries due to the scarcity of delivery slots, underscoring the immense value of a confirmed production slot in a sold-out market.

A historic milestone was reached on October 7, 2025, when the Airbus A320 family officially surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the world's most delivered commercial jet. This achievement was sealed with the delivery of an A320neo to Saudi carrier flyadeal, pushing the total number of A320 family deliveries to 12,260 aircraft since its entry into service in 1988. This compares to Boeing's 737 series, which had approximately 12,259 units delivered. This marks the first time since 1968 that Boeing has been dethroned in the single-aisle market, a testament to the A320's consistent innovation, fuel efficiency, and versatility.

Market Ripple Effects: Winners and Losers in the Aerospace Duopoly

Airbus's sustained strong delivery performance presents a considerable challenge to its primary competitor, Boeing (NYSE: BA), primarily impacting its market share and financial standing. Airbus has delivered more aircraft than Boeing for five consecutive years, a trend that intensified in 2024, where Airbus delivered 766 commercial aircraft, more than double Boeing's 348 deliveries. This disparity has led to Boeing reporting losses since 2019 and a significant drop in its stock performance. Boeing is under immense pressure to recover from production challenges and quality issues, forcing it to cede market share, particularly in single-aisle aircraft where Airbus now holds a dominant lead.

The two primary engine suppliers for commercial aircraft, CFM International (a joint venture between GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) and Safran (EPA: SAF)) and Pratt & Whitney (a division of RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX)), experience varying impacts from Airbus's success. CFM International, whose LEAP-1A engine powers a significant portion of the A320neo family, directly benefits from Airbus's high delivery volumes, driving revenue and profitability for its parent companies. CFM continues to lead in the narrowbody market, with its LEAP series powering 72% of active narrowbody fleets overall.

Conversely, Pratt & Whitney, while also benefiting from Airbus's high delivery volumes for its GTF engines, has faced significant financial impacts due to reliability issues. The 2023 requirement for accelerated inspections on 600-700 PW1100G engines resulted in an estimated gross financial implication of $6-7 billion for RTX, with a $3 billion pre-tax operating profit charge. Pratt & Whitney is focused on resolving these reliability issues to maintain its market share and reputation, especially as its GTF engine is also used on the Airbus A220.

Airline customers are directly affected by these dynamics. Airlines with significant existing Airbus fleets or those ordering new Airbus aircraft stand to ""win"" from fleet commonality, reduced training costs, and the A320neo's fuel efficiency. In an environment where Boeing has faced significant production delays, Airbus's more consistent delivery schedule offers a reliable path for airlines to update their fleets with fuel-efficient aircraft. Conversely, airlines heavily reliant on Boeing, or those facing delays in receiving their ordered aircraft, might experience disadvantages, forced to fly older, less fuel-efficient planes for longer periods, increasing operational costs.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Aerospace Landscape

Airbus's strong market position and delivery performance underscore a significant shift in the aerospace duopoly, driven by prevailing industry trends. The sustained demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft, fueled by environmental concerns and rising fuel costs, has been expertly leveraged by Airbus with its A320neo family. This family offers 15-20% less fuel burn, aligning with airlines' pursuit of lower operating expenses and the industry's decarbonization goals. The A320 family's historic achievement of surpassing the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered jetliner in history further solidifies Airbus's dominance in the crucial single-aisle market, which forms the backbone of most airline fleets.

The ripple effects extend profoundly to its main competitor, Boeing. Boeing's recent challenges, including the 737 MAX groundings, ongoing safety and certification issues, and production bottlenecks, have directly contributed to Airbus's market share gains. While Airbus produced 58 A320neos per month in July 2025, Boeing was producing only 38 737 MAX units, highlighting the disparity. This situation has compelled Boeing to focus on recovery and quality, impacting its own market standing and pushing both giants to navigate complex supply chain and regulatory landscapes.

The competition between Airbus and Boeing also carries significant regulatory and policy implications, primarily manifested in long-running trade disputes. The US and EU have been engaged in the world's longest-running trade dispute at the WTO concerning alleged illegal government subsidies to both manufacturers. While tariffs were suspended in 2021, the underlying issue of state support remains a contentious geopolitical dimension of the duopoly, highlighting how governments actively support their national champions. The effective duopoly itself, accounting for 99% of global large aircraft orders, raises questions about market concentration and potential antitrust enforcement.

Historically, the current duopoly emerged from industry consolidation, with Airbus formed to challenge American dominance after mergers. The duopoly has maintained its strength by absorbing or partnering with smaller competitors, as seen with Airbus's acquisition of a majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries program (now the Airbus A220). The competition also echoes past product line rivalries, such as the Boeing 747 versus the Airbus A380, demonstrating that even within a duopoly, misjudging market needs and cost-effectiveness can have significant consequences. Boeing's current struggles with the 737 MAX similarly illustrate the high stakes of product development and safety in such an environment.

What Comes Next: Navigating Growth and Transformation

Airbus is strategically positioned for future growth, leveraging its strong delivery performance and substantial order backlog. The company aims to increase the production of its A320 family aircraft to 75 per month by 2027, up from an unofficial rate of around 52 per month in late 2024. To achieve this, Airbus is expanding its global production footprint by opening new final assembly lines (FALs) in Mobile, Alabama, and Tianjin, China, both scheduled for October 2025. These expansions are expected to contribute significantly to its global output, with U.S. and China production capacity each accounting for 20% by 2026.

In the short term, Airbus will capitalize on its current market leadership and a robust order backlog, which for the A320 family alone exceeds 7,000 jets, representing over 12 years of production. The ongoing recovery in air travel further fuels demand for new aircraft. However, significant short-term challenges persist, primarily supply chain disruptions affecting critical components like engines, semiconductors, and wiring harnesses. These issues have forced Airbus to revise production targets and have resulted in a backlog of completed airframes awaiting missing parts, with delivery delays expected to persist for at least three years.

Long-term possibilities for Airbus are largely shaped by decarbonization efforts and technological innovation. Airbus aims to bring the world's first zero-emission commercial aircraft to market by 2035, investing over €2 billion per year in cleaner technologies such as hybrid-electric engines and hydrogen propulsion. The company is actively pursuing 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) compatibility for its entire range of commercial airliners before 2030. These ambitions open up new markets and position Airbus as a leader in sustainable aviation. However, long-term challenges include the significant R&D investment required, the development of necessary infrastructure for new fuels, and managing the complex transition to a decarbonized aerospace sector.

Airbus's strategic pivots are centered on resilience, innovation, sustainability, and scale. This involves strengthening supply chain resilience through diversification and deeper collaborations with suppliers, addressing workforce development, and continuing heavy investment in next-generation aircraft and sustainable technologies. The company's ambition to replace the A320 with an open-fan propulsion jet by 2035 demonstrates a radical commitment to innovation for emissions reduction. While Boeing is expected to recover its shipment volume and regain some market share (projected around 40% in 2025), Airbus is anticipated to continue its strong delivery performance, with competition intensifying around the introduction of next-generation, more sustainable aircraft.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Sustained Leadership in a Transforming Market

Airbus's robust delivery performance in the first nine months of 2025, culminating in over 500 jet deliveries and a record-breaking September, solidifies its position as the undisputed market leader in commercial aviation. The key takeaway is Airbus's operational resilience and strategic foresight in navigating a complex global environment marked by persistent supply chain challenges. The A320 family's historic milestone of surpassing the Boeing 737 in total deliveries underscores the enduring success of Airbus's narrowbody strategy and its focus on fuel efficiency.

Moving forward, the aerospace market is poised for sustained growth, driven by increasing air travel demand and an urgent need for fleet modernization. Airbus is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on this, thanks to its substantial order backlog and aggressive production ramp-up plans. The company's strategic expansion of its global production footprint, with new Final Assembly Lines in the US and China, is crucial for meeting demand, building resilience, and mitigating geopolitical risks. This globalized approach enhances flexibility and shortens delivery times for customers, further solidifying Airbus's long-term impact on air travel.

The lasting impact of Airbus's current trajectory is the reshaping of the aerospace duopoly. While Boeing (NYSE: BA) faces continued pressure from production delays and quality control issues, Airbus's consistent performance and innovative strides in sustainable aviation are widening the competitive gap. This leadership not only affects market share but also drives the entire industry towards decarbonization through significant investments in hybrid-electric, hydrogen, and SAF-compatible aircraft.

Investors should closely monitor Airbus's ability to meet its ambitious 2025 delivery target of around 820 commercial aircraft, as this will be a key indicator of its success in mitigating ongoing supply chain bottlenecks, particularly engine deliveries. Progress on the production ramp-up for all aircraft families, especially the A350, and the profitability of these efforts will also be critical. Beyond commercial aircraft, the performance of Airbus's Defence and Space and Helicopters divisions will be important for overall financial health. The upcoming financial reports will provide further insights into the company's operational achievements and strategic direction in the months to come.

But the market must overcome some of its previous challenges to produce sufficient volumes to entice potential new users.

Historically, we have referred to heat-treated biomass products as black pellets, because of their darker color compared to white wood pellets. However, there is a need to use broader terminology to encompass producers that instead produce biomass briquettes or supply it in undensified form.

The market can be divided into two distinct sectors. Biocoal refers to a coal-like product that can be used for heat and power generation. It is usually produced via torrefaction or steam treatment, but in some cases, hydrothermal carbonization may be used. Biocarbon refers to a product which can be used as a reductant in metals production. It must have a high fixed carbon content, meaning it can only be produced by the higher temperature pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis can also be used to produce biochar, a product used for carbon sequestration, soil enhancement and carbon credits, but biocarbon has additional properties such as mechanical strength, which means it can be used for metals production.

For over 15 years, project developers have advanced the technologies needed to improve the properties of raw biomass. However, there have been many technical and commercial obstacles along the way.

Production Projects

In recent years, emerging interest from heavy industries, driven by corporate decarbonization efforts, has rejuvenated the market and led to the start-up of commercial-scale production. Hawkins Wright’s latest multiclient report, “The Biocarbon and Biocoal Market,” identifies the existing capacity today and the pipeline of planned projects, including company profiles. We have identified around 2 million metric tons (mt) of annual production capacity existing today, but we estimate actual production in 2024 was less than 300,000 mt.

In the biocoal space, most production is in smaller-scale pilot or demonstration plants. But Arbaflame is one of the old-timers. It has been producing steam-treated pellets for over 20 years in Norway. 2025 saw the arrival of the first commercial volumes from Idemitsu in Vietnam, TTCL in Thailand and Joensuu Biocoal in Finland. TSI also started up a 15,000-mt plant in the U.S.

Meanwhile in France, the new owners of the FICAP steam-treated biocoal mill, Pearl Capital, plans to restart production this fall. Perpetual Next has also started work on installing new reactors at its Estonia torrefaction plant.

Large-scale production of biocarbon is slightly behind progress in the biocoal market. Market leader Aymium will soon start up its large-scale North American biocarbon facilities, although it has been operating a 75,000-mt mill in Michigan since 2012. There are also some promising smaller-scale plants due online soon in Norway, the U.S., Canada and Sweden. Meanwhile, Airex Energy started operating its 30,000-mt plant in Quebec in early 2025, mainly to produce biochar, but additional volumes could be used for testing by metals producers.

Demand Opportunities

Demand side developments have been slower than many had expected, but there is still growing interest. Around 15 years ago, the then-emerging technology known as black pellets was originally developed as a drop-in replacement for coal in power and heat plants in Europe. But, ultimately, large-scale demand did not materialize in the region, with white wood pellets instead taking precedent. Since then, most European countries have ended the use of coal for power, so opportunities there are more limited, aside from perhaps for district heating and power in Poland and Germany.

But there is growing interest elsewhere. In Japan, there could be opportunities to cofire biocoal at coal power plants to meet energy efficiency targets. The Indian government has introduced cofiring mandates for coal power plants, with specific mention of using torrefied biomass. There are also coal power plant conversions under consideration in Canada and New Zealand. In addition, there is growing attention from heavy industry users looking to replace their coal use for heat, power and steam production with a renewable alternative.

A much newer market is the use of biocoal as a feedstock for gasification, producing syngas for a variety of end-uses, including via Fischer-Tropsch for sustainable aviation fuel, synthetic natural gas and hydrogen production.

Meanwhile, biocarbon has a unique opportunity to help defossilize the metals industry. For a lot of metals production, including steel, a carbon reductant is a crucial element of the production process. Therefore, if the sector is to defossilize, it must find a renewable carbon alternative—biocarbon. If biocarbon is used to defossilize just a small proportion of global metals production, the demand volumes could be huge. The World Steel Association estimates steel production uses around 1 billion mt of metallurgical coal annually.

Barriers and Challenges

Although 2025 has brought some exciting announcements in the biocarbon and biocoal space, progress has not been as smooth or as quick as many had hoped. The economics of biocoal and biocarbon versus fossil fuels are still a problem. In 2022, the energy crisis and higher carbon prices in Europe drove a renewed interest from heavy industry. However, since then, calmer energy markets have dampened that interest. Currently, the technology, energy and feedstock costs typically render biocoal and biocarbon uncompetitive with fossil fuels, without some additional incentive. Higher carbon prices in the future would change that.

For some potential users, a major barrier has also been the lack of large volumes available. This is especially a problem for steel producers. Even those looking for what they would deem test volumes, the requirements are beyond what any single producer can supply just yet. And of course, producing biocoal, and even more so biocarbon, comes with its own technical challenges. Even though I have mentioned several new start-ups this year, I do not think any could claim the start-up was straight forward and exactly as expected.

Other challenges the sector will need to overcome if it is really to move to a commoditized product include logistical challenges, quality consistency and standardization.

In order to help facilitate the development of this emerging market, and the defossilization of heavy industry with all types of solid biomass, Hawkins Wright will hold its third annual heavy industry-focused biomass conference. The European Biocarbon Summit will be held Dec. 9-10 in Amsterdam.

The Evolving Green Energy Market with IDTechEx

The renewable energy sector is becoming increasingly enriched with the developments of clean, green, and natural power sources, with hydrogen and solar being two of the biggest technology names rising within the industry. IDTechEx's portfolios of Hydrogen and Energy & Decarbonization Research Reports explore the growing markets that are expected to reshape the future of energy in line with global decarbonization targets.

Harnessing sun and wind energy for renewable charging within the transport sector

The transport industry is a large adopter of clean energy technologies, largely due to the expectations of lowering carbon footprints and the desire to realize sustainability targets. Solar canopy charging, hydrogen generator charging, and airborne wind energy charging are all avenues explored by IDTechEx as a means of powering electric vehicles away from grid access. IDTechEx's report, ""Off-Grid Charging For Electric Vehicles 2024-2034: Technologies, Benchmarking, Players and Forecasts"", covers different off-grid EV charging methods, and provides forecasts for their uptake over the next ten years.

Solar canopy charging carports that are completely independent from the grid could see cars charging simply from being parked underneath solar panels and plugged into a charging outlet. Labelled as the fastest growing source of renewable energy by IDTechEx, solar power can provide cheaper means of generating energy, especially when compared to fossil fuel projects.

'Top-up charging', where drivers can recharge little and often, may suit electric vehicles better, as they never have to worry about running too low and struggling to source power. Issues surrounding energy storage and intermittency may arise with solar canopy chargers, which without grid stability, may prove difficult to abate. However, when used mostly as a charge boost, solar canopy charging offers an environmentally friendly and smart way to keep vehicles energized.

Wind power, though also a promising means of renewable energy, is currently too expensive and large to feasibly use for electric vehicle charging, according to IDTechEx. However, airborne wind energy (AWE) could be a loophole, which sees a tether-based device being able to harness power from high-altitude winds, while incurring less material costs. AWE can also provide more consistency when compared to solar, given its ability to work even in the dark, and increasing the surface area of the device could increase power generation without affecting the ground footprint.

Hydrogen for land and sky transportation

Hydrogen could provide a means of charging up battery electric vehicles, as opposed to fuel-cell electric vehicles, by having external fuel cells produce electricity from outside of the vehicle. Hydrogen chargers could have an integrated battery, but also rely on stored, compressed hydrogen as energy storage. While this could provide a solution to off-grid or temporary power situations, IDTechEx states that the costs of hydrogen charging, especially when using green hydrogen to maximize sustainability, would be very high. However, as renewable energy costs decrease as they become more widely available, hydrogen charging could see a noticeable uptake.

Hydrogen planes could be a new means of travel in the future, with the only emission produced in-flight being water vapour, and would be a great development for the environment and reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Liquid hydrogen fuel cell planes could have between 30 and 40% of the range of a jet fuel plane, which could mean a travel range of several thousand kilometers is possible. This would be ideal for shorter journeys of under 2,000km, which is where over 50% of travel demand lies by seats, according to IDTechEx. The report, ""Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts"", covers different ways to decarbonize the air travel sector, including the introduction of battery-powered planes and the implementation of sustainable aviation fuel.

The creation of green hydrogen with electrolysis

With the expansion of hydrogen applications in line with increasing decarbonization efforts, green hydrogen in particular is drawing attention as being the most environmentally beneficial in its use. Green hydrogen is produced with water electrolysis, with many different electrolyzer types on the market, each with their own benefits.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, for example, can offer more compact system designs and much smaller footprints when compared with alkaline systems. PEMELs high power densities are as a result of their solid proton exchange membrane, and they are a popular commercial option for producing green hydrogen with advancing technologies being developed. Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolyzers operate at the lowest voltage range and therefore can be considered one of the most efficient technologies. This is possible as a result of leveraging high temperatures and enabling favorable thermodynamics, according to IDTechEx. More types of electrolyzers used to produce green hydrogen, and their best suited applications, are covered in detail in IDTechEx's report, ""Materials for Green Hydrogen Production 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"".

Turning hydrogen into electricity

Fuel cells operate with the input of hydrogen fuel and an oxygen source which undergo a chemical reaction that results in the generation of electricity to power an external load, alongside water and heat. Stationary fuel cells refer to this process occurring in a fixed place, either permanently or semi-permanently, and are usually operating within a fuel cell stack as part of a larger system.

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are more favoured within stationary applications including industrial power and commercial operations, for continuous generation. Other types such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are more desired within mobile applications such as in the transport sector and are also becoming contenders for back-up power generation in the replacement of diesel generators.

The implementation of fuel cells as a means of providing large scale renewable energy could provide relief for continuous, always-on applications such as data centers. The sustainability promises that this means of generating electricity can fulfil, especially with the growing use of green hydrogen into the future, will also contribute to worldwide decarbonization efforts within the energy sector. IDTechEx's report, ""Stationary Fuel Cell Markets 2025-2035: Technologies, Players & Forecasts"", covers a multitude of fuel cell types, and their best suited applications, along with emerging trends and drawbacks to consider.

Using internal research funding, a multidisciplinary team produced and characterized the SAF, along with two other commercially available fuels, before collecting emissions and particulate data to support the aviation industry’s emissions goals.

“Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,” said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI’s Mechanical Engineering Division. “With this project we’re gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.”

Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum that burns inside a jet engine. Fueling jets with SAF could help reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide air travel accounts for 2% of all carbon emissions, and 12% of all carbon emissions from transportation. The team tackled three focus areas — production, characterization and testing.

First, chemical engineers refined electrofuels, or e-fuels, manufactured with hydrogen that’s produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The team then processed that into an in-house SAF meeting aviation fuels standards. Then SwRI’s fuels and lubricants specialists characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI's propulsion and energy specialists used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

Through a series of hydroprocessing reactions over several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They engineered a small batch — about one barrel of fuel — to characterize and test fuels prior to commercialization.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time and risks for our clients.”

“We are excited to offer multidisciplinary solutions across all stages of the SAF development cycle,” said SwRI’s Executive Vice President Walt Downing. “This integrated project paired chemical and mechanical engineers with fluids and emissions experts to address several technical challenges.”

Di Sabatino will present at the Sustainable Aviation Futures Congress in Houston, October 14-16.

SwRI is a leader in propulsion, aircraft technology, alternative fuels, and emissions characterization. In 2024, the Institute invested more than $11 million into its internal research and development program aimed at advancing new technology without the narrow scope and expected deliverables of contract R&D.

European Energy adds bio-methanol made with e-SMR to its green fuel portfolio

The production process will decrease production costs while lowering the carbon intensity of methanol

The addition of e-SMR-based bio-methanol will broaden European Energy’s green methanol portfolio

The e-SMR technology can also be deployed in conventional methanol production, reducing CO₂ emissions from natural-gas-based methanol

First commercial 10-MW unit planned for 2026 following more than 80,000 hours of prototype testing

European Energy will begin integrating the next generation of bio-methanol into its portfolio of green fuels.

The bio-methanol will be produced through an innovative technology known as electrified steam methane reforming (e-SMR), where renewable electricity is used to process biogas or biomethane into synthesis gas, which is then converted into green methanol using European Energy’s proprietary methanol technology.

The e-SMR technology is not a replacement but a complementary addition to European Energy’s green fuel offering. By advancing green hydrogen, e-methanol, and bio-methanol in parallel, European Energy ensures greater flexibility across markets. Together, the three products form a diversified technology platform that accelerates the transition from fossil fuels to scalable, carbon-neutral fuels.

The technology has been developed by SYPOX, a spin-off from the Technical University of Munich, with which European Energy is now cooperating. Following over 80,000 test hours and successful demonstrations under real-life conditions at biogas plants in Germany, the first 10-MW commercial e-SMR unit is scheduled for delivery in 2026.

“With SYPOX’s e-SMR technology, we can reduce the production costs of green methanol while lowering its carbon intensity – enabling the shipping and chemical sectors to decarbonize faster,” says Emil Vikjær-Andresen, Executive Vice President and Head of Power-to-X at European Energy.

“By adding bio-methanol made with e-SMR technology, we strengthen our ability to deliver competitive green fuels across different regulatory and market conditions. This is not a pivot but a complementary pathway that expands the technology solutions needed to scale green methanol globally.”

European Energy began green fuel production at its Kassø e-methanol facility in May 2025, making it the world’s first large-scale commercial e-methanol facility, with a potential production capacity of 42,000 tpy of e-methanol.

“European Energy brings unique expertise as a frontrunner in scaling green methanol production, and their commitment is a strong validation of our technology. Together, we can accelerate the industrial deployment of e-SMR and make green methanol a competitive global fuel,” says Gianluca Pauletto, CEO of SYPOX.

“Our e-SMR systems have undergone more than 80,000 hours of successful testing, including a pilot and demo installation in the field, providing both efficiency and stability. With European Energy, we can now take the next step into commercial-scale deployment, optimizing the technology for large production units and further reducing the carbon footprint of methanol synthesis.”

Methanol plays a central role in the global energy and chemical economy, serving as a fuel for the shipping sector, a feedstock for the chemical industry, and potentially also as a fuel for aviation. Today, most methanol is produced from fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, making the transition to green alternatives essential for meeting climate targets and reducing emissions.

The global methanol market exceeds 100 MM tonnes today and is projected to reach 500 MM tonnes by 2050. With growing demand from shipping, chemicals, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, e-SMR provides a practical next step for scaling green fuels to meet climate and compliance goals.

Organised by Eva International Media, the event will take place at Copenhagen Airport, bringing cargo, ground handling and passenger operations under one roof.
“The goal is to demystify the technology and focus on what works.” A Centenary setting Hosting ACHL 2025 at Copenhagen Airport gives the event a ready-made talking point.
“Copenhagen Airport is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2025, which is already a milestone worth raising a glass to,” Raja notes.
“ That mix of history and innovation makes Copenhagen the perfect place to host ACHL,” she explained.","The Air Cargo Handling and Logistics (ACHL) Conference returns on 14th October with a format that combines six events into a single, multi-track gathering. Organised by Eva International Media, the event will take place at Copenhagen Airport, bringing cargo, ground handling and passenger operations under one roof.

“The thinking was refreshingly simple: listen to the industry,” Parveen Raja, Publisher of Eva International Media, said. “Time and again, we were told there are too many events competing for the same diaries and travel budgets. So, the solution was clear — why not bring them together under one roof?

“These areas don’t function in isolation — they have natural synergies,” she explains. “By merging six events into one platform, we save people time, reduce travel demands, and create deeper opportunities for learning and networking.”

From buzzwords to bottom line

This year’s theme — ‘Enhance Safety, Embrace Digital, Drive Value’ — reflects what Raja calls “the three non-negotiables of aviation today and tomorrow.” “Safety remains the foundation of everything we do,” she says. “That doesn’t change, especially as ne

w technologies, aircraft types, and operating models emerge. Digitisation is no longer just a buzzword; it’s transforming how we handle passengers, cargo, and compliance.” But digital progress, she stresses, must serve a clear purpose: “Everything must deliver value for airlines, handlers, airports, and ultimately the passenger. By addressing these priorities head on, we’re helping the industry stay focused on what truly matters — building trusted, efficient, and future-ready aviation services.”

Delegates can expect sessions on AI, IoT, and blockchain — though Raja is keen to keep discussions grounded in application rather than hype. “We bring experts, innovators, and early adopters together to share real examples and lessons learned,” she says. “The goal is to demystify the technology and focus on what works.”

A Centenary setting

Hosting ACHL 2025 at Copenhagen Airport gives the event a ready-made talking point. “Copenhagen Airport is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2025, which is already a milestone worth raising a glass to,” Raja notes. “Beyond that, CPH is one of Europe’s fastest-growing hubs, with passenger numbers on the rise and a globally recognised role as a pharmaceutical logistics hub. “

That mix of history and innovation makes Copenhagen the perfect place to host ACHL,” she explained. “It’s a setting where we can both honour history and shape the next century of aviation together.”

Collaboration that counts

Cooperation remains the event’s core purpose. “We take collaboration very seriously, which is exactly why we’ve put everyone under one roof,” Raja explained. “By breaking down silos and creating shared forums for airlines, handlers, regulators, and tech innovators, ACHL creates an environment where the conversations that really matter can take shape.”

Sustainability will also be prominent throughout the programme. “It’s no longer confined to the CSR sections of annual reports — it’s business critical,” she continued. “Delegates will hear perspectives on everything from green logistics strategies to the real-world scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and ambitious decarbonisation roadmaps.”

With these discussions, the event hopes to encourage delegates to move from intent to implementation: “We want to shift the conversation from why to how — practical solutions, innovative technologies, and collaborative models that genuinely help aviation walk the sustainability talk.”

Networking with a Nordic flair

ACHL has built a reputation for lively networking, something the organisers are looking to maintain in 2025. “Networking is the heartbeat of ACHL, and this year we’re turning up the volume,” Raja outlined. The programme includes a welcome reception on 14th October and an evening at Copenhagen’s Circus Building — a venue more often associated with entertainment than trade shows.

Adding a personal touch, the Women in Air Cargo Awards, championed by Brigitte Gledhill, will highlight professionals shaping the sector’s future. “Expect conversations that matter, connections that last, and backdrops so memorable you’ll be glad you brought a camera as well as your business cards,” she highlighted.

When asked what he hopes attendees will take away, Raja was clear: “Professionally, I hope they leave feeling better connected and better equipped to tackle the big challenges in aviation today. Personally, I hope they leave with new friendships, great memories, and maybe a story or two from the Circus Building that they’ll still be laughing about next year.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0138-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 12:59:17.629235

OXCCU announced the funding on September 29th. The spin-out company is positioned as a leading climate tech innovator in the UK, tackling aviation emissions, with its latest funding round being oversubscribed.

Funding and Investment

The most recent round of funding includes new investors such as Orlen VC, Safron Corporate Ventures, and International Airlines Group (IAG). Existing investors include Clean Energy Ventures and the University of Oxford.

Investor demand exceeded available shares in the latest funding round, indicating strong investor confidence. The funding amount will accelerate commercialisation efforts and advance the next phase of technology scale-up. OX2, the next demonstration plant, will be fully operational by 2026.

Technology and Innovation

OXCCU employs a one-step process to produce sustainable aviation fuel. It involves an iron-based catalyst enabling the synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. The process eliminates the need for steps such as water gas shift or e-methanol, reducing operating costs.

The SAF mandate in the UK and the RefuelEU Aviation initiative in the EU set clear targets for airlines to increase the use of sustainable fuels in their operations. However, this may be a challenge as conventional fuel is still significantly cheaper.

OXCCU has mentioned that although their process has reduced costs, high production costs remain a barrier. By developing the one-step process, however, OXCCU is attempting to provide a cost-saving alternative to the current SAF production methods.

Benefits of growth

The investment will inevitably help the UK meet its SAF mandate by producing more sustainable fuel. It is also one of many UK-based SAF plants, making the country a leading player in the market. Creating new SAF plants will create green jobs and increase aviation fuel exports.

Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU:

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving.”

Johnathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, said:

“IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030.” – IAG expect to meet their target of 10% through their investment in OXCCU.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OX1-Plant-Opening-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-08 12:59:29.842268

Trading Improvement The improved trading outlook follows a period of relative stability in oil prices.
That echoes Exxon Mobil Corp.’s update on Monday, which projected a $300 million to $700 million profit boost from stronger fuel-making margins.","Shell Plc said the performance of its oil and gas trading operation recovered in the third quarter, after struggling with geopolitical volatility in the previous period.

The division’s performance was significantly higher for gas and higher for oil in the quarter, the company said Tuesday in a statement ahead of earnings results later this month.

It’s a bounce back for a business that’s often one of the energy giant’s biggest profit boosters. Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan had linked unusually poor trading results in the second quarter to market swings driven by geopolitics rather than supply-demand fundamentals, leading Shell to dial back risk.

Shell’s shares rose as much as 2.3% in London on Tuesday, the most in two months. The stock’s 12% gain this year is now the best performance among the largest oil and gas companies.

“We see this as a strong update from the company,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note on Tuesday. He highlighted “better trading” performance in the July-September period following the “disappointing” trading result in the previous quarter.

Borkhataria also noted Shell’s increased LNG liquefaction volumes rising to between 7 million and 7.4 million metric tons, up from 6.7 million in the prior quarter. Shell’s oil and gas output climbed to as much as the equivalent of 1.89 million barrels a day, within previous guidance range.

Underlying operating expenses in oil and gas exploration and production could exceed the previous quarter by up to $500 million, Shell said.

Trading Improvement

The improved trading outlook follows a period of relative stability in oil prices. Brent crude futures traded mostly within a narrow band between $65 and $70 a barrel in the third quarter, giving traders more predictable spreads to exploit. Average prices in the quarter were up by more than $2.

While the third quarter was not without volatility, the preceding period saw a short-lived war in the Middle East — the world’s oil heartland — and wide ranging announcements of tariffs by US President Donald Trump’s administration.

Shell is among the first so-called supermajors to update investors guidance on quarterly results, giving a little more visibility for how the sector at large fared.

Its peers also struggled with volatility in the second quarter. And while Shell’s update suggests an improvement for energy trading, the International Energy Agency says the oil market is on the cusp of oversupply that might pressure prices. TotalEnergies SE announced a reduction in share buybacks last month with an expectation of Brent crude trading in a lower range.

Refining margins also improved for Shell. That echoes Exxon Mobil Corp.’s update on Monday, which projected a $300 million to $700 million profit boost from stronger fuel-making margins.

Chemicals Woes

Not all divisions are rebounding. Shell’s chemicals unit is expected to lose money in the third quarter.

The chemicals unit has been a drag on Shell’s performance for some time, and the company has said it’s exploring partnerships in the US and selective closures in Europe. Sawan in July pledged to turn around the chemicals business, which he said has been suffering from one of the most protracted industrywide slumps in a long time.

Major chemical producers have announced closures or have idled capacity in Europe, including Dow Inc. and Exxon, partly as high energy costs in the region make it less competitive. Shell completed the sale of its Singapore chemicals plant earlier this year.

Biofuels Writedown

Shell also took $600 million in new impairments tied to the suspension of its biofuels plant in Rotterdam, bringing total writedowns at the site to roughly $1.4 billion. The project, which was put on hold last year pending a cost review, would have been one of Europe’s biggest plants for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Shell has been shedding low-carbon businesses to boost profitability.

Rival BP Plc is also forgoing construction of a biofuels plant in the Netherlands to focus on oil and gas production.

Sawan has spent the past two years seeking to cut costs, improve reliability and shed underperforming assets in an effort to close a valuation gap with Shell’s US rivals.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time and risks for our clients.”

“We are excited to offer multidisciplinary solutions across all stages of the SAF development cycle,” said SwRI’s Executive Vice President Walt Downing. “This integrated project paired chemical and mechanical engineers with fluids and emissions experts to address several technical challenges.”

Liquid biofuels feature heavily in the climate plans of many countries, as governments prioritise domestic energy security amid geopolitical challenges, while looking to meet their climate targets and bolster farm incomes.

Despite a rapid shift towards electrified transportation, biofuels continue to play a leading role in efforts to reduce road-transport emissions, as they work well with many existing car engines.

At the same time, biofuels are expected to play an important role in decarbonising sectors where emissions are particularly challenging to mitigate, such as shipping, trucking and aviation.

Heated debates continue around using food sources as fuel in the face of record hunger levels, given competing demands for land and crops.

Despite these arguments, biofuels are seeing heightened demand bolstered by a strong policy push, particularly in developing countries.

They are expected to feature heavily on the COP30 agenda this year as a key feature of the host Brazil’s “bioeconomy”.

Below, Carbon Brief unpacks what biofuels are, their key benefits and criticisms, plus how they are being used to meet climate targets.

What are biofuels?

Bioenergy refers to all energy derived from biomass, a term used to describe non-fossil material from biological sources. Biofuels, in turn, are liquid fuels that are produced from biomass.

These sources are wide-ranging, but commonly include food crops, vegetable oils, animal fats, algae and municipal or agricultural waste, along with synthetic derivatives from these products.

Glossary

Biomass

Non-fossil material of biological origin

Biofuel

Fuels produced directly or indirectly from biomass

Feedstock

Types of biomass used as sources for biofuels, such as crops, grasses, agricultural and forestry residues, wastes and microbial biomass

Bioenergy

All energy derived from biofuels

Bioethanol

A biofuel used as a petrol substitute, produced from the fermentation of biomass from plants like corn, sugarcane and wheat

Biodiesel

A biofuel used as a diesel substitute, derived from vegetable oils or animal fats through a process called transesterification

The different types of biomass are referred to as “feedstocks”. They are converted to fuel through one or more processes, such as fermentation or treating them with high temperatures or hydrogen.

Biofuels are frequently blended with petroleum products in an effort to reduce emissions and reliance on fossil-fuel imports.

Experiments to test whether vegetable oils could run in combustion engines began in the early 1900s. In a 1912 paper, Rudolf Diesel – the inventor of the diesel engine – presciently noted that these oils “make it certain that motorpower can still be produced from the heat of the sun…even when all our natural stores of solid and liquid fuels are exhausted”.

Biofuels are divided into four “generations”, based on the technologies and feedstocks used to synthesise them.

First-generation biofuels

The first – and earliest – generation of biofuels comes from edible crops, such as corn, sugarcane, soya bean and oil palm. Large-scale commercial production of these fuels began in the 1970s in Brazil and the US from sugarcane and corn, respectively.

Bioethanol, for instance, is drawn from the fermentation of sugars in corn, sugarcane and rice. Biodiesel is derived from vegetable oils – such as palm, canola or soya bean oil – or animal fats, through a process called transesterification, which makes them less viscous and more suitable as fuels.

Because they are derived directly from food crops, experts and campaigners have expressed concerns over the impacts of first-generation biofuels on forests, food security and the environment, as well as indirect land-use change impacts. (See: What are some of the main criticisms of biofuels?)

Several studies have found that the land-use emissions of first-generation biofuels are severely underestimated, but other experts tell Carbon Brief that this depends on how and where the crops are grown, processed and transported.

According to Dr Angelo Gurgel, principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy, the “big image that biofuels are bad” is not always accurate. Gurgel explains:

“Some biofuels can be better than others, varying from place to place and feedstock to feedstock. It depends on where you produce them, how much farmers can increase yields, how effectively a country’s regulations help avoid land-use change and how closely it is connected to international markets.

“Some options may be very, very good in terms of reducing emissions and other options probably will be very bad.”

Second-generation biofuels

Second-generation biofuels are extracted from biomass that is not meant for human consumption.

Feedstocks for these biofuels are incredibly varied. They include agricultural waste, such as straw and corn stalks, grasses, forest residues left over from wood processing, used vegetable oil and solid waste. They can also be made from energy crops grown specifically to serve as biofuels, such as jatropha, switchgrass or pongamia.

Derived from “waste” or grown on “marginal” land, second-generation biofuels were developed in the early 2000s. These fuels aimed to overcome the food security and land-use issues tied to their predecessors, while increasing the amount of fuel drawn out from biomass, compared to first-generation feedstocks.

These feedstocks are either heated to yield oil or “syngas” and then cooled, or treated with enzymes, microorganisms or other chemicals to break down the tough cellulose walls of plants. They can be challenging to process and present significant logistical and land-use challenges.

Third-generation biofuels

Third-generation biofuels are primarily derived from aquatic organic material, particularly algae and seaweed. While the US Department of Energy began its aquatic species programme in 1978 to research the production of biodiesel from algae, algal biofuel research saw a “sudden surge” in the 1990s and “became the darling” of renewable energy innovation in the early 21st century, says Mongabay.

Because algae grows faster than terrestrial plants, is high in lipid (fatty organic) content and does not compete with terrestrial crops for land use, many scientists and industry professionals consider third-generation biofuels an improvement over their predecessors.

However, high energy, water and nutrient needs, high production costs and technical challenges are key obstacles to the large-scale production of algae-based biofuels. Since the early 2010s, many companies, including Shell, Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil, have abandoned or cut funding to their algal biofuel development programmes.

Fourth-generation biofuels

Genetically modified algae, bacteria and yeast engineered for higher yields serve as the feedstock for fourth-generation biofuels. These fuels have been developed more recently – from the early 2010s onwards – and are an area of ongoing research and development.

Some of these organisms are engineered to directly or artificially photosynthesise solar energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuel; these are called solar biofuels.

Others – called electrofuels, synthetic fuels or e-fuels – are produced when CO2 captured from biomass is combined with hydrogen and converted into hydrocarbons through other processes, typically using electricity generated from renewable sources.

Fourth-generation biofuels are technology- and CO2-intensive and expensive to produce. They also run up against public perception and legal limitations on genetically modified organisms, as well as concerns around biosafety and health.

What are the most common biofuels being used today?

Bioethanol is the most commonly used liquid biofuel in the world, followed by biodiesel.

In 2024, global liquid biofuel production increased by 8% year-on-year, with the US (37%) and Brazil (22%) accounting for the largest overall share of production, according to the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy from the Energy Institute.

Other countries that saw a notable increase in production between 2023-24 were Sweden (62%), Canada (39%), China (30%), India (26%) and Argentina (24%).

Bioethanol is the most commonly used biofuel in the world, with a consumption rate of 1.1m barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, according to the report. This is closely followed by biodiesel, at 1m barrels of oil equivalent per day.

In 2024, the US, Brazil and the EU accounted for nearly three-quarters of all biofuels consumed globally. However, while India’s biofuel demand grew by 38%, demand for biofuels in the EU fell by 11% in 2024, according to the review, echoing outlooks that show that middle-income countries are driving biofuel growth.

The chart below shows how biofuel production and consumption have changed since 2000, and how they are projected to change through 2034.

What are the main arguments for biofuels?

From lowered oil imports and emissions through to boosting farm livelihoods, countries that have boosted biofuels programmes cite several benefits in biofuels’ favour.

‘Renewable’ energy and lowered emissions

Biofuels are often described as “renewable” fuels, since crops can be grown over and over again.

In order to achieve this, crops for biofuels must be continuously replanted and harvested to meet energy demand. Growing crops – particularly in the monoculture plantations typically used for growing feedstocks – can require high use of fossil fuels, in the form of machinery and fertiliser. Furthermore, in the case of wood as a feedstock, regrowth can take decades.

While some biofuels offer significant emissions reductions, others, such as palm biodiesel, generate similar or sometimes higher emissions as fossil fuels when burned. However, ancillary emissions for biofuels are much smaller than for oil and gas operations.

One of the main cited benefits of biofuels is that plants capture CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, potentially serving to mitigate emissions. However, several lifecycle-assessment studies have questioned just how much plants can offset emissions. These studies come up with varying estimates based on feedstock types, geography, production routes and methodology.

This divergence is echoed in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), which points to “contrasting conclusions” even when similar bioenergy systems and conditions are analysed.

Per the report, there is “medium agreement” on the emissions-reduction potential of second-generation biofuels derived from wastes and residues by 2050.

At the same time, the IPCC adds that “technical land availability does not imply that dedicated biomass production for bioenergy…is the most effective use of this land for mitigation”.

It also warns that larger-scale biofuel use “generally translates into higher risk for negative outcomes for greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, food security and a range of other sustainability criteria”.

Along with the IPCC, many other groups and experts – including the UK’s Climate Change Commission – have called for a “biomass hierarchy”, pointing to a limited amount of sustainable bioenergy resources available and how best to prioritise their use.

Use in hard-to-abate sectors

In many countries, such as the US and UK, biofuels are part of a standard grade of diesel and petrol (gasoline) available at most fuel pumps.

Biofuels have also been the leading measure for decarbonising road transport in emerging economies, where electric vehicle systems were not as developed as in many western nations.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), most new biofuel demand is coming from these countries, including Brazil, India and Indonesia.

Biofuels are also one of the key options being explored to decarbonise the emissions-heavy, but “hard-to-abate”, sectors of aviation and shipping.

The AR6 report notes that the “faster-than-anticipated adoption of electromobility” has “partially shifted the debate” from using biofuels primarily in land transport towards using them in shipping and aviation.

At the same time, experts question how this can be done sustainably, given the limited availability of advanced biofuels and the rising demand for them.

Government reports – such as those released by the EU Commission – recognise that, in some circumstances, so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) could produce just as many emissions as fossil fuels when burned in order to power planes.

However, SAFs do generally – although not always – have a lower overall “lifecycle” carbon footprint than petroleum-based jet fuel. This is due to the CO2 absorbed when growing plants for biofuels, or emissions that are avoided by diverting waste products to be used as fuels.

Unlike the road sector, where “electrification is mature…aviation and shipping cannot be electrified so easily”, says Cian Delaney, fuels policy officer at the Brussels-based advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

According to a 2025 T&E briefing, the 2030 demand for biofuels from global shipping alone could require an area the “size of Germany”. Delaney tells Carbon Brief:

“In aviation in particular, where you still need some space to transition, you still need a certain amount of biofuels. But these biofuels should be advanced and waste biofuels derived from true waste and residues, and they are available in truly limited amounts, which is why, in parallel, we need to upscale the production of e-fuels [synthetic fuels derived from green hydrogen] for aviation.”

In February this year, more than 65 environmental organisations from countries including the US, Indonesia and the Netherlands wrote to the International Maritime Organization, urging its 176 member states to “exclude biofuels from the industry’s energy mix”.

The organisations cited the “devastating impacts on climate, communities, forests and other ecosystems” from biofuels, cautioning that fuels such as virgin palm oil are often “fraud[ulently]” mislabelled as used cooking oil – a key feedstock for SAF.

Meanwhile, the AR6 report has “medium confidence” that heavy-duty trucks can be decarbonised through a combination of batteries and hydrogen or biofuels. And despite growing interest in the use of biofuels for aviation, it says, “demand and production volumes remain negligible compared to conventional fossil aviation fuels”.

Energy security and reducing import dependence

In many countries, such as India and Indonesia, biofuels are seen as a part of a suite of measures to increase energy security and lessen dependence on fossil-fuel imports from other countries. This imperative received increasing emphasis after the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine.

In developing countries, the “main motivation” behind biofuel policy is to find an alternative to excessive dependence on imported fossil fuels that are a “major drain” on foreign exchanges and subject to volatility and price shocks, says Prof Nandula Raghuram, professor of biotechnology at the Guru Gobind Singh University in New Delhi.

Raghuram, who formerly chaired the International Nitrogen Initiative, tells Carbon Brief that, in order for developing countries to “earn those precious dollars to finance our petroleum imports”, they have to export “valuable primary commodities”, such as grain and vegetables, at the cost of nutritional self-reliance. He adds:

“And so we have to see the biofuel approach as not so much a proactive strategy, but as a sort of reactive strategy to use whatever domestic capacity we have to produce whatever domestic fuel, including biofuels, to reduce that much burden on the exchequer for imports.”

Boost to agriculture

Many governments also see biofuels as an alternative income stream for farmers and a means to revitalise rural economies.

An increasing demand for biofuels could, for example, offer farmers higher returns on their crops, attract industry and services to agrarian areas and help diversify farm incomes.

In 2023, a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated that the liquid biofuel industry employed approximately 2.8 million people worldwide.

The bulk of these jobs were in Latin America and Asia, where farming is more labour-intensive and relies on informal and seasonal employment. Brazil’s biofuel sector alone employed nearly one million people in 2023, according to the report.

Meanwhile, North America and Europe accounted for only 12% and 6% of biofuel jobs in 2023, respectively, according to the report.

The chart below shows the number of jobs in the biofuel sector in the top 10 biofuel-producing countries.

Delaney points out that biofuel-related jobs account for less than 1% of all jobs in the EU, adding that the “most-consumed biofuel feedstocks” in the bloc are vegetable oils that are imported from countries such as Brazil and Indonesia. (See: How are countries using biofuels to meet their climate targets?)

He tells Carbon Brief:

“Despite strong biofuels mandates in the EU, the sector didn’t create as many jobs in the end for EU farmers, but, instead, benefited the big fuel suppliers and industry players.”

What are some of the main criticisms of biofuels?

Despite their widespread use and increasing adoption, experts recognise that biofuels “may also carry significant risks” and cause impacts that can undermine their sustainability, if not managed carefully.

Production emissions, land-use change and deforestation

The different chemical processes involved in making biofuels require varying amounts of energy and, therefore, the associated emissions depend on how “clean” a producer country’s energy mix is.

At the same time, growing biofuel crops often relies on emissions-intensive fertilisers and pesticides to keep yields high and consistent. (See Carbon Brief’s detailed explainer on what the world’s reliance on fertilisers means for climate change.)

Biofuel production processes, such as fermentation, also release CO2 and other greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide.

MIT’s Gurgel tells Carbon Brief that it is “relatively straightforward” to measure these direct emissions from biofuel production.

However, given how different countries account for deforestation, tracking direct land-use change emissions related to biofuel production is slightly more challenging – although still possible, Gurgel says. These emissions can come from clearing forests or converting other land specifically for growing energy crops.

For example, in many tropical forest countries, native rainforests and peatland have been cleared to grow oil palm for biodiesel or sugarcane for bioethanol.

According to one 2011 study by the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF), it could take more than 200 years to reverse the carbon emissions caused by clearing peatland to grow palm oil.

Gurgel tells Carbon Brief:

“What is really very hard – I would say impossible – to measure are the indirect impacts of biofuels on land.”

Indirect land-use change occurs when a piece of land used to grow food crops is used instead for biofuels. This can, in turn, require deforestation somewhere else to produce the same amount of crops for food as the original piece of land.

Indirect land-use change can mean a loss of natural ecosystems, with “significant implications for greenhouse gas emissions and land degradation”, according to a 2024 review paper.

Gurgel explains:

“If you provoke a chain of reactions in the market, that can lead to expansion of cropland in another region of the world and then this can push the agricultural frontier further and cause some deforestation…It’s quite hard to know exactly what’s going to happen and those things are interactions in the market that are impossible to measure.”

The “best that scientists can do” to determine if such a “biofuel shock” could indeed cause land-use change in a forest or grassland elsewhere “is try to project those emissions using models, or do very careful statistical work that will never be complete”, he adds.

Delaney, from Transport and Environment, contends that there is enough scientific research to “show that indirect land-use change is real” and to quantify the expansion of “certain food and feedstocks into high-carbon stock” areas, such as forests.

While this is “not easy” to do, he points to the European Commission’s indirect land-use change directive, the accompanying methodology and its scientific teams who study agricultural expansion rates. Delaney continues:

“What we all agree with at this point is that indirect land-use change exists, that it’s a problem, that certain feedstocks like palm and soya are particularly problematic from this perspective and that it is an issue that we need to tackle and capture in the best possible way.

“You cannot just be vague and descriptive without having proper figures behind it – and I think that’s something that at least the EU have tried and that they continue trying to implement. And I hope that, at the global level as well, this will be more recognised.”

Impacts on food, biodiversity and water security

Biofuel-boosting policies have been subjected to intense scrutiny during periods of global food-price spikes in 2008, 2011 and 2013.

Following the spikes, critics attributed increasing biofuel production as a major factor in the near-doubling of cereal prices. Studies have shown that they played a more “modest” role in some of these spikes and a more substantial one in others.

Severalexperts have linked food-price spikes to protests in north Africa and the Middle-East, including the Arab Spring.

In more recent years, the “food vs fuel debate” has come back to the fore since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022.

This was in part due to the world’s reliance on Ukraine and Russia’s food and energy systems – particularly some of the most food-insecure countries, who had to contend with record-high food prices that peaked in March 2022, but still persist. The war also saw heightened calls for the US and EU to overturn biofuel-boosting policies to free up land to increase domestic food production and bring down food prices.

In developing countries, such as India, the use of cereals and oils to make biofuels while large sections of the population still lack access to adequate nutrition has attracted criticism from experts.

While first-generation biofuels rely on fertilisers to guarantee consistently high yields, second-generation biofuels could directly compete with feed for livestock or their return to soil as nutrients.

According to a 2013 report by the panel of scientists that advises the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS):

“All crops compete for the same land or water, labour, capital, inputs and investment, and there are no current magic non-food crops that can ensure more harmonious biofuel production on marginal lands.”

This competition, along with clearing forests and other ecosystems for cropland, has consequences not just for emissions, but also for biodiversity, water and nutrients.

According to one 2021 review paper, local species richness and abundance were 37% and 49% lower, respectively, in places where first-generation biofuel crops were being grown than in places with primary vegetation. Additionally, it found that soya, wheat, maize and palm oil had the “worst effects” on local biodiversity, with Asia and central and South America being the most-impacted regions.

Biofuels’ impact on water resources, similarly, is highly crop- and location-specific.

For instance, growing a “thirsty” crop such as sugarcane in Brazil could have minimal impacts on local water resources, due to the region’s abundant rainfall. But in drought-prone India, experts have estimated that a litre of sugarcane ethanol requires more than 2,500 litres of water to produce and relies entirely on irrigation. Research has also found that nearly half of China’s maize crop requires irrigation to grow.

According to agricultural economist Dr Shweta Saini, meeting India’s 2025-26 biofuels target will require 275m tonnes of sugarcane, 6m tonnes of maize and 5.5m tonnes of rice. According to one 2020 study cited by Bloomberg columnist David Fickling, increasing sugarcane production to meet India’s biofuel targets “could consume an additional 348bn cubic metres of water…around twice what is used by every city” in the country.

Prof Raghuram tells Carbon Brief:

“Water resources are drying up everywhere in the country and by incentivising, through policy, a water-guzzling industry like this, we are inviting a sustainability crisis.”

‘Feedstock crunch’

Another concern surrounding biofuels is that there may not be enough supply to go around to meet rising demand. The IEA described the potential shortfall as a “feedstock supply crunch” in a 2022 report.

Fuels derived from the most commonly used waste and residues, in particular, could be approaching supply limits, the IEA warns, as these fuels satisfy both sustainability and feedstock policy objectives in the US and EU.

Consumption of vegetable oil for biofuel production is expected to soar by 46% over 2022-27, the report says. Meanwhile, the world is estimated to “nearly exhaust 100% of supplies” of used cooking oil and animal fats within the decade.

For the world to stay on a net-zero trajectory, “a more than three times production increase” would be required, the report adds. It warns that if the limited availability of second-generation feedstocks continues unchanged, “the potential for biofuels to contribute to global decarbonisation efforts could be undermined”.

The chart below shows the biofuel demand share of global crop production from 2022-27.

How are countries using biofuels to meet their climate targets?

Broadly, biofuel policies are divided into two categories.

Technology “push” policies focus on the research and development of new technologies and include measures such as research funding, pilot plants and government support for commercialising nascent technologies.

Meanwhile, market “pull” policies drive demand for existing and emerging biofuels through measures such as “biofuel blending mandates” – where countries prescribe a certain percentage of biofuel with fossil fuels – and tax breaks for producers and vehicle owners.

US

The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is the world’s largest existing biofuel programme. Its mandates are keenly watched and contested by the country’s farm and petroleum lobbies.

Under RFS, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets out minimum levels of biofuels that must be blended into the US’s transport, heating and jet fuel supplies.

Under the policy, oil refiners can either blend mandated volumes of biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits – called Renewable Identification Numbers (RINS) – from those that do.

While the programme sets out emissions reduction targets, the environmental impacts of cropland expansion and monoculture driven by the policy have been cause for concern by experts.

According to one 2022 study, the RFS programme increased US fertiliser use by 3-8% each year between 2008-16 and caused enough domestic emissions from land-use change that the carbon intensity of corn ethanol was “no less than that of gasoline and likely at least 24% higher”. Additionally, the programme’s impacts on biodiversity have not yet been fully assessed.

In June 2025, the Trump administration announced plans to expand the biofuel mandate to a “record 24.02bn gallons” next year – an 8% increase from its 2025 target – while seeking to discourage imported biofuels.

EU

In the EU, policymakers have promoted biofuels since 2003 to reduce emissions in the transport system. As part of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED), biofuels have been explicitly linked to emissions targets.

Under the current iteration of RED (REDIII) – revised as part of the EU’s Fit for 55 package – EU countries are required to either achieve a share of 29% of renewable energy in transport or to reduce the emissions intensity of transport fuels by 14.5%. Additionally, it sets out a sub-target for “advanced biofuels” of 5.5% and excludes the use of food and feed-based biofuels in aviation and shipping.

In 2015, the European Commission acknowledged that the indirect land-use change emissions of first-generation biofuels could “fully negate” any emission savings by biofuels. The commission capped the use of first-generation biofuels in each member country at 7% of all energy used in transport by 2020, but did not announce plans to phase them out.

As of 2021, nearly 60% of all biofuels used in the EU were still made from food and feed crops, according to analysis by Oxfam. While the latest RED legislation continues to push for the use of advanced and waste biofuels, campaigners warn that a lack of clear definitions could increase the risk of “loopholes” and fraud, exacerbated by increased demand.

T&E’s Delaney tells Carbon Brief:

“You’re putting a lot of pressure on the land – you might require a lot of pesticides and irrigation – and there is not even enough land in Europe for this. How can you make sure true sustainability safeguards are in place so that you’re not actually driving additional demand for land in [biodiverse countries such as] Brazil?”

Brazil

Brazil has the world’s oldest biofuels mandate, dating back to the 1970s, established in a bid to insulate the country from expensive oil imports.

In 2017, Brazil announced a state policy called RenovaBio that set out national carbon intensity reduction targets for transport, decided biofuel mandates and created an open market for biofuel decarbonisation carbon reduction credits called CBIO.

In October 2024, Brazil enacted a “Fuels of the Future” law that replaced RenovaBio, with president Lula declaring that “Brazil will lead the world’s largest energy revolution”. The law aims to boost biofuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use, increasing biodiesel blending mandates by 1% every year starting in 2025 until it reaches 20% by March 2030.

Biofuels now account for 22% of the energy that fuels transport in Brazil and its ethanol market is “second in size only” to the US.

In June this year, Brazil announced that the country was increasing its biofuel blending mandates from 1 August in a bid to make the country “gasoline self-sufficient for the first time in 15 years”, reported Reuters.

Indonesia

As the world’s biggest palm oil producer, Indonesia has continued to raise its biodiesel blending mandates to meet its domestic energy needs.

The country first introduced mandatory biodiesel blending in 2008, at 2.5%. The mandate is currently at 40% in 2025 and, starting next year, could go up to 50% with an eventual goal of 100%.

While Indonesia’s president Prabowo Subianto has stated that implementing 50% blending could save the country $20bn in reduced diesel imports, the move would need an estimated 2.3m hectares of land, including protected forests, resulting in the “country’s largest-ever deforestation project”, according to Mongabay.

It could also compete with palm oil meant for domestic and international food markets, impacting already soaring prices and signalling the “end of cheap palm oil”.

India

India has quickly joined the ranks of major biofuel producers, due to high-level political support, policies and a diversity of feedstocks. In 2023, India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance as one of its key priorities of its G20 presidency.

Biofuel mandates are outlined in the country’s National Policy on Biofuels, first published in 2009 and subsequently amended in 2018 and 2022. In 2022, India achieved its 10% ethanol blending target ahead of schedule and is pursuing a 20% blending target by 2025, as well as a 5% biodiesel blending target by 2030.

India’s rapid biofuel push, however, has been criticised by food security experts as hunger levels rise, for its impact on endemic rainforests and, most recently, by vehicle owners for the impact of blended fuel on car engines.

Prof Raghuram says:

“From a sheer governance angle and sustainability angle, there are a lot of compromises being made to somehow push this whole thing. Even the land available in India is shrinking, as various reforms and dilution of environmental safeguards in the last 10 years have made it relatively easier to convert farm and forest land for non-agricultural purposes.”

China

China developed its first biofuel policies over 20 years ago and is one of the world’s biggest biofuel producers.

In 2017, China announced a new mandate expanding the use of fuel including bioethanol from 11 trial provinces to the entire country by 2020. However, Reuters and South China Morning Post reported that this was suspended in 2020. Only 15 provinces still maintain biofuel mandates, according to the US Department of Agriculture, which notes that a “lack of meaningful support for domestic biofuel consumption while aggressively promoting electric vehicles indicates a strategic choice to pursue transportation decarbonisation through electrification rather than liquid biofuels”.

At the same time, biofuel production in China grew by 30% in 2024, according to the Energy Institute’s Statistical Review.

While most of China’s biofuel production is grain-based, tax incentives for ethanol production have been gradually phased out and alternative biofuels have been incentivised, according to the IEA. China is currently piloting a scheme to increase biodiesel consumption at home, even as it exports biodiesel and used cooking oil to the EU and US.

How could climate change impact biofuel production?

Despite the well-documented impacts of climate change-induced extreme weather on land, agriculture and forests, there is currently little scientific literature examining how continued warming will impact global biofuel production.

One 2020 study found that bioethanol availability globally could drop – by 23% under a “very high emissions scenario” and by 4.3% under a “low emissions” scenario by 2060 – “if climate change risk is not adequately mitigated” and corn continues to be the dominant feedstock.

The study “encourages” changing out corn for switchgrass as a key source of bioethanol.

Another 2021 study examining the viability of China’s planned biofuel targets estimated that energy crop yields in China in the 2050s will decrease significantly compared to the 2010s, due to the impacts of climate change.

It found that climate change is expected to have a “substantial impact” on the land available for biofuel production in the 2050s, under both scenarios used in the study.

Gurgel, from MIT, tells Carbon Brief that it is “very hard to take into account how much climate change will damage bio-energy production” at this point, given the uncertainty of what emissions pathway the world will follow.

While most climate models “do a very good job” at forecasting average temperature change in the future, they do an “average job” at projecting rainfall change, or how many extreme weather events countries will see in the future, he says.

This is important because many biofuel crops, such as sugarcane and palm oil, are water-intensive and thrive in regions with abundant rainfall, but yields may fail in drier parts of the world that could see more drought.

Given this “cascade of uncertainties”, he continues, “we don’t have a clear picture of how bad the future [of agriculture] will be – we just know it will be more challenging than today”.

Delaney, meanwhile, asks whether investing in biofuels, which will be impacted by climate change, is a “good investment” for the long term. He tells Carbon Brief:

“I think these are the questions that we need to ask ourselves when we see – not just in India, but Indonesia, Brazil, everywhere around the world right now – this growing appetite for biofuels. Can we really keep the promises that we made at the end of the day?”",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/biofuels-hero-BM84M8.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:56:24.598559

The aviation industry faces mounting pressure to cut carbon emissions while maintaining safety, performance, and operational efficiency. Alternative aviation fuels have emerged as a key solution, but many existing options come with limitations—whether in blend ratios, energy density, or supply scalability.

Recent advances in fuel technology are shifting that narrative. New fuel formulations offer higher energy density, improved performance, and compatibility with current aircraft, enabling airlines to reduce emissions without sacrificing range or payload. These breakthroughs also support a more resilient and distributed production network, addressing critical supply chain challenges.

As the industry moves towards net-zero goals, the race is on to develop sustainable fuels that can be produced at scale, delivered reliably, and adopted seamlessly. Understanding these innovations is vital to grasp how aviation can balance growth with environmental responsibility in the coming decades.

The facility spans six acres and is intentionally designed as a scalable blueprint for future sites globally. It aims to produce 30,000 gallons of advanced fuels annually by early 2026, with engineering that supports expansion to a 100 million gallon commercial-scale facility. Mukund Karanjikar, CEO and founder of CleanJoule highlighted that “the key aspects are process integration and balance of plant, which once demonstrated, allow known scale-up engineering to take place.”

This approach differs from simply expanding one plant; instead, CleanJoule plans to replicate the CJ1 blueprint across multiple facilities worldwide. “Our goal is a globally-distributed, resilient fuel infrastructure network,” Karanjikar states. The repeatable manufacturing protocols and standardised operational procedures create a solid foundation for scaling without compromising quality or efficiency.

Crucially, this model addresses a persistent challenge in the alternative aviation fuel industry: securing enough supply to meet demand while maintaining consistent fuel quality. By enabling multiple plants in diverse geographies, CleanJoule’s strategy mitigates risks linked to supply chain disruptions and regional feedstock shortages.

Advanced fuel formulations

CleanJoule’s innovation isn’t just about scaling production—it’s also about redefining what sustainable aviation fuel can deliver in terms of performance. Their two formulations, CycloSAF and CycloRP, offer markedly different advantages over traditional SAF.

“CycloSAF is 10 percent more energy dense than typical Jet A or Jet A-1,” Karanjikar notes. “This translates into greater range, higher payload capacity, or improved fuel efficiency.” Unlike many alternative aviation fuels limited to 50 percent blending with conventional jet fuel, CycloSAF is designed to be a 100 percent drop-in replacement. “That means no engine modifications are needed, which makes adoption far easier for airlines,” he adds.

CycloRP, meanwhile, targets aerospace applications, particularly rocket propulsion. “It delivers over four percent improvement in energy density compared to conventional kerosene fuels used in liquid rockets,” Karanjikar says. “It also offers superior ultra-cold flow properties, which is critical for space missions.”

Both fuels are produced from abundant biomass, primarily waste agricultural materials, using CleanJoule’s proprietary manufacturing process. This feedstock flexibility and focus on waste not only reduce carbon emissions but also address concerns over land use and food competition that often accompany biofuel production.

“Our process has been successfully proven on 11 different feedstocks,” Karanjikar points out. “This flexibility allows scaling anywhere, tapping into existing agricultural supply chains without requiring new land dedication.” In the U.S., for example, declining ethanol demand frees up billions of bushels of corn, creating abundant feedstock for alternative aviation fuels production by 2030.

Certification, partnerships and readiness

Reaching market scale depends not only on production but also regulatory certification and partnerships. CleanJoule is nearing the end of the ASTM International D4054 qualification process, a key step for commercial approval.

“All required testing for a 10 percent blend of CycloSAF with Jet A has shown that it meets and even improves upon Jet A’s performance,” Karanjikar reports. “We expect qualification by the end of 2025, which will open the door for commercial use.” The CJ1 commissioning validated the facility’s readiness to produce these fuels at industrial scale, aligning technical and economic viability.

Moreover, CleanJoule has already secured significant offtake agreements. “Our airline investors have signed 90 million gallons of offtake from our next facility, CJ2, which is soon to be commissioned,” Karanjikar reveals.

Collaborations extend beyond commercial aviation, with CleanJoule recently powering a rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) using CycloRP in partnership with Venus Aerospace. “This test demonstrated the versatility of our fuels, proving they can power both conventional and advanced propulsion systems without compromising performance,” he explains. This opens opportunities in defence and spaceflight, broadening the impact of sustainable fuels.

Addressing the industry’s challenges

The broader aviation industry is grappling with tightening regulations and aggressive net-zero commitments. Yet many current alternative aviation fuels options face “blend walls” limiting their use to 50 percent blends and suffer from lower energy densities compared to fossil fuels.

CleanJoule aims to overcome these limitations. “Our fuels are designed not just to be cleaner but better-performing,” Karanjikar emphasises. “This allows airlines to meet climate goals without operational trade-offs.” The company’s distributed manufacturing also supports energy independence and supply chain resilience, vital considerations amid geopolitical and market volatility.

He adds, “We see advanced fuels as one of the most practical and immediate ways to reduce emissions across aerospace—from today’s commercial flights to future space missions.” By offering drop-in solutions that require no engine changes, CleanJoule is lowering barriers for industry-wide adoption.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CJ1-2-2-1080x810.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:56:31.502350

At the 2025 IFSA Global EXPO 2025, a panel tackled how airlines can better manage cabin waste in the near term. Titled The Green Shift: Advancing Environmental Stewardship Onboard, the session highlighted the need to link strong operations with a deep commitment to sustainability.

Moderated by Diana Cawley, CEO of the Aviation Sustainability Forum (ASF), the panel featured Tosin Durotoye, innovation strategist at Delta Air Lines; Matrix de Vries, food and product specialist at KLM; and Chris Kinsella, Chief Commercial Officer of gategroup North America. Together, they shared the belief that better data, more innovative product design, and closer collaborations will ultimately mean reaching sustainability goals will become part of daily catering practices.

ASF Outlines the Reason for Acting Now, Not Later

Diana Cawley opened the session with an important warning, explaining that aviation fleets and passenger numbers are on track to more than double by 2050. Without action, the industry’s share of global CO2 emissions could rise from 3 per cent to almost 20 per cent. “The great news is the sector’s growing,” she said. “But with that, the waste is growing.” She continued that while sustainable aviation fuel will help in the long term, the immediate challenge is cabin waste.

“Total sealed beverage waste is 406,000 tons. We are not doing anything with that at the moment.”

– Diana Cawley, ASF

ASF studies this issue through cabin waste audits, using an IATA-approved method that categorizes all items left on aircraft by type. The results show a clear pattern. “What that roughly gives us is about 63 per cent of the waste being beverage and food,” Cawley said. Other contributors include plastics, paper, glass, and aluminium.

Rising passenger numbers are exacerbating the problem. Between 2024 and 2025, ASF tracked an increase from 4.7 to 5.2 billion passengers, which resulted in a rise from 3.6 to 4.0 million tons of cabin waste. “It is growing and growing unless you do something about this,” she stated.

Cawley advised the aviation industry to focus on four key essentials: understanding different regional regulations, developing the ability to reduce and recycle waste, enhancing the quality of their waste data, and linking financial costs to waste and fuel consumption.

She then pointed to the sheer scale of the opportunity: Airlines deplane about 13 billion plastic bottles and nearly 5 million aluminium cans every year. Even unopened items add up. “Total sealed beverage waste is 406,000 tons,” she said. “We are not doing anything with that at the moment.” To address this, Cawley argued, airlines require better data, standardized protocols, and onboard training, along with technology that can consolidate scattered efforts into tangible progress.

“I was able to capture one million drawers coming into our kitchens. That volume of data allows you to make these really confident, data-driven decisions.”

A Shift from Downstream Recycling to Upstream Design

gategroup North America Chief Commercial Officer Chris Kinsella described the caterer’s constraints and opportunities. Policy fragmentation is a daily reality that slows progress. “There’s not a standard global policy around recycling,” he said. “In the North American market, you have varying policies, whether it is country to country, state to state, airport by airport.”

The company’s response begins with fundamentals and progresses with data. Baling cardboard, recovering cooking oil, capturing aluminium, and recycling pallets and shrink wrap remain essential. Composting pilots are running in Edmonton, with more sites targeted in the US.

The larger shift is design. “We need to shift as caterers from the downstream mentality to an upstream mentality,” Kinsella said. As such, gategroup now uses AI and visual insights in dish rooms to learn what is returned, what is consumed, and what goes missing. “Standard cabin waste reports” and a “waste consumption analysis report” now inform menu design and loading. “For the longest time, companies like ours did not have that metric,” he added.

From the airline side, KLM’s Matrix de Vries cited a regulatory breakthrough with immediate results. In 2024, the European Commission clarified the rules for Category 1 waste for inbound flights. “Any product that has not been in contact with food can actually recycle,” she said. That transformed inbound sorting in Amsterdam. “Out of the EU, the waste that comes in from our safety plus destinations, we can actually segregate some of that and send it to a recycling plant instead of sending it to landfill.”

Procurement also supports ethics and cost control when scaled with airline partners. On packaging, a gategroup sister company builds rotables with end-of-life recovery in mind. “Once they degrade, they are collected and then brought back to the factory, where they are ground. Those materials come back into play,” Kinsella said.

“In the North American market, you have varying policies, whether it is country to country, state to state, airport by airport.”

KLM Embraces Changing EU Regulations

The impact is tangible. On European flights alone, KLM collects about 80,000 kilograms of plastic wine bottles per year, a figure that rises on long-haul routes. The cost to enable it is modest. “I think the biggest investment that we had to do is training our crew in how to segregate it on the flight,” de Vries said.

The trick is teaching nuance. Crews must understand why inbound sorting to Amsterdam is permitted, while outbound sorting to the United States or other countries is not. Dutch crews have an advantage because sorting by material at home is second nature, but the airline still had to embed consistent procedures, she noted.

KLM’s cabin approach follows a simple mantra: reuse, reduce, recycle. The weight versus service balance is always present, de Vries acknowledged. Pull too much off the aircraft, and the customer may feel the cutback. Load too much and weight, fuel burn, and waste all rise.

The Case for Smart Loading

Delta Air Lines Innovation Strategist Tosin Durotoye argued that airlines cannot fix what they cannot see. “It is very hard to take action if you do not know what to focus on,” she said, highlighting that habit and the cultural urge to never run out can push ratios above real demand.

“You are in the kitchen, dumpster diving,” she said of Delta’s initial manual audits. However, scale arrived with the automation of the process. “I was able to capture one million drawers coming into our kitchens,” Durotoye said. The result was a clear view of preferences. “The volume of data allows you to make these really confident, data-driven decisions.”

That evidence paid off. “We have used technology at Delta Air Lines to save on millions of dollars,” she said, citing portion changes, product swaps, and smarter builds. Large sample sizes also win buy-in. “If I bring in the tech and I say, I looked at a million drawers, they are going to say, okay, tell us what you found.”

Pre-order helps, but it does not solve everything. Durotoye said that international routes benefit most from it, but that the concept of domestic upgrades introduce uncertainty that necessitates ongoing consumption analytics.

Delta reboards sealed beverages when permitted by the rules, while monitoring the fuel penalty associated with hauling unused weight.

“Out of the EU, the waste that comes in from our safety plus destinations, we can actually segregate some of that and send it to a recycling plant instead of sending it to landfill.”

Collaboration is Key to Cabin Waste Reduction Success

Throughout the discussion, collaboration kept surfacing as the essential part for the green shift towards less wasteful cabins. Cawley pointed to common standards that make life easier for everyone, even down to the colors of bags and labeling.

Kinsella asked airlines and caterers to meet upstream on the design choices that predetermine waste, and to use joint data to adjust menus. De Vries argued for international regulators to replicate the European clarity that unlocked meaningful recycling in Amsterdam. Durotoye pushed leaders to champion internal change agents who can introduce new tools and ways of working.

Audience questions reinforced the theme. Regarding composting, Kinsella confirmed the importance of active pilots and care in choosing the right facilities, as not all facilities accept the same inputs, including certain bioplastics. On ethical sourcing and cost, he encouraged airlines and caterers to leverage combined buying power and local procurement options, while still tailoring to each carrier’s brand and budget. “There is a tremendous amount of buying power,” one audience member observed, noting how other sectors have pooled demand to bring down costs for cage-free eggs.

Partnerships with technology providers are also maturing. A vendor who helped count Delta’s drawers asked how to maintain strong airline and caterer relationships. Kinsella asked for speed. “We are dipping our toes into a lot of work that was on a slide deck just about a year or two ago,” he concluded.",https://apex.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Green-shift.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:56:38.738398

Why CO2 Supply Could Tighten Again

Many regions in the U.S. could face similar disruptions in the coming years. The long-term outlook for the availability of beverage grade CO2 remains fragile. The recent North American CO2 SummitOpens in new window in Denver, Colorado, cited decreasing supply and increasing demand. Refinery closings in California and current plans to sequester CO2 from both ethanol production and natural well sources, such as the Jackson DomeOpens in new window, are examples of commercial sources of CO2 that are being removed from the market.

At the same time, there is a growing demand for commercial CO2 from emerging industries such as sustainable aviation fuel and dry ice applications. New sources of CO2, such as direct air capture, biogenic and fuel cell gas recovery are being explored, but converting to these new technologies will be a major challenge for suppliers.

Ammonia is one of the world’s ‘big four’ chemical products. It is the main feedstock for nitrogen-based fertilisers and it is also used in refrigeration, explosives, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Its production accounts for about 1.5% of total-energy related emissions and the vast majority is currently made by combining hydrogen with nitrogen in the Haber-Bosch process.

According to the International Energy Agency, ammonia is one of the most emissions-intensive commodities produced by heavy industry, nearly twice as emission intensive as crude steel production and four times as intensive as that of cement on a direct emissions basis,

To fully decarbonise its production, companies are also exploring green ammonia. However this comes with its own challenges including high production costs, infrastructure gaps, and a lack of economic incentives.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/shutterstock_2297911471.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 11:57:16.008273

Pune, Maharashtra, India – Business Wire India

Aemetis Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX) is advancing decarbonization at its 65 million gallon-per-year ethanol plant in Keyes, California, with a $30 million energy efficiency upgrade with integration of a Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) system. Praj Industries (NSE: PRAJIND, BSE: 522205) is supplying the advanced low-carbon solution and equipment that form the key components of this system. Project execution and implementation are being carried out by NPL Construction Co., a subsidiary of Centuri Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CTRI).

The Aemetis Advanced Fuels Keyes facility has been operating since 2011, utilizing Praj’s ethanol technology, and has consistently delivered reliable performance while contributing to California’s low-carbon fuel standard and U.S. energy security.

The project has received approximately $19.7 million in grants and tax credits from California Energy Commission, and Pacific Gas & Electric, and IRA 45Z tax credits.

Project completion is scheduled for Q2 2026, and once operational, the solution is projected to:

• Reduce natural gas usage at the Keyes plant by approximately 80%

• Generate an estimated $32 million of incremental annual cash flow from energy savings

• Deliver a double-digit reduction in the carbon intensity of the plant’s fuel ethanol, increasing LCFS credits

• Expand eligibility for transferable Section 45Z production tax credits

This investment marks a significant step forward in Aemetis’ decarbonization strategy, complementing its Dairy Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) program and recently approved CARB LCFS pathways.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Chairman of Praj Industries, said:

“Praj has been a trusted technology partner to Aemetis for more than a decade at this facility. The deployment of advanced low-carbon solution marks the next step in lowering the carbon intensity of ethanol while driving greater efficiency and profitability. Together with Aemetis and Centuri, we are enabling meaningful progress in the U.S. energy transition.”

Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis, said:

“This MVR project represents a high-return, high-impact upgrade to our California ethanol facility. By working with Centuri’s EPC team and Praj’s proven technology, we expect to materially improve operating margins, strengthen cash flow, and capture the benefits of Section 45Z tax credits while advancing our commitment to delivering lower-carbon renewable fuels.”

But without clear targets for each individual sector, sustainability-focused investors may instead send their money along paths with less resistance, meaning agriculture misses out.

Several nascent avenues of investment present themselves in Australia’s Agriculture and Land Sector Plan, which is one of six sector plans released in conjunction with the larger Net Zero Plan.

The Net Zero Plan was released to coincide with Australia’s updated commitment to the United Nations to reduce national emissions by 62-70 percent below 2005 levels by 2035.

The land sector plan includes a push to bolster carbon and biodiversity projects, developments which are already gaining traction under the management of investors like Cibus Capital and Silva Capital.

Such projects stand to gain further regulatory support through an Integrated Farm and Land Management method that allows for stacking of multiple carbon activities on one property, without the need to register multiple projects.

The government also expects its reformed Safeguard Mechanism – a policy requiring high-emitting facilities to reduce their net emissions by buying carbon credits – to drive more demand for carbon credits from private buyers.

Plantation forestry is also set for a boost with the government providing about A$74 million in grant funding for new long-rotation softwood and hardwood forests.

Finally, the government’s announcement of a A$1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels program to support domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels should mean savings on transport for canola producers who currently send most of their crops overseas for processing.

It should also lead to more demand for the crop – if Australia introduces a sustainable aviation fuel mandate to catalyze production.

While these initiatives may drive more investment into agriculture and land, and contribute a measure of emissions reduction across the sector, they lack the underpinning of an explicit target.

The sector plan states: “This plan is not setting an emissions reduction target, although many businesses and industry groups are setting their own emissions reduction goals.”

Instead, the plan presents a Treasury-modelled baseline scenario, which sees agriculture emissions fall by 28 percent from 2025 to 2050 even as agricultural production increases by 32 percent.

The model predicts carbon removals through land sequestration will increase by 126 percent over the same period.

According to the model, agriculture will have residual emissions of about 62Mt CO2-e in 2050, contributing about 37 percent of economy-wide emissions – up from 19.6 percent as of 2024.

The model posits that the increase in land sequestration will balance out those residual emissions.

In the absence of a target for emissions reduction, investors could look to the baseline scenario for a direction of travel. However, a target would serve better.

Just look at the electricity sector, which in 2022 received a target to reach 82 percent renewable generation by 2030. It has since benefited from policy like the Capacity Investment Scheme, which is rolling out 40GW worth of renewable generation and dispatch projects to deliver this target.

Private investors are piling in, as affiliate title Infrastructure Investor reports. Agriculture investors would benefit from similar calls to action. These could include targets for carbon sequestration, farm machinery running on clean energy, or reduced methane emissions from livestock by modifying diet, for example.

Of course, targets should be set in collaboration with the industry they are serving, to ensure support and traction for them. But by shying away from target-setting altogether, the government removes what could be a major catalyst for large-scale investment.",https://media.agriinvestor.com/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1326286821.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 00:56:12.607177

In an interview with Down To Earth (DTE)'s Puja Das, Chairman and Managing Director Ranjit Rath says the SAF project’s Detailed Project Report (DPR) is nearing completion, while the bamboo ethanol plant, powered by Finnish technology, will support the company’s petrol blending goals and expand its green chemicals value chain. Excerpts:

Puja Das (PD): Is OIL looking at producing sustainable aviation fuel?

Ranjit Rath (RR): It’s too premature for me to talk about it because it is still on the drawing board. Given the current government mandate, SAF blending is voluntary till 2030, at around five per cent. Being in the refining sector, and since we supply Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) to Northeastern airports, we understand that there is a need for SAF — ATF demand is growing about seven per cent year-on-year, evident from rising airport footfalls.

We are currently engaging with the Government of Odisha to set up an SAF facility in Paradip, based on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process. The plant is expected to consume around 200 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) of crude palm oil (CPO) or equivalent feedstock to produce about 150 ktpa of SAF. A DPR for the project is under preparation and is expected to be completed within a month.

PD: Why CPO?

RR: There are many pathways to produce SAF. The DPR will analyse economic feasibility — imported palm oil is one option; others are more expensive.

Palm oil is a readily traded product. However, demand influences prices greatly and long-term prediction is risky. OIL expects India will have commercial sustainable cultivation of palm oil and sourcing can be domestic in future.

The idea is to use imported palm oil from Malaysia or Indonesia as feedstock, which is why a coastal location like Paradip has been chosen. We already have a setup as part of the Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) expansion programme, with offices in Bhubaneswar and Paradip, along with a tank farm and a crude oil pipeline from Paradip to Numaligarh. Odisha also offers a strong market, and from there, the product can reach multiple locations. So, market access is not an issue.

Once the DPR is done, we’ll take a Final Investment Decision (FID) and then make a formal announcement.

PD: Are you considering any other feedstock to produce SAF and why?

RR: The Paradip plant will also be capable of processing feedstocks like palm oil mill effluent (POME), palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and used cooking oil (UCO) in whole or in blends of any corporation. UCO can be and will be used based on price advantage over other feedstocks and availability.

Different refiners have drawn up their own plans, and capacity additions will be guided by market demand. These will not be limited to the HEFA route, which uses vegetable oils or UCO as feedstock, but will also include alternative pathways that utilise captured CO2 and green hydrogen to produce olefins, followed by oligomerisation to generate synthetic hydrocarbons suitable for SAF production.

OIL/NRL is collaborating with Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) Dehradun to pursue alternate paths to produce SAF using captured CO2 and green hydrogen.

PD: How much will you be investing in it and what will be the duration?

RR: The investment order would be about Rs 2,000 crore. But it’s still too nascent at this point. Any plant typically takes about 2 to 2.5 years to commission, depending on execution.

PD: India’s SAF targets — one per cent by 2027, two per cent by 2028, and five per cent by 2030 — align with the ICAO’s goal of five per cent SAF use by 2030 under the CORSIA framework to cut aviation emissions. Has OIL set any internal SAF target?

RR: No, we don’t have an internal target. We will always be governed by the government’s target. Since it’s voluntary now, we’ll align accordingly.

PD: How will you navigate the price difference between ATF and SAF?

RR: Premium of SAF from that of conventional ATF hovers around $1300 per tonne. But in future, it may come down. In India, SAF is being sold at Rs 200 per litre compared to around 60 per litre of normal ATF (without taxes).

PD: About your ethanol projects, are you planning to upgrade to 3G or 4G?

RR: Not right now. We want to stabilise the 2G ethanol plant, which was inaugurated recently. The plant uses bamboo as feedstock — 500 TMT (thousand metric tonnes) of bamboo converts to 300 TMT of dry chips, producing 50 TMT of ethanol, 19 TMT of furfural, 11 TMT of acetic acid, and 30 TMT of liquid CO₂.

The furfural and acetic acid are green-certified, and we’ll explore export opportunities. The ethanol will be used for in-house blending, as NRL produces around 3 million tonnes of petrol annually, requiring 10 per cent ethanol blending. The liquid CO2 will be supplied to the food processing industry.

Downstream, we’re exploring API manufacturing, as acetic acid is a precursor. Furfural may also be used for pigments and resins, potentially leading to downstream units and exports.

PD: Why bamboo as a feedstock?

RR: After 2015, the government studied ways to reduce crude imports by 10 per cent. One avenue was ethanol blending. Initially, India focused on bagasse, rice straw, and molasses. But food-versus-fuel concerns arose.

A Finnish company, Chempolis, demonstrated a technology to produce ethanol from bamboo, which is rich in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Since Northeast India has abundant bamboo, OIL adopted it for its 2G ethanol project. Bamboo grows one metre per day, and OIL has distributed six million saplings locally to develop a sustainable ecosystem.

Currently, 3G ethanol (from refinery gases) is still under development — IOCL is working on it.

PD: Can bamboo ethanol be diverted to SAF production?

RR: Not now. The 2G ethanol (50 TMT) is dedicated for blending. SAF feedstock will be imported palm oil, at least for now.

PD: There are efficiency concerns with E20 fuel and beyond. What’s your view?

RR: The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has issued an official statement, which I endorse.

PD: A national policy on geothermal energy has been put out, with potential areas being Ladakh, Himachal, among others, which are eco-sensitive. As you venture into it, how will you ensure that drilling does not damage the environment?

RR: We’re exploring geothermal energy in Assam’s depleted fields — at 5,000 m depth, we expect 100°C heat gradients. A Pre-Feasibility Report (PFR) is done; a DPR is in progress.

We’ve identified 8-10 wells and are collaborating with the Government of Arunachal Pradesh to assess hot springs.

We’re focusing on the Northeast Himalayas to avoid disturbing eco-sensitive zones. Our drilling footprint is small — 120m x 120m — and existing wells reduce environmental impact.

PD: What is your investment plan for deep-water exploration?

RR: We’ve committed about Rs 3,000 crore for exploration, including Andaman & Nicobar, where a gas discovery was made. Additional wells are planned in the Kerala-Konkan basin (Rs 800 crore) and the KG basin (shallow water).

Under OLP-IX, OIL holds 40,000 sq. km in the Mahanadi and KG basins. We’ll acquire 5,000 sq. km each of 2D and 3D seismic data, costing around Rs 1,000 crore. Each deep water well will cost Rs 1,000-1,200 crore.

PD: In critical minerals, are you exploring acquisition of lithium or rare earth minerals blocks abroad?

RR: Under the National Critical Mineral Mission, OIL has acquired a graphite-vanadium block near Itanagar (Arunachal Pradesh) and a potash block near Anumangad. Exploration has begun; total initial investment is Rs 100 crore. After DPR completion, mining may proceed with Hindustan Copper Ltd, our partner.

We’re also exploring lithium acquisitions overseas — Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Australia — and collaborating with India Rare Earths Ltd on rare earths. Domestically, we’ll consolidate in graphite, vanadium, and potash, which serve EV batteries and fertiliser needs.

PD: OIL aims 5 GW by 2040 from 188 MW renewable capacity now. Given the poor transmission infrastructure causing curtailment issues in states like Rajasthan, how do you plan to achieve this?

RR: We currently have 188 MW renewable capacity (14 MW solar, rest wind). Through OIL India Green Energy Ltd, we aim for 5 GW by 2040, requiring Rs 20,000 crore. We’ve signed MoUs with RVUNL (Rajasthan) for 1,000 MW solar and 200 MW wind, and with Assam for 25 MW (expandable to 640 MW).

In Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, we’re partnering with state utilities rather than operating directly — we’ll act as investors, not operators. So, we have nothing to worry about.

PD: Combining all segments — SAF, biofuels, renewables, CBG, green hydrogen, exploration, geothermal, and critical minerals, how much does OIL plan to invest by 2040?",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-10-07%2Fhez7y6ru%2FRanjit.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-08 00:56:18.026548

Bioenergy Australia chief executive officer and founder of the LCFAANZ and RGA, Shahana McKenzie, said the launch of the National Feedstock Strategy “marks a game-changing moment” for the sector.

“By unlocking the nation’s abundant feedstock resources, this strategy will create a clear pathway for homegrown low-carbon fuels to deliver thousands of regional jobs, strengthen energy security, and generate over $10 billion annually,” Ms McKenzie said.

“With our vast agricultural and industrial base, CSIRO reports that by 2025 Australia will have enough feedstock to replace 60 percent of local jet fuel with SAF, growing to 90pc by 2050.

“The LCFAANZ and RGA look forward to working with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on the deployment of this strategy, and advancing a collaborative, cross-sector effort for Australia’s feedstock future.”

The new strategy is backed by significant new investment, including $1.1 billion to help unlock the vast economic opportunities on offer from low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF).

The new 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program is expected to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of LCLF, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

Submissions on the discussion paper can be made until 7 November 2025.

This measure was in line with the strategy adopted in 2023 by the member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), including the reduction of emissions from ships.
Since January 2025, our company EFEN Marine Brazil, based at the giant Port of Açu, and the global mega-transport company Wilson Sons have been jointly testing the use of the new HVO as a clean marine carrier.
After the testing phase, the expectation is that commercialization for use in OSVs (Offshore Supply Vessels = tugboats) will be possible in the short term.","1) SUMMARY –

In this short diagnosis (05 pages), I demonstrate with many RECENT data how the oils derived from our ancient palm tree “Macauba” – already considered much more productive and more recuperative than the Palm – plus other crops, including soybeans, canola, jatropha, etc. plus some animal fats plus frying oils and even sewage sludge can greatly move and depollute the World, when transformed into SAF (“Sustainable Aviation Fuel”, which pollutes 70.0% with less Co2 than kerosene) for use/high air environmental cleaning until pure, with 100% single use (projects in progress by ACELEN Renewables/MUBADALA of Camaçari Port City - BA plus by EMBRAPA in Montes Claros - MG); and more recently, HVO (""Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil"") in MAJOR MARINE FUEL CLEAN-UP projects, now by ACELEN, EMBRAPA, EFEN/BP Marine, Porto do Açu, and Wilson Sons. This new marine fuel can replace the current highly polluting bunker oil by up to 80%. Better yet, these two biofuels will be ""drop-in,"" meaning vehicles, aircraft, vessels, etc., will not require any engine engineering adjustments to use them. Furthermore, they can reduce marine Co2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fuels. The biggest challenges facing both companies worldwide aren't related to their agricultural and similar production, but to their refining processes (the previous global approach, Bayer, is still extremely expensive and inefficient). However, PETROBRAS, ACELEN, and others already have much more efficient technologies, based on their extensive experience refining biodiesel from soybeans and other oils, and even producing blonde glycerin. According to the UN, an additional 12 million hectares of land are degraded worldwide each year, and something needs to be done immediately to reduce, halt, or neutralize this. Our Macauba palm/coconut tree above - native and fully adapted to the cerrado and semi-arid regions, even in swampy and arid/dry areas - can already produce up to 7 times more oil per hectare/year than soybeans (in processing/crushing, Macauba bran remains with 15%-25% CP - Crude Protein for animal feed, according to EMBRAPA) and this from the 4th year and for another 20 to 50 years, if well maintained. So, in addition to moving the world and cleaning/sustaining the world's highly polluting fuels, our intensive and highly technical cultivation of Macauba will also allow us to recover – in isolated crops or especially if intercropped – initially up to 1.0 million hectares of already well-degraded pastures in Brazil, much more of which are from Family Farming (the ""VALORIZA"" program) in northern Minas Gerais and Bahia, out of the 160.0 million hectares of already degraded pastures in Brazil, which occupy almost half of the country's rural establishments, according to EMBRAPA and UFG/LAPIG (for this Agency, there are already 111.0 million hectares of pastures with over 40.0% degradation, equal to 60.0% of the total 177.0 million hectares of total pastures in the country). Furthermore, there are between 86.0 and 134.0 million hectares in our semi-arid giant and also to recover economically and, above all, socio-environmentally, and all, if possible/well encouraged, through plantings – isolated or intercropped – of many more Macaúbas for oil, direct grasses pastures and/or for protein banks. The ideal is to cultivate such cloned Macauba in a space of 10.0 m x 10.0 m, intercropping with well-fenced pastures grasses better adapted for small animals (such as with andropogon, bufell, capiaçu, millet, etc.) and/or with annual forage palm in double rows and/or with the new semi-arboreal legume ""Gliricidia"", also improved at EMBRAPA and originating from Mexico, this one fully resistant to droughts, even tall like Macauba (up to 15 meters), but fully nitrifying/recovering soils (as a very fast legume), whether for very well-controlled direct grazing and/or living fences and/or protein banks with 18.0% to 24.0% CP (as in the current leucenas) and this already 6 months after planting and very well intercropped with our Macauba for oils.

2) MY SHORT STRATEGIC SUSTAINABLE AND REALLY CLEAN NEW FUELS WORLD ARTICLE (05 pages)

First, I apologize your to the purists for using the term nautical (which is more used to refer to vessels operated by sailors = ""nautics,"" that is, all of them), rather than the term ""maritime"" or even ""naval"" (both even for me it’s more erroneous, as they do not clearly include the - quite distinct, but also highly polluting—inland waterway transport and similar transport on rivers, dams, lakes, etc.).

Really, over the past year, I have researched, written, and published here—almost for the first time—three articles with a large audience in Portuguese and English about the global revolution brought about by the Arabs of the MUBADALA group, with research, improvements, and even the beginning of refining tests of Macauba palm oil at the ACELEN refinery in Mataripe City, near Salvador Capital, Brazil. This was for the production of “Sustainable Aviation Fuel,” initially in addition to kerosene and even pure in the future. This was a true masterstroke, and in addition to greatly cleaning up the global aviation system, it will also greatly recover millions of hectares of already degraded land, both pastureland and the Brazilian semiarid region. This has been going on since the beginning of production of each palm tree at four years of age, followed by cultivation and harvesting for 20 to 50 years. IN TOTAL, MY ARTICLES ABOUT THIS HAVE ALREADY ADDED AN incredible 17,000 page views/year worldwide and worldwide. Brazil.

Immediately after ACELEN's/EMBRAPA BRAZIL above initiative, other large Brazilian/world companies (BASF, Vibra, INOCAS, KLM) also initiated or announced their projects, some even involving the production of cosmetics using this oil. Also, our giant oil company, PETROBRAS, has also begun conducting refinement tests, leveraging its extensive experience with our biodiesel high sustainable refining world example and/or the production of blond glycerin and other components.

The oil produced/refined from the Brazil Macauba coconut palm tree can be used to produce marine green diesel and/or HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) and/or sustainable aviation kerosene (mixed) with its SAF 100% pure oil in future too (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Acelen intends to produce both with an eye on the international market, where they are already approved for sale and consumption. The refinery expects to produce 20,000 barrels/day of vegetable oil (especially from Macauba) within 10 years, equivalent to approximately 1.0 billion liters per year, equivalent to the annual supply of 1.1 million vehicles.

The INOCAS high world company also presented a timeline for implementing the first fully integrated industrial unit, from plant cultivation to the annual delivery of another 1.0 billion liters of HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) all for HVO green diesel and/or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

For the giant world Honeywell, our agricultural potential guarantees competitiveness and consolidates the country as a global player in biorefining by 2025.

Also, recently, the Chinese government announced that it will invest an initial Us $1.0 billion in SAF production in Brazil. See details at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FP7lfo8ATM

This is excellent news recovery until fast and our millions of hectares of already degraded pastures all by by cultivation of our Brazilian Macaúba coconut tree for world sustainable cleaned oils (also called macaíba tree, bocaiuva coconut, coco-babão, coco-espinho). The Macauba is a native crop of the Brazilian Cerrados (savannas more of center-west region = about 23,0% of Brazil total lands same as 2.1 million hectares all with high agriculture potential) and our semi-arid northeast regions (also with 12,0% of Brazil total lands same as 1.03 million hectares). It is capable of producing up to 7 times more oil per hectare/year than soybeans, especially in reforest development projects and even at up 40% degraded pasture areas (recuperated), as in the initial project for an initial 100,000 hectares of Macaúba already being implemented in the Montes Claros region - MG by the Arab group MUBADALA/Acelen plus local rural producers plus EMBRAPA Brazil agri fuel research Company. The Macaúba can also be grown in old areas with other forestry crops, such as eucalyptus, this questionable/not sustainable and until named to be converted from “green deserts,” as the BBC recently called them. Read at https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/articles/cxeev8l3mpko (SEE MORE ABOUT BELOW).

Another ACELEN/EMBRAPA planes are already underway to replicate the Macaúba cultivation module for 200,000 hectares and then for 1.0 million hectares. In the first phase, 90,000 direct and indirect jobs will be created. At least 20,0% of the crop will come from family farming, potentially generating income of up to R$ 130,000 per year (Us$ 25,000/year current currency) on a 10-hectare property, which currently has little or no economic viability (degraded, unproductive, or arid areas).

In the 10.0 m x 5.0 m spacing at EMBRAPA Research Station Montes Claros, the Macaúba produces 2,500 liters of oil to manufacture aeronautical SAF (compared to 0.7 thousand liters of soybeans) and allows raising calves and sheep at low levels. Also, according to EMBRAPA, after removing/distilling the Macauba oil (new industrial process Brazilian only), large volumes of macauba meal remain a meal with 15%-25% CP Crude Protein for the production of poultry, swine, pet, fish feed, etc. AND ALL THIS WITH A POSSIBLE LIFE OF 20 TO 50 YEARS AND LOW FERTILIZER MORE RAIN CONSUMPTIONS. This is a Palm Tree with very deep stands/roots and is already fully adapted to the few normal droughts (between harvests) of our Cerrados/savannas (up to 5 months) and even the long droughts (up to 8 months/year) of our caatingas in the northeast region (semiarid).

""When completed, ACELEN's new biorefinery – alongside the current oil refinery – will be in the top quartile of the world's largest bio refineries. And if we factor all projects into its cost curve, this project will be one of the most competitive in the world in terms of the production cost of 1 liter of SAF,"" according to ACELEN. ""And we will build 100,0% of it on degraded pastures, due to the capture of carbon credits in these areas (i.e., more resources and more profits). We are creating true bioenergy forests.""

Recently, the same group of ACELEN FUEL RENEWABLES (United Arab Emirates + Giant oil MUBADALA Refinery in Mataripe - BA) joined with EMBRAPA in a research station and giant production of Macaúba seedlings in Montes Claros City - MG, where it will invest, initially, US $ 3.0 billion to recover 100 thousand hectares of degraded pastures (with plans to reach 1.0 million hectares in several areas of States closer to its Refinery) and with Macaúba crops (with this, possibly being up to 3 times more profitable and 4 times more sustainable than with eucalyptus and up to 5 times more than with pine, considering all the socio-environmental and temporal benefits/costs to recover the already much denounced devastation of such eucalyptus/pine crops by the BBC World Network that nicknamed them in Brazil as “Green Deserts” - see more data in Portuguese at: https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/articles/cxeev8l3mpko ). In the world, many renowned scientists and naturalists have even condemned the cultivation of eucalyptus, pine and even rubber trees (for rubber production) because in the production of eucalyptus, pine, etc., where approximately 60%-75% of the paper and cardboard produced from their cellulose is burned within 6 months, thus re-releasing all the carbon collected. Also, they says that between 5%-10.0% of the paper/cardboard produced, worse, is added to water and food waste and becomes a “swab”, highly clogging pipes, tubes, septic tanks, drains and sewers and which many criticize as, environmentally, much more reprehensible than such burning (see Wikipedia), as it takes up to 20 years to melt/process. Furthermore, many harmful chemicals are used in their pulp processing.

For the same BBC Brazil, our Macauba is “The palm tree that emerges as Brazil's new 'Green Gold'” - See in Portuguese: https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-39788968 .

Ultimately, all refinery results will be exported in the form of the still rare SAF – “Sustainable Aviation Fuel,” already a requirement for many companies and countries, especially European ones, and to replace up to 100,0% of the current highly polluting aviation kerosene and/or super marine biodiesel, which still has a nascent demand but also expects enormous future demand. See more information in Portuguese at: https://investnews.com.br/negocios/sem-solucao-para-embate-com-petrobras-mataripe-mantem-investimento-bilionario-e-futuro-em-aberto/.

In February 2025, the ACELEN also announced the first continuous-flow extraction of macaúba oil on an industrial scale at Acelen Agripark, the company's agro-industrial technological innovation center under construction in the city of Montes Claros, in Minas Gerais. According to the company, the Macauba plant has high energy potential, being up to 10 times more productive per hectare planted compared to soybeans. Although not yet fully domesticated, Macauba already outperforms in average productivity and yields per hectare. According to INOCAS (Innovative Oil and Carbon Solutions), Macauba produces 7 to 8 times more oil per hectare/year than soybeans, for example.

The current global techs challenge difficulty is how to refine much more oil in the low-cost; i.e.; how to get highly efficient refining of Macauba oil? not in its production. After ACELEN and/or PETROBRAS, among others, completely dominate and dramatically reduce the cost of the entire extraction and refining technology (the current Bayer-type global refining system is still inefficient and very expensive), Brazil will also become the ""world champion"" in this area of ??truly sustainable biofuels, especially since Macauba's production, whether isolated or combined, is already well-developed. They are adapting an already well-developed Brazilian system for processing/refining soybeans and animal fats to produce biodiesel and blonde glycerin, which is more efficient and much cheaper. The best part is that these technologically advanced crops and the correct processing of Macauba, as well as other consortium proposals, do not release carbon back into the atmosphere in the form of reincorporation of such SAF and the new HVO (maritime biodiesel).

The biofuels produced by the ACELEN will be drop-in, meaning vehicles will not require any engine engineering adjustments to use them. Furthermore, they can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fuels.

The expectation is the ACELEN to reach 1.0 billion liters of renewable fuel per year from 2028, including green biodiesel HVO and sustainable aviation fuel SAF, generating up to 85 thousand initial jobs in the production chain and only in those locations.

In addition to the new HVO and SAF biodiesel, their derivatives have applications in cosmetics, food, and feed, benefiting rural economies and their sustainable agroforestry systems.

According to the UN, approximately 12 million hectares of land are lost each year worldwide, and this is land where 20 million tons of grain could have been grown. In Brazil, in 2018, the total area of ??degraded pastures (with all types and stages of degradation) was estimated by EMBRAPA at approximately 160 million hectares, occupying almost half of the country's rural properties.

In 2023, the global market for Macauba oil was estimated at Us$ 101.6 billion and growing at around 13.7% per year, potentially reaching Us$ 366.4 billion by 2033, driven by massive demand in Asia and the Pacific. See in English at: https://www.sphericalinsights.com/reports/macauba-oil-market .

In Brazil alone, this new production chain could generate nearly Rs$ 90 billion annually (around Us$ 15.7 billion/year).

In the United Kingdom, since January 2025, setting a strong global example, new aeronautical SAF really sustainable/cleaner fuel - so obtained from soybean oil and even leftover cooking oil - has been mandatory and aims to REVOLUTIONIZE FLIGHTS, with the goal of achieving zero air carbon emissions by 2050. Initially, the Department for Transport mandated that SAF constitute at least 2.0% of all aviation fuel for flights departing there, increasing annually to 10.0% per year by 2030 and 22.0% per year by 2040. These are ambitious goals, but, according to the British Government, achievable, and should result in approximately 1.2 million tons of SAF being supplied annually for the UK airline industry by 2030, enough to circle the world 3,000 times. SAF – coming much more than from Macauba oil – is also made from another sustainable sources, such as household waste or used cooking oil, and all produces on average 70.0% fewer carbon emissions than traditional fossil-based aviation fuel (typically kerosene).

From this moment forward, global aviation will have a greener and more sustainable way of traveling, representing a significant milestone for the UK SAF industry. The SAF is a critical component of all aeronautic industry's plan to achieve net-zero emissions, representing nearly 40.0% of the carbon reduction that will make net-zero emissions a reality by 2050.

In the cultivated spacing of 10.0 m x 5.0 m at EMBRAPA Montes Claros City above, Macauba produces 2,500 liters of oil to manufacture aeronautical SAF (compared to 0.7 thousand from soybeans) and allows for raising calves and sheep below. Also, according to the same EMBRAPA, after removing the oil, as described above, large volumes of Macaúba meal remain, with 15%-25% of PD to feed poultry, swine, pet, and fish feed. All of this, with Macauba having a useful life of 20 to 50 years if well cared for and with LOW FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION, always remembering that it is a palm native to the cerrados (our savannas), rustic and very well adapted and with very deep roots and not a grass/grass/corn and/or a legume of any size, even like soybeans/canola, etc., the latter being large consumers of fertilizers and water.

SOME STRATEGICS AND COMPARATIVES INFORMATION’S MORE ANALYSES OF THE USES OF THE IMMENSE DAILY COSTS MORE THE EFFICIENCIES AND OVER THE CURRENT IMMENSE POLLUTIONS OF THE WORLD ATMOSPHERIC AND WATTERS BY HUNDREDS OF TYPES AERO MORE NAUTICAL VEHICLES, ADDED (SPECIALLY OF THE SEAS, RIVERS, DAMS AND LAKES BY SHIPS, BOATS ETC.) -

Now, let's analyze a little about the extremely high pollution and attempts for possible cleanups of the World Nautical transport chain (maritime, river and lake), now including the future uses of Macauba oil for the production of new HVO nautical biodiesel, since I have already written and published here 03 other articles about the production and uses of aeronautical SAF.

In 2022, of the total global emissions of these harmful, and still growing, GHGs (Greenhouse Gases), 80.6% were carbon dioxide (Co2), plus 12.1% methane (Ch4)—much more harmful to the environment than Co2—plus 5.3% nitrous oxide (N2o), the infamous laughing gas, plus 2.0% fluorinated gases. Methane is the worst of all, as it is about 80 times more potent a pollutant than carbon dioxide (Co2) over a 20-year period. In Brazil, on the other hand, most land/metropolitan transportation has not yet used so-called S-500 diesel, which is highly polluting to the atmosphere (especially with the terrible sulfuric gases So2 and So3 from acid rain, which combine with nitric gases). However, the new D-50 diesel fuel, enriched with biodiesel, is already significantly expanding its use.

Market current concern is even greater due to the new regulations in effect for metropolitan diesel fuel. An agreement reached last year mandates the sale of an even cleaner metropolitan diesel fuel in some areas of the country. This is S-50, which contains only 50 parts per million of sulfur. In the rest of Brazil, the metropolitan diesel sold is S-500, with 500 parts per million of sulfur. ""Inland diesel, like marine diesel, has a much higher level of pollution: 2,000 parts sulfur per million. The regulation mandating the sale of cleaner diesel will cause a further price shift and further encourage fraud in regions where S-50 has become mandatory, according to those representing dealers.""

Since early May 2009, the S-50 oil was the only fuel available at gas stations in the Recife Capital, Fortaleza Capital, and Belém Capital regions. Previously, it was used only by buses in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. According to a schedule approved by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF), the S-50 was to arrive in the Curitiba Capital bus fleet in August, and in January 2010, it will fuel buses in Porto Alegre Capital, Belo Horizonte Capital, Salvador Capital, and cities in the São Paulo Metropolitan Region.

We all know that Ships are the eighth-largest source of Co2 emissions in the world, accounting for approximately 3.0% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted into the global atmosphere. Ships emit greenhouse gases and sulfur and nitrous oxides, contributing to air, water, and noise pollution.

It is estimated that the global commercial shipping fleet already emits approximately 940 million tons of CO2 annually.

In recent years, maritime transport has established itself as the backbone of global trade, responsible for moving approximately 90% of the planet's goods. These ships can measure over 400 meters in length and have the capacity to carry more than 20,000 TEUs (standard 27-ton containers) of clothing, electronics, food, cars etc. or 500,000 tons of crude oil, or at least 200,000 tons of grain, or large cargoes of iron ore, fertilizers, coal, and chemicals. To maintain their constant operation, 14-cylinder engines, with over 100,000 horsepower, operate 24 hours a day.

This continuous operation requires the consumption of large quantities of ""bunker oil,"" a thick, high-energy marine fuel. The consumption figure of 300,000 liters per day refers to the operation of each giant ship at cruising speed—approximately 22 knots (40 km/h).

When you hear that a ship consumes 300,000 liters of fuel per day, your immediate reaction might be shock. But when you delve into the data and the logic of global transportation, it becomes clear that, even with this high consumption, large cargo ships and supertankers are, in fact, more efficient than airplanes in terms of fuel consumption per ton transported.

Thus, while a Boeing 747 aircraft consumes approximately 13,000 liters of kerosene per hour, carrying a maximum of 140 tons of cargo, a large ship consumes 300,000 liters per day (approximately 12,000 liters per hour in 24 hours possible operations), but carries 200,000 tons or more of cargo. Thus, comparatively, ships are much more efficient, but also much slower and much more polluting to the air and waters they navigate. A large cruise ship can consume up to 304,593 liters of fuel per day, according to an analysis by the University of Colorado at Boulder in the United States. The average Co2 emission per passenger on a cruise around Seattle, in the United States, is 8 times greater than that of 1 tourist who spends their vacation in the same city, on land, according to analysis by the NGO “Friends of the Earth”.

Others argue that even the most efficient cruise ships emit more CO2 per passenger/kilometer than a commercial jet, according to an analysis by the American NGO International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). And the Co2 that warms the planet's atmosphere isn't the only problem caused by cruises, as they say. The 218 cruise ships operating in Europe in 2022 emitted more sulfur oxides (Sox) than 1.0 billion automobiles—4.4 times more than all the cars on the continent. Sox can harm trees, reducing their growth. It also contributes to acid rain, which can disrupt sensitive ecosystems. And exposure to the pollutant can also affect the human respiratory system, causing breathing problems.

Waste is another major problem. In 2019, cruise ships bound for or originating in Alaska discharged more than 31 billion liters of toxic waste onto Canada's western coast.

Now, learn more about the ship that consumes 300,000 liters of fuel per day - and is still more efficient than an airplane—at: https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/conheca-o-navio-que-consome-300-mil-litros-de-combustivel-por-dia-e-mesmo-assim-e-mais-eficiente-que-o-aviao-vml97/ . Designed to cross oceans carrying up to 20,000 containers, this Triple-E-class maritime giant represents the pinnacle of modern naval engineering and global logistics.

In terms of costs in 2023, one ton of bunker oil—the most widely used marine fuel oil today, even though it is highly polluting—was sold for Us$ 1,200 (around Us$ 200/ton). Thus, just one large ship consumes the equivalent of Us$ 370,000 per day (around Us$ 68.000/day). In other words, a giant ship carrying 350,000 tons of iron ore (equivalent in cargo to the Triple-E above), traveling from our superport of Tubarão City, Espírito Santo, to the Mineral Port of Qingdao, China, pays only about US$ 7.5 million (around Us$ 1.45 million) for its approximately 20-day maximum one-way journey (i.e., costs are still very low, considering its benefits).

In Brazil, in December 2023, the average price of vehicle diesel was R$ 5.95 per liter (around Us$ 1.15/liter), while S-10 diesel (marine biodiesel) had an average price of R$ 6.05 per liter (around Us$ 1.16/liter). Considering the mandatory blend of 86.0% diesel type A and 14.0% biodiesel for diesel type B sold at gas stations, PETROBRAS's refining share of the consumer price will be R$ 2.81/liter (around Us$ 0.50/liter), a reduction of R$ 0.14 for each liter of diesel type B.

Comparatively, the estimated production cost of the new HVO marine biodiesel with Macauba oil is very low, averaging just R$ 1.16/liter across all Macauba plants (around Us$ 0.18/liter), dropping to R$ 1.10/liter for plants with the most fruit.

B) ABOUT THE CURRENT HIGH AND COMPARATIVES STRATEGICS PROPOSALS AND ACTIONS FOR REDUCING/MITIGATING HIGH NAUTICAL POLLUTIONS ADDED –

Since 2020, the world Nautic (marine) cruise lines have begun taking steps to improve their sustainability. They are adopting energy-efficient engines and appliances, such as using port power while at dock and/or implementing recycling systems and/or reducing single-use plastic consumption onboard, for example.

Many Nautic (marine) cruise lines have begun using LNG to power their ships, according to them, because they promote the fuel as a cleaner, large-scale alternative to polluting marine diesel. Even with the release of methane, LNG's greenhouse gas footprint is better than that of marine fuel oil.

Between 2023 to 2028, 60% of new Nautic ships scheduled for launch will use LNG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas, the same as cooking gas) for their primary propulsion, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. LNG-powered ships, they say, emit about 25% less Co2 than those powered by conventional marine fuels (mostly bunker oil), but activists say they have an additional damaging impact on the climate, releasing methane into the atmosphere—a gas about 80 times more potent and harmful than carbon dioxide (Co2) over a 20-year period.

Across the industry, in addition to LNG, some shipping companies are now also investing in hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia as the fuels of the future for maritime shipping. For example, Container giant Maersk, for example, is banking on methanol to achieve its goal of zero emissions by 2040.

Across the industry, in addition to LNG, some shipping companies are now also investing in hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia as the fuels of the future for maritime shipping. Container shipping giant Maersk, for example, is banking on methanol to achieve its goal of zero emissions by 2040.

Thus, green methanol can be a low-carbon fuel when produced with sustainable biomass or using renewable electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen and combine them with Co2 to form methanol. However, some argue that green methanol is not the right fuel for decarbonizing shipping, as its production is energy-intensive and still results in Co2 emissions.

Methanol can even be a low-carbon fuel when produced with sustainable biomass or using large volumes of renewable electricity to split water into oxygen and hydrogen and combine them with Co2, forming methanol. In other words, all of this occurs with extremely high electricity consumption from water that is 99.5% pure—direct or even recycled, not from the sea—as in the disastrous production of the dreamed-of Brazilian Green H2, which lacks any global competitiveness, either in terms of price or in inefficient volumes.

Methanol can reduce Co2 emissions by up to 95.0% and nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 80.0%, according to the industry organization, the Methanol Institute. However, in practice, many scientists argue that green methanol is not the right fuel for decarbonizing Nautic shipping, as its production is energy-intensive and still results in Co2 emissions.

Another Nautic ship alternative is green ammonia, produced by the electrolysis of water with renewable electricity (i.e., it also suffers from the same problems as methanol production and/or the harmful Brazilian Green H2). The green methanol production process is complex. Co2 must be captured from the atmosphere using technology that is still emerging, expensive, and unproven for large-scale use.

FEW OF THEM ARE STILL FULLY AWARE OF MACAUBA OIL, which is used to produce SAF (see above), a new, sustainable biofuel that is much more thoroughly tested and even more widely used to thoroughly clean jet fuel. In the future, it could be used in a 100% pure, kerosene-free form, as already described.

C) SOME STRATEGICS INFORMATION’S MORE ANALYSES OF THE EXPECTED MOTOR AND NAUTICAL DEPOLLUTION’S EFFECTS WITH VERY SUSTAINABLE/RENEWABLE OILS ORIGINATING FROM THE BRAZILIAN MACAUBA PALM TREE –

With the advancement of green technologies, the nautical sector is also reinventing itself, and what was once a symbol of consumption and pollution can now become a benchmark for innovation and environmental efficiency.

The era of smart and sustainable mega-ships has already begun, and the engine that consumes 300,000 liters per day may just be the last gasp of an era that is fading.

Initiating the Brazil example more process of cleaning and converting nautical bunker fuel, only recently, in June 2024, the ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels) granted Petrobras' request and authorized the sale of improved/cleaned marine fuel (bunker fuel) with biodiesel. In tests, this marine fuel (sea and/or river), still with 24.0% biodiesel, has already emitted 19.0% less greenhouse gases. This was the Agency's first authorization for the continued sale of bunker fuel, now with renewable content.

Between September 2022 to January 2024, Petrobras, authorized by the National Petroleum Agency (ANP), conducted tests on ships using bunker fuel with biodiesel added, varying from 10.0% to 24.0%. The results showed no problems with the operation of the ships' engines and other operational systems, and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions occurred.

This measure was in line with the strategy adopted in 2023 by the member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), including the reduction of emissions from ships. The goal is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport by 2050. In this regard, the International Organization for Standardization, in its most recent edition, published in May, of its ISO 8217 standard, ""Products from petroleum, synthetic and renewable – Fuels (class F) – Specifications of Marine Fuels,"" allows the use of up to 100.0% biodiesel in shipping.

The IMO's initial global goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport by 50% by 2050 and achieve zero emissions by the end of the century. To achieve this, investment in new technologies will be essential. Even if the aforementioned ship, which consumes 300,000 liters of fuel per day, continues to operate for a few more decades, it will gradually be replaced by cleaner, smarter models integrated with alternative fuels.

For them, the future of global transportation lies at sea, but now with a compass pointed toward sustainability.

Also, in January 2025, the Vibra Energia Brazil (formerly BR Distribuidora Petrobras) announced that it will sell marine diesel with up to 30.0% biodiesel to Svitzer between January 2025 and December 2026. The estimated consumption is 230 m³/month. The Svitzer will use the fuel in its own fleet of port support tugboats in Santos Port, São Paulo. Initially, the biodiesel content will be 2.0%, with a gradual increase based on vessel performance monitoring results.

But in 2025, the big news on the market and in the field of marine fuel cleaning is the new ""HVO,"" which - for many - is much more than a biofuel and can be produced with Macauba oil, as already described.

See more information in Portuguese at: https://www.gov.br/anp/pt-br/canais_atendimento/imprensa/noticias-comunicados/anp-autoriza-comercializacao-de-combustivel-maritimo-com-biodiesel .

The newly developed HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil), also known as green diesel or renewable diesel, is a type of fuel produced from vegetable oils and animal fats. It can be produced with vegetable oils (macauba, soybean, canola, jatropha, etc.); with animal fats, such as beef tallow and trimmings, pork lard and CMS, etc.; with used frying oil, and even with sewage sludge.

Thus, the production process involves the hydrogenation of these raw materials, generating a high-quality fuel. Unlike biodiesel, HVO is a pure hydrocarbon, with no oxygen in its molecule. This makes it very similar to fossil diesel, but with a much lower environmental impact. Furthermore, HVO is more of a ""drop-in"" solution, meaning it is compatible with conventional diesel engines, thus requiring no modifications to existing equipment. This makes HVO an affordable and practical option, as it doesn't require financial investment or time to adjust for immediate consumption.

In July 2024, a technical meeting involving scientific leaders from Acelen Renewables ??and EMBRAPA launched a project to develop the technology of the Macaúba palm tree for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green diesel (HVO), thermal energy, and other high-value-added byproducts. See more information in Portuguese and english at: https://www.embrapa.br/busca-de-noticias/-/noticia/90610252/embrapa-and-acelen-renewables-start-macaw-palm-domestication-for-aviation-fuel-and-bioproducts .

Since January 2025, our company EFEN Marine Brazil, based at the giant Port of Açu, and the global mega-transport company Wilson Sons have been jointly testing the use of the new HVO as a clean marine carrier. With the approval of the National Petroleum Agency (ANP), EFEN imported HVO from BP British Petroleum and supplied it to Wilson Sons, which tested the green fuel on its tugboats operating at the Port of Açu, replacing marine diesel (bunker). EFEN is the combined company of BP—a global energy giant, a leader in the marketing of marine fuels and with a presence in several ports worldwide. In this case, it is associated with Prumo Rail/Miner Logistic, a leading private port operator in Brazil and highly successful in developing sustainability projects in the sector.

For EFEN Marine, there are four main advantages to using the new HVO for transport and depollution in marine applications: 1) The expected reduction in sectoral Co2 emissions by up to 80.0%; 2) Lower environmental impact throughout the production chain; 3) Full compatibility with diesel engines already in use; 4) Improved performance and durability.

This supply was part of the pilot project that aimed to evaluate the performance of HVO in EFEN marine engines. After the testing phase, the expectation is that commercialization for use in OSVs (Offshore Supply Vessels = tugboats) will be possible in the short term. Each step was taken with a focus on operational safety, quality, and product efficiency.

This partnership is the result of a shared commitment between these companies, aiming to contribute significantly and effectively to the energy transition of the maritime sector through sustainable practices, technologies, and innovations.

LUX expects the fuel farm to be completed in 2028. Total cost of building the facility is anticipated to come to €106.5 million ($125 million). The farm will have up to six tanks, each with the capacity to store 5,000 m³ (1.3 million gal.) of aviation fuel. The facility has been designed to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The farm will increase the airport’s fuel storage capacity by 275%, according to LUX.

“With the main storage tanks positioned landside and directly connected to the highway, and a dedicated supply system extending airside, the design combines efficiency with resilience,” LUX said. “In the unlikely event of a disruption, fuel deliveries can also be secured by truck.”

Luxembourg’s Ministry of Mobility and Public Works is the contracting authority for the fuel farm project, while airport operator lux-Airport serves as the project manager.

“By significantly expanding storage capacity, the facility will ensure an uninterrupted fuel supply for airlines and partners, providing several days of operational autonomy and reinforcing supply security,” the airport said.

The fund has raised a total of $20 billion in commitments and strategic capital from a diverse group of both existing and new investors.

This fundraising effort has not only surpassed the initial target but has also set a new record, making BGTF II the largest private fund dedicated to facilitating the global transition to clean energy.

The new fund has attracted contributions from institutional investors worldwide, including several entities that are engaging with Brookfield’s transition platform for the first time. Among significant commitments are $2 billion from ALTÉRRA and $1.5 billion from Norges Bank Investment Management, both of which demonstrate strong confidence in the fund’s objectives and strategy.

Beyond these commitments, the Fund has secured around $3.5 billion in co-investments, which adds to the total capital raised for the BGTF II strategy, bringing the overall figure to approximately $23.5 billion. This capital will be instrumental in implementing the Fund’s investment strategy, which aims to promote clean energy solutions.

To date, more than $5 billion has already been allocated to a range of high-quality investments in the clean energy sector. One notable investment is in Neoen, which involved a public-to-private takeover of a leading global developer and operator of renewable power and battery storage solutions. This acquisition is expected to significantly enhance operational capabilities and expand market reach.

Another key investment was made in Geronimo Power, which entails the acquisition of a large-scale, diversified energy developer in the United States. This company holds a substantial operating and development pipeline in critical power markets, positioning Brookfield for further growth in the domestic clean energy landscape.

Additionally, the Fund has formed a joint venture with Evren in India, aimed at accelerating the development of over 10 GW of wind, solar, and storage projects. This partnership is a strategic move to tap into India’s rapidly growing renewable energy market, which offers immense potential for expansion in sustainable energy generation.

Brookfield’s previous flagship transition fund, BGTF I, had raised $15 billion and made a series of strategic investments across various energy technologies worldwide. These included renewables, carbon capture solutions, sustainable aviation fuel, and battery storage technologies, along with a significant stake in Westinghouse, a global leader in nuclear services.

Decarbonizing aviation in the short term will likely entail replacing large quantities of petroleum jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), which are predominantly biofuels. In the United States, biofuels are currently used as substitutes for gasoline and diesel in road transportation and are supported by a complex set of federal and state policies including the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), state low carbon fuel standards, and state and federal tax credits. Policies promoting SAF therefore interact with surface transport biofuel policies. In this paper, we use a new detailed partial equilibrium model of road and air transportation fuel markets to compare various policy options designed to achieve a target of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030. Our results suggest that the target is attainable with current technology but not with current policy. Several potential federal policies, including modifications to the existing RFS, a federal SAF tax credit, or a clean aviation standard could meet the 3 billion gallon target with similar emissions reductions and costs but different incidence. The lowest cost policy we study entails replacing all current biofuels policies with a modest carbon tax on fossil transportation fuels paired with a SAF tax credit.

While large commercial airframes await technology advancement of high- temperature, next generation hydrogen fuel cells, at the smaller end, there are huge potential applications for streamlined, aerospace grade low-temperature proton exchange membrane (LTPEM) fuel cell systems.
As with other aircraft segments, electric aircraft would deliver the best efficiency and maintenance costs, and hydrogen-electric would provide the best range of all electric options.
Replacing battery power systems with hydrogen fuel cells can significantly extend range, reduce maintenance costs caused by battery cycling, and improve operations thanks to quicker turnaround time (hydrogen refueling vs lengthy battery recharge times).
As aerospace innovators push the boundaries of clean flight, one challenge persists: most current hydrogen fuel cell solutions aren’t designed with aviation’s unique constraints in mind.","When ZeroAvia first formed, our enthusiasm for fuel cells in hydrogen was too often met with a close-minded cynicism. There was a common (although flawed) assumption among some industry watchers that battery energy density would improve five-fold in less than a decade and that Sustainable Aviation Fuel would rapidly scale up production and thus adoption by airlines.

A number of factors changed these preconceptions in the early part of this decade. First, Airbus launched its ZEROe program, then the Aerospace Technology Institute’s Fly Zero project published a definitive tome of reports which pinpointed liquid hydrogen as the ultimate fuel of the future for aviation (and with huge potential near-term application), then, most importantly, the aircraft started to fly! First, ZeroAvia’s 2020 six seat hydrogen-electric demonstrator, then our testbed 19-seat Dornier 228, and then also erstwhile competitor Universal Hydrogen’s Dash 8 Q300 flights. Rolls-Royce and easyJet then showed how comfortable an aircraft jet engine could be burning hydrogen with a ground test, Joby/H2Fly completed a landmark 523 nautical mile flight on fuel cell power using liquid hydrogen.

The market impact of these factors was big, and over the course of this time we saw major airlines go from pre-orders to definitive purchase orders, and we welcomed investment from Airbus, IAG, American, United, Alaska and other industry heavyweights.

While timelines on some large commercial aircraft projects have slipped back, there is a bank of demand for engines, and certification projects are underway. It could be argued that it is a matter of time before the next great transition in commercial aircraft propulsion really takes hold.

Separately, hydrogen is picking up new impetus in other segments of aviation thanks to a unique set of drivers: new approaches to regulation, a thirst for greater endurance of novel electrical aircraft, such as electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and corresponding space and weight efficiency advances in low-to-mid power modular hydrogen fuel cell systems.

While large commercial airframes await technology advancement of high- temperature, next generation hydrogen fuel cells, at the smaller end, there are huge potential applications for streamlined, aerospace grade low-temperature proton exchange membrane (LTPEM) fuel cell systems.

In August of this year, the Federal Aviaton Administration launched the Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification (MOSAIC) rule, with profound implications for the applicability of fuel cell propulsion in the general aviation category.

The changes include removing weight limit as a key qualification and allowing up to four seats, thus broadening the design envelope for aircraft that can obtain regulatory approval without a type certificate and a production certificate.

Qualifying aircraft are no longer limited to single piston engines, opening up the opportunity to certify these with new electric and hydrogen-electric powertrains. As with other aircraft segments, electric aircraft would deliver the best efficiency and maintenance costs, and hydrogen-electric would provide the best range of all electric options.

As the U.S. gets ready to kick demonstration of eVTOL platforms up a notch following the launch of the eVTOL and AAM Integration Pilot Program (EIPP), attention is turning to how these first demonstrated routes can be expanded to more use cases.

Replacing battery power systems with hydrogen fuel cells can significantly extend range, reduce maintenance costs caused by battery cycling, and improve operations thanks to quicker turnaround time (hydrogen refueling vs lengthy battery recharge times).

As regional aviation looks to the adoption of hydrogen for fixed-wing long-distance flight, many airports already have active programs examining hydrogen for both air and ground operations. EVTOL can be a further demand case for these growing hydrogen hubs at airport, with the sector benefiting from existing plans to establish infrastructure.

The key ingredient for the light-sport and eVTOL categories is modular, flexible fuel cell systems with power generation somewhere between a typical automotive application and a larger fixed-wing aircraft. As aerospace innovators push the boundaries of clean flight, one challenge persists: most current hydrogen fuel cell solutions aren’t designed with aviation’s unique constraints in mind. Flight duration, integration complexity, and weight limitations often hinder adoption.",https://zeroavia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_1511663536-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 22:56:54.104477

It includes: Mitigation Action Accounting and Reporting Guidance, which outlines ways to disclose on initiatives not covered under GHG Protocol rules.
Target Accounting and Reporting Guidance, a framework for accounting for progress against voluntary climate targets.
PepsiCo is particularly interested in using the methods for reporting on emissions reduction programs that don’t fall into Scope 2.
The task force also plans to solicit feedback through public consultation in early 2026, with a view to publishing updated versions of these documents late next year, Davis said.","Aldi, Etsy, Netflix, PepsiCo, REI and Weyerhaeuser are among more than a dozen companies testing a new methodology for disclosing the impact of climate initiatives, including replacing diesel vehicles and investing in low-carbon aviation fuel.

The guidance comes from an independent group of greenhouse gas accounting experts, led by former sustainability pros from Netflix and Amazon and formally known as the Task Force for Corporate Action Transparency. Their tools, published in late September, are meant to complement other reporting frameworks.

For example, rules from the widely used standards body Greenhouse Gas Protocol outline ways to report on actions to mitigate electricity consumption, which fall under Scope 2. They don’t address methods for discussing the impact of other activities aimed at reducing emissions such as insulating buildings, replacing diesel trucks with electric vehicles, reducing methane emissions from livestock and closing down a business unit as part of a merger.

Those methods often relate to Scope 3, which covers emissions from a company’s business partners and customers.

“I would underscore the idea that there has been an explosion of these instruments,” said Chris Davis, a former Amazon executive, who is interim director for the Task Force for Corporate Action Transparency. “The avenues for progress have outpaced the ability to talk about it.”

“Companies are becoming more sophisticated, and in trying to meet their targets, they are implementing various programs to reduce emissions in their operations and supply chains,” said Noora Singh, senior director of sustainability at PepsiCo. “Unfortunately, the current standards and approaches lack the level of detail and sophistication needed to reflect or record these activities in reporting.”

Common frustration

The lack of disclosure guidance threatens to stall the adoption of approaches emerging to support the adoption of technologies such as sustainable aviation fuel and zero-emissions vehicles. These methods allow corporations to “claim” the environmental benefits related to buying into specific projects or contracts, even if they aren’t directly using the services.

“Under existing standards, it’s unclear how companies can participate,” said Sam Brundrett, environmental impact lead at Etsy. “That ambiguity doesn’t just create hesitation; it threatens to stall action altogether precisely when speed and scale matter most.”

Etsy’s role as a marketplace makes it difficult to directly control emissions reductions, he said.

The Task Force for Corporate Action Transparency was born two years ago through informal discussions. “When I was at Netflix implementing and building our strategy, I wanted to start reporting on all these things we were doing, and I was looking for disclosure guidance,” said Alexia Kelly, now managing director of the carbon policy and markets initiative at High Tide Foundation. “There was no uniform guidance.”

The group’s initial guidance was written to stand up to third-party assurance by organizations that verify ESG disclosures. It includes:

Mitigation Action Accounting and Reporting Guidance, which outlines ways to disclose on initiatives not covered under GHG Protocol rules.

Target Accounting and Reporting Guidance, a framework for accounting for progress against voluntary climate targets.

PepsiCo is particularly interested in using the methods for reporting on emissions reduction programs that don’t fall into Scope 2. “We have a number of initiatives, whether it’s upstream in our ag supply chain for fertilizer production, third-party transportation switching to alternative or electric vehicles or various on-farm practices, and it would be helpful to test all of these using that accounting document,” Singh said.

What’s next

The group enlisted corporate reporting professionals to test its guidance in 2025 and 2026; it may add a few others aside from the dozen-plus companies already committed to the pilot, said Davis.

The task force also plans to solicit feedback through public consultation in early 2026, with a view to publishing updated versions of these documents late next year, Davis said.

The group is aligning its guidance to updates under way at the GHG Protocol, which is revising many of its rules as part of an extensive overhaul, Davis said. It is also in conversation with other standards bodies including the Science Based Targets initiative, the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets, the Center for Green Market Activation, the California Air Resources Board and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative.

“The hope is not that this becomes the definitive solution but rather that the established standards, once updated, will adopt some of the approaches proposed by [the task force] and incorporate them into official guidance,” said Singh.

“We want to inform existing systems and move forward,” Kelly said. “We just want this problem solved.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trellis_editorial_pepsico_disclosure_1470x894.png,N,,2025-10-07 15:56:10.403375

With the latest funding, BGTF II said it exceeded its target and set a record. The company plans to use this fund and contributions from institutional investors worldwide, including several investors that are new to the Brookfield transition platform. This includes the previously announced commitments of $2 billion from ALTÉRRA and $1.5 billion from Norges Bank Investment Management. In addition to the above commitments, the Fund has also secured approximately $3.5 billion of co-investment into its portfolio, bringing the total capital raised across the strategy in this vintage to approximately $23.5 billion.

Previously, under its transition fund (BGTF I), Brookfield raised $15 billion and invested in a range of energy technologies globally. The company said it invested in renewables, carbon capture, sustainable aviation fuel, battery storage, as well as nuclear services via a majority stake in global technology leader, Westinghouse. Recently, it also struck framework energy supply deals with Microsoft and Google, which were the largest ever agreed in wind/solar and hydroelectricity, respectively.

Funding Spread Across Projects

The company has already deployed more than $5 billion across a diverse set of transition investments, including:

Neoen: A public-to-private takeover of a leading, global renewable power and battery storage operator and developer

Geronimo Power: An acquisition of a large-scale, diversified energy developer in the U.S. with a significant operating and development pipeline in key power markets.

Evren: A joint venture in India to accelerate the development of over 10 GW of wind, solar and storage projects

“We’ll continue to grow here in Savannah,” Burns told reporters last week at the company’s annual gathering at its headquarters.
Its production, completions, and customer support service facilities combined occupy more than 4 million square feet in Savannah.
Izzard said about 3 in 5 of the company’s 5,000 customer support personnel work in Savannah.
Combined with its main Savannah customer support campus, now known as Service Center West, the facilities represent the largest service footprint in business aviation, Gulfstream said.","SAVANNAH, Georgia—Here outside Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (KSAV), it’s Gulfstream Aerospace as far as the eye can see.

When Mark Burns joined Gulfstream as an engineer in 1983, the company had about 100 employees. The G-IV—which would go on to become one of the world’s most popular business jets—had only just been conceived.

Now, as company president, Burns leads a global team comprising more than 20,000 employees. Nearly two-thirds of them work in Savannah and its suburbs, where the company has become a ubiquitous presence—and the city’s largest private employer.

“We’ll continue to grow here in Savannah,” Burns told reporters last week at the company’s annual gathering at its headquarters. “It is our home.”

Gulfstream is also Georgia’s largest manufacturer. Its production, completions, and customer support service facilities combined occupy more than 4 million square feet in Savannah.

Per Burns, the company has about 3,300 aircraft in service. It has delivered more than 350 G500 and G600 models, introduced in 2018 and 2019, respectively. It delivered its 50th G700 in May, about one year after certification. The G800—the world’s longest-range business jet—entered service in August, replacing the Collier Trophy-winning G650.

The G400, which awaits certification, is undergoing flight testing. This week, Gulfstream unveiled the newest member of its next-generation fleet of ultra-long-range twin-engines—the G300.

“Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia are all continuing to grow,” said Burns. “We’re fortunate that our brand is really a global brand now.”

The super-midsize G300 will be the sixth model Gulfstream has introduced in just over a decade. According to Lor Izzard, senior vice president of customer support, that investment in aircraft is being “matched” by investments in new facilities, technologies, and personnel.

Scaling Up

John Kenan, Gulfstream’s senior vice president of operations, said the company expects to make about 150 global deliveries in 2025. The bulk of them come out of Savannah, where it owns more than 3 million square feet of manufacturing and completion facilities for the G400 through G800.

In December, Gulfstream produced its thousandth wing in Savannah. Kenan gave FLYING a tour of the wing production facility, which he said churns out one every 2.5 manufacturing days. Adjacent to that site is the building that produces fuselages for the G500 and G600, as well as the G400 following a 142,000-square-foot expansion in 2023. The G700 and G800 fuselages are produced in separate hubs nearby.

As the manufacturing operation has exploded, Gulfstream gave itself the ability to be flexible to shifts in demand. The G700 production line, for example, could be used to produce the G800—and vice versa—because the manufacturing processes are so similar.

“We’ve invested heavily in new design fixturing and tooling, which actually was created here in Savannah with our own research and development center,” Kenan said. “And how we manufacture aircraft is unique to the rest of the industry.”

The G300, like the G280 it will replace, is being built and tested in the Middle East in partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries. But research and development for the model is based in Savannah, where nearly 2,600 Gulfstream engineers work with state-of-the-art laboratories and simulators.

At Your Service

More aircraft in service means more resources are required to service the aircraft. By that token, Gulfstream has also invested heavily in customer support services—to the tune of $620 million over 10 years.

In Savannah, the company’s customer support footprint covers more than 1.1 million square feet. Its 10 hangars, occupying more than 550,000 square feet, can accommodate 85 aircraft at a time. These facilities handle modifications, inspections, and repairs for fuselages, flight controls, engines, wings, hydraulics, wheels, and landing gear, as well as avionics upgrades and aircraft redesign. Also on-site is a fuel farm that can hold up to 30,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Izzard said about 3 in 5 of the company’s 5,000 customer support personnel work in Savannah. He added that Gulfstream has invested more in personnel training over the past 12 months than in its entire history.

Izzard walked FLYING through the company’s 367,000-square-foot Service Center East, which was expanded in July 2024. It has poured more than $150 million into the facility, which has two hangars each capable of servicing up to 13 aircraft at once. The building handles both scheduled maintenance and drop-ins for the G300 through G800. Gulfstream in September, for instance, installed its hundredth SpaceX Starlink system, which Izzard said is a particularly popular request.

Combined with its main Savannah customer support campus, now known as Service Center West, the facilities represent the largest service footprint in business aviation, Gulfstream said.

Gulfstream’s Georgia Roots

With customers around the world, Gulfstream has invested heavily beyond Savannah.

Its support network includes MRO facilities in California, Wisconsin, Texas, Florida, and the U.K. In January, it opened a new, 225,000-square-foot customer support and MRO center at Mesa Gateway Airport (KIWA) in Arizona, from which it uses a fleet of Pilatus PC-12s to deliver spare parts to the West Coast.

The company has also expanded its Field and Airborne Support Teams (FAST), which travel around the world to provide 24/7 on-site support. As of April, it had more than 150 FAST technicians across 24 bases worldwide. According to Izzard, the team has grown 40 percent in the past 18 months.

But Gulfstream has no plans to dig up its roots in Georgia, which it has called home for nearly 60 years.

Burns estimated that the company has hired about 5,000 Savannah personnel since 2016. It maintains partnerships with high schools, colleges, and universities to create a pipeline of local talent. Its Savannah Technical Training Center, for example, hosted more than 140,000 hours of training for about 2,000 new employees in 2024 alone.

“This community has been good for Gulfstream,” Burns said. “We have invested significantly in the education system here, and it has paid off in dividends.”

There could be more to come. With the G400 approaching certification and scaled production—and the G300 waiting in the wings—Gulfstream may need to spend even more on Savannah.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/IMG_2055-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:57:00.247561

The initiative underscores SAF’s vital role in advancing the industry’s sustainability goals.

NBAA-BACE will be held from Oct. 14 to 16 at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Henderson Executive Airport (HND). Airport-based fuel providers will offer SAF at HND and North Las Vegas Airport (VGT).

Additionally, several original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are expected to fly their aircraft to the HND Aircraft Connection using either physical SAF or SAF attributes via book-and-claim.

Book-and-claim programs offered by airport fixed-base operators (FBOs) and fuel suppliers make it possible for operators to purchase SAF attributes even when it’s not physically available on-site.

Operators using book-and-claim upload traditional fossil-based fuel at a participating FBO or fuel supplier, but they also receive credit for buying SAF at another airport where SAF is available.

The process creates a system that allows operators to offset their use of fossil-based fuel.

SAF, which can reduce aviation’s lifecycle carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent over traditional fuels, is a key part of business aviation’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

“By making SAF available to operators at NBAA-BACE, we’re highlighting the importance of expanding its production, accessibility and adoption,” said NBAA president and CEO Ed Bolen.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a key element of our industry’s long-term strategy to reduce emissions.”

The availability of SAF as part of NBAA-BACE reflects the show’s broader sustainability focus – for example:

The convention includes a two-day Business Aviation Sustainability Summit to showcase the most important developments shaping business aviation’s path to net-zero carbon emissions.

NBAA is again offering an Exhibitor Sustainability Pledge aimed at making 2025 NBAA-BACE one of the most sustainable trade shows.

The convention week will also mark the two-year anniversary of the industry’s CLIMBING. FAST. advocacy initiative, which underscores business aviation’s societal benefits with policymakers and opinion leaders, including sustainability leadership.

Passenger traffic through Dubai International is expected to exceed 100 million within 18 months, cementing the emirate’s status as a global mobility hub.
Space joins the flight path Space, once peripheral to the Airshow, now stands alongside aviation at its core.
In his words, “The Dubai Airshow is not just going to be about a traditional wave of showing aircraft and closing deals,” he said.
The Airshow will include 12 conference tracks and four main stages covering green fuels, airport technology, cybersecurity and workforce development.","Twenty national pavilions, 12 conference tracks, and four main stages will host over 90 hours of content, while a vast static display will present the industry’s most advanced commercial, military and urban-mobility aircraft side by side.

Griffiths described the show as “not just a major international platform, but a centre of innovation where great ideas take flight.”

He adds, the world’s most visionary minds will gather to “showcase technology you can hardly believe is real when you see it in front of you.”

With that being said, here are 5 key takeaways from the Dubai Airshow Press Conference

1. Aviation’s widening remit beyond traditional flight

The panel opened by reminding the audience how aviation has evolved from basic transport into a dynamic ecosystem at the heart of the global economy. Now valued at around $4 trillion, it is, in Griffiths’s words, “the lifeblood of human connectivity.”

Dubai’s own aviation story mirrors that expansion. Passenger traffic through Dubai International is expected to exceed 100 million within 18 months, cementing the emirate’s status as a global mobility hub.

The 2025 theme, The Future is Here, signifies not just a display of next-generation aircraft, but an ambition to catalyse technologies and partnerships shaping aviation’s next phase.

The Airshow itself is being reimagined as a convergence of ideas, technology and investment.

2. Space joins the flight path

Space, once peripheral to the Airshow, now stands alongside aviation at its core.

His Excellency Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi, UAE Minister of Education and Chairman of the UAE Space Agency, explained that “the line between atmospheric space and space itself is becoming more blurred, and because Dubai is a city of the future, we want to be well positioned.”

Participation from global space entities has increased by more than 80 per cent, with a near-doubling of private-sector involvement.

Al Falasi tells the audience, “Any successful space economy starts with a big investment by the government,” adding, “you can only truly succeed once you’ve empowered your private sector.”

The inclusion of international space-agency heads alongside commercial enterprises, “signifies a global recognition of the Dubai Airshow as a legitimate space platform… this is the future, and this is why space is part of the Airshow.”

3. Technology takes centre stage

For His Excellency Omran Sharaf, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs for Advanced Science and Technology, the 2025 edition is about far more than static aircraft and order books.

In his words, “The Dubai Airshow is not just going to be about a traditional wave of showing aircraft and closing deals,” he said. “It’s an opportunity to showcase the technologies of the future.”

Artificial intelligence, automation and digital infrastructure will be major themes, alongside electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), drones and hybrid propulsion systems, all supported by Dubai’s new regulatory framework.

His Excellency Mohammed Abdulla Lengawi, Director-General of the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority, confirmed that “by 2026, the air taxi will be launched in Dubai,” with drone-delivery operations expanding to cover “30 per cent of Dubai now and 70 per cent within five years.”

These developments, he said, will position the UAE as a world leader in advanced air mobility, where traditional and digital-era flight coexist under one policy framework.

4. Sustainability drives the agenda

Sustainability will be the unifying thread across the 2025 edition. Aircraft will operate on sustainable aviation fuel, and exhibitors will highlight decarbonisation, circular supply chains and eco-design.

The Airshow will include 12 conference tracks and four main stages covering green fuels, airport technology, cybersecurity and workforce development.

Organisers confirmed that sustainability is embedded into every facet of the event, from build-up logistics to catering, transportation and hospitality.

The panel noted that these efforts reflect Dubai’s vision for “growth that is environmentally conscious yet globally ambitious.”

5. Partnerships, people and purpose

If the show’s technology dazzles, its human focus grounds it. His Excellency Khalifa Al Zaffin, Executive Chairman of Dubai Aviation City Corporation, emphasised that 2025 will be “bigger from every angle, exhibition, pavilions, and quality.”

The Airshow, he said, “has already won global recognition, but this year’s event will be even better.” The week will welcome more than 1,000 students and 35 universities for workshops and competitions aimed at inspiring the next generation of aerospace talent.

“It’s not about business and commercial interests alone,” Sharaf states. “It’s about building relationships between nations.”, an embrace of the some 98 international delgates due to attend.

Eugene Barry, Chief Commercial Officer at Dubai Airports and Chairman of the Dubai Airshow Project Board, joined the conversation by describing the event as “the culmination of a year-long collaboration across Dubai’s aviation ecosystem.”

The traditional Thursday gala dinner, he said, “is our chance to thank the industry and celebrate the success of Dubai’s aviation community, it’s the highlight of Airshow week and unlike anything else in the world.”

The gala dinner, is the greatly anticipated culmination of the week. Pulsing a note of gratitude and optimism, a symbolic salute to the weeks accomplishments and a send-off for the industry’s next chapter.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/07/Dubai-Airshow-2025-Press-Conference-3-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 11:57:27.097803

DUBAI: Kenya Airways (KQ) and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines today convened a high-level executive roundtable in Nairobi that reached a landmark consensus on the future of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Africa.

For the first time, senior leaders from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), Kenya Airports Authority (KAA), the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) agreed on a joint roadmap and policy recommendations to unlock investment and regional production of SAF.

The package of recommendations includes:

SAF blending mandates to accelerate adoption across African carriers.

Incentives for producers, such as tax breaks and subsidies.

Streamlined certification processes to ease market entry.

Regional collaboration mechanisms to align governments, regulators, and private sector investment in SAF infrastructure.

This policy breakthrough comes at a crucial time. Aviation accounts for 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, and Africa’s passenger traffic is expected to double by 2035. With abundant biomass resources and strong growth potential, the continent is uniquely positioned to play a leading role in the global sustainability transition.

The Nairobi roadmap lays the foundation for Africa to scale up SAF production and uptake, while also fostering knowledge exchange between global and regional partners. It includes pilot projects in Kenya and the Netherlands, drawing on KLM’s expertise in SAF procurement via mass balance systems and Kenya Airways’ corporate SAF uplift model.

What do these affiliate links mean for you?

First, and most importantly, we still only recommend products that we believe add value for you.

When you buy something through one of our affiliate links, we may earn a small commission - but at no additional costs to you.

And when you buy something through a link that is not an affiliate link, we won’t receive any commission but we’ll still be happy to have helped you.

What do these affiliate links mean for us?

When we find products that we believe add value to you and the seller has an affiliate program, we sign up for it.

When you buy something through one of our affiliate links, we may earn a small commission (at no extra costs to you).

And at this point in time, all money is reinvested in sharing the most helpful content with you. This includes all operating costs for running this site and the content creation itself.

What does this mean for me personally?

You may have noticed by the way Impactful Ninja is operated that money is not the driving factor behind it. It is a passion project of mine and I love to share helpful information with you to make a positive impact on the world and society. However, it's a project in that I invest a lot of time and also quite some money.

Washington, DC, Oct. 7, 2025 – In collaboration with industry partners, the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is making sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available at Las Vegas-area airports in conjunction with the 2025 NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE).

The initiative underscores SAF’s vital role in advancing the industry’s sustainability goals.

NBAA-BACE will be held from Oct. 14-16 at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Henderson Executive Airport (HND). Airport-based fuel providers will offer SAF at HND and North Las Vegas Airport (VGT).

Additionally, several OEMs are expected to fly their aircraft to the HND Aircraft Connection using either physical SAF or SAF attributes via book-and-claim. Book-and-claim programs offered by airport FBOs and fuel suppliers make it possible for operators to purchase SAF attributes even when it’s not physically available on-site.

Operators using book-and-claim upload traditional fossil-based fuel at a participating FBO or fuel supplier, but they also receive credit for buying SAF at another airport where SAF is available. The process creates a system that allows operators to offset their use of fossil-based fuel.

SAF, which can reduce aviation’s lifecycle carbon emissions by as much as 80% over traditional fuels, is a key part of business aviation’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

“By making SAF available to operators at NBAA-BACE, we’re highlighting the importance of expanding its production, accessibility and adoption,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “Sustainable aviation fuel is a key element of our industry’s long-term strategy to reduce emissions.”

The availability of SAF as part of NBAA-BACE reflects the show’s broader sustainability focus – for example:

The convention includes a two-day Business Aviation Sustainability Summit to showcase the most important developments shaping business aviation’s path to net-zero carbon emissions.

NBAA is again offering an Exhibitor Sustainability Pledge aimed at making 2025 NBAA-BACE one of the most sustainable trade shows.

The convention week will also mark the two-year anniversary of the industry’s CLIMBING. FAST. advocacy initiative, which underscores business aviation’s societal benefits with policymakers and opinion leaders, including sustainability leadership.

Jane Hupe, a deputy director at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), stated that India possesses ample raw materials to not only meet its own future demand for this green fuel but also to become an exporter.

“India will be producing this new aviation fuel before the year is over,” Hupe was quoted as saying. Production is expected to begin at a refinery in Panipat, operated by Indian Oil Corporation.

While official rules requiring airlines to blend SAF with conventional fuel start in 2027, Hupe noted that starting production early, even with potential minor delays, is a crucial step that will build confidence in the new industry.

The official’s visit to India involved discussions on a recent study that highlighted the country’s strong potential. The report pointed to India’s vast supply of agricultural waste and other biomass, estimated at hundreds of millions of tonnes, which can be used as feedstock to produce the fuel.

The study also identified several methods for producing the fuel in India. The initial method, which uses used cooking oil, is considered a proven technology and ready for immediate use. Another method using alcohol is also being explored.

It is a pleasure and a privilege for Amsterdam to host this important gathering of business leaders and policymakers.

You have come at a special time. In just twenty days, Amsterdam celebrates its 750th birthday. Seven and a half centuries since a small community that built a dam in the Amstel River grew into the international commercial and cultural centre we know today. From the very beginning, Amsterdam met the challenges of its watery environment with a spirit of commerce, creativity, and innovation.

That same spirit is needed again today. Not only in Amsterdam, but across Europe and the world.

Our current economic model has reached its limits. We must transform our “take-make-waste” economies into ones that reduce, reuse, and redesign.

The good news is that there is a growing consensus around Mario Draghi’s call to combine the ambition to decarbonise the European economy with the drive to make it more competitive.

As Draghi wrote in The Economist:

“The EU has reached a point where, without action, it will have to compromise either its welfare, the environment, or its freedom.”

Amsterdam fully embraces Draghi’s recommendations. As well as the EU’s Clean Industrial Deal. Europe can reach net-zero by 2050 if the EU and the private sector work closely together with Europe’s great cities; the international business hubs and centres of innovation.

Cities are the key to a competitive, zero-emission Europe. They attract the talent needed for success. They provide the cultural atmosphere where open minds, free thinkers, and entrepreneurs can thrive. Europe’s great cities embody the very values on which we can build the Green Deal: democracy, rule of law, innovation, openness, human rights, and international cooperation.

They unite deep historical roots with an unshakable belief in progress and in never ceasing to imagine the future.

Let me name a few tangible examples from Amsterdam. The Port of Amsterdam is decarbonising rapidly: with 340,000 square metres of solar panels, wind turbines powering 20,000 households, and a complete hydrogen chain under development, the port is becoming a hub for the energy transition. Amsterdam is also home to Fairphone, the company that makes the world’s most sustainable smartphone.

Built from recycled and ethically sourced materials. And SkyNRG, another Amsterdam-based pioneer, has built Europe’s first sustainable aviation fuel plant in the Netherlands. From re-use of building materials to groundbreaking battery technology, these examples show that the green transformation is already underway in Europe’s cities.

Cities like Amsterdam are eager to work with the business sector. In return, we need the support of forward-thinking and responsible business leaders. Because our shared values are under pressure. Around the world, authoritarian regimes are reshaping capitalism to serve power, privilege, and prejudice.",https://www.amsterdam.nl/publish/varianten/615/logo_voor_social.png,N,,2025-10-07 07:59:04.795430

The Delhi pilot is the first tangible step on this ambitious journey to make Indian skies significantly greener.","India is taking a significant stride towards a sustainable aviation future with the announcement of a pilot project to introduce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi.

The pilot is strategically placed in Delhi due to a critical piece of existing infrastructure: a dedicated pipeline from the Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) Panipat refinery, which supplies Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) directly to the airport depot. IOC recently received certification to produce SAF, which will initially be a blend created using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. Crucially, the feedstock for this fuel includes readily available domestic resources like used cooking oil and even rice straw (parali).

The launch comes as India is in the process of framing a comprehensive national policy to support the SAF segment. This effort aligns with India's commitments under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which applies to international flights. While India chose not to participate in the voluntary phases, offsetting requirements for Indian carriers will become mandatory starting in 2027.

To meet these future obligations, the Centre is planning indicative blending targets, starting with a one per cent SAF blend in ATF in 2027, escalating to two per cent in 2028, and aiming for five per cent by 2030.

Union Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu has expressed confidence in India's potential to become a global leader in SAF production, citing two primary natural advantages. ""The first advantage is our geography, which allows us to become an exporter, and the second is the massive availability of feedstock,"" the Minister explained.

India's potential feedstock capacity is immense, with over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue that can be converted into SAF. This enormous domestic supply capability is projected to exceed India's own domestic demand, positioning the country to become a major exporter of green fuel. Given that India currently exports about 50% of its ATF production, this transition into a SAF exporter appears to be a natural progression, underscoring the nation's commitment to sustainability in the global aviation industry.

The study also outlined multiple technological pathways for SAF production in India, including the HEFA process utilising used cooking oil (UCO), Hupe said.
The ICAO’s study also outlined policy tools that the Indian government could adopt to support the growth of SAF production, such as mandates, financial incentives and market creation strategies.
At the time of the report, SAF was almost three to four times as expensive as traditional jet fuel but price reduction would come alongside increased production, Hupe added.","The country had abundant feedstocks to meet SAF domestic demand and exports in the future, Jane Hupe, deputy director (environment branch, Air Transport Bureau) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations (UN) body, was quoted as saying in the 15 September report.

Although the country’s SAF blending mandates do not officially take effect until 2027, Hupe indicated that early production, even if delayed slightly, would boost confidence in the sector.

Hupe was in India to discuss a study conducted under the ICAO’s SAF programme with stakeholders.

The study highlighted India’s strong feedstock availability and policy momentum, positioning the country to not only meet domestic SAF demand but also potentially become an exporter in the future, Hindu Businessline wrote.

According to Engineering News, the agreement was signed on Monday (6) on the sidelines of the 9th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9), held in Yokohama in August, by Solomon Quaynor, AfDB Vice-President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, and Shoji Yamada, Representative Director and President of JGC Corporation.

SAF refers to jet fuel produced from renewable resources such as vegetable oils, waste, or captured carbon, which can significantly reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

The Letter of Intent establishes a framework for joint promotion, knowledge exchange, and co-financing opportunities in SAF development and other green aviation initiatives across the continent.

Under the agreement, the AfDB will facilitate coordination with public sector aviation stakeholders, identify potential projects in development, and explore financing mechanisms — including support for feasibility studies and debt or equity financing. Meanwhile, JGC Corporation will conduct demand and technical feasibility studies, assess implementation opportunities based on local infrastructure and resources, and help transfer Japanese clean energy technology to African markets.

The initiative aligns with AfDB’s sustainable transport, mobility, and energy transition strategy, which aims to decarbonize key sectors of the African economy while supporting industrial growth and innovation.

Quaynor emphasized that the partnership represents an important step to reduce emissions and increase competitiveness in Africa’s aviation sector. “The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to reduce the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” he said.

“Moreover, it should enhance sector competitiveness over time. This partnership with JGC will help unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pioneer in the sector,” he added.

JGC President Shoji Yamada stated that the company is eager to apply its engineering expertise to Africa’s decarbonization efforts. “We are proud to collaborate with the African Development Bank in promoting sustainable aviation fuels in Africa,” Yamada said, adding that “by leveraging our expertise in facility engineering and sustainable energy, we aim to contribute to the continent’s decarbonization efforts while simultaneously promoting local economic growth and innovation.”

If successful, the partnership could mark a significant step in Africa’s clean energy transition, positioning the continent to play a leading role in the global sustainable aviation market, which is expected to grow exponentially over the next decade.

Even though other airplanes, likely from other carriers, are the ones receiving the SAF molecules in their fuel, the airline purchasing the SAF gets credit for its use.
Importantly, there’s a second component to the SAF certificate system that allows for the allocation of SAF GHG reductions to individual travelers or air-freight shippers.
According to IATA accounting principles, the airline should retire Scope 3 SAF certificates on your behalf and use your fare premium towards SAF purchases.
In the European Union and the United Kingdom, SAF blending mandates came into effect at the start of 2025, but in other jurisdictions, the vast majority of SAF use is supported by selling SAF certificates to business customers and thus should not be claimed by other passengers.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a “drop-in” fuel that can be mixed with fossil jet fuel and used in existing fueling infrastructure and engines. Once SAF is mixed with conventional jet fuel, it cannot be physically traced. So how do airlines know how much SAF is used on their flights? And how does SAF use by airlines affect your personal carbon footprint? Welcome to the world of SAF accounting.

I’ll tackle the first question, the easier one, by explaining mass-balance accounting. This practice is used when chemically identical feedstocks with unique environmental characteristics are blended. In mass-balance accounting, the mass of SAF blended into the fuel system is matched to an equivalent mass of fuel being withdrawn by the fuel purchaser even though the original fuel molecules have not been directly traced. This allows a SAF purchaser to claim SAF use even if most of the fuel molecules in shared fuel supply infrastructure are of fossil origin.

But what if SAF is not even supplied to a specific airport/location? Can SAF use still be claimed for departing flights? This is where book-and-claim accounting comes in. In this practice, a fuel supplier mixes SAF into the shared jet fuel infrastructure at another airport on behalf of the airline making the purchase. Even though other airplanes, likely from other carriers, are the ones receiving the SAF molecules in their fuel, the airline purchasing the SAF gets credit for its use.

If an airline gets credit for SAF uplifted into aircraft from a different carrier, how can we be sure that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from SAF use are properly tracked and the other airline isn’t also claiming credit (i.e., double counting)? For this the aviation industry is developing a system of SAF “proof of sustainability” certificates that document each batch of SAF production and its environmental characteristics. If SAF crediting is further checked and verified against a central trusted registry—for example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s recently announced SAF Registry—users can be more confident in the correct attribution of fuel.

As shown in the figure, SAF sustainability certificates are tracked in registries that log SAF purchases. Each certificate also records information on the volume and type of SAF produced and its life-cycle GHG emissions intensity. Airlines purchasing the SAF are given custody of a corresponding certificate that indicates the purchased SAF was mixed into the aviation fuel system for use. If there is a one-to-one ratio between the quantity of certificates purchased and the volume of SAF uplifted, then there has been no double counting within corporate GHG reporting. And if life-cycle analysis best practices are followed, it’s reasonable to assume that GHG reduction estimates on SAF certificates are robust.

Now we can turn to the second question about personal carbon footprint. Importantly, there’s a second component to the SAF certificate system that allows for the allocation of SAF GHG reductions to individual travelers or air-freight shippers. These end-user certificates are known as Scope 3 certificates because a business’s air travel emissions are covered under the Scope 3 emissions category of the GHG Protocol corporate emissions accounting framework. The Scope 3 certificates determine which passengers can claim a lower carbon footprint based on the use of SAF. The recently released IATA accounting and reporting methodology states that airlines can only represent lower per-seat emissions to customers if the Scope 3 certificates have been retired by the airline on their customers’ behalf. If, instead, these Scope 3 certificates are sold to corporations to offset emissions from a business’s travel or shipping activities, only the corporation purchasing the Scope 3 certificates can claim a reduced carbon footprint.

So, what happens if you purchase a SAF upgrade to offset CO2 emissions on a personal flight? According to IATA accounting principles, the airline should retire Scope 3 SAF certificates on your behalf and use your fare premium towards SAF purchases. Note, though, that reduced GHG fare options may also potentially combine a carbon offset from another sector with a SAF purchase to arrive at the total GHG reduction value on the ticket.

Is SAF reducing the climate impact of my travel?

You may be wondering if SAF is likely to be reducing your personal carbon footprint right now. Unless you’re purchasing SAF upgrades or flying in Europe, the answer is probably no. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, SAF blending mandates came into effect at the start of 2025, but in other jurisdictions, the vast majority of SAF use is supported by selling SAF certificates to business customers and thus should not be claimed by other passengers.

It’s also important to remember that, on a global basis, the current impact of SAF on aviation emissions is minimal. In 2024, SAF accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production. So, for now, it’s safe to assume that the majority of fuel on most flights is conventional jet fuel derived from petroleum.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ID-377-SAF-credit-864x576.png,N,,2025-10-07 03:56:10.132809

Bringing down the costs of SAF via strategies including public and private investment, market measures, and cost sharing is crucial for building widespread support for its deployment. This piece explores both the challenges and opportunities for bringing down the cost of SAF.

Although SAF can be made from many different materials and conversion processes, all of them are currently costlier than fossil jet fuel. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency estimated that the average production cost of SAF in 2024 ranged from €1,461 per tonne (for biofuels) to €7,695 per tonne (for e-fuels). We calculate that this is a cost premium of 2.1–10.6x compared with fossil jet fuel by converting fossil jet production costs from the International Energy Agency, reported in U.S. dollars per liter, into equivalent units. While e-fuel costs should come down when they arrive on the market around 2030, they are expected to remain far above the current price of fossil jet fuel.

The cost of SAF is primarily driven by the cost of its feedstock. For example, virgin vegetable oil is more expensive than the kerosene it is displacing. Making waste-based SAF with high cellulosic content is expensive due to inefficient supply chains for sourcing raw material and the enzymes needed to break down feedstocks into “drop-in” fuel. E-fuels, meanwhile, require high quantities of renewable electricity to produce renewable hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen produced via electrolysis using 100% renewable electricity) and extract diluted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Risk of investment

It takes up to 5 years for SAF projects to reach final investment decision—a critical stage during project development that indicates whether projects are ready to move forward to construction—and many projects fail before this is achieved. Earlier this year, consulting group BCG found that fewer than 30% of SAF projects globally have reached final investment decision. Often projects come apart due to technology “valleys of death” during the transition between the demonstration and commercialization stages. This can be the result of poor project financing, mismanagement, or unforeseen technical barriers. SAF projects require significant funding and investor backing, particularly when constructing first-of-a-kind (FOAK) facilities. If funding support fluctuates (as it has with the recently revised 45Z tax credits in the United States), if producers cannot secure long-term offtake agreements, or if governments and other investors do not provide sufficient loan support, SAF projects may fail before final investment decision.

Fulcrum BioEnergy, which broke ground on a plant in Reno, Nevada, in 2016 and filed for bankruptcy in 2024, serves as a cautionary tale for FAOK facility deployment. The project failed in part because plant managers did not prepare for technical challenges similar to those that arose during a previous high-profile gasification project, the project failed to meet overly optimistic production deadlines, and representatives overstated progress that cost them the trust of investors. An expert retrospective assessment of this case suggests that greater transparency, improved risk management, and the use of third-party assessments could help future FOAK projects move from the development to commercialization stage.

From a financial perspective, investing in “advanced” SAF pathways requires a combination of “technology push” and “market pull” to overcome the “valleys of death” and reach commercialization. As of now, regions such as the United Kingdom and European Union have put SAF mandates in place with penalties for non-compliance; these are examples of a market pull. However, airlines have criticized the high cost of SAF purchases and called on regulators in these regions to review the timeline and trajectory of mandates amidst rising prices. Additionally, rather than being part of the technology push, the fossil fuel industry appears slow to act.

Market mechanisms

The United Kingdom has offered more than £200 million in upfront grant funding to second-generation SAF projects via its Advanced Fuels Fund, a form of technology push. This is paired with its SAF mandate and revenue certainty mechanism, which will take effect by the end of 2026; both act as a “market pull.” The revenue certainty mechanism allows SAF producers to enter into a 15-year contract with a counterparty to set a fixed guaranteed strike price (GSP) on fuel production. When the market price of SAF falls below the GSP, producers are reimbursed by the UK government for all financial losses below that price. When the market price is higher than the GSP, producers must return any profits above that price. We illustrate this cost sharing relationship in Figure 1 (below).

The UK revenue certainty mechanism is funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers that covers the cost of SAF payments and administrative overhead for the counterparty. This is a promising example of a policy that can be efficient, provide longer-term investor certainty, and be paid for in-sector. Other proposed funding mechanisms such as a double-sided auction can help minimize the costs of operating the scheme by introducing an auction on both supply (SAF producer) and demand (SAF offtakers).

Airlines and individuals downstream of the fossil fuel supply chain can also share in the costs of supporting aviation sector decarbonization. Airlines can enter into offtake agreements with SAF producers to meet company-level sustainability goals or partner with businesses to procure voluntary SAF via Scope 3 certificates. When these emissions reductions are properly tracked and accounted for in registries, they can be an effective way for customers to mitigate the costs of SAF procurement at any location around the world.

Regarding individual consumers, a 2022 ICCT study found that a levy rising from $0 per flight on a passenger’s first flight of the year to $177 on their twentieth flight could be used to generate $121 billion in annual revenue that could be used to pay for developing the SAF market. This would also help shift the burden from infrequent flyers to frequent flyers who are typically located in high-income countries.

While airlines and the private sector have taken small steps by engaging in offtake agreements and voluntary SAF purchases, successfully bringing SAF to market will require participation from all parties with penalties if any delay action. As I explored above, governments can ensure the largest financial contributions come from fossil jet fuel suppliers while designing cost-sharing mechanisms to offset these added costs. This follows the “polluter pays principle” where parties most responsible for pollution are the ones tasked with cleaning it up.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ID-404-SAF-cost-blog.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 19:57:01.918476

In onze berekeningen variëren deze niet-CO2-effecten tussen 2 en 4 keer het CO2-effect op de opwarming van de aarde.

De voordelen van SAF in termen van CO2-reductie zijn duidelijk, maar de klimaateffecten van de niet-CO2-emissies, zoals stikstofoxiden, waterdamp en roet, zijn veel moeilijker te berekenen en worden momenteel niet meegenomen in regelgeving zoals CORSIA en de EU-richtlijn voor hernieuwbare energie. In een wetenschappelijk rapport gepubliceerd in Nature (Open Science) berekenen onderzoekers Luc Boerboom, Arvind Gangoli Rao, Volker Grewe en Feijia Yin van de Technische Universiteit Delft een realistischer klimaateffect van vliegen op SAF door zowel de CO2- als de niet-CO2-klimaateffecten te meten. Hun conclusie: hoewel het gebruik van SAF beter is voor het milieu dan fossiele kerosine, is SAF niet klimaatneutraal.

Duurzame vliegtuigbrandstof (SAF) wordt beschouwd als een duurzamer alternatief voor fossiele kerosine. De brandstof kan worden gemaakt van restproducten, zoals gebruikte bakolie of landbouwafval, of in synthetische vorm uit waterstof en CO2 die uit de lucht wordt gehaald. Het gebruik van SAF wordt gestimuleerd door overheden en regelgevende instanties. Luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden aangemoedigd om SAF te gebruiken om hun CO2-compensatieverplichting te verminderen via het Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). De EU heeft luchtvaartmaatschappijen verplicht om in 2025 gemiddeld 2% SAF toe te voegen in Europa, oplopend tot 70% in 2050. Maar hoewel de voordelen van SAF voor de CO2-reductie duidelijk zijn, is er veel minder bekend over de klimaatimpact van niet-CO2-emissies tijdens het vliegen op SAF. CORSIA en de EU-richtlijn hernieuwbare energie houden geen rekening met de klimaatimpact van niet-CO2-emissies tijdens de vlucht, zoals stikstofoxiden (NOx), waterdamp (H2O) en roet.

Onderzoekers Luc Boerboom, Arvind Gangoli Rao, Volker Grewe en Feijia Yin van de faculteit Lucht- en Ruimtevaarttechniek van de Technische Universiteit Delft vullen die kenniskloof op. In hun wetenschappelijke rapport, gepubliceerd in Nature Open Science op 30 augustus 2025, evalueren zij de totale effecten van SAF op de opwarming van de aarde aan de hand van een uitgebreide levenscyclusanalyse, waarin zowel de klimaateffecten van de CO2-uitstoot tijdens de levenscyclus als de niet-CO2-uitstoot tijdens de vlucht zijn meegenomen.

Universitair hoofddocent Climate Effects of Aviation, dr. Feijia Yin: “Het beoordelen van de werkelijke klimaatimpact van vliegtuigtechnologie is complex. Over het algemeen is het klimaateffect van niet-CO2-emissies sterk afhankelijk van ruimte en tijd. Bijvoorbeeld: de uitstoot van NOx op vlieghoogte leidt tot een positieve stralingsforcering (opwarmend effect) omdat deze de ozonproductie versterkt. Waterdamp heeft op grote hoogte een aanzienlijk broeikasgaseffect omdat het langer in de atmosfeer blijft. Bovendien kan waterdamp die condenseert op deeltjesemissies (bijvoorbeeld roet) en bevriest tot een contrail, leiden tot een aanzienlijke opwarming van de aarde (positieve forcering), vooral 's nachts. In onze berekeningen variëren deze niet-CO2-effecten tussen 2 en 4 keer het CO2-effect op de opwarming van de aarde. Deze variatie wordt veroorzaakt door de grote onzekerheid van niet-CO2-klimaateffecten.”

De onderzoekers hebben de klimaatimpact van NOx, H2O en contrails veroorzaakt door wereldwijde vluchten in 2019 voor SAF gekwantificeerd. De totale CO2e-waarden voor de levenscyclus variëren van ongeveer 150 tot 250 g/MJ, rekening houdend met verschillende brandstofalternatieven. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de maximale vermindering van de CO2e-uitstoot bij gebruik van SAF minder dan 50% bedraagt in vergelijking met conventionele vliegtuigbrandstof, voornamelijk als gevolg van de NOx- en contraileffecten tijdens de vlucht.",https://filelist.tudelft.nl/_processed_/4/1/csm_contrails_485f6f1f70.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 00:56:50.952049

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel, also known as alternative jet fuel, is a drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel. This means it can use existing fuel distribution infrastructure and power aircraft engines without modifications. Sustainable aviation fuel helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can be made from different types of renewable sources such as biomass, organic waste or clean synthetic feed stocks using various production methods. The fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel and transported by rail, pipelines, vessels or trucks.

What will the programmatic environmental impact statement analyze?

The programmatic environmental impact statement is a planning document that takes a broad look at the potential significant adverse environmental impacts of producing and distributing sustainable aviation fuel as well as measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Projects can use this information and will also need their own individual environmental reviews.

Scoping

Scoping is the first step in developing the environmental review. We are asking for input from industry, local and state agencies, Tribes, the public and interested parties regarding what we should study. Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced, blended and distributed through a variety of ways, our scoping process will help determine which types of fuel production pathways and distribution infrastructure to evaluate. Our goal is to develop a useful, timely resource for developers, Tribes, agencies, and communities. Getting feedback is critical in determining where to focus our analysis.

The U.S. must implement new policies to kick-start production of bio-based jet fuel, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

​A new paper offers a policy road map for expanding U.S. production of sustainable aviation fuel — a move researchers say could cut climate pollution while offering a lifeline to ethanol producers buffeted by tariffs and the rise of electric vehicles.

The working paper, published Monday by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, outlines how the U.S. could meet the Biden-era goal of producing 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by 2030. The least costly, lowest-emissions option would be to eliminate all biofuel mandates and subsidies — and replace them with a carbon tax of $15 per ton of emissions and a tax credit of $4.41 per gallon of SAF, according to the paper.

That unlikely scenario serves as a “nice benchmark” for a slew of other possibilities, said Harvard University political economy professor James Stock, one of the paper’s co-authors.

Even the most powerful aircraft carriers have a critical weakness: their aircraft. A Nimitz-class ship can sail for decades on nuclear power, but its fighters burn thousands of gallons of fuel every hour.

Tankers and replenishment ships keep the air wing flying, yet they are slow, exposed and vulnerable. Disrupt that chain, and the carrier’s entire strike capability falters.

Now the US Navy is testing a technology that could make those ships almost entirely self-sufficient — by drawing jet fuel straight from the surrounding sea.

US Navy and Sea Dragon Energy develop ‘Project Genesis’ seawater-to-jet fuel system

San Diego-based Sea Dragon Energy Inc. (SDEI) has been contracted by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to demonstrate how seawater can be transformed into JP-5 jet fuel.

On 21 August 2025, ONR awarded the company a $9.5 million contract for the second-phase demonstration of its Seawater to Jet Fuel programme. That follows an earlier $19.2 million ONR contract in 2024, which funded development of a pilot “Seawater to Jet Fuel Demonstration Unit”.

Sea Dragon calls the initiative Project Genesis — a self-contained, ship-mounted system designed to extract carbon dioxide and hydrogen from seawater, then recombine them into hydrocarbons using Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, a century-old industrial process.

“It’s a major step towards truly sustainable aviation fuel for both government and commercial use,” said John Kohut, Sea Dragon’s chairman and CEO.

Texas congressman John Carter, who represents the company’s home district, described the work as “a lasting contribution to our warfighters and to the commercial sector”.

Sea Dragon’s research and development team in California aims to deliver a deployable demonstration system by 2027 — one that could operate aboard aircraft carriers or offshore platforms.

How the US Navy plans to turn seawater into JP-5 jet fuel

Seawater contains both dissolved carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the basic ingredients of hydrocarbons. The process begins by extracting these gases using electrolysis and advanced membranes.

The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) holds patents for an electrolytic cation exchange module (E-CEM) that can simultaneously capture both elements. These gases are then fed into a Fischer–Tropsch reactor, where carbon and hydrogen atoms are assembled into JP-5-grade fuel.

In 2014, NRL scientists used this method to power a scale model aircraft entirely with fuel synthesised from seawater, proving the chemistry could work. The challenge since then has been scaling production to levels that could sustain an aircraft carrier’s operations.

Early estimates suggest that, with around 200 megawatts of nuclear power, a carrier could theoretically produce up to 82,000 gallons of jet fuel per day, enough to keep multiple aircraft continuously airborne.

Advanced catalysts and AI research boost seawater fuel efficiency

The biggest technical barrier is catalysis, making the conversion process efficient and cost-effective.

Researchers at the University of Rochester and the University of Pittsburgh, supported by ONR, are developing zeolite-based bimetallic catalysts that avoid rare metals and can be tuned to produce precisely the right hydrocarbon chain lengths for jet fuel.

“Our goal is to tune hydrocarbon selectivity so we produce exactly what we need — jet fuel, not methane,” explained Professor Marc Porosoff, assistant professor of chemical engineering at Rochester. Machine-learning models are now being used to predict catalyst performance, potentially cutting years off laboratory testing.

Sea Dragon has also partnered with Emerging Fuels Technology (EFT) to integrate a pilot-scale conversion module capable of producing aviation-grade e-fuel that meets ASTM and DoD specifications.

Strategic impact: seawater-to-fuel technology could make US carriers self-sufficient

Producing jet fuel at sea could remove one of the US Navy’s most significant operational constraints. Carriers rely on long, predictable supply chains that are increasingly vulnerable to precision-strike threats.

If a carrier could synthesise its own fuel using onboard nuclear power, it would be able to operate for months or even years without resupply, effectively becoming a self-contained energy ecosystem.

Strategists say such a capability would revolutionise naval logistics. Instead of defending slow-moving fuel convoys, fleets could operate independently, drastically reducing risk in contested environments like the South China Sea or Arctic.

Technical challenges and energy limits of seawater jet fuel production

Still, the challenges are formidable. The process is energy-intensive, demanding massive electrical input and careful heat management. Materials must withstand corrosion, salt fouling and vibration in a shipboard environment.

Scaling up from laboratory reactors to a 100,000-gallon-per-day system means overcoming efficiency losses, waste-heat dissipation and reactor lifespan issues. Integration with carrier systems, fuel storage, and safety certification will all require extensive testing.

Even with nuclear energy as the power source, the economics of producing fuel at sea are uncertain. Analysts caution that Project Genesis may serve initially as a strategic resilience tool, not a wholesale replacement for tanker fleets.

Civil aviation and shipping could benefit from seawater-derived fuel

If the technology can be refined, it could also benefit civil aviation and shipping, two of the world’s hardest-to-decarbonise sectors. Synthetic fuel derived from seawater and renewable power could provide a closed-carbon-cycle alternative to fossil jet fuel.

Sea Dragon highlights fuel security, predictable costs and lower carbon impact as key advantages. In theory, any port or offshore facility with access to seawater and clean electricity could generate its own fuel, making the ocean a limitless energy resource.

By 2027, Sea Dragon hopes to demonstrate a working shipboard unit capable of producing JP-5 fuel continuously from seawater. If successful, it would mark one of the most radical advances in naval logistics since the introduction of nuclear propulsion.

For now, the idea remains a hybrid of science and ambition — but one that could, in time, let naval aviators take off knowing the ocean below can refuel them when they return.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FA-18-hornet-landing-on-USS-George-Bush.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 14:56:32.916712

The question is: Are your leaders driving accountability or waiting for an accountability crisis to arise?","We have an accountability crisis. A 2025 Culture Partners study found that 80% of employees say feedback only happens when something goes wrong, and most confuse accountability with blame. No wonder leaders struggle. Accountability has become synonymous with punishment and “being held accountable.” However, perhaps the single issue isn’t accountability, but rather a multifaceted issue of clarity, mindset and training.

Here’s a snapshot of the four stages of accountability breakdown, along with practical ways leaders can move from avoidance to alignment, where coaching replaces criticism and clarity replaces confusion.

The four phases of accountability breakdown

Phase 1: Avoidance

Leaders postpone the tough talk. Fear, lack of skill or hoping the problem disappears only makes tension build.

Phase 2: The conversation

Eventually, the leader has the talk. To their surprise, it goes smoother than expected. Relief sets in, even pride.

Phase 3: Temporary improvement The employee makes short-term changes. The leader breathes a sigh of relief, believing the storm has passed.

Phase 4: Regression Old habits creep back in. The same issues resurface. Resentment builds. The leader wonders, “Should I try again?” Document? Escalate to HR?

Distinguish responsibility and accountability

In working with hundreds of clients over 20 years, I have noticed several recurring patterns. The terms “responsibility” and “accountability” are used interchangeably. What I can say with certainty is that responsibility and accountability are distinct, yet both are necessary.

Responsibility is about ownership. It’s of the heart.

Accountability is about measurement. It’s of the head.

Here’s another important distinction: Accountability requires a witness, which is another person, for example, a leader, who confirms the measurements. You can’t be accountable without a witness. There is no such thing as “personal accountability.” There is, however, personal responsibility, which is about taking ownership. When people take ownership, they actually want measurement, and they want a coach, mentor or witness to confirm their success.

A common problem in corporations is the lack of responsibility in applying. Accountability (measurement) without personal responsibility creates mere compliance. I can’t say this enough: Change the corporate language to differentiate between responsibility and accountability, and you’ll find every single leak.

Pro tip: When the head and heart work together, accountability feels like alignment, not punishment.

Eliminate blame

The only way to eliminate blame from your culture is for the leadership to adopt a mindset and practice of 100% responsibility. A blaming mindset from any leader, especially at the top, cannot produce responsible or accountable employees. Without a responsible mindset, blame takes center stage, and accountability becomes something to avoid. An important skill is learning how to identify irresponsible language, allowing you to eliminate blame. Besides name-calling and gossip, here are some common yet less recognized examples.

Common phrases that undermine accountability:

“That’s not my job.”

“I assumed you knew…”

“They dropped the ball.”

“I didn’t have time.”

“It’s above my pay grade.”

“No one told me.”

“We’ve always done it this way.”

Some leaders may justify these statements by saying, “Well, it’s the truth.” That’s how you know there’s a responsibility problem and not an accountability problem.

Pro tip: In any area where you see recurring conflict, you’ll find an absence of responsibility and an abundance of blame.

Clarity comes before accountability

According to Gallup, only 45% of employees are aware of what’s expected of them. Without clarity, accountability is impossible. Most employees answer “no” to the question: I know what my boss expects from me at work.

Culture Partners reports that 85% of employees aren’t sure what their organizations are trying to achieve, and one-third say priorities change frequently. Confusion is the enemy of accountability.

Pro tip: In accountable cultures, employees feel free to ask for clarification about tasks and priorities.

Teach managers how to coach

The Talent Strategy Group reports that coaching conversations aren’t happening because managers lack skills and often, the right mindset. When managers view performance issues as “catch and punish” instead of “coach and support,” accountability feels unsafe.

Pro tip: Accountability grows when managers view performance conversations as opportunities to coach, rather than confront.

Quick action checklist

Leaders can start strengthening accountability this quarter by:

Defining responsibility (ownership) vs. accountability (measurement).

Auditing culture for blame-language.

Training managers to coach, not catch.

Building a culture of accountability doesn’t happen overnight, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. Accountability without blame is a competitive advantage. The question is: Are your leaders driving accountability or waiting for an accountability crisis to arise?
