LUX expects the fuel farm to be completed in 2028. Total cost of building the facility is anticipated to come to €106.5 million ($125 million). The farm will have up to six tanks, each with the capacity to store 5,000 m³ (1.3 million gal.) of aviation fuel. The facility has been designed to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The farm will increase the airport’s fuel storage capacity by 275%, according to LUX.

“With the main storage tanks positioned landside and directly connected to the highway, and a dedicated supply system extending airside, the design combines efficiency with resilience,” LUX said. “In the unlikely event of a disruption, fuel deliveries can also be secured by truck.”

Luxembourg’s Ministry of Mobility and Public Works is the contracting authority for the fuel farm project, while airport operator lux-Airport serves as the project manager.

“By significantly expanding storage capacity, the facility will ensure an uninterrupted fuel supply for airlines and partners, providing several days of operational autonomy and reinforcing supply security,” the airport said.

This fundraising effort has not only surpassed the initial target but has also set a new record, making BGTF II the largest private fund dedicated to facilitating the global transition to clean energy.
Brookfield’s previous flagship transition fund, BGTF I, had raised $15 billion and made a series of strategic investments across various energy technologies worldwide.
These partnerships strategically position Brookfield to continue leading the charge in the global transition to clean energy solutions.
Against this backdrop we need an ‘any and all’ approach to energy investment that will continue to favor low carbon resources.","Brookfield has completed the final institutional closing of its flagship energy transition strategy, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II). The fund has raised a total of $20 billion in commitments and strategic capital from a diverse group of both existing and new investors.

This fundraising effort has not only surpassed the initial target but has also set a new record, making BGTF II the largest private fund dedicated to facilitating the global transition to clean energy.

The new fund has attracted contributions from institutional investors worldwide, including several entities that are engaging with Brookfield’s transition platform for the first time. Among significant commitments are $2 billion from ALTÉRRA and $1.5 billion from Norges Bank Investment Management, both of which demonstrate strong confidence in the fund’s objectives and strategy.

Beyond these commitments, the Fund has secured around $3.5 billion in co-investments, which adds to the total capital raised for the BGTF II strategy, bringing the overall figure to approximately $23.5 billion. This capital will be instrumental in implementing the Fund’s investment strategy, which aims to promote clean energy solutions.

To date, more than $5 billion has already been allocated to a range of high-quality investments in the clean energy sector. One notable investment is in Neoen, which involved a public-to-private takeover of a leading global developer and operator of renewable power and battery storage solutions. This acquisition is expected to significantly enhance operational capabilities and expand market reach.

Another key investment was made in Geronimo Power, which entails the acquisition of a large-scale, diversified energy developer in the United States. This company holds a substantial operating and development pipeline in critical power markets, positioning Brookfield for further growth in the domestic clean energy landscape.

Additionally, the Fund has formed a joint venture with Evren in India, aimed at accelerating the development of over 10 GW of wind, solar, and storage projects. This partnership is a strategic move to tap into India’s rapidly growing renewable energy market, which offers immense potential for expansion in sustainable energy generation.

Brookfield’s previous flagship transition fund, BGTF I, had raised $15 billion and made a series of strategic investments across various energy technologies worldwide. These included renewables, carbon capture solutions, sustainable aviation fuel, and battery storage technologies, along with a significant stake in Westinghouse, a global leader in nuclear services.

Brookfield has recently established framework energy supply agreements with major technology companies, including Microsoft and Google, marking the largest deals ever made in wind, solar, and hydroelectric energy. These partnerships strategically position Brookfield to continue leading the charge in the global transition to clean energy solutions.

It includes: Mitigation Action Accounting and Reporting Guidance, which outlines ways to disclose on initiatives not covered under GHG Protocol rules.
Target Accounting and Reporting Guidance, a framework for accounting for progress against voluntary climate targets.
PepsiCo is particularly interested in using the methods for reporting on emissions reduction programs that don’t fall into Scope 2.
The task force also plans to solicit feedback through public consultation in early 2026, with a view to publishing updated versions of these documents late next year, Davis said.","Aldi, Etsy, Netflix, PepsiCo, REI and Weyerhaeuser are among more than a dozen companies testing a new methodology for disclosing the impact of climate initiatives, including replacing diesel vehicles and investing in low-carbon aviation fuel.

The guidance comes from an independent group of greenhouse gas accounting experts, led by former sustainability pros from Netflix and Amazon and formally known as the Task Force for Corporate Action Transparency. Their tools, published in late September, are meant to complement other reporting frameworks.

For example, rules from the widely used standards body Greenhouse Gas Protocol outline ways to report on actions to mitigate electricity consumption, which fall under Scope 2. They don’t address methods for discussing the impact of other activities aimed at reducing emissions such as insulating buildings, replacing diesel trucks with electric vehicles, reducing methane emissions from livestock and closing down a business unit as part of a merger.

Those methods often relate to Scope 3, which covers emissions from a company’s business partners and customers.

“I would underscore the idea that there has been an explosion of these instruments,” said Chris Davis, a former Amazon executive, who is interim director for the Task Force for Corporate Action Transparency. “The avenues for progress have outpaced the ability to talk about it.”

“Companies are becoming more sophisticated, and in trying to meet their targets, they are implementing various programs to reduce emissions in their operations and supply chains,” said Noora Singh, senior director of sustainability at PepsiCo. “Unfortunately, the current standards and approaches lack the level of detail and sophistication needed to reflect or record these activities in reporting.”

Common frustration

The lack of disclosure guidance threatens to stall the adoption of approaches emerging to support the adoption of technologies such as sustainable aviation fuel and zero-emissions vehicles. These methods allow corporations to “claim” the environmental benefits related to buying into specific projects or contracts, even if they aren’t directly using the services.

“Under existing standards, it’s unclear how companies can participate,” said Sam Brundrett, environmental impact lead at Etsy. “That ambiguity doesn’t just create hesitation; it threatens to stall action altogether precisely when speed and scale matter most.”

Etsy’s role as a marketplace makes it difficult to directly control emissions reductions, he said.

The Task Force for Corporate Action Transparency was born two years ago through informal discussions. “When I was at Netflix implementing and building our strategy, I wanted to start reporting on all these things we were doing, and I was looking for disclosure guidance,” said Alexia Kelly, now managing director of the carbon policy and markets initiative at High Tide Foundation. “There was no uniform guidance.”

The group’s initial guidance was written to stand up to third-party assurance by organizations that verify ESG disclosures. It includes:

Mitigation Action Accounting and Reporting Guidance, which outlines ways to disclose on initiatives not covered under GHG Protocol rules.

Target Accounting and Reporting Guidance, a framework for accounting for progress against voluntary climate targets.

PepsiCo is particularly interested in using the methods for reporting on emissions reduction programs that don’t fall into Scope 2. “We have a number of initiatives, whether it’s upstream in our ag supply chain for fertilizer production, third-party transportation switching to alternative or electric vehicles or various on-farm practices, and it would be helpful to test all of these using that accounting document,” Singh said.

What’s next

The group enlisted corporate reporting professionals to test its guidance in 2025 and 2026; it may add a few others aside from the dozen-plus companies already committed to the pilot, said Davis.

The task force also plans to solicit feedback through public consultation in early 2026, with a view to publishing updated versions of these documents late next year, Davis said.

The group is aligning its guidance to updates under way at the GHG Protocol, which is revising many of its rules as part of an extensive overhaul, Davis said. It is also in conversation with other standards bodies including the Science Based Targets initiative, the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets, the Center for Green Market Activation, the California Air Resources Board and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative.

“The hope is not that this becomes the definitive solution but rather that the established standards, once updated, will adopt some of the approaches proposed by [the task force] and incorporate them into official guidance,” said Singh.

“We want to inform existing systems and move forward,” Kelly said. “We just want this problem solved.”",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trellis_editorial_pepsico_disclosure_1470x894.png,N,,2025-10-07 15:56:10.403375

Izzard said about 3 in 5 of the company’s 5,000 customer support personnel work in Savannah.
Combined with its main Savannah customer support campus, now known as Service Center West, the facilities represent the largest service footprint in business aviation, Gulfstream said.","SAVANNAH, Georgia—Here outside Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (KSAV), it’s Gulfstream Aerospace as far as the eye can see.

When Mark Burns joined Gulfstream as an engineer in 1983, the company had about 100 employees. The G-IV—which would go on to become one of the world’s most popular business jets—had only just been conceived.

Now, as company president, Burns leads a global team comprising more than 20,000 employees. Nearly two-thirds of them work in Savannah and its suburbs, where the company has become a ubiquitous presence—and the city’s largest private employer.

“We’ll continue to grow here in Savannah,” Burns told reporters last week at the company’s annual gathering at its headquarters. “It is our home.”

Gulfstream is also Georgia’s largest manufacturer. Its production, completions, and customer support service facilities combined occupy more than 4 million square feet in Savannah.

Per Burns, the company has about 3,300 aircraft in service. It has delivered more than 350 G500 and G600 models, introduced in 2018 and 2019, respectively. It delivered its 50th G700 in May, about one year after certification. The G800—the world’s longest-range business jet—entered service in August, replacing the Collier Trophy-winning G650.

The G400, which awaits certification, is undergoing flight testing. This week, Gulfstream unveiled the newest member of its next-generation fleet of ultra-long-range twin-engines—the G300.

“Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia are all continuing to grow,” said Burns. “We’re fortunate that our brand is really a global brand now.”

The super-midsize G300 will be the sixth model Gulfstream has introduced in just over a decade. According to Lor Izzard, senior vice president of customer support, that investment in aircraft is being “matched” by investments in new facilities, technologies, and personnel.

John Kenan, Gulfstream’s senior vice president of operations, said the company expects to make about 150 global deliveries in 2025. The bulk of them come out of Savannah, where it owns more than 3 million square feet of manufacturing and completion facilities for the G400 through G800.

In December, Gulfstream produced its thousandth wing in Savannah. Kenan gave FLYING a tour of the wing production facility, which he said churns out one every 2.5 manufacturing days. Adjacent to that site is the building that produces fuselages for the G500 and G600, as well as the G400 following a 142,000-square-foot expansion in 2023. The G700 and G800 fuselages are produced in separate hubs nearby.

As the manufacturing operation has exploded, Gulfstream gave itself the ability to be flexible to shifts in demand. The G700 production line, for example, could be used to produce the G800—and vice versa—because the manufacturing processes are so similar.

“We’ve invested heavily in new design fixturing and tooling, which actually was created here in Savannah with our own research and development center,” Kenan said. “And how we manufacture aircraft is unique to the rest of the industry.”

The G300, like the G280 it will replace, is being built and tested in the Middle East in partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries. But research and development for the model is based in Savannah, where nearly 2,600 Gulfstream engineers work with state-of-the-art laboratories and simulators.

At Your Service

More aircraft in service means more resources are required to service the aircraft. By that token, Gulfstream has also invested heavily in customer support services—to the tune of $620 million over 10 years.

In Savannah, the company’s customer support footprint covers more than 1.1 million square feet. Its 10 hangars, occupying more than 550,000 square feet, can accommodate 85 aircraft at a time. These facilities handle modifications, inspections, and repairs for fuselages, flight controls, engines, wings, hydraulics, wheels, and landing gear, as well as avionics upgrades and aircraft redesign. Also on-site is a fuel farm that can hold up to 30,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Izzard said about 3 in 5 of the company’s 5,000 customer support personnel work in Savannah. He added that Gulfstream has invested more in personnel training over the past 12 months than in its entire history.

Izzard walked FLYING through the company’s 367,000-square-foot Service Center East, which was expanded in July 2024. It has poured more than $150 million into the facility, which has two hangars each capable of servicing up to 13 aircraft at once. The building handles both scheduled maintenance and drop-ins for the G300 through G800. Gulfstream in September, for instance, installed its hundredth SpaceX Starlink system, which Izzard said is a particularly popular request.

Combined with its main Savannah customer support campus, now known as Service Center West, the facilities represent the largest service footprint in business aviation, Gulfstream said.

Gulfstream’s Georgia Roots

With customers around the world, Gulfstream has invested heavily beyond Savannah.

Its support network includes MRO facilities in California, Wisconsin, Texas, Florida, and the U.K. In January, it opened a new, 225,000-square-foot customer support and MRO center at Mesa Gateway Airport (KIWA) in Arizona, from which it uses a fleet of Pilatus PC-12s to deliver spare parts to the West Coast.

The company has also expanded its Field and Airborne Support Teams (FAST), which travel around the world to provide 24/7 on-site support. As of April, it had more than 150 FAST technicians across 24 bases worldwide. According to Izzard, the team has grown 40 percent in the past 18 months.

But Gulfstream has no plans to dig up its roots in Georgia, which it has called home for nearly 60 years.

Burns estimated that the company has hired about 5,000 Savannah personnel since 2016. It maintains partnerships with high schools, colleges, and universities to create a pipeline of local talent. Its Savannah Technical Training Center, for example, hosted more than 140,000 hours of training for about 2,000 new employees in 2024 alone.

“This community has been good for Gulfstream,” Burns said. “We have invested significantly in the education system here, and it has paid off in dividends.”

There could be more to come. With the G400 approaching certification and scaled production—and the G300 waiting in the wings—Gulfstream may need to spend even more on Savannah.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/IMG_2055-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:57:00.247561

The initiative underscores SAF’s vital role in advancing the industry’s sustainability goals.

NBAA-BACE will be held from Oct. 14 to 16 at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Henderson Executive Airport (HND). Airport-based fuel providers will offer SAF at HND and North Las Vegas Airport (VGT).

Additionally, several original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are expected to fly their aircraft to the HND Aircraft Connection using either physical SAF or SAF attributes via book-and-claim.

Book-and-claim programs offered by airport fixed-base operators (FBOs) and fuel suppliers make it possible for operators to purchase SAF attributes even when it’s not physically available on-site.

Operators using book-and-claim upload traditional fossil-based fuel at a participating FBO or fuel supplier, but they also receive credit for buying SAF at another airport where SAF is available.

The process creates a system that allows operators to offset their use of fossil-based fuel.

SAF, which can reduce aviation’s lifecycle carbon emissions by as much as 80 percent over traditional fuels, is a key part of business aviation’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

“By making SAF available to operators at NBAA-BACE, we’re highlighting the importance of expanding its production, accessibility and adoption,” said NBAA president and CEO Ed Bolen.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a key element of our industry’s long-term strategy to reduce emissions.”

The availability of SAF as part of NBAA-BACE reflects the show’s broader sustainability focus – for example:

The convention includes a two-day Business Aviation Sustainability Summit to showcase the most important developments shaping business aviation’s path to net-zero carbon emissions.

NBAA is again offering an Exhibitor Sustainability Pledge aimed at making 2025 NBAA-BACE one of the most sustainable trade shows.

The convention week will also mark the two-year anniversary of the industry’s CLIMBING. FAST. advocacy initiative, which underscores business aviation’s societal benefits with policymakers and opinion leaders, including sustainability leadership.

SAF is a term for any jet fuel made from renewable sources – like plant oils, waste materials, and even captured carbon – designed to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

The two parties signed a Letter of Intent at a recent business event in Yokohama to expand collaboration in an area still in its infancy across Africa.

It establishes a framework for cooperation to jointly promote development, information and knowledge sharing, and to explore co-financing opportunities for SAF and other green aviation solutions in Africa.

JGC Corporation will conduct demand studies for SAF in African markets, perform technical feasibility assessments, evaluate deployment opportunities tailored to local resources and infrastructure, and harness and facilitate Japanese technology adoption to Africa in this regard.

The Japanese engineering giant is already a leading player in what is expected to be a fast-evolving strand in the air transport industry in the coming years.

“By leveraging our experience in plant engineering and sustainable energy, we aim to contribute to Africa’s decarbonisation efforts while fostering local economic growth and innovation,” said Shoji Yamada, JGC Corporation’s president.

The production and adoption of SAF in Africa is consistent with the AfDB’s sustainable transport and mobility and energy transition strategy, said Solomon Quaynor, the bank’s vice-president for private sector, infrastructure and industrialisation.

On its side the AfDB will facilitate coordination and dialogue with public sector aviation stakeholders, identify potential project pipelines, and explore possible financing options, including feasibility study support and promoting global partnerships around the concept in Africa, as well as debt and equity financing.

“Adopting sustainable aviation fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” said Quaynor.

“Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time. This partnership with JGC will help unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector.”

Since the 1980s, the JGC Group has accumulated a wealth of project experience in Africa, providing engineering services including EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) for numerous refineries, among other facilities.

It has also been a key player in the development of some the continent’s major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects, successfully completing onshoreLNG plants in Nigeria and Egypt, as well as an offshore LNG plant in Mozambique.

In addition, it is currently providing basic design services for the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique and conducting early work for another undisclosed offshore LNG plant in Africa.

Passenger traffic through Dubai International is expected to exceed 100 million within 18 months, cementing the emirate’s status as a global mobility hub.
Space joins the flight path Space, once peripheral to the Airshow, now stands alongside aviation at its core.
In his words, “The Dubai Airshow is not just going to be about a traditional wave of showing aircraft and closing deals,” he said.
The Airshow will include 12 conference tracks and four main stages covering green fuels, airport technology, cybersecurity and workforce development.","Twenty national pavilions, 12 conference tracks, and four main stages will host over 90 hours of content, while a vast static display will present the industry’s most advanced commercial, military and urban-mobility aircraft side by side.

Griffiths described the show as “not just a major international platform, but a centre of innovation where great ideas take flight.”

He adds, the world’s most visionary minds will gather to “showcase technology you can hardly believe is real when you see it in front of you.”

With that being said, here are 5 key takeaways from the Dubai Airshow Press Conference

1. Aviation’s widening remit beyond traditional flight

The panel opened by reminding the audience how aviation has evolved from basic transport into a dynamic ecosystem at the heart of the global economy. Now valued at around $4 trillion, it is, in Griffiths’s words, “the lifeblood of human connectivity.”

Dubai’s own aviation story mirrors that expansion. Passenger traffic through Dubai International is expected to exceed 100 million within 18 months, cementing the emirate’s status as a global mobility hub.

The 2025 theme, The Future is Here, signifies not just a display of next-generation aircraft, but an ambition to catalyse technologies and partnerships shaping aviation’s next phase.

The Airshow itself is being reimagined as a convergence of ideas, technology and investment.

2. Space joins the flight path

Space, once peripheral to the Airshow, now stands alongside aviation at its core.

His Excellency Dr Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi, UAE Minister of Education and Chairman of the UAE Space Agency, explained that “the line between atmospheric space and space itself is becoming more blurred, and because Dubai is a city of the future, we want to be well positioned.”

Participation from global space entities has increased by more than 80 per cent, with a near-doubling of private-sector involvement.

Al Falasi tells the audience, “Any successful space economy starts with a big investment by the government,” adding, “you can only truly succeed once you’ve empowered your private sector.”

The inclusion of international space-agency heads alongside commercial enterprises, “signifies a global recognition of the Dubai Airshow as a legitimate space platform… this is the future, and this is why space is part of the Airshow.”

3. Technology takes centre stage

For His Excellency Omran Sharaf, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs for Advanced Science and Technology, the 2025 edition is about far more than static aircraft and order books.

In his words, “The Dubai Airshow is not just going to be about a traditional wave of showing aircraft and closing deals,” he said. “It’s an opportunity to showcase the technologies of the future.”

Artificial intelligence, automation and digital infrastructure will be major themes, alongside electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs), drones and hybrid propulsion systems, all supported by Dubai’s new regulatory framework.

His Excellency Mohammed Abdulla Lengawi, Director-General of the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority, confirmed that “by 2026, the air taxi will be launched in Dubai,” with drone-delivery operations expanding to cover “30 per cent of Dubai now and 70 per cent within five years.”

These developments, he said, will position the UAE as a world leader in advanced air mobility, where traditional and digital-era flight coexist under one policy framework.

4. Sustainability drives the agenda

Sustainability will be the unifying thread across the 2025 edition. Aircraft will operate on sustainable aviation fuel, and exhibitors will highlight decarbonisation, circular supply chains and eco-design.

The Airshow will include 12 conference tracks and four main stages covering green fuels, airport technology, cybersecurity and workforce development.

Organisers confirmed that sustainability is embedded into every facet of the event, from build-up logistics to catering, transportation and hospitality.

The panel noted that these efforts reflect Dubai’s vision for “growth that is environmentally conscious yet globally ambitious.”

5. Partnerships, people and purpose

If the show’s technology dazzles, its human focus grounds it. His Excellency Khalifa Al Zaffin, Executive Chairman of Dubai Aviation City Corporation, emphasised that 2025 will be “bigger from every angle, exhibition, pavilions, and quality.”

The Airshow, he said, “has already won global recognition, but this year’s event will be even better.” The week will welcome more than 1,000 students and 35 universities for workshops and competitions aimed at inspiring the next generation of aerospace talent.

“It’s not about business and commercial interests alone,” Sharaf states. “It’s about building relationships between nations.”, an embrace of the some 98 international delgates due to attend.

Eugene Barry, Chief Commercial Officer at Dubai Airports and Chairman of the Dubai Airshow Project Board, joined the conversation by describing the event as “the culmination of a year-long collaboration across Dubai’s aviation ecosystem.”

The traditional Thursday gala dinner, he said, “is our chance to thank the industry and celebrate the success of Dubai’s aviation community, it’s the highlight of Airshow week and unlike anything else in the world.”

The gala dinner, is the greatly anticipated culmination of the week.

Hey fellow impactful ninja ?

You may have noticed that Impactful Ninja is all about providing helpful information to make a positive impact on the world and society. And that we love to link back to where we found all the information for each of our posts.

Most of these links are informational-based for you to check out their primary sources with one click.

But some of these links are so-called ""affiliate links"" to products that we recommend.

Why do we add these product links?

First and foremost, because we believe that they add value to you. For example, when we wrote a post about the environmental impact of long showers, we came across an EPA recommendation to use WaterSense showerheads. So we linked to where you can find them. Or, for many of our posts, we also link to our favorite books on that topic so that you can get a much more holistic overview than one single blog post could provide.

And when there is an affiliate program for these products, we sign up for it. For example, as Amazon Associates, we earn from qualifying purchases.

What do these affiliate links mean for you?

First, and most importantly, we still only recommend products that we believe add value for you.

When you buy something through one of our affiliate links, we may earn a small commission - but at no additional costs to you.

And when you buy something through a link that is not an affiliate link, we won’t receive any commission but we’ll still be happy to have helped you.

What do these affiliate links mean for us?

When we find products that we believe add value to you and the seller has an affiliate program, we sign up for it.

When you buy something through one of our affiliate links, we may earn a small commission (at no extra costs to you).

And at this point in time, all money is reinvested in sharing the most helpful content with you. This includes all operating costs for running this site and the content creation itself.

What does this mean for me personally?

You may have noticed by the way Impactful Ninja is operated that money is not the driving factor behind it. It is a passion project of mine and I love to share helpful information with you to make a positive impact on the world and society. However, it's a project in that I invest a lot of time and also quite some money.

Eventually, my dream is to one day turn this passion project into my full-time job and provide even more helpful information. But that's still a long time to go.

Washington, DC, Oct. 7, 2025 – In collaboration with industry partners, the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is making sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available at Las Vegas-area airports in conjunction with the 2025 NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE).

The initiative underscores SAF’s vital role in advancing the industry’s sustainability goals.

NBAA-BACE will be held from Oct. 14-16 at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Henderson Executive Airport (HND). Airport-based fuel providers will offer SAF at HND and North Las Vegas Airport (VGT).

Additionally, several OEMs are expected to fly their aircraft to the HND Aircraft Connection using either physical SAF or SAF attributes via book-and-claim. Book-and-claim programs offered by airport FBOs and fuel suppliers make it possible for operators to purchase SAF attributes even when it’s not physically available on-site.

Operators using book-and-claim upload traditional fossil-based fuel at a participating FBO or fuel supplier, but they also receive credit for buying SAF at another airport where SAF is available. The process creates a system that allows operators to offset their use of fossil-based fuel.

SAF, which can reduce aviation’s lifecycle carbon emissions by as much as 80% over traditional fuels, is a key part of business aviation’s plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

“By making SAF available to operators at NBAA-BACE, we’re highlighting the importance of expanding its production, accessibility and adoption,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “Sustainable aviation fuel is a key element of our industry’s long-term strategy to reduce emissions.”

The availability of SAF as part of NBAA-BACE reflects the show’s broader sustainability focus – for example:

The convention includes a two-day Business Aviation Sustainability Summit to showcase the most important developments shaping business aviation’s path to net-zero carbon emissions.

NBAA is again offering an Exhibitor Sustainability Pledge aimed at making 2025 NBAA-BACE one of the most sustainable trade shows.

The convention week will also mark the two-year anniversary of the industry’s CLIMBING. FAST. advocacy initiative, which underscores business aviation’s societal benefits with policymakers and opinion leaders, including sustainability leadership.

Learn more about the latest developments in SAF.

Taking place Oct. 14-16, NBAA-BACE is the world’s most powerful business aviation event of the year, showcasing the industry’s latest innovations and services, and hosting the leaders who are shaping its future. Learn more about NBAA-BACE.

This initiative aims to power aircraft with cleaner-burning fuel made from renewable sources, reports OFI.

Jane Hupe, a deputy director at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), stated that India possesses ample raw materials to not only meet its own future demand for this green fuel but also to become an exporter.

“India will be producing this new aviation fuel before the year is over,” Hupe was quoted as saying. Production is expected to begin at a refinery in Panipat, operated by Indian Oil Corporation.

While official rules requiring airlines to blend SAF with conventional fuel start in 2027, Hupe noted that starting production early, even with potential minor delays, is a crucial step that will build confidence in the new industry.

The official’s visit to India involved discussions on a recent study that highlighted the country’s strong potential. The report pointed to India’s vast supply of agricultural waste and other biomass, estimated at hundreds of millions of tonnes, which can be used as feedstock to produce the fuel.

The study also identified several methods for producing the fuel in India. The initial method, which uses used cooking oil, is considered a proven technology and ready for immediate use. Another method using alcohol is also being explored.

To support the growth of this new sector, the report suggested the Indian government consider policies like blending mandates, financial incentives, and strategies to create a stable market.

Seven and a half centuries since a small community that built a dam in the Amstel River grew into the international commercial and cultural centre we know today.
From the very beginning, Amsterdam met the challenges of its watery environment with a spirit of commerce, creativity, and innovation.
Not only in Amsterdam, but across Europe and the world.
Europe can reach net-zero by 2050 if the EU and the private sector work closely together with Europe’s great cities; the international business hubs and centres of innovation.","Let me begin by extending a very warm welcome to all of you who have travelled here from cities across the Netherlands, Europe, and perhaps even further. It is a pleasure and a privilege for Amsterdam to host this important gathering of business leaders and policymakers.

You have come at a special time. In just twenty days, Amsterdam celebrates its 750th birthday. Seven and a half centuries since a small community that built a dam in the Amstel River grew into the international commercial and cultural centre we know today. From the very beginning, Amsterdam met the challenges of its watery environment with a spirit of commerce, creativity, and innovation.

That same spirit is needed again today. Not only in Amsterdam, but across Europe and the world.

Our current economic model has reached its limits. We must transform our “take-make-waste” economies into ones that reduce, reuse, and redesign.

The good news is that there is a growing consensus around Mario Draghi’s call to combine the ambition to decarbonise the European economy with the drive to make it more competitive.

As Draghi wrote in The Economist:

“The EU has reached a point where, without action, it will have to compromise either its welfare, the environment, or its freedom.”

Amsterdam fully embraces Draghi’s recommendations. As well as the EU’s Clean Industrial Deal. Europe can reach net-zero by 2050 if the EU and the private sector work closely together with Europe’s great cities; the international business hubs and centres of innovation.

Cities are the key to a competitive, zero-emission Europe. They attract the talent needed for success. They provide the cultural atmosphere where open minds, free thinkers, and entrepreneurs can thrive. Europe’s great cities embody the very values on which we can build the Green Deal: democracy, rule of law, innovation, openness, human rights, and international cooperation.

They unite deep historical roots with an unshakable belief in progress and in never ceasing to imagine the future.

Let me name a few tangible examples from Amsterdam. The Port of Amsterdam is decarbonising rapidly: with 340,000 square metres of solar panels, wind turbines powering 20,000 households, and a complete hydrogen chain under development, the port is becoming a hub for the energy transition. Amsterdam is also home to Fairphone, the company that makes the world’s most sustainable smartphone.

Built from recycled and ethically sourced materials. And SkyNRG, another Amsterdam-based pioneer, has built Europe’s first sustainable aviation fuel plant in the Netherlands. From re-use of building materials to groundbreaking battery technology, these examples show that the green transformation is already underway in Europe’s cities.

Cities like Amsterdam are eager to work with the business sector. In return, we need the support of forward-thinking and responsible business leaders. Because our shared values are under pressure. Around the world, authoritarian regimes are reshaping capitalism to serve power, privilege, and prejudice.",https://www.amsterdam.nl/publish/varianten/615/logo_voor_social.png,N,,2025-10-07 07:59:04.795430

The pilot is strategically placed in Delhi due to a critical piece of existing infrastructure: a dedicated pipeline from the Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) Panipat refinery, which supplies Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) directly to the airport depot. IOC recently received certification to produce SAF, which will initially be a blend created using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. Crucially, the feedstock for this fuel includes readily available domestic resources like used cooking oil and even rice straw (parali).

The launch comes as India is in the process of framing a comprehensive national policy to support the SAF segment. This effort aligns with India's commitments under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which applies to international flights. While India chose not to participate in the voluntary phases, offsetting requirements for Indian carriers will become mandatory starting in 2027.

To meet these future obligations, the Centre is planning indicative blending targets, starting with a one per cent SAF blend in ATF in 2027, escalating to two per cent in 2028, and aiming for five per cent by 2030.

Union Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu has expressed confidence in India's potential to become a global leader in SAF production, citing two primary natural advantages. ""The first advantage is our geography, which allows us to become an exporter, and the second is the massive availability of feedstock,"" the Minister explained.

India's potential feedstock capacity is immense, with over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue that can be converted into SAF. This enormous domestic supply capability is projected to exceed India's own domestic demand, positioning the country to become a major exporter of green fuel. Given that India currently exports about 50% of its ATF production, this transition into a SAF exporter appears to be a natural progression, underscoring the nation's commitment to sustainability in the global aviation industry.

Even though other airplanes, likely from other carriers, are the ones receiving the SAF molecules in their fuel, the airline purchasing the SAF gets credit for its use.
Importantly, there’s a second component to the SAF certificate system that allows for the allocation of SAF GHG reductions to individual travelers or air-freight shippers.
According to IATA accounting principles, the airline should retire Scope 3 SAF certificates on your behalf and use your fare premium towards SAF purchases.
In the European Union and the United Kingdom, SAF blending mandates came into effect at the start of 2025, but in other jurisdictions, the vast majority of SAF use is supported by selling SAF certificates to business customers and thus should not be claimed by other passengers.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a “drop-in” fuel that can be mixed with fossil jet fuel and used in existing fueling infrastructure and engines. Once SAF is mixed with conventional jet fuel, it cannot be physically traced. So how do airlines know how much SAF is used on their flights? And how does SAF use by airlines affect your personal carbon footprint? Welcome to the world of SAF accounting.

I’ll tackle the first question, the easier one, by explaining mass-balance accounting. This practice is used when chemically identical feedstocks with unique environmental characteristics are blended. In mass-balance accounting, the mass of SAF blended into the fuel system is matched to an equivalent mass of fuel being withdrawn by the fuel purchaser even though the original fuel molecules have not been directly traced. This allows a SAF purchaser to claim SAF use even if most of the fuel molecules in shared fuel supply infrastructure are of fossil origin.

But what if SAF is not even supplied to a specific airport/location? Can SAF use still be claimed for departing flights? This is where book-and-claim accounting comes in. In this practice, a fuel supplier mixes SAF into the shared jet fuel infrastructure at another airport on behalf of the airline making the purchase. Even though other airplanes, likely from other carriers, are the ones receiving the SAF molecules in their fuel, the airline purchasing the SAF gets credit for its use.

If an airline gets credit for SAF uplifted into aircraft from a different carrier, how can we be sure that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from SAF use are properly tracked and the other airline isn’t also claiming credit (i.e., double counting)? For this the aviation industry is developing a system of SAF “proof of sustainability” certificates that document each batch of SAF production and its environmental characteristics. If SAF crediting is further checked and verified against a central trusted registry—for example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s recently announced SAF Registry—users can be more confident in the correct attribution of fuel.

As shown in the figure, SAF sustainability certificates are tracked in registries that log SAF purchases. Each certificate also records information on the volume and type of SAF produced and its life-cycle GHG emissions intensity. Airlines purchasing the SAF are given custody of a corresponding certificate that indicates the purchased SAF was mixed into the aviation fuel system for use. If there is a one-to-one ratio between the quantity of certificates purchased and the volume of SAF uplifted, then there has been no double counting within corporate GHG reporting. And if life-cycle analysis best practices are followed, it’s reasonable to assume that GHG reduction estimates on SAF certificates are robust.

Now we can turn to the second question about personal carbon footprint. Importantly, there’s a second component to the SAF certificate system that allows for the allocation of SAF GHG reductions to individual travelers or air-freight shippers. These end-user certificates are known as Scope 3 certificates because a business’s air travel emissions are covered under the Scope 3 emissions category of the GHG Protocol corporate emissions accounting framework. The Scope 3 certificates determine which passengers can claim a lower carbon footprint based on the use of SAF. The recently released IATA accounting and reporting methodology states that airlines can only represent lower per-seat emissions to customers if the Scope 3 certificates have been retired by the airline on their customers’ behalf. If, instead, these Scope 3 certificates are sold to corporations to offset emissions from a business’s travel or shipping activities, only the corporation purchasing the Scope 3 certificates can claim a reduced carbon footprint.

So, what happens if you purchase a SAF upgrade to offset CO2 emissions on a personal flight? According to IATA accounting principles, the airline should retire Scope 3 SAF certificates on your behalf and use your fare premium towards SAF purchases. Note, though, that reduced GHG fare options may also potentially combine a carbon offset from another sector with a SAF purchase to arrive at the total GHG reduction value on the ticket.

Is SAF reducing the climate impact of my travel?

You may be wondering if SAF is likely to be reducing your personal carbon footprint right now. Unless you’re purchasing SAF upgrades or flying in Europe, the answer is probably no. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, SAF blending mandates came into effect at the start of 2025, but in other jurisdictions, the vast majority of SAF use is supported by selling SAF certificates to business customers and thus should not be claimed by other passengers.

It’s also important to remember that, on a global basis, the current impact of SAF on aviation emissions is minimal. In 2024, SAF accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production. So, for now, it’s safe to assume that the majority of fuel on most flights is conventional jet fuel derived from petroleum.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ID-377-SAF-credit-864x576.png,N,,2025-10-07 03:56:10.132809

France-based Waga Energy on Sept. 29 released financial results for its fiscal half year, the six months ended June 30, reporting a 7% increase in total revenue, which was driven by a 39% increase in renewable natural gas (RNG) production revenues.

The company’s portfolio of landfill gas-to-RNG projects injected 326 gigawatt hours (GWh), or 1.1 million MMBtu, of RNG across France, Spain, Canada and the U.S., a 28% increase when compared to same period of 2024. That volume of RNG production avoided an estimated 80,500 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions by displacing fossil natural gas in energy grids.

Bringing down the costs of SAF via strategies including public and private investment, market measures, and cost sharing is crucial for building widespread support for its deployment. This piece explores both the challenges and opportunities for bringing down the cost of SAF.

Although SAF can be made from many different materials and conversion processes, all of them are currently costlier than fossil jet fuel. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency estimated that the average production cost of SAF in 2024 ranged from €1,461 per tonne (for biofuels) to €7,695 per tonne (for e-fuels). We calculate that this is a cost premium of 2.1–10.6x compared with fossil jet fuel by converting fossil jet production costs from the International Energy Agency, reported in U.S. dollars per liter, into equivalent units. While e-fuel costs should come down when they arrive on the market around 2030, they are expected to remain far above the current price of fossil jet fuel.

The cost of SAF is primarily driven by the cost of its feedstock. For example, virgin vegetable oil is more expensive than the kerosene it is displacing. Making waste-based SAF with high cellulosic content is expensive due to inefficient supply chains for sourcing raw material and the enzymes needed to break down feedstocks into “drop-in” fuel. E-fuels, meanwhile, require high quantities of renewable electricity to produce renewable hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen produced via electrolysis using 100% renewable electricity) and extract diluted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Risk of investment

It takes up to 5 years for SAF projects to reach final investment decision—a critical stage during project development that indicates whether projects are ready to move forward to construction—and many projects fail before this is achieved. Earlier this year, consulting group BCG found that fewer than 30% of SAF projects globally have reached final investment decision. Often projects come apart due to technology “valleys of death” during the transition between the demonstration and commercialization stages. This can be the result of poor project financing, mismanagement, or unforeseen technical barriers. SAF projects require significant funding and investor backing, particularly when constructing first-of-a-kind (FOAK) facilities. If funding support fluctuates (as it has with the recently revised 45Z tax credits in the United States), if producers cannot secure long-term offtake agreements, or if governments and other investors do not provide sufficient loan support, SAF projects may fail before final investment decision.

Fulcrum BioEnergy, which broke ground on a plant in Reno, Nevada, in 2016 and filed for bankruptcy in 2024, serves as a cautionary tale for FAOK facility deployment. The project failed in part because plant managers did not prepare for technical challenges similar to those that arose during a previous high-profile gasification project, the project failed to meet overly optimistic production deadlines, and representatives overstated progress that cost them the trust of investors. An expert retrospective assessment of this case suggests that greater transparency, improved risk management, and the use of third-party assessments could help future FOAK projects move from the development to commercialization stage.

From a financial perspective, investing in “advanced” SAF pathways requires a combination of “technology push” and “market pull” to overcome the “valleys of death” and reach commercialization. As of now, regions such as the United Kingdom and European Union have put SAF mandates in place with penalties for non-compliance; these are examples of a market pull. However, airlines have criticized the high cost of SAF purchases and called on regulators in these regions to review the timeline and trajectory of mandates amidst rising prices. Additionally, rather than being part of the technology push, the fossil fuel industry appears slow to act.

Market mechanisms

The United Kingdom has offered more than £200 million in upfront grant funding to second-generation SAF projects via its Advanced Fuels Fund, a form of technology push. This is paired with its SAF mandate and revenue certainty mechanism, which will take effect by the end of 2026; both act as a “market pull.” The revenue certainty mechanism allows SAF producers to enter into a 15-year contract with a counterparty to set a fixed guaranteed strike price (GSP) on fuel production. When the market price of SAF falls below the GSP, producers are reimbursed by the UK government for all financial losses below that price. When the market price is higher than the GSP, producers must return any profits above that price. We illustrate this cost sharing relationship in Figure 1 (below).

The UK revenue certainty mechanism is funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers that covers the cost of SAF payments and administrative overhead for the counterparty. This is a promising example of a policy that can be efficient, provide longer-term investor certainty, and be paid for in-sector. Other proposed funding mechanisms such as a double-sided auction can help minimize the costs of operating the scheme by introducing an auction on both supply (SAF producer) and demand (SAF offtakers).

Airlines and individuals downstream of the fossil fuel supply chain can also share in the costs of supporting aviation sector decarbonization. Airlines can enter into offtake agreements with SAF producers to meet company-level sustainability goals or partner with businesses to procure voluntary SAF via Scope 3 certificates. When these emissions reductions are properly tracked and accounted for in registries, they can be an effective way for customers to mitigate the costs of SAF procurement at any location around the world.

Regarding individual consumers, a 2022 ICCT study found that a levy rising from $0 per flight on a passenger’s first flight of the year to $177 on their twentieth flight could be used to generate $121 billion in annual revenue that could be used to pay for developing the SAF market. This would also help shift the burden from infrequent flyers to frequent flyers who are typically located in high-income countries.

While airlines and the private sector have taken small steps by engaging in offtake agreements and voluntary SAF purchases, successfully bringing SAF to market will require participation from all parties with penalties if any delay action. As I explored above, governments can ensure the largest financial contributions come from fossil jet fuel suppliers while designing cost-sharing mechanisms to offset these added costs. This follows the “polluter pays principle” where parties most responsible for pollution are the ones tasked with cleaning it up.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ID-404-SAF-cost-blog.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 19:57:01.918476

De voordelen van SAF in termen van CO2-reductie zijn duidelijk, maar de klimaateffecten van de niet-CO2-emissies, zoals stikstofoxiden, waterdamp en roet, zijn veel moeilijker te berekenen en worden momenteel niet meegenomen in regelgeving zoals CORSIA en de EU-richtlijn voor hernieuwbare energie. In een wetenschappelijk rapport gepubliceerd in Nature (Open Science) berekenen onderzoekers Luc Boerboom, Arvind Gangoli Rao, Volker Grewe en Feijia Yin van de Technische Universiteit Delft een realistischer klimaateffect van vliegen op SAF door zowel de CO2- als de niet-CO2-klimaateffecten te meten. Hun conclusie: hoewel het gebruik van SAF beter is voor het milieu dan fossiele kerosine, is SAF niet klimaatneutraal.

Duurzame vliegtuigbrandstof (SAF) wordt beschouwd als een duurzamer alternatief voor fossiele kerosine. De brandstof kan worden gemaakt van restproducten, zoals gebruikte bakolie of landbouwafval, of in synthetische vorm uit waterstof en CO2 die uit de lucht wordt gehaald. Het gebruik van SAF wordt gestimuleerd door overheden en regelgevende instanties. Luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden aangemoedigd om SAF te gebruiken om hun CO2-compensatieverplichting te verminderen via het Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). De EU heeft luchtvaartmaatschappijen verplicht om in 2025 gemiddeld 2% SAF toe te voegen in Europa, oplopend tot 70% in 2050. Maar hoewel de voordelen van SAF voor de CO2-reductie duidelijk zijn, is er veel minder bekend over de klimaatimpact van niet-CO2-emissies tijdens het vliegen op SAF. CORSIA en de EU-richtlijn hernieuwbare energie houden geen rekening met de klimaatimpact van niet-CO2-emissies tijdens de vlucht, zoals stikstofoxiden (NOx), waterdamp (H2O) en roet.

Onderzoekers Luc Boerboom, Arvind Gangoli Rao, Volker Grewe en Feijia Yin van de faculteit Lucht- en Ruimtevaarttechniek van de Technische Universiteit Delft vullen die kenniskloof op. In hun wetenschappelijke rapport, gepubliceerd in Nature Open Science op 30 augustus 2025, evalueren zij de totale effecten van SAF op de opwarming van de aarde aan de hand van een uitgebreide levenscyclusanalyse, waarin zowel de klimaateffecten van de CO2-uitstoot tijdens de levenscyclus als de niet-CO2-uitstoot tijdens de vlucht zijn meegenomen.

Universitair hoofddocent Climate Effects of Aviation, dr. Feijia Yin: “Het beoordelen van de werkelijke klimaatimpact van vliegtuigtechnologie is complex. Over het algemeen is het klimaateffect van niet-CO2-emissies sterk afhankelijk van ruimte en tijd. Bijvoorbeeld: de uitstoot van NOx op vlieghoogte leidt tot een positieve stralingsforcering (opwarmend effect) omdat deze de ozonproductie versterkt. Waterdamp heeft op grote hoogte een aanzienlijk broeikasgaseffect omdat het langer in de atmosfeer blijft. Bovendien kan waterdamp die condenseert op deeltjesemissies (bijvoorbeeld roet) en bevriest tot een contrail, leiden tot een aanzienlijke opwarming van de aarde (positieve forcering), vooral 's nachts. In onze berekeningen variëren deze niet-CO2-effecten tussen 2 en 4 keer het CO2-effect op de opwarming van de aarde. Deze variatie wordt veroorzaakt door de grote onzekerheid van niet-CO2-klimaateffecten.”

De onderzoekers hebben de klimaatimpact van NOx, H2O en contrails veroorzaakt door wereldwijde vluchten in 2019 voor SAF gekwantificeerd. De totale CO2e-waarden voor de levenscyclus variëren van ongeveer 150 tot 250 g/MJ, rekening houdend met verschillende brandstofalternatieven. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de maximale vermindering van de CO2e-uitstoot bij gebruik van SAF minder dan 50% bedraagt in vergelijking met conventionele vliegtuigbrandstof, voornamelijk als gevolg van de NOx- en contraileffecten tijdens de vlucht.",https://filelist.tudelft.nl/_processed_/4/1/csm_contrails_485f6f1f70.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 00:56:50.952049

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel, also known as alternative jet fuel, is a drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel. This means it can use existing fuel distribution infrastructure and power aircraft engines without modifications. Sustainable aviation fuel helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can be made from different types of renewable sources such as biomass, organic waste or clean synthetic feed stocks using various production methods. The fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel and transported by rail, pipelines, vessels or trucks.

What will the programmatic environmental impact statement analyze?

The programmatic environmental impact statement is a planning document that takes a broad look at the potential significant adverse environmental impacts of producing and distributing sustainable aviation fuel as well as measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Projects can use this information and will also need their own individual environmental reviews.

Scoping

Scoping is the first step in developing the environmental review. We are asking for input from industry, local and state agencies, Tribes, the public and interested parties regarding what we should study. Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced, blended and distributed through a variety of ways, our scoping process will help determine which types of fuel production pathways and distribution infrastructure to evaluate. Our goal is to develop a useful, timely resource for developers, Tribes, agencies, and communities. Getting feedback is critical in determining where to focus our analysis.

Public comment

We are accepting comment from Oct. 6 at noon through Nov. 5 at 11:59 p.m. Read our guide on how to effectively comment on environmental reviews. Our scoping document provides more details on the process and a brief overview of sustainable aviation fuel development in Washington state.

The U.S. must implement new policies to kick-start production of bio-based jet fuel, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

​A new paper offers a policy road map for expanding U.S. production of sustainable aviation fuel — a move researchers say could cut climate pollution while offering a lifeline to ethanol producers buffeted by tariffs and the rise of electric vehicles.

The working paper, published Monday by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, outlines how the U.S. could meet the Biden-era goal of producing 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by 2030. The least costly, lowest-emissions option would be to eliminate all biofuel mandates and subsidies — and replace them with a carbon tax of $15 per ton of emissions and a tax credit of $4.41 per gallon of SAF, according to the paper.

That unlikely scenario serves as a “nice benchmark” for a slew of other possibilities, said Harvard University political economy professor James Stock, one of the paper’s co-authors.

“There are various, maybe more politically viable, policies that could be done,” said Stock, who served on the president’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration. Those include creating a sustainable aviation fuel tax, modifying the renewable fuels standard to encourage SAF production, and implementing a national aviation fuel emissions intensity standard.",https://governorsbiofuelscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-biofuels.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 21:56:14.913304

Even the most powerful aircraft carriers have a critical weakness: their aircraft. A Nimitz-class ship can sail for decades on nuclear power, but its fighters burn thousands of gallons of fuel every hour.

Tankers and replenishment ships keep the air wing flying, yet they are slow, exposed and vulnerable. Disrupt that chain, and the carrier’s entire strike capability falters.

Now the US Navy is testing a technology that could make those ships almost entirely self-sufficient — by drawing jet fuel straight from the surrounding sea.

US Navy and Sea Dragon Energy develop ‘Project Genesis’ seawater-to-jet fuel system

San Diego-based Sea Dragon Energy Inc. (SDEI) has been contracted by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to demonstrate how seawater can be transformed into JP-5 jet fuel.

On 21 August 2025, ONR awarded the company a $9.5 million contract for the second-phase demonstration of its Seawater to Jet Fuel programme. That follows an earlier $19.2 million ONR contract in 2024, which funded development of a pilot “Seawater to Jet Fuel Demonstration Unit”.

Sea Dragon calls the initiative Project Genesis — a self-contained, ship-mounted system designed to extract carbon dioxide and hydrogen from seawater, then recombine them into hydrocarbons using Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, a century-old industrial process.

“It’s a major step towards truly sustainable aviation fuel for both government and commercial use,” said John Kohut, Sea Dragon’s chairman and CEO.

Texas congressman John Carter, who represents the company’s home district, described the work as “a lasting contribution to our warfighters and to the commercial sector”.

Sea Dragon’s research and development team in California aims to deliver a deployable demonstration system by 2027 — one that could operate aboard aircraft carriers or offshore platforms.

How the US Navy plans to turn seawater into JP-5 jet fuel

Seawater contains both dissolved carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the basic ingredients of hydrocarbons. The process begins by extracting these gases using electrolysis and advanced membranes.

The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) holds patents for an electrolytic cation exchange module (E-CEM) that can simultaneously capture both elements. These gases are then fed into a Fischer–Tropsch reactor, where carbon and hydrogen atoms are assembled into JP-5-grade fuel.

In 2014, NRL scientists used this method to power a scale model aircraft entirely with fuel synthesised from seawater, proving the chemistry could work. The challenge since then has been scaling production to levels that could sustain an aircraft carrier’s operations.

Early estimates suggest that, with around 200 megawatts of nuclear power, a carrier could theoretically produce up to 82,000 gallons of jet fuel per day, enough to keep multiple aircraft continuously airborne.

Advanced catalysts and AI research boost seawater fuel efficiency

The biggest technical barrier is catalysis, making the conversion process efficient and cost-effective.

Researchers at the University of Rochester and the University of Pittsburgh, supported by ONR, are developing zeolite-based bimetallic catalysts that avoid rare metals and can be tuned to produce precisely the right hydrocarbon chain lengths for jet fuel.

“Our goal is to tune hydrocarbon selectivity so we produce exactly what we need — jet fuel, not methane,” explained Professor Marc Porosoff, assistant professor of chemical engineering at Rochester. Machine-learning models are now being used to predict catalyst performance, potentially cutting years off laboratory testing.

Sea Dragon has also partnered with Emerging Fuels Technology (EFT) to integrate a pilot-scale conversion module capable of producing aviation-grade e-fuel that meets ASTM and DoD specifications.

Strategic impact: seawater-to-fuel technology could make US carriers self-sufficient

Producing jet fuel at sea could remove one of the US Navy’s most significant operational constraints. Carriers rely on long, predictable supply chains that are increasingly vulnerable to precision-strike threats.

If a carrier could synthesise its own fuel using onboard nuclear power, it would be able to operate for months or even years without resupply, effectively becoming a self-contained energy ecosystem.

Strategists say such a capability would revolutionise naval logistics. Instead of defending slow-moving fuel convoys, fleets could operate independently, drastically reducing risk in contested environments like the South China Sea or Arctic.

Technical challenges and energy limits of seawater jet fuel production

Still, the challenges are formidable. The process is energy-intensive, demanding massive electrical input and careful heat management. Materials must withstand corrosion, salt fouling and vibration in a shipboard environment.

Scaling up from laboratory reactors to a 100,000-gallon-per-day system means overcoming efficiency losses, waste-heat dissipation and reactor lifespan issues. Integration with carrier systems, fuel storage, and safety certification will all require extensive testing.

Even with nuclear energy as the power source, the economics of producing fuel at sea are uncertain. Analysts caution that Project Genesis may serve initially as a strategic resilience tool, not a wholesale replacement for tanker fleets.

Civil aviation and shipping could benefit from seawater-derived fuel

If the technology can be refined, it could also benefit civil aviation and shipping, two of the world’s hardest-to-decarbonise sectors. Synthetic fuel derived from seawater and renewable power could provide a closed-carbon-cycle alternative to fossil jet fuel.

Sea Dragon highlights fuel security, predictable costs and lower carbon impact as key advantages. In theory, any port or offshore facility with access to seawater and clean electricity could generate its own fuel, making the ocean a limitless energy resource.

By 2027, Sea Dragon hopes to demonstrate a working shipboard unit capable of producing JP-5 fuel continuously from seawater. If successful, it would mark one of the most radical advances in naval logistics since the introduction of nuclear propulsion.

For now, the idea remains a hybrid of science and ambition — but one that could, in time, let naval aviators take off knowing the ocean below can refuel them when they return.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FA-18-hornet-landing-on-USS-George-Bush.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 14:56:32.916712

Eliminate blame The only way to eliminate blame from your culture is for the leadership to adopt a mindset and practice of 100% responsibility.
Without a responsible mindset, blame takes center stage, and accountability becomes something to avoid.
Quick action checklist Leaders can start strengthening accountability this quarter by: Defining responsibility (ownership) vs. accountability (measurement).
The question is: Are your leaders driving accountability or waiting for an accountability crisis to arise?","We have an accountability crisis. A 2025 Culture Partners study found that 80% of employees say feedback only happens when something goes wrong, and most confuse accountability with blame. No wonder leaders struggle. Accountability has become synonymous with punishment and “being held accountable.” However, perhaps the single issue isn’t accountability, but rather a multifaceted issue of clarity, mindset and training.

Here’s a snapshot of the four stages of accountability breakdown, along with practical ways leaders can move from avoidance to alignment, where coaching replaces criticism and clarity replaces confusion.

The four phases of accountability breakdown

Phase 1: Avoidance

Leaders postpone the tough talk. Fear, lack of skill or hoping the problem disappears only makes tension build.

Phase 2: The conversation

Eventually, the leader has the talk. To their surprise, it goes smoother than expected. Relief sets in, even pride.

Phase 3: Temporary improvement The employee makes short-term changes. The leader breathes a sigh of relief, believing the storm has passed.

Phase 4: Regression Old habits creep back in. The same issues resurface. Resentment builds. The leader wonders, “Should I try again?” Document? Escalate to HR?

Distinguish responsibility and accountability

In working with hundreds of clients over 20 years, I have noticed several recurring patterns. The terms “responsibility” and “accountability” are used interchangeably. What I can say with certainty is that responsibility and accountability are distinct, yet both are necessary.

Responsibility is about ownership. It’s of the heart.

Accountability is about measurement. It’s of the head.

Here’s another important distinction: Accountability requires a witness, which is another person, for example, a leader, who confirms the measurements. You can’t be accountable without a witness. There is no such thing as “personal accountability.” There is, however, personal responsibility, which is about taking ownership. When people take ownership, they actually want measurement, and they want a coach, mentor or witness to confirm their success.

A common problem in corporations is the lack of responsibility in applying. Accountability (measurement) without personal responsibility creates mere compliance. I can’t say this enough: Change the corporate language to differentiate between responsibility and accountability, and you’ll find every single leak.

Pro tip: When the head and heart work together, accountability feels like alignment, not punishment.

Eliminate blame

The only way to eliminate blame from your culture is for the leadership to adopt a mindset and practice of 100% responsibility. A blaming mindset from any leader, especially at the top, cannot produce responsible or accountable employees. Without a responsible mindset, blame takes center stage, and accountability becomes something to avoid. An important skill is learning how to identify irresponsible language, allowing you to eliminate blame. Besides name-calling and gossip, here are some common yet less recognized examples.

Common phrases that undermine accountability:

“That’s not my job.”

“I assumed you knew…”

“They dropped the ball.”

“I didn’t have time.”

“It’s above my pay grade.”

“No one told me.”

“We’ve always done it this way.”

Some leaders may justify these statements by saying, “Well, it’s the truth.” That’s how you know there’s a responsibility problem and not an accountability problem.

Pro tip: In any area where you see recurring conflict, you’ll find an absence of responsibility and an abundance of blame.

Clarity comes before accountability

According to Gallup, only 45% of employees are aware of what’s expected of them. Without clarity, accountability is impossible. Most employees answer “no” to the question: I know what my boss expects from me at work.

Culture Partners reports that 85% of employees aren’t sure what their organizations are trying to achieve, and one-third say priorities change frequently. Confusion is the enemy of accountability.

Pro tip: In accountable cultures, employees feel free to ask for clarification about tasks and priorities.

Teach managers how to coach

The Talent Strategy Group reports that coaching conversations aren’t happening because managers lack skills and often, the right mindset. When managers view performance issues as “catch and punish” instead of “coach and support,” accountability feels unsafe.

Pro tip: Accountability grows when managers view performance conversations as opportunities to coach, rather than confront.

Quick action checklist

Leaders can start strengthening accountability this quarter by:

Defining responsibility (ownership) vs. accountability (measurement).

Auditing culture for blame-language.

Training managers to coach, not catch.

Building a culture of accountability doesn’t happen overnight, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. Accountability without blame is a competitive advantage. The question is: Are your leaders driving accountability or waiting for an accountability crisis to arise?

Our broad statewide studies, also called programmatic environmental impact statements, are required by state law. In June, we released three studies evaluating utility-scale onshore wind and solar energy projects, and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.

As part of the scoping process, we are seeking input from interested parties, including the public, regarding the range of actions and impacts we should study.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

To help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to power aircraft engines. The fuel is derived from low-carbon sources such as biomass, organic waste and clean synthetic feedstocks using a wide range of production methods and technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.

Scoping our study to be impactful and efficient

While these fuel projects are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the state economy, they can still have negative environmental impacts that need to be considered—including ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate those impacts.

Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from a variety of renewable resources and transported using various distribution methods, our study will not be able to evaluate every possible option. This means your input is critical. It will help us determine where to focus our analysis to develop the most useful, timely report that will support the future development of sustainable aviation fuel projects in Washington.

The study will evaluate the potential impacts on natural and built resources at a broad level. Developers and agencies can use the findings to help avoid and reduce impacts through siting and design choices. It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.

Taking public comments

We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel. In October, we will hold two virtual meetings where interested parties can make public comments:

Tuesday, Oct. 21 virtual meeting starting at 1 p.m.

Register on Zoom

Wednesday, Oct. 22 virtual meeting starting at 9 a.m.

Register on Zoom

All the comments we receive will be valued equally. They help us determine our approach to the programmatic impact statement, or study. Comments addressing specific pathways, impacts or issues are the most useful. We have prepared a fact sheet about providing effective public comments.

It is working to integrate sustainability within championships, but its 2024 sustainability report shows a 9% absolute emissions increase.

The FIA also reports a decrease in carbon intensity by 7% year-on-year alongside an increase in activities, revenue and headcount.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the FIA, says: “Five years into the FIA’s ambitious strategy, it is clear there is more to do.

“As we look to the future, I am confident the FIA will continue to play a leading role in facing the challenges ahead, which are significant.”

Willem Groenewald is the FIA’s Secretary General for Automobile Mobility and Sustainability.

He leads the FIA’s mobility and sustainability mission, working with 245 Member Clubs in 149 countries to advance its objectives across sport and mobility.

Willem spoke to Sustainability Magazine about the FIA’s 2024 Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion report.

What are some of the highlights from this report?

We were pleased to see a 45% increase in uptake for our Environmental Accreditation Programme, which provides our member clubs, championships, promoters, teams, suppliers, circuits and with a clear framework against which to accredit their activities. The scheme has three levels on a star-rated basis, ranging from basic to best practice, and is designed to support our entire ecosystem across sport and mobility, encouraging a gradual progression through the levels. This was our strongest yearly growth to date, showing real momentum.

We also invested for the first time in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which reduced our footprint by an estimated 388 tCO₂e in 2024 and about 8% of freight-related emissions when compared with 2023. SAF can cut lifecycle GHGs by up to 80% vs conventional jet fuel, and we have committed to further increase our investment in SAF in 2025.

Another highlight was the launch of our Sustainable Fuel Certification Programme. From 2026, Formula 1 will mandate sustainable fuel made from Advanced Sustainable Components. To ensure compliance, we launched a scheme with Zemo Partnership which verifies each fuel’s origin, composition and greenhouse gas performance. The Programme aims to go beyond sport, laying the foundation for broader adoption of these fuels across everyday mobility. Future partnerships with fuel providers will support this transition, helping to reduce transport emissions at scale.

How have you found the split of the sustainability and D&I function?

We have sharpened our focus for the respective functions while keeping the two areas connected where it matters. Under the new structure, sustainability is within my remit while D&I reports to Alessandra Malhamé, Senior HR Director at the FIA. This allows us to build out our capabilities in these functions and align them with other areas of the FIA, most notably our member clubs.

Sustainability and D&I are embedded in FIA governance through our Sustainability & D&I Committee and specialist Commissions, allowing us to drive deep technical progress on climate and environmental management, while ensuring our inclusion programmes generate positive impact inside and outside of the FIA.

What progress are you most proud of?

The growth of our Environmental Accreditations Programme shows that organisations across sport and mobility are moving from intention to implementation, raising the bar across the ecosystem. We have 190 organisations signed up and will keep evolving and expanding the programme.

We were also really proud to be recognised by the British Standards Institution (BSI) as an example of how sports governance can integrate structured climate transition planning.

We are the first to acknowledge that there is more to do and that we have an important role in driving further action in bettering sustainable practices across the industries we operate in.

What’s working and what will you focus on next?

While absolute emissions increased overall in 2024, a year of strong activity growth, carbon intensity, which is defined as each tCO₂e emitted for each € of general revenue, fell ~7% against revenue, showing that our efficiency measures are working. With 99% of our footprint in Scope 3 - the hardest emissions to abate across all industries - our early use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel helped limit the increase and underlines the potential of these biofuels to reduce future impacts. We will continue to push stricter travel policies, event optimisation and stronger sustainable procurement. We are targeting Net Zero by 2040 and remain committed to halving absolute emissions by 2030 against a 2022 baseline.

What goes into creating this report?

As for any organisation, it is a very comprehensive process and in recent years we have made a concerted effort to ensure our data is collected consistently, accurately and in line with recognised standards. This has formed part of the wider transformation of processes and internal controls within the FIA.

We report to GRI Standards (2024 period). We have calculated our carbon footprint since 2019 in line with the GHG Protocol, covering all three scopes across our headquarters, events, championships and financed supplier activities. In 2024 we ensured our footprint was reviewed under ISO 14064-3 by Global Climate Initiatives. We track energy, water, waste, supplier screening and a detailed Scope 1–3 inventory (including business travel, freight and purchased goods). We also restated prior years to reflect updated emission factors and a new 2022 baseline for accuracy.

We will continue to expand data collection and research, building a stronger evidence base to guide our strategy and track our impact effectively.

How is this data used to assess and continue making progress?

In short, to drive action and continuously push for better outcomes across sustainability and D&I.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives this week urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize rules that prioritize domestic feedstocks and protect U.S. farmers and renewable fuel producers from foreign competition.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers called on the agency to move forward with its proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and to maintain record-high biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes set out earlier this year. They said the policy changes would strengthen American energy security and bolster farm economies across the Midwest.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks,” the members wrote. “The Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.”

The Import RIN reduction, proposed by the EPA in June, would cut in half the RIN credits available for imported renewable fuels or fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Lawmakers argue the move would help level the playing field for American producers facing competition from foreign sources such as Brazilian tallow and used cooking oil imported from China.

The letter also noted that soybean oil plays a key role in the U.S. biofuel industry — though it represents only 20% of the soybean by weight, it accounts for more than half the crop’s market value. About half of that oil is used to make biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“The EPA’s own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal,” the senators wrote. “It will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities.”

Joining Young in signing the letter were Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran of Kansas, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Rounds of South Dakota, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, among others.

Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives also endorsed the letter, including Indiana’s Jim Baird (IN-04), Erin Houchin (IN-09), Mark Messmer (IN-08), and Rudy Yakym (IN-02).

The senators said finalizing the rule would fulfill the intent of Congress under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritize domestic production and job growth in rural communities.

We’re talking about green methanol, and how would it be possible?
Just combine green hydrogen with carbon captured from sustainable biomass, and then we’ll have methanol with a neutral carbon footprint (the famous green methanol).
This partnership plans to produce 300,000 tons of green methanol per year from 2028 (some experts are even saying goodbye to hydrogen, as in this case).","Hydrogen has been talked about for some time now as an alternative for the global energy transition we are currently experiencing. In fact, it is highly sought after. However, in the midst of this race for hydrogen, a somewhat surprising alternative has emerged that has even greater potential than previously imagined and that we can start using right now – yes, until now we have not been able to imagine how this has been hidden for so long…

It looks like the race for green hydrogen already has a protagonist

Countries like Germany, Japan and South Korea have been ahead of the game when it comes to hydrogen for generating green energy for quite some time now. The business is so serious that they have already established partnerships to import this fuel. On the other hand, regions like the Middle East, South America and Oceania are preparing to export it on a large scale. It is worth noting that Australia, in particular, is a strong candidate in this race.

Why? Well, to understand, we need to look at the Australian state of Tasmania. The reason is its 100% renewable energy profile and strategic geography, which has been considered one of the best places in the world for producing green hydrogen. The north of this state has been the site of several projects and investments in this niche for some time now. However, many of them ended up failing due to technical and infrastructure challenges.

But it seems that this scenario is about to change, since the company ABEL Energy has put a project on the table with a different approach. How so? Well, instead of just exporting hydrogen, why can’t we transform it into something denser, more versatile and with greater immediate global demand? It seems that the secret lies there…

From hydrogen to green methanol

Ok, so what would this hydrogen transformation be? We’re talking about green methanol, and how would it be possible? Just combine green hydrogen with carbon captured from sustainable biomass, and then we’ll have methanol with a neutral carbon footprint (the famous green methanol). This material can be used as:

Clean marine fuel;

Feedstock for green chemicals;

And even the basis for sustainable aviation fuel.

It was from there that ABEL Energy partnered with Worley for the Bell Bay Powerfuels project. This partnership plans to produce 300,000 tons of green methanol per year from 2028 (some experts are even saying goodbye to hydrogen, as in this case). But for all this to happen, the initiative has already received A$330 million in public incentives, which has attracted international interest and is close to being acquired by Zen Energy, a company backed by economist Ross Garnaut.

Why is all this happening now?

Before we talk about the moment itself, we need to better understand the place where all this is happening. This is because Tasmania itself offers unique conditions, such as:

Almost entirely renewable energy matrix;

Access to a deep-water port;

Geographical location close to major Asian markets;

And a political and industrial ecosystem committed to the energy transition.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Depositphotos_13850583_L.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:56:13.993472

It also came above the S&P 500’s return of 3.6% in the same time frame.

Other industry players, such as Rocket Lab USA, Inc. RKLB and Curtiss-Wright Corp. CW, have also delivered a similar stellar performance in the past month. Shares of RKLB and CW have risen 17.6% and 11.1%, respectively, in the said period.

With RYCEY’s strong outperformance, some investors may be eager to buy the stock right away. However, before making this decision, it is essential to verify whether the company’s fundamentals can sustain long-term growth or if the recent rise is merely temporary. Understanding RYCEY’s growth potential and related risks is essential for making a well-informed investment choice.

What Pushed Up RYCEY Stock?

RYCEY’s latest robust performance on the bourses seems to have been influenced by the following developments:

In September 2025, Rolls-Royce, together with Landmark and ASCO, commissioned a 10-megawatt gas engine power plant with a carbon capture system in the East Midlands region of the United Kingdom. In the same month, Lithuanian energy supplier Ignitis Group chose Rolls-Royce to provide large-scale battery storage systems from its mtu EnergyPack brand. The order includes systems with a total storage capacity of 582 megawatt hours and an output of 291 megawatts. These developments should bolster RYCEY’s position as a technology company contributing to sustainable energy.

Additionally, the company introduced the mtu 12V2000Z engine with 2222 horsepower and launched the mtu NautIQ Bridge system for yachts between 30 and 40 metres in length. It also presented a new flexible exhaust aftertreatment system for its mtu 4000 series engines and a fuel-efficient POD drive. These additions are expected to strengthen Rolls-Royce’s position in the marine market and support future growth.

Growth Prospects for RYCEY Stock

Looking ahead, Rolls-Royce seems well-placed to maintain its growth in the coming years, supported by strong demand across its key business areas, which include Civil Aerospace, Defence and Power Systems.

In the Civil Aerospace segment, the company continues to benefit from higher global air travel and the need for fuel-efficient aircraft. Its Trent XWB, Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 engines power major aircraft such as the Airbus A350, Boeing 787 and Airbus A330. The recent improvements made by Rolls-Royce to extend engine life by 30% are expected to increase its aftermarket revenues and support long-term cash generation. With an order backlog of more than 2,000 widebody engines (as of July 2025), Rolls-Royce has good visibility for future growth.

Its Defence business is also expected to perform well as global defense spending increases. Rolls-Royce engines, including the EJ200 for the Eurofighter Typhoon and the AE series for transport aircraft, continue to see strong demand.

In September 2025, Rolls-Royce strengthened its partnership with Avio Aero and IHI to develop the next-generation fighter engine under the Global Combat Air Programme. This initiative reinforces Rolls-Royce’s commitment to advancing future combat air propulsion technology.

In the Power Systems division, Rolls-Royce is expanding in clean energy and energy storage. Its focus on hydrogen-powered engines, sustainable aviation fuel and small modular reactors supports the global shift toward cleaner energy. The selection of its small modular reactor technology by Great British Nuclear and the large battery storage orders (in June 2025) show the growing strength of this segment.

Overall, steady orders, ongoing innovation and a strong presence across several growing industries are likely to help Rolls-Royce maintain its positive momentum and achieve sustainable growth in the long term.

Let’s check below how the company is expected to perform in the near term.

A much more concrete prospect than the sixty-eight slogan about flowers in cannons, provided that Brussels clarifies some rules for farmers and industry. In fact, the Commission is about to define what is meant by 'intermediate crop' in the Renewable Energy Directive, a fundamental step to allow Italian farmers too to intercept the rich biofuel business, a 120 billion market destined to double in the next 10 years. ""Europe is about to take a crucial decision that could open up new markets for Italian farmers, while helping to drastically reduce emissions from aviation. Without a broad definition, we believe that European farmers will be excluded from this opportunity. Gabriele Burato is the head in Italy of Corteva Agriscience, the agrochemical giant born from the merger between Dow and DuPont with a turnover of more than 14 billion that together with the other three biggies in the sector (Bayer, Basf and Syngenta) controls the majority of the world market for crop protection products, seeds, plant protection products and fertilisers. In Italy it has two plants and two research centres concentrated in the north and is now preparing to invest in the new frontier of biofuels. Thus, sunflowers grown in Italy are also a candidate to provide part of the fuel for the next flights.

""These days,"" Burato explains, ""the aviation industry is busy finding cost-competitive sources of sustainable aviation fuel (Saf), due to new European regulations that require companies to include at least 2 per cent Saf in fuel blends, with a target of 70 per cent by 2050. Biofuels derived from agriculture could be part of the solution. Crops such as the sunflower contain a high percentage of oil in their seeds and are a perfect raw material for the production of biofuels'.

While Italy, also with the latest revision of the NRP, is accelerating on the latest generation of agri-voltaics that does not involve soil consumption and adds to the agro-energy mix dominated by biomethane, at a global level there has long been a debate on the contrast between energy and food uses of agricultural raw materials. In Europe, says Burato, 'the role of farmers in the production of sustainable energy is often overlooked, because having a limited amount of fertile land at their disposal they have to give priority to food and feed production, as is also the case in Italy. However, with innovative solutions and the right regulatory support, biofuels can also become a key element for the future of sustainable energy in Europe, with agriculture playing a leading role. Farming to produce biofuels will be increasingly profitable'.

Normally, the crops associated with biofuel production are rape, maize and soya. Alongside these, Corteva wants to bet on sunflower in Italy. On the convenience of the bet Burato has no doubts: 'First of all, in terms of cost, growing dedicated crops such as sunflowers between harvests is cheaper than producing fossil fuels, or synthetic aviation fuels. The advantage of using oil crops is that there is already a value chain for all the components of the seeds that are used, and in Europe there are already activities such as crushing plants, storage, and refineries, operational and with the capacity to convert the oil into aviation fuel'.",https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/S24/Documenti/2025/10/01/Immagini/Ritagli/Sunflower_DSC_0847-U76567444862pOC-1440x752@IlSole24Ore-Web.JPG?r=1170x507,N,,2025-10-06 11:56:27.144443

The certification ensures full traceability of sustainable aviation fuel throughout the supply chain. According to Weston Aviation, the company maintains a management system designed to guarantee traceability of sustainable material and accurate application of the mass balance approach.

All biomass and waste-based fuels supplied comply with ISCC sustainability criteria, including land use restrictions, biodiversity protection, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and respect for human and labor rights. Internal procedures include regular audits, staff training and data verification processes.

“As the ISCC auditor for Weston Aviation, it was great to see the team’s clear commitment to sustainability and transparency,” said Jack Boyle, head of operations at EnviroSense International. “Their proactive approach to compliance and traceability really highlights their dedication to driving progress in the use of sustainable aviation fuel.”

Since January 1, all jet fuel across the UK and Union airports within Ireland contains a minimum blend of two percent SAF calculated on a mass balance basis. Weston Aviation requires ISCC certification to trade PoCs, which are provided by ISCC certified suppliers detailing the SAF blend supplied and which operators require for reclaiming under offset schemes.

Ruth Tootill, aviation fuel manager at Weston Aviation, explained how the certification maintains chain of custody. “The benefit for Weston Aviation becoming ISCC certified is so that we do not break the chain of custody, so that where our ISCC certified supplier provides a PoC for SAF, we offer traceability by passing our own PoC on to our customers,” said Tootill. “It also demonstrates our commitment to our customers and suppliers to support the progress of sustainability in aviation fuels.”",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/processed-A47D1A22-FD61-41C1-A6B5-0E2E8A6D7451.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 11:56:58.896501

Singapore Airlines offers the longest current commercial passenger flight. It travels from Singapore to New York and takes 18 hours and 40 minutes. Mercifully, they don’t offer economy seats — it’s premium economy or business only! During the flight, the plane emits about 2.7 tons of CO2 per passenger, or about the same as driving a standard gasoline-fueled car from San Francisco to Boston and back.

Batteries and hydrogen potentially could dramatically reduce CO2 emissions from aviation, but their weight and/or volume make them infeasible at present. Current batteries are 50 times heavier than jet fuel per unit of energy, and they take up 20 times as much space. Compressed hydrogen takes up 6 times as much space as jet fuel. The fuel in a typical long-haul jet (including the Singapore-NYC plane) comprises up to 40% of its weight on takeoff. This leaves little capacity for batteries or hydrogen.

The low energy density of batteries and hydrogen implies that near-term decarbonization of long-haul jets relies on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAFs are liquid aviation fuels derived from feedstocks such as waste oils and fats, crops such as corn, soy, and sugarcane, cellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, or captured CO2. SAFs are chemically very similar to fossil jet fuel. They are currently approved to be mixed with conventional jet fuel at levels up to 50%, making them compatible with existing aircraft and requiring no modifications to current fueling infrastructure.

A Grand Challenge

In 2011, the US Federal Aviation Administration set a goal for US airlines to use one billion gallons of SAF annually by 2018. Actual SAF production fell far short of this target; in 2018 only 1.8 million gallons were produced.

In 2021, the US Federal government launched the SAF Grand Challenge, which set a target of 3 billion gallons annual production by 2030, which would result in SAF comprising about 12% of US jet fuel consumption in that year. At the beginning of 2024, US annual production capacity for SAF was approximately 30.66 million gallons, representing just 0.1% of the current US jet fuel supply. In late 2024, two additional plants came online, generating a significant increase in capacity to about 450 million gallons per year.

What would it take to reach the SAF Grand Challenge goal?

In an NBER working paper out today, Mengying Wu, Kristen McCormack, Will Scott, Jingran Zhang, Jim Stock, and I answer that question.

In the paper, we develop a detailed model of the road and air transportation fuel sectors, including the 12 most common biofuel-feedstock combinations. We use this model to evaluate six alternative policy scenarios designed to achieve the 3 billion gallon SAF target and discuss the estimated emissions reductions, cost effectiveness, fuel-feedstock mix, and cost incidence of each policy.

Two SAF production technologies are currently operational in the US, both based on biofuels: (i) hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) using vegetable oils and waste fats, and (ii) alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) using ethanol made from corn or some other bio feedstock. The three most common road transportation biofuels are ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are produced from the same feedstocks as HEFA SAF.

Because currently available SAFs are predominantly biofuels, SAF policy will interact with the tangled web of existing policies that promote biofuels for surface transportation. In the United States, these policies include the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates blending biofuels into the surface transportation fuel supply, federal tax credits (45Z), state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS), and state tax credits. These policies provide subsidies for producers and consumers of biofuels. Depending on the policy, the cost of these subsidies fall on drivers, surface freight shippers, or taxpayers (illustrated below).

Any proposed SAF policy must be developed and assessed in the context of existing biofuel policies. The mix of policies in place help determine the total quantity, as well as the composition by technology and feedstock, of biofuel produced and consumed for surface and aviation fuel.

We have five main findings

First, current policies are insufficient to achieve the SAF production target. Using SAF generates credits in the RFS and LCFS programs, but the value of these credits is insufficient to bring much SAF into the market. In our model, only 60 million gallons of SAF are produced in 2030 under current policy, and a large amount of biodiesel feedstock that could be used for SAF is converted instead to less-expensive renewable diesel, which is used to replace petroleum diesel to satisfy the California LCFS.

In short, the current US policy mix incentivizes the use of biofuels for surface transportation over aviation (as illustrated below).

Second, we find that three alternative policy options to reach the target would all result in similar total emissions and overall economic costs. But they differ in who would bear those costs. The three are:

a regulatory change to the RFS that creates a SAF requirement, but does not obligate petroleum jet fuel producers to buy renewable fuel credits (we call this Nested D2)

a regulatory change to the RFS that creates a SAF requirement and obligates petroleum jet fuel producers to buy renewable fuel credits (we call this D2 with Aviation Obligation)

a clean aviation standard in addition to current policy (we call this Aviation Intensity Standard)

The average cost of reducing carbon emissions with any of these three policies is around $470 per ton of CO2, which is more than twice the social cost of carbon. These three policy tools would result in slightly higher average economic costs and lower total emissions than the current policy mix (see figure below).

Our cost estimate is based on current models of greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels. These models adjust for the fact that increasing demand for biofuels induces more land to be converted into farmland, which can release large amounts of carbon stored in plants and soil. However, there’s ongoing debate about whether these adjustments are large enough. Such emissions are especially high when forests are cleared in places like Brazil for soybeans or Indonesia for palm oil. Accounting for emissions from higher induced land use would move the dots in the above figure up and to the left.

Our third finding is that replacing all current federal and state biofuel policies with a $15 per metric ton carbon tax on fossil transportation fuels and a $4.41 per gallon SAF tax credit could reduce emissions, reach the 3 billion gallon target, and substantially reduce total policy costs, all relative to the current policy mix. Almost all reductions are a result of reduced demand for fuels.

Fourth, additional policy costs of reaching the target are disproportionately borne by California, which experiences gasoline and diesel price increases of 30-40 cents per gallon under the three policies mentioned above. This occurs because increased demand for SAF outside of California, encouraged by state tax incentives that currently exist in Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Washington, increases competition for bio-based diesel feedstocks and therefore makes compliance with California’s LCFS more expensive.

Finally, it follows from the first two findings that adding policies to achieve the target is more costly than current policy. The static costs reported in this paper, however, do not account for any technological innovation induced by a durable SAF policy that would spur investment; costs arguably could be driven down further by extensive federal R&D support for advanced low-carbon SAFs, such as SAF produced from captured CO2, which has low carbon emissions if produced using clean electricity.

Conclusion

Open up an in-flight magazine or read press releases from airlines and you will see an industry that is conscious of the high greenhouse gas emissions from flying. Many companies, including Singapore Airlines, have experimented with adding SAF to their fuel supply. Such voluntary initiatives could potentially support some SAF, but volumes would likely remain small, in large part because SAFs are significantly more expensive than fossil jet fuel and somewhat more expensive than biofuels for surface transportation. For SAF to expand, it will need long-term policy support. Our findings show that such policies would mostly divert biofuels from surface transportation to aviation at somewhat higher cost.

Considering potential innovation is important, particularly because many SAF technologies are still relatively nascent. In surface transportation, recent research indicates that learning-by-doing that drives down costs has been substantial for ethanol but not for bio-based diesel. If using biofuel SAFs can accelerate the technological transition to deep decarbonization (e.g., batteries, hydrogen, or SAF from captured CO2), and if the induced land-use change effects of biofuels are not too large, then incentivizing biofuel SAFs could perhaps be justified.

The project aims to explore synergies between traditional chemical processes and emerging technologies that work to convert waste into circular chemicals. There will also be a specific focus on the possible conversion of waste into chemicals in a more sustainable way.

Direct conversion can help to transform complex waste streams into valuable C2+ chemical compounds, like ethylene and propylene, through gasification. They are essential building blocks for products like contact-sensitive plastics, detergents, paints, and textiles. Additionally, users could see a reduction in emissions while receiving a cost-effective alternative to fossil-based feedstocks.

“Our collaboration with ETH Zurich scientists represents a significant step toward realising a circular and net-zero chemical industry,” said Charlie Tan, CEO of GIC. “By leveraging cutting-edge research and industry expertise, we aim to explore scalable solutions that address both environmental and economic challenges.”

Researchers at ETH Zurich will complete environmental and techno-economic assessments of the direct conversion process. The findings will help assess the viability of a proof-of-concept, while also identifying conditions for any future pilot-scale efforts.​ The collaboration will explore processing heterogeneous waste materials and integrating new feedstocks into existing chemical value chains.

“The chemical industry must shift from fossil-based inputs to renewable and circular carbon sources. Through our collaboration with GIC on Direct Conversion, we’re exploring how to transform waste into essential chemicals—an important step toward operating within planetary boundaries,” said Professor André Bardow, Chair of Energy and Process Systems Engineering at ETH Zurich.

Richard Haldimann, Chief Strategy & Technology Officer at Clariant and Chairman of the GIC Executive Committee, added, “This partnership shows how science and industry together can drive real progress toward a circular future.

Late last week analytics platform MSCI Carbon Markets announced that the Architecture for REDD+ Transactions (ART) registry this week confirmed that Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways canceled a batch of credits from the Guyana Jurisdictional REDD+ Project (ART102,) currently the only program that satisfies both the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Emission Unit Criteria and carries a corresponding adjustment from its host government. Those two features make the credits uniquely eligible under CORSIA.

At a Q2 2025 auction run by the International Air Transport Association, the credits sold for about $22.25 per metric ton of CO2e, with bids for the next quarterly auction still underway.

With the first verified retirements now on record, CORSIA’s once-theoretical framework is becoming a functioning marketplace that could redefine how airlines account for their climate footprints.

MSCI focused on CORSIA

According to MSCI’s 2025 CORSIA Outlook, global demand for eligible credits could reach 500 million to 1.3 billion tonnes between 2027 and 2035, with prices potentially climbing from $26 to as high as $124 per tonne as supply tightens.

The inaugural Contrails Analysis Report also urges business aviation to modify flight plans to minimise contrails and airlines to publish similar studies.

The report claims 1% of contrails accounted for 48% of the global warming impact arising from 2,987 on demand private charter flights worldwide. The results highlight how a small number of high-impact contrails disproportionately contribute to climate effects and how remedial action could lead to significant improvements.

Defined as long, thin cloud formations forming behind high altitude aircraft, contrails are responsible for 1-2% of global warming. They can cause as much global warming each year as all the CO2 emitted by flights between 1945 and 2018, according to recent (and separate) research from the University of Cambridge Aviation Impact Accelerator. Both organisations want to highlight the CO2 and non-CO2 impact of business aviation on climate change while encouraging commercial airlines to publish their own contrail analysis reports.

Long-lasting or ‘big-hit’ contrails can have an outsized warming impact, trapping and absorbing heat that otherwise would radiate back into space. Research from the European Commission indicates that contrails and non-CO₂ emissions are responsible for about twice as much warming as the CO2 emitted by aviation.

‘Avoid contrail formation’

One misconception is that private jets fly above contrail regions but this report proves this isn’t always the case, warned Toby Edwards, co-CEO at Victor. “We want our private jet clients to have the option to avoid contrail formation by choosing progressive operators that are proactively making small adjustments to their flight paths to avoid contrail-forming regions, thereby lowering their environmental impact,” he said.

Operators who are working on contrail avoidance using, already available, smart flight management software would be recommended to clients. “Such an offering would be a natural extension to our existing product, which includes aircraft estimate fuel-burn data and Neste sustainable aviation fuel [SAF],” said Edwards.

The results of this research support an earlier study conducted by 4AIR. This was also said to show the concentration of a majority of the contrail impact emerging from a small minority of flights, highlighting the opportunity to cut climate impact substantially by addressing just a fraction of flights.

4AIR, who used the open-source Contrail Cirrus Prediction model from Contrails.org and hindcast weather data plus ADSB data within a flight, shines the spotlight on the non-CO2 impact of Victor’s charter flights and highlights the alarming impact of contrails by the growing commercial airline sector, reinforcing calls to accelerate the deployment of known mitigation techniques that could quickly reduce these effects.

‘Very large opportunity’

Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR said the challenge of minimising the impact of contrails was not confined to business aviation. “Avoiding atmospheric regions likely to create big hit contrails represents a very large opportunity to reduce the impact from aviation,” he said. “But effectively mitigating these regions will require pro-active flight planning by operators as well as coordination with Air Traffic Control.”

It is critical to raise awareness of both the impact and opportunity of non-CO2 impacts and encourage operators to understand their contrail footprint, as aviation sector prepared to meet its climate goals, he added.

“By publishing this data voluntarily, Victor and 4AIR are calling on all airlines to increase transparency, improve flight-path planning and work with Air Traffic Control to reduce contrail-forming flights,” according to Victor and 4AIR. “This inaugural report represents a step toward greater accountability in aviation and will be published annually.” Read the full report here.",https://www.corporatejetinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CJI-Contrail-Anon-Jet-Shutterstock-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:57:17.782524

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.
And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.
“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.
The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.","U.S. government support of sustainable aviation fuel has waned, shifting the impetus for increasing its production to the states. But progress continues.

“It’s a pivot,” says Keith Sawyer, Avfuel manager of alternative fuels. “The focus had been typically on the federal government; now investors are including what may or may not be offered by states in their calculations, in their rates of return on investment in facilities.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) that became law with President Donald Trump’s signature on July 4 amended the existing 45Z clean fuel production credit (CFPC) to benefit biofuel producers instead of blenders and extended it for two years through 2029. Added to the tax code during the Biden administration through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CFPC was set to expire in 2027.

The continuation of the tax credit is cause for some optimism that ongoing development of SAF capacity is supported—given that one of Trump’s early actions after becoming president in January was to pause funding disbursements under the IRA, which was considered a major achievement of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.

Trump’s executive order was slowed by legal challenges, but the OBBB approved by the Republican majority in Congress contains a section that rescinds unobligated balances of the FAA’s Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant program, also established under the IRA.

The Biden administration had announced $291 million in FAST grants in August 2024, primarily for 22 projects “that produce, transport, blend or store sustainable aviation fuel.” The largest single grant—$50 million—went to Martinez Renewables LLC, a 50/50 joint venture of Marathon Petroleum and SAF producer Neste, to fund the conversion of a Marathon facility in Martinez, California, for renewable fuels production.

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.

Under the OBBB, the CFPC has been modified; the value of the credit for production of “neat” or pure, unblended SAF declines from $1.75-per-gallon to $1-per-gallon after 2025, aligning it with the credit for renewable diesel. And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada. Sugar cane, soybeans, tallow, used oils and greases sourced outside of North America won’t qualify.

“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.

The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Also welcoming the new 45Z credit as one of the OBBB’s “America First” energy provisions was Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, a coalition that joins Airbus, Airlines for America, Delta Air Lines, and NBAA representing the aviation industry with agriculture groups and energy companies ExxonMobil and BP.

SAF is now moving into mainstream adoption, driven by international mandates such as ReFuelEU in Europe, the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, and airline emissions targets. With policies tightening and carbon credit markets maturing, SAF is positioned to become one of the fastest-growing areas in renewable energy. For producers like XCF, this transition represents a significant opportunity to secure offtake agreements and build durable revenue streams.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""XCF is excited to share our vision for scaling sustainable aviation fuel worldwide and building one of the most important new markets in renewable energy.

,,2025-10-06 11:44:18+00:00,The Salata Institute,A policy playbook to meet sustainable aviation fuel targets - The Salata Institute,Not Available,,,,,https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/a-policy-playbook-to-meet-sustainable-aviation-fuel-targets/,"The only near-term option is to replace a slice of today’s petroleum-based jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a cleaner drop-in product that planes can already use.
The paper finds that the U.S. target is attainable with current technology, but not with current policy.
Under current policy, surface fuel wins most of the incentives and the limited supply of oils and fats.
Because these levers change fuel prices, fuel choices, and government spending in different ways, the money flows add up differently.
A second option is a national “clean aviation” standard that steadily lowers the carbon intensity of jet fuel, making jet fuel suppliers meet a target.","Aviation is one of the hardest parts of the economy to decarbonize. New planes that run on hydrogen or batteries are being tested, but technical hurdles and slow fleet turnover mean these solutions are years away.

The only near-term option is to replace a slice of today’s petroleum-based jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a cleaner drop-in product that planes can already use. SAF is made mostly from biological sources (like waste vegetable oils, tallow, or crops). Over its lifecycle, it reduces emissions – unlike burning a fossil fuel, which releases carbon that had been locked underground for millions of years.

A new paper circulated on October 6 by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) uses, for the first time, a detailed economic model of the U.S. road- and jet-fuel markets to test real policy choices. The authors, led by a team at Harvard, calculate how overlapping state and federal incentives stack up. They lay out the trade-offs in designing SAF policy, consider interactions with markets for the biofuels used in surface transportation, and offer clear guidance for policymakers trying to cut aviation emissions.

The challenge is immense. The Department of Energy has set a goal of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030. As of early 2024, domestic SAF production capacity was roughly 31 million gallons – about 1% of the target and just 0.1% of the U.S. jet-fuel market.

The paper finds that the U.S. target is attainable with current technology, but not with current policy. Under today’s mix of policies (the Renewable Fuel Standard, state low-carbon fuel standards, the new Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (45Z), and state SAF tax credits), the economists’ model projects only a small bump in SAF production by 2030.

Because most SAF comes from the same feedstocks as the biofuels used in ground transportation, the two compete for both raw materials and policy subsidies. Under current policy, surface fuel wins most of the incentives and the limited supply of oils and fats. For example, an increasing share of feedstock that could be used for SAF is converted instead to less-expensive renewable diesel to satisfy California’s low-carbon fuel standards.

The question is whether those surface uses can pivot towards jets. The paper argues yes: It would cost more, but not a lot more. It would require policy changes, but there are multiple ways to achieve the pivot.

Pathways to the 2030 target

Different rules move different levers, shifting the bill among motorists, taxpayers, and air passengers. Because these levers change fuel prices, fuel choices, and government spending in different ways, the money flows add up differently. So does the average cost per ton of CO₂ abated.

One path the authors model is to update the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, a Congressional mandate that biofuels be blended into road fuels sold throughout the country, so jet fuel has its own target and isn’t just competing with surface biofuels.

A second option is a national “clean aviation” standard that steadily lowers the carbon intensity of jet fuel, making jet fuel suppliers meet a target. The European Union is going down this path this as part of its net-zero goals.

These paths cost about the same as current policy but yield a 40-46% increase in emissions reductions.

A third option – creating a new federal SAF tax credit on top of current rules – also boosts SAF by stimulating supply, but is more expensive. This cuts emissions about 22% more than current policy, but at about 25% higher average cost per ton of CO₂ avoided.

Aiming higher

Emissions cuts would be about 110% larger than under today’s policy mix, at about the same cost, if policymakers did two things at once: Create a SAF-only category within the Renewable Fuel Standard and expand the Standard so the country must use more low-carbon fuel in total, not just reshuffle it from trucks to planes. But this would raise pressure on limited agricultural land and drive up crop prices, and thus food prices nationally and globally.

The analysis does not count future innovations that could make SAF cheaper over time. Whether bio-based SAF or e-fuels (“power-to-liquids”) become cheaper is still an open question.

Yet under all scenarios, the analysis shows that if policymakers align incentives so aviation and trucking are not competing for the same fuels, the U.S. can scale SAF much faster and cut more emissions this decade, at a cost not much higher than the country is paying for its current biofuels.",https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_365895620_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 10:56:08.379915

Now known as Par Hawaii East, the facility is the site of Hawaii’s first SAF project.
However, the state’s carbon reduction mandate requires the utilities to provide 100% renewable energy by 2045, according to Wright.
“The renewable fuel we’re making is going to help the utilities hit their mandated renewable energy goals.
After the technology was proved out, Par Pacific moved forward with the technology, installing it in their new system.","More than 2,400 miles from the mainland U.S., energy company Par Pacific Holdings Inc. serves as Hawaii’s lone refinery. In 2023, the company decided to add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel to their product portfolio, creating a unit focused on developing renewable fuels projects. This unit developed the Hawaii Renewables Project at the Par Hawaii East refinery near Kapolei, Hawaii. Currently, the refinery’s capacity stand at 94,000 barrels per day (b/d) of conventional fuel. In 2023, the company committed to converting one of its units into a hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process. When operation begins, the renewables unit will produce 4,000 b/d, or 60 MMgy, of renewable diesel and SAF.

Par Pacific made its debut in the Hawaiian market in 2013 with the purchase of a refinery formerly owned by Tesoro. Now known as Par Hawaii East, the facility is the site of Hawaii’s first SAF project.

Refining Resilience

The grit and determination of Par Pacific’s leadership led to its current market position, according to Jon Goldsmith, senior vice president of renewables with Par Pacific. When the then-startup company first entered the Hawaiian market, it was a case of David and Goliath, with Par competing against one of the world’s largest energy companies—Chevron. Tesoro was shuttering a 50-year-old refinery in Kapolei, a city on Hawaii’s Oahu Island. “We invested capital, we restarted the plant, and we were able to maintain all these critical jobs and on-island energy production,” he tells Biomass Magazine. “And Hawaii has limited high-quality manufacturing and industrial sector jobs.”

In 2016, Chevron sold its refinery to Island Energy Services. A few years later, the refinery was shuttered and Par Hawaii acquired most of the assets. Through strategic acquisitions of refineries from fuel suppliers, after seven years, Par Pacific emerged as the state’s only refiner. Not only playing a key role as a fuel supplier for the electrical grid, shipping and air transport, Par Hawaii also provides high-paying jobs in a market with few job options. Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii, has lived in the state for eight years. Par Hawaii takes its role as one of few high-paying industrial employers very seriously. The refinery employs about 300 people, paying new workers $40 per hour.

“It’s not for everybody, but for people who are looking for a good career path, this is really a great option for them,” Wright says. “The renewable fuels project helps solidify our future and make sure that we stay relevant as a state pursues its clean energy goals.”

In-House Development

In 2019, the refinery invested in a distillate hydrogen treater, which removes sulfur from diesel and helps refiners hit the regulation specification of 15 parts per million. The unit ran for a couple years before the company observed the growth of the renewable fuels industry, and Par Pacific decided to explore converting the unit to a dedicated HEFA renewable fuels plant. In 2022, the company partnered with Hawaiian Airlines to explore SAF production. After a year of exploring the technical demands of the project with technology provider Topsoe, and as well as economic potential for SAF and renewable diesel production, Par Pacific committed to pressing forward on the project in 2023.

Goldsmith emphasizes the impressive capabilities of Par Hawaii’s experienced engineers, who allowed the company to develop, design and execute the project without hiring an engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Par Pacific’s new mission statement, “Humbly serving communities,” has been evidenced in the company’s engagement with the surrounding community, Goldsmith explains.

This in-house approach allowed Par Pacific to develop the 60 MMgy HEFA unit for less than $100 million dollars, a cost of around $1.50 per gallon. “If you look at other projects that have been announced, that’s relatively cheap and the reason for that is we have the refinery with a lot of existing infrastructure that we were able to utilize,” Wright says.

Combining Forces

Par Pacific recently announced the formation of Hawaii Renewables LLC, a joint venture company with Alohi Renewable Energy LLC (a partnership between Mitsubishi Corp. and ENEOS Corp., two of Japan’s largest energy and trading companies), where Par Pacific would contribute and operate the renewable fuel production assets in Hawaii.

The partnership will combine Par Pacific’s advantaged West Coast and Hawaii asset base and operational capabilities with improved market access via Mitsubishi’s terminal in Long Beach, California. Both ENEOS and Mitsubishi will enhance the business by leveraging their global integrated businesses and providing their technical, trading and feedstock origination capabilities across Asia-Pacific and North America.

“We are thrilled to be combining forces with Mitsubishi and ENEOS,” Goldsmith says. “We have been collaborating for well over a year and have had the opportunity to shape the partnership in a way that will bring value to all parties.”

Markets & Mandates

Hawaii is a unique market for renewable fuels, Wright explains. The state’s electrical grid primarily relies on diesel or fuel oil for power generation, with around 65% of the state’s energy derived from these sources. However, the state’s carbon reduction mandate requires the utilities to provide 100% renewable energy by 2045, according to Wright. “Liquid fuels will always be a part of the mix here,” he explains. “The renewable fuel we’re making is going to help the utilities hit their mandated renewable energy goals. But the great thing about our project is that we can sell the diesel to the utilities, and the sustainable aviation fuel we can sell to the airlines. The diesel can also go to the marine market shipping. So, we really hit a lot of different sectors of the economy with our project.”

The state must meet certain benchmarks progressing toward the ultimate goal of 100% renewable energy: 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2040. Hawaii’s liquid fuel demand stands at about 100,000 b/d, meaning that Par Hawaii’s renewable fuel unit will not overwhelm the market. Goldsmith explains that the max SAF volume is around 2,400 b/d, around 5% of the approximately 50,000 b/d jet fuel market. “The project scale is right-sized for the Hawaii market,” he says.

The infrastructure acquired and developed over the years enables the company to send products to market in a cost-efficient manner. Par Hawaii owns a 20-mile pipeline that runs from the refinery’s jet fuel storage to Honolulu Airport. Once production starts, the refinery can blend SAF with its conventional jet fuel and ship it down the pipeline, directly to the airport. “We’re very closely integrated with the airport and the jet fuel infrastructure in a way that a lot of other facilities aren’t,” Wright says.

Feedstock Flexibility

The unit is able to handle a wide range of feedstocks, including beef tallow, used cooking oil and more. To maximize economic benefits, Par Hawaii has installed an innovative, and first-of-its-kind pretreatment technology developed by Lutros LLC.

Par Pacific helped finance Lutros’ pilot plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After the technology was proved out, Par Pacific moved forward with the technology, installing it in their new system. Wright explains that since the facility will utilize diverse feedstocks, pretreatment helps ensure that the oils are free of any contaminants that could poison the catalyst. The company recognized the importance of onsite pretreatment, rather than purchasing treated feedstock.

Collocating the renewable fuels unit alongside a refinery benefits the process in a number of ways. The presence of preexisting hydrogen infrastructure is one such benefit, according to Wright. Par Hawaii East used to process a lot of Alaskan crude oil, which has a high sulfur content. Due to that, the refinery added hydrogen to reach required fuel specifications. Currently, the refinery uses a “sweeter” crude slate with less sulfur, meaning that the hydrogen plants were underutilized.

The hydrogen is produced via a process similar to steam methane reforming but substituting propane for methane, the unit separates the carbon and hydrogen, allowing the hydrogen to be used in the SAF production. “The renewable fuels unit will actually, in the first stage of the unit, make a lot of renewable propane from the renewable feedstock,” Wright says. “And so, we’re able to feed that to the hydrogen unit and produce renewable hydrogen that then gets used to make the renewable fuel. We don’t make enough renewable propane to say … we’re using all green hydrogen, but we come pretty close.”

Currently, fuel production requires importing all feedstock by ship, both from the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Jones Act requires cargo travelling from one U.S. port to another to be transported by a U.S.-built ship, flying a U.S. flag and crewed by Americans. Par Hawaii charters one of these ships under a long-term lease, which transports feedstock and products from Par Pacific’s refinery in Tacoma, Washington, out to Hawaii. Wright highlights that many HEFA plants use imported feedstock of some type, whether that be used cooking oil from Asia or canola oil from Canada.

A Second Life

Par Hawaii is already seeking solutions for its feedstock access challenges, exploring Hawaii-based feedstocks with Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private conservation company. The group tests the viability of growing various crops on fallow agricultural land across the state. One such crop is camelina, a promising HEFA feedstock.

Camelina has potential to not only serve as a feedstock for the oils needed for SAF, but also provide animal feed at an affordable price to livestock farmers within the state, explains Chris Bennett, vice president of sustainable energy solutions with Pono Pacific. The crop’s short growth cycle—80 to 100 days—could allow it to serve as a cover crop, rotating with food production during Hawaii’s long growing season. “If we’re successful, and we’re able to activate fallow lands, that actually means more land is in production,” Bennett says.

Pono completed pilot tests of several camelina varieties and identified the best strain for the region. The next step is to expand the project to 100-acre plots, with the five-year plan being to reach 50,000 acres. The ultimate goal is not to fully provide Par Hawaii’s feedstock, as there isn’t acreage available in the state to grow camelina at that scale, but Pono Pacific plans to provide 10% to 20% of the refinery’s feedstock if the project’s scale-up is successful.

“I think this is such a great project that shows that an oil refinery and a 25-year [old] land conservation company can find common ground and work together in a way that potentially could be very positive for the state of Hawaii,” Bennett says.

Hawaii’s unique, high-demand market offers a wide range of opportunities for renewable fuel producers. Renewable diesel demand originating from the cruise ship industry, marine fuel, electric grid and more, along with the state’s large, aviation fuel-reliant tourist industry and the state’s net-zero carbon emissions goals creates a perfect storm for renewable fuel demand. Although the logistics of feedstock supply and lack of a strong tax credit framework for renewable fuels constitute a challenge, they are not impossible to overcome. “I think it’s a great story that this refinery had a second life and now we’re making a big investment in it, and solidifying its future,” Wright adds. “As you can imagine, our people are really excited about it. It’s something new we get to learn how to do.”

As one of the world’s largest economies and a regional leader, Indonesia could help shape the global climate agenda – while also showcasing the progress it is making on its own decarbonization pathway.

BloombergNEF’s Indonesia Transition Factbook aims to support policy, business and investment professionals by making available key data about the country’s energy transition, as well as the trends, challenges and opportunities that are shaping it.

Indonesia’s net-zero transformation presents a $3.8 trillion opportunity through 2050.

The country still relies heavily on fossil fuels for power generation, but it is also starting to accelerate its clean power deployment on the back of a new, renewables-rich power development plan and rapidly expanding solar and battery supply chains. Indonesia is already the world’s second-largest producer of geothermal power and is aiming for the top spot.

In the transport sector, electric vehicles are quickly gaining traction on Indonesian roads. EVs reached a 14% share of passenger vehicle sales from January to August 2025, and many foreign automakers are setting up EV production facilities in the country. Meanwhile, state-owned airlines have started commercial flights with sustainable aviation fuel made by the national oil and gas company, Pertamina.

Indonesia is one of the world’s top sources of energy transition metals, such as nickel, cobalt, bauxite and copper. In the coming years and decades, Indonesia’s supply of these materials will be essential if the world is to meet its climate goals. On the sustainable finance front, the volume of sustainable and sustainability-linked debt issued in Indonesia grew 12-fold to $6.3 billion in 2024 from $0.5 billion in 2015, indicating an increasingly lively market.

With one of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems in the world, Indonesia can also lead the way in sustaining biodiversity. The archipelago’s vast potential for providing nature-based solutions puts it at the heart of the growing global trade of carbon credits, a financial instrument that could be key to saving these diverse ecosystems.",https://assets.bbhub.io/image/v1/convert?type=auto&url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bbhub.io%2Fprofessional%2Fsites%2F44%2FAutomated-Manufacturing-Facility-new.png,N,,2025-10-05 23:56:23.874782

O Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária recebeu, pela primeira vez em 165 anos, a visita de um presidente da Petrobras. Magda Chambriard e o ministro Carlos Fávaro discutiram a integração entre o agronegócio e o setor energético.

Na ocasião, a Petrobras apresentou três frentes de atuação no agro: originação de matérias-primas, polos de venda e comercialização direta com grandes consumidores.

A estatal também destacou o crescimento da demanda por diesel nas regiões do Centro-Oeste e MATOPIBA, que abrange o Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí e a Bahia, impulsionado pela expansão agrícola.

Segundo Magda Chambriard, o futuro do Brasil passa pela união entre o petróleo e o agro.

Entre os temas abordados, estão o fortalecimento da infraestrutura logística, o avanço dos biocombustíveis – como etanol de milho, biodiesel, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) e o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) — e parcerias com cooperativas e centros de pesquisa para desenvolver fertilizantes mais eficientes.

Para o ministro Carlos Fávaro, o encontro aproxima de forma concreta os dois setores:

Driven by rising fuel costs and sustainability goals, airlines are rediscovering the value of propeller-driven efficiency on short routes. Models like the De Havilland Dash 8, ATR 42, and the upcoming Deutsche Aircraft D328eco are proving that slower can sometimes mean smarter. With jets offering little advantage on 200–300-mile hops, turboprops burn far less fuel, operate from shorter runways, and cost less to maintain — a powerful equation in today’s tight-margin market.

From the US to Europe and Asia, regional carriers are returning to turboprops to connect smaller cities and remote regions. In North America, airlines like Porter and WestJet Encore use Dash 8s to serve rural hubs. Across island nations like Indonesia and the Philippines, they remain essential lifelines. The next generation, led by Germany’s D328eco, combines speed, range, and green technology — even capable of flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.

Once dismissed as outdated, turboprops are now being reimagined as the backbone of regional mobility — efficient, versatile, and ready for the era of low-emission flying. #fblifestyle"".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/558087021_122250711842064089_5844283536119857744_n.jpg?stp=c216.0.648.648a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&efg=eyJlZmdfdGFnIjoiRkVFRC5iZXN0X2ltYWdlX3VybGdlbi5DMyJ9&_nc_ohc=HdBGVbh7BdYQ7kNvwEJF3fg&_nc_oc=Adl7YRCG8U56Wfp5k-Un7bSOs8udh9tpvwrnMZU7igskhfPsV2mDihGxKNMsTbC_TCw&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=8Zqc2zsI-lPiRz6io4GESA&oh=00_AfdFE4OEcPkPG3A4irmdMk-FekHJBKbVGtGYlERyBxvELw&oe=68E90804,N,,2025-10-06 00:56:23.989930

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuel producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, that turns cattle fat, called tallow, into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuel market. It has collected more than $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofues since 2022, according to filings.

Farmers urged to be grain-safe this fall

Working around grain bins comes with risk, from farmers falling to drowning in grain: Experts have five tips to help avoid grain-related accidents this harvest.

However, interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025, according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel.

However, government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, which many consider the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law.

“Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed more than a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally cleared land in the Amazon.

In 2022, Darling Ingredients chief executive officer Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found that one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meat packers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been co-operating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 sq. miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama.

Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle were moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner, Antonio Lucena Barros, still owes more than $3 million in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer, Calebe Rocha, said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer, Vinicius Segatto, said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to expand their pastures because of its economic value — less than three per cent of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a byproduct of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to expand their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02161144/190830_web1_2012-10-23T120000Z_974771627_GM1E8AN10Q101_RTRMADP_3_BRAZIL-SOY-CATTLE.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 22:56:12.507873

“This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5% (101,809ha) to 5.1% (210,000ha) annually,” he said.
He expressed hope that the government would approve RM280mil in funding for oil palm replanting programmes specifically for independent smallholders.","KUALA LUMPUR: The palm oil industry has called for more targeted incentives and policy support under Budget 2026 to enhance export competitiveness, boost yields and productivity, and strengthen sustainability, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB).

Its director-general, Datuk Dr Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir, said the government should intensify trade promotion and branding initiatives to position Malaysian palm oil as a sustainable, climate-smart commodity.

“Stronger branding reinforces Malaysia’s commitment to sustainability standards such as Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and the National Traceability System, which improves transparency and accountability.

“This credibility helps counter negative campaigns in key export markets and assures buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious consumer demand,” he told Bernama.

He said the industry is also seeking fiscal incentives for downstream products, including oleochemicals, specialty fats, bioenergy, and sustainable aviation fuel, describing them as key levers to future-proof the sector against regulatory pressures, shifting consumer preferences, and global sustainability requirements.

“We urge more strategic support for logistics efficiency, including incentives for greener and lower-cost export solutions, to address both immediate cost pressures and long-term market positioning, ensuring that Malaysia’s palm oil industry remains resilient and future-ready,” he added.

Raising yield and productivity

Ahmad Parveez said a 100% reinvestment allowance for oil palm replanting should be encouraged to accelerate replanting by both private and government agencies.

“This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5% (101,809ha) to 5.1% (210,000ha) annually,” he said.

He expressed hope that the government would approve RM280mil in funding for oil palm replanting programmes specifically for independent smallholders.

“Recognising the urgent need to rejuvenate ageing plantations, the government remains committed to supporting independent smallholders and will continue to fast-track the replanting programme under the 13th Malaysia Plan.

“This includes improving delivery mechanisms, facilitating access to financial assistance, and strengthening outreach and engagement with smallholder communities,” he said.

He noted that the introduction of a RM100mil soft loan scheme for small and medium oil palm estates was timely to rejuvenate ageing and unproductive trees, which currently contribute to declining yields and reduced competitiveness.

“Similar to Smallholder Oil Palm Replanting Programme, this scheme would allow smallholders to undertake replanting without heavy financial strain, thereby accelerating rejuvenation across a wider segment of the industry.

“In the medium to long term, this initiative will boost national crude palm oil production through higher-yielding palm varieties and better farm management practices,” he noted.

Promoting a sustainable future

Ahmad Parveez proposed imposing a 3% export duty on refined, bleached and deodorised palm stearin to discourage excessive exports and ensure sufficient supply for the domestic oleochemical sector.

He said maintaining an adequate domestic supply of raw materials would sustain production and competitiveness while indirectly supporting the palm-based oleochemical industry.

“By strengthening downstream industries, we create a more sustainable and resilient palm oil future, adding higher value locally and safeguarding long-term competitiveness,” he said.

He also suggested imposing a 10% to 20% export duty on waste oils, including used cooking oil and palm oil mill effluent.

This would promote local utilisation and value addition by securing sufficient feedstock for biodiesel, renewable fuels, and oleochemical production.

“Additionally, duties would help reinforce compliance with sustainability and certification standards such as MSPO and International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, which are crucial for both domestic use and export credibility.

“In the longer term, this measure would accelerate Malaysia’s transition towards a circular, greener palm oil industry and strengthen its global competitiveness as a responsible and future-ready commodity.”

Overcoming external challenges

Ahmad Parveez added that the Budget 2026 could play a pivotal role in helping the palm oil sector overcome external challenges while fostering growth, productivity and resilience.

He said replanting programmes for smallholders and small and medium enterprise plantations should be expanded, with an emphasis on high-yielding and disease-resistant planting materials.

“The focus should also be on strengthening sustainability compliance through universal MSPO adoption and robust traceability systems.

“Compliance with global environmental, social and governance standards is vital to safeguard Malaysia’s position in international markets.

“Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency,” he added.",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/10/06/3556304.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 20:56:19.644707

AIS chief executive Somchai Lertsutiwong said the company plans to address climate change through efficient management of its business operations and supply chain.

Mr Somchai said the potential of digital technology and collaboration from several sectors are the keys to driving the country towards a sustainable future.

He said AIS's digital green initiative includes greener products and services, a greener supply chain and customers, a greener corporation and greener business growth.

GREEN NETWORK

The company upgraded equipment at its cellular network base stations nationwide and integrated them with clean energy, alongside conventional energy supplies.

For example, AIS recently installed solar energy systems at more than 13,000 cellular network base stations and buildings.

Mr Somchai said the move was crucial in remote areas, where 100% alternative energy is required to support communication services.

One of AIS's green initiatives is called ""Green Energy, Green Network for Thais"", delivering solar power-generated electricity to communities and installing solar-powered cellular base stations to create digital networks for communities.

AIS, Gulf Development, and the Highland Research and Development Institute (HRDI) teamed up for the project last year, seeking to improve the quality of life for Thais in highland areas.

Two pilot projects are running in the Ban Dok Mai Sod community and Moko Poke community in Tak province's Tha Song Yang district.

Mr Somchai said the goal is to reduce inequality, improve quality of life and foster sustainable economic growth within these communities.

The trio continued their partnership with the commencement of a second year of the project in June 2025.

Another project took place in Ban Doi Wiang in Chiang Mai's Chai Prakan district, where Gulf joined forces with AIS and satellite operator Thaicom to install solar panels at the Mae Fah Luang Community Learning Center.

The clean energy generated supports internet and satellite connectivity, enabling children and youth to access new knowledge and educational opportunities.

The AIS network also enhances digital access and communication for the entire community.

Furthermore, the project supported the construction of a solar-powered coffee processing facility and provided coffee milling equipment, allowing locals to add value to their produce and develop a community-owned coffee brand.

Mr Somchai said AIS leverages artificial intelligence to manage energy consumption at its base stations.

Regarding waste management, AIS focuses on reducing and recycling waste from its operations under its ""Zero E-Waste to Landfill"" goal -- meaning no electronic waste ends up in landfills.

The company also encouraged the public to properly manage e-waste, he said.

HUB OF E-WASTE

Saichon Submakudom, head of corporate communication and public affairs at AIS, said sustainability and environmental stewardship are at the heart of its operations, particularly in the area of e-waste management.

""We are committed to becoming Thailand's hub of e-waste,"" Ms Saichon said.

AIS, together with more than 250 public and private sector partners, has been raising awareness about the impact of e-waste and providing convenient disposal channels that ensure proper recycling, she said.

Since 2020, AIS's collaboration with Central Group on an e-waste project has expanded to include more than 42 e-waste drop-off points nationwide.

Every piece of e-waste deposited with AIS is handled through its partnership with Waste Management Siam (WMS), a member of Dowa Group.

According to AIS, the amount of e-waste increases every year globally. In 2024, 62 million tonnes of e-waste was generated and estimates suggest the quantity will increase to 74 million tonnes by 2030 and 110 tonnes by 2050.

Of the 62 million tonnes of e-waste produced in 2024, only 22% of it was managed properly, according to the company.

Some 439,495 tonnes of e-waste was generated in Thailand in 2024 and only 10% of it was handled properly, noted AIS.

Thailand ranks third in Southeast Asia for greatest quantity of e-waste produced.

FLY FOR FREE

AIS recently partnered with Central and Japan Airlines (JAL) to launch the ""Film Your E-Waste Drop & Fly to Japan for Free!"" campaign.

The campaign invites AIS customers, as well as eco-conscious shoppers using Central outlets, to unleash their creativity by producing short videos that inspire friends to dispose of e-waste correctly.

The winners are awarded an exclusive trip to Japan via JAL, featuring an all-inclusive dining, travelling and shopping experience. The campaign runs from now until Nov 30.

The trip includes a collaboration between AIS and Central to explore Japan's comprehensive e-waste management and recycling ecosystem at a Dowa company in Japan.

Dowa possesses a wealth of expertise in e-waste management and recycling, and is a global leader in e-waste solutions.

Achara Wisuttiwongrat, head of corporate marketing, communication and sustainability at Central, said the company set a target to reduce landfill waste by at least 30% by 2030, and achieve zero landfill waste by 2050 through its ""Love The Earth – Zero Waste Now"" project.

Takafumi Sawada, regional manager of Thailand, Indochina, and the South Asian subcontinent at JAL, said the airline is deeply committed to its environmental and social responsibilities.

He said the airline set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from used cooking oil during flights.

JAL plans to increase the proportion of SAF it uses to 10% by 2030, while modernising its fleet with new, energy-efficient aircraft.

The airline is following the ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle + Redesign"" principle by eliminating single-use plastics and introducing biodegradable food containers to reduce its environmental impact, said Mr Sawada.

SHIFTING GEARS

Yoshihiro Okada, president of WMS, said Dowa Group has been involved in mining and metal smelting for more than 140 years.

""We shifted our business direction to address the depletion of natural resources by turning e-waste into a valuable source of raw materials for precious metal extraction,"" he said.

In Thailand, Mr Okada said Dowa believes ""e-waste is not waste, but a valuable resource"".

Through its collaboration with AIS, the e-waste collected is sent to ESBEC, a subsidiary of WMS, for dismantling.

Most of the recyclable materials are processed domestically, while non-recyclable components such as mobile phone batteries are safely disposed of using energy recovery incineration.

For complex yet highly valuable components, such as printed circuit boards containing multiple precious metals, these are exported to Dowa's facilities in Japan for advanced recycling processes.

Mr Okada said as a global leader in resource extraction and circular utilisation, Dowa is committed to reintegrating these recovered metals back into industrial processes -- helping to build a more sustainable future for both society and the environment.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/10/06/5806160_700.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 20:56:34.998147

Sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediately viable option for reducing aviation emissions while existing aircraft continue operating.
Its involvement in sustainable aviation fuel development reflects a strategic bet that the sector offers genuine development potential rather than just environmental benefits.","Africa’s aviation industry could soon be producing its own sustainable fuel rather than relying entirely on imported jet fuel, following a new partnership between the African Development Bank (AfDB) and a major Japanese engineering company. The collaboration, announced Friday, aims to develop production capacity for sustainable aviation fuel across the continent while advancing climate goals and reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports.

The AfDB and JGC Corporation signed a Letter of Intent on August 21 in Yokohama during the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9), establishing a framework for cooperation on green aviation projects. The timing reflects growing global momentum toward cleaner aviation fuels as airlines and governments seek ways to reduce the sector’s substantial carbon footprint.

Under the agreement, both organizations will share technical information, conduct demand assessments and feasibility studies, and explore opportunities to co finance sustainable aviation fuel projects across Africa. For the AfDB, the partnership fits within its broader sustainable transport and energy transition strategy, which increasingly targets sectors with high emissions and significant economic impact.

“Adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” said Solomon Quaynor, the bank’s Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization. “Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time.”

His emphasis on competitiveness highlights an economic dimension beyond environmental benefits. Airlines operating in Africa currently purchase conventional jet fuel at prices determined by global oil markets and supply chain logistics that favor established aviation hubs. Developing domestic sustainable aviation fuel production could eventually provide cost advantages while creating new industries and employment opportunities.

JGC Corporation, founded in 1928 and headquartered in Yokohama, brings substantial engineering expertise to the partnership. The company has expanded beyond traditional plant engineering into renewable energy and sustainable fuels in recent years, positioning itself to help African countries adapt technologies that have been tested in other markets to local conditions and feedstock availability.

“We are proud to collaborate with the African Development Bank in advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa,” said Shoji Yamada, JGC’s President. “By leveraging our experience in plant engineering and sustainable energy, we aim to contribute to Africa’s decarbonization efforts while fostering local economic growth and innovation.”

The company’s role will include conducting demand assessments that determine how much sustainable aviation fuel African airlines and airports could realistically consume, performing technical feasibility studies to identify promising production locations and technologies, and exploring how Japanese sustainable aviation fuel systems might need modification to work effectively in African contexts.

The AfDB, meanwhile, will coordinate with public sector aviation stakeholders including national airlines, airport authorities, and transportation ministries. The bank plans to identify potential project pipelines, develop financing options that could make projects viable for private investors, and promote partnerships around sustainable aviation initiatives throughout its 41 African member countries.

Sustainable aviation fuel represents a category of jet fuel derived from renewable sources rather than petroleum. Common feedstocks include plant oils, agricultural waste materials, municipal solid waste, and even carbon captured from industrial processes. When produced and used properly, these fuels can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel, according to industry assessments.

The fuel isn’t entirely new. Airlines globally have been testing and using sustainable aviation fuel in limited quantities for years, often blending small percentages with conventional fuel. What’s changing is the scale of production and adoption as governments implement climate policies and airlines respond to pressure from customers and investors to reduce emissions.

For Africa, entering the sustainable aviation fuel market presents both opportunities and challenges. The continent has abundant agricultural resources and waste streams that could serve as feedstock for fuel production. Many African countries also have significant solar energy potential that could power production facilities, creating genuinely low carbon fuel production chains.

However, building sustainable aviation fuel production capacity requires substantial upfront investment in specialized facilities and supply chain infrastructure. The technology, while proven, remains more expensive than conventional refining in most contexts. And African countries would need to develop regulatory frameworks governing fuel quality standards, sustainability certifications, and integration with existing aviation fuel supply systems.

The partnership announcement comes as global aviation confronts its climate impact. The sector accounts for roughly 2 to 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, a share that’s been growing as air travel expands faster than efficiency improvements can offset. Unlike some industries where electrification offers a clear pathway to decarbonization, aviation faces significant technical hurdles in moving away from liquid fuels, particularly for long haul flights.

Sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediately viable option for reducing aviation emissions while existing aircraft continue operating. The fuel works in current engines without modification, unlike hydrogen or battery electric propulsion systems that would require entirely new aircraft designs.

For African nations, the economic calculus around sustainable aviation fuel development includes multiple factors beyond direct production costs. Countries currently spend significant foreign exchange importing jet fuel. Domestic production could improve trade balances while creating skilled manufacturing jobs. The agricultural and waste management sectors might find new revenue streams by supplying feedstock to fuel producers.

There’s also a competitive dimension. If sustainable aviation fuel production scales up in other regions while Africa remains dependent on imports, African airlines could face cost disadvantages as carbon pricing mechanisms and sustainability requirements proliferate. Developing domestic capacity now could position the continent advantageously for future market conditions.

The AfDB has been actively financing infrastructure and industrial projects across Africa, operating as the continent’s premier development finance institution with support for initiatives in 54 regional member states. Its involvement in sustainable aviation fuel development reflects a strategic bet that the sector offers genuine development potential rather than just environmental benefits.

Whether this partnership generates significant on the ground projects remains to be seen. Memoranda of understanding and letters of intent are common in development finance, sometimes leading to substantial initiatives but other times failing to advance beyond preliminary studies. Success will likely depend on identifying specific countries with favorable conditions for initial projects, securing adequate financing, and navigating regulatory complexities.

What’s clear is that both organizations see opportunity in Africa’s potential role in the emerging sustainable aviation fuel industry. As Quaynor suggested, the partnership could “unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector.” Whether that optimistic vision materializes will depend on execution in the months and years ahead, but the framework for collaboration is now established.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-10-05 18:56:12.329894

The African Development Bank (AfDB) and Japan’s JGC Corporation have signed a Letter of Intent to collaborate on developing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects across Africa — a move that could help accelerate the continent’s transition toward greener air transport.

The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) held in Yokohama last month, by Solomon Quaynor, AfDB Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, and Shoji Yamada, Representative Director and President of JGC Corporation.

SAF refers to jet fuel produced from renewable resources such as plant oils, waste materials, or captured carbon, which can significantly reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

The Letter of Intent establishes a framework for joint promotion, knowledge exchange, and co-financing opportunities in the development of SAF and other green aviation initiatives on the continent.

As part of the agreement, the AfDB will facilitate coordination with public-sector aviation stakeholders, identify potential project pipelines, and explore financing mechanisms — including feasibility study support and debt or equity financing.

Meanwhile, JGC Corporation will conduct demand and technical feasibility studies, assess deployment opportunities based on local infrastructure and resources, and help transfer Japanese clean-energy technology to African markets.

The initiative aligns with the AfDB’s sustainable transport, mobility, and energy transition strategy, aimed at decarbonizing key sectors of Africa’s economy while supporting industrial growth and innovation.

Quaynor said the partnership represents an important step toward reducing emissions and enhancing competitiveness in Africa’s aviation sector.

“Adopting sustainable aviation fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” he said.

“Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time. This partnership with JGC will help unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector.”

Countries use a wide variety of financial management systems and processes, which are not standardized and seldom share information across platforms.

To address these issues, the World Bank is rolling out FundsChain.

This proprietary platform uses blockchain technology to track every dollar on a secure, immutable digital ledger that can be accessed by all project stakeholders.

By offering broader access to up-to-date transaction records, FundsChain is greatly enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability.

As the first multilateral development institution to implement blockchain for project oversight, the World Bank is leading the way in future-ready financial management.

Impact on financial management and communities

The use of FundsChain to track project funds is part of a broader effort to make World Bank Group (WBG) operations more efficient and streamlined, ultimately better serving clients and communities.

“FundsChain is a one-stop shop for financial reporting and transparent tracking. It quickly shows payments, contracts, and expenses, notifying suppliers the moment payments are ready, empowering teams to make timely, informed decisions and streamline project management,” said Lovella Tolentino-Morada, finance management specialist at the Metro Manila Development Authority.

The Philippines was one of the early adopters of FundsChain, which was rolled out to the Metro Manila Flood Management Project, a USD 500 million initiative funded by the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

The project aims to reduce Manila’s vulnerability to floods by upgrading water infrastructure.

In Bangladesh, FundsChain is being used in the Bangladesh Resilience, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood Improvement Project.

This initiative targets 3,200 villages to help women launch entrepreneurial ventures, cover pregnancy-related expenses, improve sanitation, and provide wider support for the community.

Since the project worth USD 600 million began in 2021, it has helped lift more than 115,000 people out of poverty.

“We are implementing FundsChain in 350 villages as a pilot. We are also implementing our Loan Management System (LMS) in all 3,200 villages of the project, providing laptops, and women leaders have been trained to use it.

When FundsChain is linked with the LMS, they will be able to use it directly, and every village organization will become part of the process and can track funds transparently,” explained Mahbubul Alam, director of the project at the Social Development Foundation, an autonomous organization under the Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance.

Alam underscored that FundsChain is also benefiting his finance management team by simplifying transaction records and digitalizing all project-related information, something especially important in a project with many suppliers and beneficiaries.

FundsChain is a one-stop shop for financial reporting and transparent tracking.

It quickly shows payments, contracts, and expenses, notifying suppliers the moment payments are ready, empowering teams to make timely, informed decisions and streamline project management.

How does FundsChain work?

FundsChain integrates technologies such as cryptography, distributed ledgers, and the internet to provide a secure and immutable platform for all types of transactions.

It uses Hyperledger Besu, a blockchain solution which allows transactions to be stored by all parties involved in a project and recorded permanently.

This enables development partners to track funds throughout the lifecycle of a project, and to prepare comprehensive project execution reports, allowing for robust data analysis.

The platform has already been recognized internationally.

In 2025, it received the Most Exciting Public Sector Innovation Project award from the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications and was featured in Citi’s Global Perspective and Solutions report for its role in modernizing financial systems and enabling new financial instruments.

FundsChain has been successfully tested in 13 projects across 10 countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Comoros Islands, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Moldova, Mozambique, and the Philippines.

It will now be scaled up and extended to approximately 250 projects in developing countries by the end of this fiscal year, in June 2026.

As FundsChain continues to expand across more projects and countries, it is important to ensure that development financing is fast and transparent, to deliver the best outcomes for people and the planet.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FundsChain-village.webp,N,,2025-10-05 17:56:15.893777

Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing a demographic transition of global proportion.

By 2050, the region’s population is set to grow from 1.5 billion in 2024 to 2.5 billion, with more than 600 million people joining the working-age population.

By then, one in three individuals aged 15-34 globally will be African.

This provides an enormous opportunity for the continent to reap the demographic dividend of higher economic growth propelled by an expanding population.

That is, however, only if this expanding population can find productive employment opportunities. Jobs are the pathway to prosperity.

And yet, this is the crux: while Sub-Saharan Africa needs to create 15 million jobs each year to keep up, its economies create far fewer and are often poorly remunerated.

Today, many youths are idle, nor in education, employment, or training (NEET).

Adolescent girls specifically are too often dropping out of school due to early marriage or childbearing. There is real urgency.

World Bank Group President Ajay Banga has called for building “a ladder of opportunity” for young people in developing countries, where each rung represents a step towards better jobs and greater empowerment.

This is an appealing people-focused framework to think through what it takes to boost job opportunities at scale and quickly.

It recognizes that the path to inclusive growth in Africa lies in the generation of higher-quality jobs, with higher labour earnings being the main driver of poverty reduction.

Solving this challenge in Africa requires a multi-pronged strategy, from increased wage employment in today’s often small formal private sector to increased productivity in self-employment and micro-enterprises in Africa’s vast informal sector.

Managed migration programs can also enhance productive labour mobility within countries and internationally, including towards fast-aging economies.

Onto the ladder and up…

For young people to climb the ladder of opportunity, they must first get on it.

Extreme poverty and food insecurity often prevent this initial step.

Across Africa, social protection programs have proven effective in helping the poor onto the ladder by ensuring that food is on the table, children can access education and health services – key for building a strong workforce for tomorrow – and households can invest in productive assets like livestock or street vending.

Social protection also offers a safety net to those who fall off the ladder in the face of shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic or increasingly severe and frequent climate events.

Over the past two decades, Africa has pioneered “productive” social protection programs, starting with the flagship Ethiopia Productive Safety Net.

These initiatives now go beyond income support, incorporating public works employment that promote climate mitigation and resilience, engaging beneficiaries in entrepreneurship and life skills training, opening bank accounts, and promoting group savings schemes in addition to income support.

Programs like Senegal’s urban Yokk Koom Koom program, Ghana’s Productive Safety Net Program, and Zambia’s Supporting Women’s Livelihoods program, have significantly boosted household revenues and savings.

These programs are particularly successful among women who often self-select as the entrepreneurial dynamo in the household.

Youth employment programs are expanding to support African Youth in finding meaningful work. For example, Kenya’s Youth Employment and Opportunities program (KYEOP) has helped 155,000 young people launch 86,000 businesses, create 125,000 jobs, and increase incomes by 50 percent.

Building on this success, Kenya’s new National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (NYOTA) aims to reach 800,000 youth, addressing 35 percent of inactive, unemployed, or low paid young people aged 18-29.

Benin’s Azôli program (which means “path to employment”) similarly supports youth with job training, placement services, and entrepreneurship support.

These programs demonstrate that scaling such efforts can significantly impact youth employment, creating pathways to economic inclusion and resilience.

…and scaling the ladder

For the ladder of opportunity to support millions of aspiring workers, governments need to invest in robust systems.

Digital social registries of poor and vulnerable households, underpinned by identification systems, are the platform for targeting support to those most in need.

Digital government-to-person (G2P) payment systems can be used to transfer income support or start-up grants to beneficiaries and serve as an entry to access finance.

Labor market systems are critical to allow programs to scale. Senegal is building a system of informal apprenticeships with a formal validation of acquired competencies, delivering credentials to youth trained by informal businesses.

Benin’s national employment agency plays a key role in matching young job seekers to employment opportunities in the expanding private sector such as textiles in the Glo-Djigbé Industrial Zone.

Realizing Africa’s demographic dividend by 2050 requires dynamic private sector development to create productive jobs.

For the private sector to invest and create jobs, reforms need to be prioritized to enhance the business environment, boost market access, attract investment, and improve trade as well as sector and firm performance.

At the same time, education and skills development systems must prepare the workforce for the demands of a growing formal private sector.

While some of these reforms will take time to deliver results, scaling youth employment programs can deliver immediate results, helping millions onto the ladder of opportunity.

The urgency is real, but so is the opportunity.

With the right investments and partnerships, Africa’s youth can climb the ladder of opportunity—and drive the continent toward a brighter future.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unlocking-jobs-for-todays-african-youth.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 16:56:13.774218

The author is director of research at the Institute of Innovative and High-Quality Development (Hong Kong).","Hong Kong’s 2025 Policy Address lays out an ambitious green agenda to drive economic revitalization and sustainability hand in hand, embracing cleaner energy, modern transport, waste reduction, and nature-based tourism as engines for growth. It aligns with broader strategies — from the Northern Metropolis innovation hub to expansion of the headquarters economy — ensuring Hong Kong’s prosperity ties to environmental leadership.

Hong Kong is upgrading its infrastructure to improve efficiency and cut emissions. Building retrofits (better insulation, smart systems, on-site renewables) and district cooling projects will sharply reduce energy use in older commercial buildings. These measures also create new jobs — architects, engineers and green-product makers — bolstering the economy. The plans tie into the Northern Metropolis development strategy.

To power these advances, the city is expanding its clean energy infrastructure. A landmark commitment is the construction of an electric-vehicle battery recycling facility — the city’s first large-scale plant — which will start operation in the first half of 2026. Retired EV batteries will be broken down into “black mass” for reuse in new batteries, creating a circular supply chain. This not only reduces waste but also supplies materials to the Chinese mainland and the broader region, reinforcing Hong Kong’s role in a regional green economy. Fast charging for EVs is also being accelerated — a HK$300 million ($38.5 million) incentive program will add about 3,000 fast chargers by 2028, and bus depots will open chargers to public use. Together, these steps lower barriers for drivers to switch to EVs and cut transport emissions.

At the same time, the city is fostering innovation. The government continues funding emerging clean technologies through grants and partnerships. This includes the new HK$3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, and an upcoming HK$1 billion artificial intelligence research institute, illustrating how the green and tech agendas reinforce each other.

Transportation is a major emission source, so Hong Kong is pushing aggressively to electrify vehicles. In addition to expanding charging networks, the government will support market development of battery-swapping technologies and automated swapping stations. In fact, taxi and bus operators are already deploying EV fleets under government programs.

Hong Kong’s leadership is tying sustainable development to economic revitalization, headquarters attraction, and regional integration. The overall tone is one of confidence: By blending ambition with realism, the city aims to become a model “green finance and innovation hub” for Asia

Hong Kong is advancing toward a “zero landfill” future, with the Waste Blueprint 2035 targeting adequate waste-to-resource capacity by the mid-2030s; I-Park1 will progressively begin operation by end-2025, with I-Park2 funding sought next year, and a paper-pulping facility to begin trial operation by the end of 2025.

Hydrogen energy is a centerpiece of Hong Kong’s decarbonization strategy. The city has already launched 28 hydrogen trial projects — from zero-emission buses and street scrubbers to a public hydrogen refueling station in the New Territories — under the Hydrogen Strategy announced last year. These pilots, in collaboration with Guangdong province, aim to make fuel-cell vehicles practical and prepare the way for industrial use. In 2025, authorities will set safety and quality standards for hydrogen fuel and extend refilling stations to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. A notable goal is developing a Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor — a cross-border network of production plants and pipelines linking Hong Kong with mainland facilities, which will enable Hong Kong to tap cheaper large-scale hydrogen from neighboring cities, while providing outlets for local innovations.

Alongside hydrogen, Hong Kong is pursuing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for air transport and a specified target SAF consumption ratio by 2030 for flights departing Hong Kong. This means large volumes of biofuels or synthetic kerosene will replace traditional jet fuel. To support this, the city will partner with mainland SAF producers to build local SAF plants and a blending terminal, creating a Greater Bay Area hub for green aviation fuel. This positions Hong Kong air travel on a low-carbon path.

HK as a green finance hub

Hong Kong’s financial sector is a core pillar of this green strategy. The city has already cemented itself as Asia’s leading sustainable finance hub. To guide markets, Hong Kong has developed a local green taxonomy, released in 2024, aligned with the mainland’s, the European Union’s, and global standards. This common framework helps investors identify bona fide “green” projects and avoid “greenwashing”. Regulators are also building carbon-market infrastructure. For instance, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd’s “Core Climate” carbon exchange is set to trial cross-boundary trading with Guangdong province pilot markets. Such links allow companies in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to trade carbon credits seamlessly, broadening the market and depth of financing for clean projects. Together, these steps strengthen the city’s specialty as the gateway for green capital — attracting international issuers and funding while circulating private investment into local green jobs.

Hong Kong’s green push extends well beyond its borders, embracing the Greater Bay Area. The strategy explicitly builds on regional synergies. A centerpiece is the Beautiful Bay Area initiative — Hong Kong will co-lead efforts with Guangdong to clean up and protect coastal waters and ecosystems. It has pledged coordinated action on nearshore pollution control, shoreline restoration and ecosystem monitoring.

Energy and industrial cooperation also figure prominently. The planned Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor is a joint effort: Guangdong’s large hydrogen-production facilities will link to Hong Kong’s end users, creating economies of scale. In aviation and shipping, Hong Kong aims to be the regional green-fuel trading hub, exporting SAF and promoting clean marine fuels throughout the bay. Financially, Hong Kong is deepening carbon and bond market integration. The upcoming Hong Kong-Shenzhen Stock Connect extensions and carbon-trading pilot programs will let businesses tap the combined Greater Bay Area capital pool for climate projects. Even in waste, the new EV battery recycling plant in Hong Kong will feed raw materials into mainland factories, and vice versa. In short, the policy envisions Hong Kong’s climate efforts as fully embedded in the Greater Bay Area ecosystem.

Hong Kong’s status as an international port and tourist destination is being leveraged for sustainability. Maritime services will go green: A new government Bunkering Incentive Scheme and budgetary tax breaks encourage early adoption of zero-carbon fuels like green methanol and liquefied natural gas. The 2025-26 Budget explicitly offers tax incentives for ships bunkering green methanol, to cut costs and make Hong Kong a leader in sustainable shipping. Marine Department action plans will build green fuel terminals and safety protocols. These moves will attract eco-conscious shipping lines and spur local investment (fuel logistics, vessel refits) — reinforcing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a maritime hub while reducing pollutants in its harbor.

On land, nature and tourism are being integrated under an “Ecology + Tourism” banner. The Four Peaks project will upgrade trails and facilities on Hong Kong’s mountains, adding things like treetop adventure parks, open-air cultural museums, and campsite renewals, all built to blend into the landscape. Meanwhile, rural attractions are being linked into immersive eco-tours: A network of cycling and hiking routes will connect traditional villages, ancestral halls, farms and cultural sites, providing rural communities with new income while encouraging city dwellers to appreciate conservation. The 2025 Policy Address sets out clear timelines. Hong Kong’s leadership is tying sustainable development to economic revitalization, headquarters attraction, and regional integration. The overall tone is one of confidence: By blending ambition with realism, the city aims to become a model “green finance and innovation hub” for Asia.

The proposed legislation aims to establish a comprehensive legal and institutional framework that supports artists, filmmakers, musicians, designers, and other creative professionals, addressing long-standing challenges that have hindered the sector’s growth.

Bill to Create Fund and Institutional Support

The Creative Economy Support Bill, sponsored by Senator Eddy Oketch, proposes the establishment of a Creatives Fund that will provide grants and financial assistance to individuals and organisations in the creative industries. The Fund will be financed through parliamentary appropriations and other sources approved by the Cabinet Secretary responsible for the creative economy.

The Bill also introduces a credit guarantee scheme designed to facilitate easier access to financing for creatives from banks and financial institutions. Many artists and creative entrepreneurs in Kenya struggle to obtain loans due to the informal nature of their work and the lack of collateral. The proposed guarantee scheme aims to bridge that gap by offering risk coverage to lenders who support creative ventures.

Another key feature of the Bill is the creation of a Creative Industry Guild, which will serve as a professional body to represent the interests of creatives, promote ethical standards, and protect intellectual property rights. The Guild is expected to unify a sector that has long been fragmented, with artists operating in isolation and often without legal or institutional protection.

Empowering Youth and Building Capacity

The Bill places strong emphasis on youth empowerment, recognising that a large proportion of Kenya’s creative workforce comprises young people. It proposes targeted initiatives to provide training, mentorship, and access to infrastructure such as creative hubs and studios. These measures are intended to enhance creative skills, promote innovation, and position Kenya as a regional leader in the creative economy.

In addition, the Bill outlines programmes for capacity building and incubation to help creatives turn their talents into sustainable businesses. It also calls for improved digital infrastructure and support for creative exports, ensuring that Kenyan content can reach international markets and attract global audiences.

What the Bill Aims to Address

Kenya’s creative economy has faced multiple challenges for years, including limited access to financing, a lack of structured policy support, weak intellectual property protection, and poor market access. Many creatives work informally and earn unstable incomes, while others lose revenue due to piracy and unfair contractual arrangements.

The Creative Economy Support Bill aims to address these systemic problems by formalising the sector and establishing a clear regulatory framework. It aims to ensure that creatives are recognised as contributors to national development, with access to funding, training, and legal protection. By addressing these gaps, the Bill also supports the government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, which prioritises job creation and inclusive economic growth.

Debate Over “Money Bill” Status

The Bill’s introduction in the National Assembly has sparked debate over whether it qualifies as a Money Bill under Article 114 of the Constitution. While the drafters have stated that it does not, some legislators have questioned this classification because it involves the establishment of public funds. The Speaker of the National Assembly has since directed the Finance and National Planning Committee to review and advise on the matter before debate proceeds.

Significance for Kenya’s Creative Sector

If enacted, the Bill would mark a turning point for Kenya’s creative economy, which contributes significantly to employment and cultural identity but remains underfunded and undervalued. The sector includes a wide range of industries, from film and fashion to gaming, visual arts, publishing, advertising, and music.

By providing legal recognition and structured financial support, the proposed law is expected to boost investor confidence, improve working conditions for creatives, and position Kenya as a continental hub for creative innovation.

Public Participation

The Creative Economy Support Bill will now undergo committee scrutiny, public participation, and several readings before it can be passed into law. Stakeholders from across the arts and entertainment industry are closely watching its progress, with many expressing optimism that the legislation will finally bring long-awaited reforms.

If implemented effectively, the Bill could unlock Kenya’s creative potential, empower thousands of young artists, and transform the sector into a major driver of economic growth and cultural export.",https://newstrends.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-10-02-at-14.38.24-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 14:56:58.292292

In Yokohama, Japan, the Bank signed a Letter of Intent with JGC Corporation, a leading Japanese engineering company, to advance the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the continent. The agreement was concluded on the sidelines of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) in August.

Under the framework, AfDB Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, Solomon Quaynor, and JGC President, Shoji Yamada, agreed to collaborate on feasibility studies, technology transfer and potential co-financing of SAF projects across Africa. The Bank will coordinate with public sector aviation stakeholders, identify project pipelines and explore financing, while JGC will focus on technical assessments, demand studies and deployment of Japanese engineering solutions.

Quaynor described SAF as “a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions” and stressed that the initiative could make Africa a pacesetter in green aviation. Yamada added that JGC’s involvement would leverage its expertise in plant engineering and sustainable energy to support Africa’s decarbonisation while stimulating economic growth.

In a separate deal, the AfDB Group signed a $144.7 million financing agreement with Niger to expand electricity access and strengthen economic resilience. The pact, signed in Abidjan between AfDB President Sidi Ould Tah and Nigerien Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, will provide budgetary support through the Bank’s concessional lending arm, the African Development Fund.

The funds will finance Phase 1 of Niger’s Energy Sector Governance and Competitiveness Support Programme (PAGSEC), which aims to raise electricity access from 22.5 percent to 30 percent by 2026, increase manufacturing’s contribution to GDP, and deliver 240 MW of new solar capacity by 2030.

The programme also targets structural reforms, including stronger fiscal management, domestic arrears clearance, and policies to stimulate private-sector investment. It prioritises social inclusion, with tailored interventions for women, youth, and Niger’s more than 500,000 internally displaced people affected by insecurity in the Sahel.

“This agreement is part of our strong cooperation with the African Development Bank Group,” Prime Minister Zeine said, noting that the support would boost Niger’s competitiveness and resilience.

Ould Tah assured that the Bank would remain a strong partner to its member states in “their pursuit of harmonious development and shared prosperity.”

The eVTOL developer finally held its much-anticipated live flight demonstration at the Osaka Expo. (When I visited back in May, they weren't even present at the Advanced Air Mobility Pavilion yet!). aThe wait was worth it for those lucky enough to witness it in person.

Want to know more about the Expo itself?

I've put together a two-part series with my general impressions and some practical informations about the Expo, its best pavilions, and even some tips about where to stay and eat in Osaka!

But Joby wasn't done yet. The company also announced plans to expand its UAE operations to include Ras Al Khaimah, the emirate about an hour's drive north of Dubai (this project is done in cooperation with Skyports, an eVTOL infrastructure company which was also featured in one episode of the podcast).

While less famous than Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah is trying to develop its tourism industry.

Spanish eVTOL maker Crisalion faces uncertainty

The reality check continues for the eVTOL industry.

On September 30, Spanish developer Crisalion reached a judicial deadline to refinance, though it remains unclear whether the company secured fresh capital in time or not and what comes next.

In the last few weeks, several media outlets reported that the company was facing a liquidity crisis and that it was falling behind in salary payments. The era of exuberance for the eVTOL industry is certainly over!

Commercial flight operations from the new airport are expected to commence in December, following the aerodrome licence granted by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30.

The project is being executed in multiple stages by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd, with the Adani Group holding a 74% stake, and the remaining 26% owned by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) of Maharashtra.

“The second airport of Maha Mumbai — Navi Mumbai International Airport — is going to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8,” said CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal, speaking to PTI after a media briefing.

Singhal added that the Prime Minister is expected to land at the new airport around 2:40 pm and spend nearly two hours at the site.

“The Prime Minister will first visit the terminal building, take a round of the premises, and then address the audience,” he said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has assigned the airport the code ‘NMI’.

Domestic airlines, including the Air India Group, IndiGo, and Akasa Air, have already announced plans to shift part of their flight operations to the new facility.

Spread over 1,160 hectares, the airport will eventually house four terminals with a total passenger capacity of 90 million per year and cargo handling capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes, positioning it among Asia’s largest aviation hubs.

“To begin with, we have completed Terminal One, with a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo capacity, and one runway,” Singhal said.

Currently, Mumbai International Airport handles around 55 million passengers annually.

Once NMIA is fully operational, the two airports together are projected to serve nearly 150 million passengers a year.

“So, once this airport is fully completed, these two airports together will cater to almost 150 million passengers per annum, making the region a major aviation hub globally,” Singhal added.

While ₹19,647 crore has been spent on the first phase, the total project cost is expected to reach ₹1 lakh crore upon completion of all four terminals.

NMIA will also be India’s first airport to be seamlessly connected by expressways, highways, metro lines, suburban rail, and water taxi services.

“This is also a green airport as it has the storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel,” Singhal noted, adding that the complex will feature an Automated Passenger People Mover system linking all four terminals internally.",https://www.indiablooms.com/storage/assets/n/2025/1759664034191686283.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 09:56:22.687605

A Lei do Combustível do Futuro, sancionada pelo governo federal em outubro do ano passado, estabelece que as companhias aéreas devem começar a operar com SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) a partir de 2027. As metas incluem uma redução gradual das emissões de gases de efeito estufa, começando com 1% até 2027 e alcançando 10% até 2037, com o objetivo principal de descarbonizar as operações.

A visão otimista foi compartilhada pelos participantes do painel “O desafio de conciliar crescimento e sustentabilidade na modernização de portos e aeroportos”, apresentado no Fórum Norte Export, em Belém (PA), no último dia 25.

“O SAF traz oportunidades muito boas para o desenvolvimento econômico do país, especialmente para as regiões que vão abrigar as plantas produtoras do combustível. Até porque não faz sentido pegar o SAF produzido em Guarulhos para colocar em caminhões e trazer até Belém. Então é mandatório você ter as contratações do SAF próximas à sua matriz de consumo”, avaliou Arthur Thiago Costa, Diretor Administrativo, Financeiro e Comercial da NOA Airports, concessionária do aeroporto de Belém.

Thairyne Oliveira, secretária-executiva adjunta do Ministério dos Portos e Aeroportos, explicou que a pasta trabalha em diversas frentes para regulamentar o SAF, entre elas, a viabilização da certificação de qualidade do produto, pesquisa e desenvolvimento e políticas de incentivo e financiamento.

Em agosto do ano passado, o governo lançou um edital para financiar investimentos em plantas de SAF. Foram disponibilizados R$ 6 bilhões em recursos do Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) e da Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (Finep), divididos em R$ 3 bi para cada. O intuito foi selecionar planos de negócios voltados à implantação de biorrefinarias no país.

“Nessa linha de crédito tem algumas contrapartidas previstas que englobam as políticas de ESG, como mais mulheres na liderança das companhias aéreas, por exemplo. É o que a gente (governo) pode fazer. É incentivar que o setor, ao pegar um recurso mais barato do que no mercado subsidiado, se comprometa também com a sociedade”, pontuou Thairyne.

Among the participating teams include the Peace Academy, CTIDO Academy, Usa Youth Academy, Black Eagle Academy, Satino and Young Boys.

However, the Black Eagle was compelled to drop out of the league midway, due to some controversies related to the ages of the participants.

The Satino Academy Coach, Abdulbast Siraji who teaches the Under-11 and Under-9 teams, said they have learned a lot during the league, especially the issue of taking seriously the ages of children who take part in the competitions.

The Young Boys Academy Coach, Jackson Tunda whose team emerged victorious stated that their mission was not just to win the trophy but to experience performance improvement among players.

“But cheating is rampant among many teams comprising young players, it therefore calls for proper awareness raising training on grassroots regarding the rules, regulations and requirements of youth leagues,” stated Tunda.

Commenting on the league, the Chairperson of the Arumeru District Football Association (ADFA), Siza Masaka who graced the final match said the youth soccer events are the current trend globally.

“But it goes further than that here in Tanzania, where we use youth soccer leagues to identify, cultivate and produce future international players,” said Masaka.

According to the ADFA chairperson, it was high time all districts, and regions started grooming young sports personalities right from the grassroots.

“Even the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) recognizes youthful football events and we support the Young Boys Academy for the initiative of running annual leagues for the youth,” added Masaka.

Le SAF, en tant que substitut prometteur aux carburants fossiles traditionnels, pourrait bien être la clé d’une aviation plus respectueuse de notre planète.

Le SAF : un carburant révolutionnaire

Le SAF, ou carburant d’aviation durable, est un produit issu principalement de déchets organiques. Il se compose d’huiles de cuisson usagées et de graisses animales, transformées par un procédé appelé HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). À ce mélange, s’ajoute environ 10 % de kérosène aromatique synthétique provenant de sucres végétaux. Ce carburant innovant est conçu pour être compatible avec les moteurs et infrastructures existants, ce qui facilite son intégration dans l’industrie. Virgin Atlantic met en avant l’importance du SAF pour atteindre l’objectif de zéro émission nette de carbone d’ici 2050. Cette transition vers des énergies renouvelables est cruciale, et le SAF se présente comme un élément central de cette transformation.

Les traînées de condensation : un défi majeur

Le vol de Virgin Atlantic a servi aussi à explorer un autre aspect environnemental crucial : les traînées de condensation. Ces traînées, bien visibles derrière les avions, jouent un rôle important dans le réchauffement climatique. Selon certaines études, elles seraient responsables de 57 % de l'impact climatique de l'aviation entre 2000 et 2018, dépassant les émissions de CO2 des carburants. Le Rocky Mountain Institute, avec ses partenaires, travaille à réduire cet impact. Les données recueillies lors de ce vol sont partagées avec l'industrie aéronautique pour développer des stratégies et des technologies visant à atténuer les effets de ces traînées.

Despite global economic instability and intensifying competition, Tunisia’s textile and clothing industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, securing its place as one of the European Union’s key apparel suppliers.

The sector comprises approximately 1,880 companies, with a striking 90% dedicated exclusively to exports. Foreign investment plays a significant role in this ecosystem—45% of these firms operate as joint ventures with international partners. As a cornerstone of the Tunisian economy, the textile and clothing industry accounts for around 20% of national exports and provides employment for about 176,000 workers, representing over 30% of the country’s manufacturing labor force.

In a recent statement on Mosaïque FM, Haythem Bouajila, President of the Tunisian Federation of Textile and Clothing, revealed that the industry’s exports have surpassed six billion Tunisian dinars. This performance, he noted, remains consistent with previous years, where annual exports ranged from 9 to 9.6 billion dinars, despite adverse global conditions and the rising competitiveness of regional players like Egypt, which is investing heavily in the denim and jeans market.

Bouajila emphasized that Tunisian textile products are moving upmarket, focusing on quality and innovation. This strategic pivot towards higher-end offerings has helped domestic producers withstand price-based competition from other countries where prices are falling but margins are shrinking.

Official trade statistics underscore this progress. Between 2019 and 2023, Tunisia’s textile exports to the EU rose significantly—from €1.966 billion in 2019 to €2.280 billion in 2022, and €2.358 billion in 2023—even as the EU’s overall textile imports fell by 16.22%.

In 2023 alone:

Clothing exports grew by 6.8%, totaling TND 8.18 billion

Textile exports increased by 3.07%

The total sector exports rose by 5.61%, reaching nearly TND 9.7 billion

The sectoral trade balance improved by 12.5 percentage points

Tunisia now ranks as the 10th largest supplier of clothing to the EU, ahead of major global producers such as the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, and Egypt. This is a significant achievement, positioning the country as a key player in the European fashion and apparel supply chain.

However, the sector faces persistent structural challenges. Skilled labor shortages, logistical inefficiencies, rampant smuggling, and the expanding parallel market continue to place pressure on domestic manufacturers.

To further solidify its international competitiveness, Tunisia has launched an ambitious sustainability roadmap. By 2030, the country aims to:

Recycle 90% of wastewater used in textile production

Reduce the sector’s carbon footprint by 30%

These eco-friendly initiatives not only align with global sustainability trends but also enhance Tunisia’s appeal to environmentally conscious European partners and brands.

The new airport will serve as Mumbai’s second international gateway, easing the heavy congestion at the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), which handles over 55 million passengers annually.

PM Modi’s Visit and Agenda

According to CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal, the Prime Minister will arrive at the NMIA site around 2:40 PM and spend nearly two hours inspecting the facilities. His visit will include a walkthrough of the newly built terminal, an overview of key airport systems, and a public address highlighting India’s infrastructure growth and aviation progress.

Senior officials from the Adani Group, CIDCO, and DGCA are expected to be present during the ceremony.

India’s New Mega Aviation Hub

The Navi Mumbai International Airport has been developed by Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited (NMIAL) — a joint venture between the Adani Group (74%) and CIDCO (26%).

The first phase alone has been built at a cost of ₹19,647 crore, while the total four-phase project will reach nearly ₹1 lakh crore.

The airport received its aerodrome licence from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30, clearing it for official operations. Commercial flights are expected to begin by December 2025.

Capacity and Infrastructure Highlights

Spread over 1,160 hectares, the Navi Mumbai airport is designed to handle up to 90 million passengers per year and 3.25 million metric tonnes of cargo once fully completed.

The first phase includes Terminal 1 and a single operational runway, capable of serving 20 million passengers annually.

Once all terminals are operational, both Mumbai airports — CSMIA and NMIA — will together handle approximately 150 million passengers per year, placing Mumbai among the top 10 aviation hubs globally.

Strategic Connectivity Advantage

The airport’s location in Panvel makes it a central point connecting major industrial and logistics zones in Maharashtra. It is:

14 km from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT)

22 km from MIDC Taloja Industrial Area

32 km from Thane

40 km from Bhiwandi

The project is also set to be India’s first airport with multimodal connectivity, featuring links to:

Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL)

Suburban railway network

Desde 2016, o Grupo Boticário adotou o polietileno verde — plástico vegetal obtido da planta da cana — em suas embalagens.
Parceira do Boticário com o EcoÁlcool, a Raízen tem investido na produção de biocombustíveis derivados da cana, como o E2G (etanol de segunda geração).
Contudo, segundo especialistas, o país tem condições de ampliar sua participação e liderar as exportações globais de biocombustíveis de baixo carbono e intermediários derivados da cana-de-açúcar.
Ou seja, a cana pode sim de alguma maneira ser considerada o novo petróleo verde"", conclui Alves.","""Hoje já produzimos etanol e, a partir do CO2 gerado na fermentação para a sua produção, podemos obter o metanol verde, que serve de matéria-prima para moléculas que dão origem a plásticos, fibras têxteis, embalagens e borrachas sintéticas, produtos que ainda dependem do petróleo"", explica Lopes.

Mas o potencial não para aí. Subprodutos da própria usina, como a vinhaça e o CO2, quando combinados a processos que geram hidrogênio e oxigênio, abrem caminho para novos combustíveis e insumos estratégicos.

O hidrogênio renovável, por exemplo, pode ser usado em células a combustível — dispositivos que geram eletricidade a partir de reações químicas, sem poluir — ou servir de base para a amônia verde, essencial na produção de fertilizantes e vista como o futuro combustível para o transporte marítimo.

""Diferentemente do petróleo, que é um recurso finito e concentrado em poucos países, a cana é renovável, distribuída e já conta com uma cadeia produtiva consolidada no Brasil"" diz Thiago Lopes. ""Por isso, com os avanços tecnológicos, a cana deixa de ser apenas fonte de etanol e açúcar, tornando-se a base de uma nova indústria química verde, capaz de sustentar em escala setores hoje totalmente dependentes do petróleo"", completa.

Empresas já apostam na cana

Algumas empresas brasileiras já têm apostado na cana-de-açúcar como uma alternativa mais sustentável de matéria-prima. Desde 2016, o Grupo Boticário adotou o polietileno verde — plástico vegetal obtido da planta da cana — em suas embalagens.

""O plástico vegetal usado nas embalagens é fabricado por empresas que produzem polietileno a partir do etanol de cana (soluções bio-based), como a Braskem"", explica Gustavo Dieamant, diretor executivo de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento do Grupo Boticário. Hoje, há mais de 2 mil produtos no portfólio da empresa que utilizam plástico verde.

O grupo passou também a aproveitar resíduos da cana (como o bagaço) como matéria-prima para o EcoÁlcool, usado na produção de perfumes. ""Somente com isso, a partir de 2021, deixamos de emitir mais de 127 mil toneladas de gases de efeito estufa. Para dimensionar o impacto, essa redução é equivalente à captura de carbono realizada por uma área de plantio de eucaliptos do tamanho de 4.700 campos de futebol"", destaca Dieamant.

Parceira do Boticário com o EcoÁlcool, a Raízen tem investido na produção de biocombustíveis derivados da cana, como o E2G (etanol de segunda geração). Diferentemente do E1G (etanol de primeira geração), que utiliza a sacarose extraída do caldo da cana, o E2G aproveita o que antes seria descartado, tornando-se uma opção mais sustentável, com menor pegada de carbono e sem a necessidade de ampliar a área de plantio.

Em 2024, a Raízen inaugurou uma nova unidade de E2G, no Parque de Bioenergia Bonfim, em Guariba (SP). Com uma pegada de carbono 80% menor que a gasolina comum brasileira e 30% menor que o E1G, o etanol de segunda geração produzido pela empresa representa uma inovação tecnológica significativa no setor de bioenergia, pois aumenta em 50% a produção sem precisar de um hectare a mais de cana.

Biocombustíveis

Entre os diversos setores que podem se beneficiar da adoção da cana-de-açúcar como matéria-prima renovável, o de transportes se destaca como um dos mais promissores.

Atualmente, além do E2G, usinas brasileiras de cana já produzem o etanol combustível (hidratado e anidro), a bioeletricidade a partir da queima de bagaço e palha e o biogás e biometano a partir de vinhaça.

Mas a versatilidade da cana vêm sendo estudada para produção de outros biocombustíveis, como o Hidrogenio verde, que pode ser empregado em ônibus, caminhões e navios; o Metanol verde, voltado para veículos pesados; e o SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), biocombustível destinado à aviação.

Brasil na frente

O Brasil é o segundo maior produtor mundial de etanol, atrás apenas dos Estados Unidos, que fabrica o combustível a partir do milho.

Contudo, segundo especialistas, o país tem condições de ampliar sua participação e liderar as exportações globais de biocombustíveis de baixo carbono e intermediários derivados da cana-de-açúcar.

A combinação entre escala agrícola, experiência industrial, certificações e baixo carbono posicional — com potencial de captura do CO2 gerado na fermentação — pode representar uma importante vantagem comparativa.

""Enquanto o milho, nos Estados Unidos, rende de 4 a 5 mil litros de etanol por hectare, a cana brasileira produz, em média, 7 mil litros por hectare, podendo ultrapassar os 10 mil litros com a integração do etanol de segunda geração"", afirma Alexandre Alves, agrônomo e chefe-geral da Embrapa Agroenergia.

Segundo ele, em termos de mitigação, entre 2003 — ano do lançamento dos carros flex — e março de 2025, o uso do etanol em substituição à gasolina evitou que mais de 730 milhões de toneladas de CO2 fossem lançadas na atmosfera. Para alcançar efeito semelhante na natureza, seria necessário cultivar cerca de 5,1 bilhões de árvores ao longo dos próximos 20 anos.

""Outro diferencial que pode colocar o Brasil na liderança da produção de biocombustíveis é o fato de que os processos de colheita e de processamento industrial da cana já estão bastante consolidados, permitindo o aproveitamento quase integral da biomassa: caldo para etanol; bagaço e palha para eletricidade e E2G; vinhaça e torta para biogás; e CO2 da fermentação para e-fuels"", aponta o chefe-geral da Embrapa Agroenergia.

Além disso, o país dispõe de uma infraestrutura consolidada — agrícola, industrial e logística — e de um sistema de governança robusto, com certificações como o RenovaBio, que mede a intensidade de carbono da produção.

O país também conta com uma vantagem territorial. ""Estudos mostram que o Brasil possui uma extensa área de pastagens degradadas que pode ser aproveitada, permitindo ampliar diversas vezes a produção de etanol, sem causar impacto ambiental significativo"", ressalta Thiago Lopes, professor da USP.

Mas é preciso investimento para acelerar o estabelecimento da cana como fonte energética.

Alexandre Alves, da Embrapa Agroenergia, defende, como próximos passos, o fortalecimento do RenovaBio, o estabelecimento de marcos regulatórios para captura, uso e armazenamento de carbono aplicados às usinas de etanol, além do incentivo à produção de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) e fomento à produção de biometano e hidrogênio a partir da biomassa e do etanol.

Também são indispensáveis investimentos em infraestrutura e logística voltados à exportação de energéticos renováveis derivados da cana. E, para consolidar o Brasil como fornecedor confiável de energia limpa, é fundamental avançar em certificações reconhecidas internacionalmente.

""O Brasil já cultiva mais de 8 milhões de hectares de cana, mas tem potencial para expandir sobre pastagens de baixa produtividade, sem pressionar os biomas sensíveis. Ou seja, a cana pode sim de alguma maneira ser considerada o novo petróleo verde"", conclui Alves.",https://conteudo.imguol.com.br/c/noticias/bb/2025/07/18/cana-de-acucar-colhida-por-usina-em-alagoas-estado-que-mais-produz-no-nordeste-1752888976662_v2_615x300.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 06:56:48.689624

Signed at the institution’s headquarters in Abidjan, the agreement provides budgetary support from the African Development Fund, the Bank Group’s concessional financing window.

It enables the Niger government to implement Phase 1 of the transformative Energy Sector Governance and Competitiveness Support Program (PAGSEC).

“It is with great pleasure that we have just formalized this agreement, which is very important for Niger,” said the Prime Minister. “The agreement is part of our strong cooperation with the African Development Bank Group.”

The support from the African Development Fund will increase national electricity access from 22.5 percent to 30 percent by 2026, while boosting the manufacturing sector’s contribution to GDP from 2.5 percent to 3.8 percent.

A key component of the project focuses on developing renewable energy capacity, with plans for 240 MW of solar power by 2030, including 50 MW by December 2026.

Prime Minister Zeine, who is also Niger’s Minister of Economy and Finance and serves as Governor of the Bank Group for his country, said the Bank’s support came at an important time, and the process has now led to the establishment of the program which aims to support the country’s economic competitiveness.

“It will also cushion Niger against multiple shocks through improved access to energy, promotion of the private sector, consolidation of the fiscal framework, and better consideration of vulnerable groups within public policies,” Premier Zaine added.

Beyond the energy sector, the program will strengthen public financial management systems while enhancing tax revenue mobilization and control systems.

It will further support the clearance of domestic arrears, enhance public-private partnerships dialogue, and promote the adoption of an industrial and trade policy to bolster Niger’s private sector.

“I can assure you that the African Development Bank Group will remain, as it has always been, a strong supporter of all our regional member states in their pursuit of harmonious development and shared prosperity,” said Dr Ould Tah.

“I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Bank’s teams for their hard work and also to thank the Board of Directors for its support for our efforts.”

Social inclusion

This high-impact program prioritizes social inclusion, and specialized support for internally displaced persons, women, and young persons.

With more than 507,000 internally displaced people due to security challenges in the Sahel region, PAGSEC has outlined a social and economic inclusion program to cushion vulnerable communities.

It will also establish high-level coordination mechanisms and update national energy policies to create a favorable environment for private-sector participation in mini-grid developments crucial for rural electrification.

With this program, Niger is set to capitalize on its vast renewable energy potential while building governance systems that support inclusive and sustainable development.

Durch die eigentümliche Form wollen die Ingenieure der Phantom 3500 ein lange bekanntes Problem der Luftfahrt gelöst haben. Laut Hersteller soll das Modell den Kerosinverbrauch um 60 Prozent reduzieren. Beim Betrieb mit Sustainable Aviation Fuel rechnet das Unternehmen mit 92 Prozent weniger CO2-Ausstoß. Dies könnte laut dem ""Wallstreet Journal"" den Privatjet-Markt revolutionieren

Günstiger als Business-Class: Flughöhe und laminare Strömung machen Privat-Jet effizient

Das Flugzeug soll mit vier Passagieren an Bord 3200 nautische Meilen zurücklegen können, das ist vergleichbar mit dem Airbus A320 und entspricht über 5900 Kilometern. Die Reiseflughöhe ist dabei deutlich größer als bei bisherigen Verkehrsflugzeugen. Die Phantom 3500 soll bis auf 51.000 Fuß oder 15,5 Kilometer steigen. Doch das eigentlich innovative an dem Konzept ist die Form des Rumpfes.

Denn um das Flugzeug herum entsteht ein Effekt, der den Luftwiderstand dramatisch reduziert: laminare Strömung. Dabei fließt die Luft in einzelnen Ebenen um den Rumpf, ohne dass sich Verwirbelungen bilden, die das Flugzeug bremsen. Dieser Effekt ist lange bekannt, doch bisher nahmen Experten an, dass eine ineffiziente und turbulente Strömung bei Flugzeugen ab bestimmten Geschwindigkeiten unvermeidbar ist – wie bei einem Wasserstrahl, der zuerst durchsichtig ist und weiß wird, sobald der Hahn voll aufgedreht ist.

Doch Otto Aerospace gibt an, dass die Phantom 3500 selbst bei 950 Kilometern pro Stunde mit laminarer Strömung fließt.

Privatjet-Riese will 300 Flugzeuge bestellen

Flexjet, einer der größten Anbieter von gemieteten Privatjets, hat sich mit dieser Großbestellung stark zum Phantom 3500 positioniert. Laut einer Pressemitteilung von Otto Aerospace zeigte sich Flexjet-CEO begeistert von dem Flugzeug und seinem modernen Ansatz. Unterstützt von einer Kapitalerhöhung in Höhe von 800 Millionen US-Dollar plant das Unternehmen, den Jet schrittweise in seine Flotte zu integrieren. Der Einsatz des Phantom 3500 könnte den Standard im privaten Flugzeugmarkt neu definieren.

Auch die fensterlose Innenkabine mit 360-Grad-Panoramabildschirmen und einer komfortablen Höhe von 195 Centimetern machten die Phantom 3500 zu einem vielversprechenden Projekt, das den gesamten Markt verändern könnte.

Phantom 3500 soll ab 2030 fliegen

Laut ""Wall Street Journal"" soll der erste Testflug des Phantom 3500 im Jahr 2027 stattfinden, mit anschließenden Auslieferungen ab 2030. Die regulatorische Zulassung sieht keine Hindernisse vor, da Fenster laut der amerikanischen Flugaufsichtsbehörde FAA für Zertifizierungen nicht verpflichtend sind. Es soll aber Fenster an Notausgängen geben. Außerdem hat das Startup mit der Celera 500L bereits ein ähnliches Design mit Propellerantrieb in die Luft gebracht.

Privatjet günstiger als Business-Class: Das gibt es bereits heute

In Deutschland gibt es bereits Anbieter, die das Fliegen mit Privatjet zu vergleichbaren Preisen anbieten wie ein Business-Class-Ticket. Wer semi-privat fliegt, kann die Annehmlichkeiten wie weniger Wartezeit und exklusiven Zugang zum Rollfeld ohne Massenabfertigung bei der Sicherheitskontrolle genießen - nimmt aber auch mehr CO₂-Emissionen in Kauf.

Indes versuchen Fluggesellschaften mit, neuen Kabinen-Designs für zahlungskräftige Kunden attraktiv zu bleiben – dies sei auch wichtig für den Klimaschutz.

More optimistic calculations estimate that total production in 2022 could reach 450 million liters. Both scenarios put the SAF industry on the brink of an exponential increase in capacity and production towards an identified tipping point of 30 billion liters by 2030, with the right supportive policies.

The airlines commit to achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and see SAF as a key contributor. Current estimates expect SAF to account for 65% of the mitigation needed for this, requiring a production capacity of 450 billion liters per year by 2050.

Having agreed a Long Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) on climate at the 41st Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in October 2022, governments now share the same goal for the decarbonisation of aviation and the interest in the success of SAF.

“There was at least triple the amount of SAF on the market in 2022 than there was in 2021. And airlines used every drop, even at very high prices! If more were available, it would have been purchased. That makes it clear that this is a supply problem and that market forces alone are insufficient to solve it. Governments, now sharing the same net-zero target for 2050, must implement comprehensive production incentives for SAF. It's what they did to successfully transition economies to renewable sources of electricity. And it is what aviation needs to decarbonise”, said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.

To date, more than 450,000 commercial flights have been operated with SAF, and the increasing number of airlines signing purchase agreements with producers sends a clear signal to the markets that SAF is needed in greater quantities and, in the future, As of 2022, around 40 purchase agreements have been signed. been announced.

Incentive-based policies

Until we have commercialized options for alternative energy sources such as hydrogen, all SAF supply for aviation will be derived from biofuel refineries. These refineries produce renewable biodiesel and biogas, as well as SAF, and their refining capacity is expected to grow by more than 400% by 2025 compared to 2022. The challenge for aviation is to secure its supply of SAF from this capacity.

“É um orgulho ter sido o ministro que recebeu, pela primeira vez em 165 anos do Ministério da Agricultura, a presidente da Petrobras. Esse encontro aproxima de forma concreta o agro e o setor de energia. É a relevância que o agro se tornou no Brasil, como ele é estratégico. E o inverso, a gente entende o agro pode, deve e vai ser importante para a Petrobras”, destacou o ministro da Carlos Fávaro.

Na ocasião, foi apresentado que a empresa se aproxima do agronegócio em três frentes distintas: originação de matérias-primas, polos de venda e venda direta para grandes consumidores.

A presidente da Petrobras evidenciou que a estratégia da estatal para os próximos anos passa pela integração entre os principais setores da economia brasileira. “O futuro do Brasil é um futuro em que o agronegócio e o setor petrolífero caminham juntos. São dois dos principais motores da nossa economia e precisam se complementar”, afirmou Magda Chambriard.

A empresa tem buscado a ampliação no Centro Oeste e MATOPIBA, regiões que tem vocação natural para a produção agrícola com disponibilidade de terras agriculturáveis e clima favorável â produção agrícola. A demanda do agronegócio nestas regiões mais que dobrou sua demanda de diesel nos últimos anos.

Também foi ressaltado que há oportunidades para expansão do transporte dutoviário e ferroviário, além de possibilidades de escoamento de produção e incremento na produção de biocombustíveis, como etanol de milho e biodiesel.

Com iniciativas existentes em produtos renováveis como óleos vegetais, gorduras animais, a Petrobras se aproximou do agronegócio para a originação de matérias-primas para a produção de Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) que consiste em um biocombustível avançado, produzido a partir de óleos vegetais (como soja, palma) ou gorduras animais, tratados com hidrogênio e do Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) que consiste em um combustível sustentável de aviação, feito de matérias-primas renováveis como óleos vegetais, gorduras animais, resíduos agrícolas ou até lixo urbano.

O ministro Fávaro ressaltou que esta integração abrirá novas perspectivas para o Brasil. “Estamos abrindo uma série de oportunidades em um novo caminho que o mundo está trilhando: a produção de energia renovável, verde e limpa, que nasce da terra”, afirmou.

Ainda, foi exposto que existem acordos formados entre o Mapa, a Petrobras e a Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa) para parcerias com cooperativas para ofertas produtos e assistência técnica aos consumidores finais. Além disso, produzem juntamente com a Embrapa e com Centro de Pesquisas Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello (Cenpes) fertilizantes de eficiência aumentada para o uso de matérias primas alternativas.

A parceria entre o Mapa e a estatal no MATOPIBA iniciou em março deste ano, após reuniões técnicas em que foram identificadas oportunidades de atuação e ocorreu a articulação de uma operação de visita na região junto a associações e produtores rurais com o objetivo de ampliar ainda mais a atuação da Petrobras na região.

Segundo a presidente Magda Chambriard, a Petrobras reconhece a importância dessas iniciativas. “Não estamos aqui para destruir nenhuma política pública. Pelo contrário, entendemos que esses investimentos foram necessários para valorizar o que temos de melhor: o petróleo e o agro”, reforçou.

Brian Duncan, a grain and livestock farmer near Polo in Ogle County and IFB president, discussed the many issues facing agriculture during an interview at the Illinois State Fair’s Ag Day.

What are the top concerns IFB is focusing on?

Duncan: I think the thing we talk about that’s kind of overarches everything right now is farm income. We’re very concerned as we continue to read the economic reports coming out of the University of Illinois.

Every farm’s got a little bit of a different economic story but, in general, this year, last year, next year, an awful lot of our members are going to be upside down.

We know the cattle industry is on a roll, and good for them, they deserve it because they had a rough ride before this.

The hog industry, which I’m a part of, is seeing some daylight, but has a big hole to backfill, and row crops, I’m hoping we can find a bottom pretty soon. But farm income is a real concern.

We are grateful for the passage of the ag provisions, that were contained in the budget bill. Those have the potential to be beneficial. We’re grateful of the tax provisions. Those are beneficial.

Is trade an ongoing concern?

Duncan: We are hoping for some significant wins here as trade has become cloudy. Our trade relationships are cloudy. We’re seeing a lot of frameworks announced and that’s good.

That provides a discussion for further deals, but I keep looking to read specific amounts of Illinois commodities or ethanol that are going to be moving into some of these countries, and it just appears we need to get some meat on the bones on some of these deals.

I try to look at things as challenges and opportunities, and a lot of challenges you can turn into an opportunity with the right work, the right connections and the right communication, and that’s what we’re trying to do as an organization.

There are also some trade wins. I met with the Office of Public Liaison at the White House. I talked about easy wins, low-hanging fruit, such as year-round E15, whole milk back in public schools. There are things here.

The “Make America Healthy Again” report creates some interesting challenges and opportunities. Challenges to our science that we rely on, that we want to make sure we’re using sound science, but maybe opportunities for good farm-raised protein to once again be talked about in a positive light.

Our pork or beef, our poultry products, our dairy products, planning their place in schools and in people’s diets. So, again, rising up and meeting the significant needs of farm income.

On the state level, we’re still working hard with stakeholders on getting estate tax relief. That is a battle we are not going to give up on.

We know property taxes have become an increasing concern for our members, and we are not taking that issue lightly either.

Then it’s always watching on both the state and the federal side burdensome regulations that directly impact farm income. It is a full plate.

Fortunately we’ve got a great team at Illinois Farm Bureau, and fortunately we’ve got great members that we rely on to help carry the message to the representatives, to their congressmen.

What are some of the things you’d like to see in the mini farm bill?

Duncan: Security for an interstate commerce. It goes beyond Proposition 12. If that is a not fixed it is a precedent that is dangerous for all of agriculture to allow one state to regulate how Illinois farmers grow their products. It’s a bad precedent.

I hope there’s an opportunity to perhaps discuss some of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program dollars. Some of that funding that was maybe not appropriated that we had farmers counting on.

Again, anything that we can do to talk about incentivizing biofuels, the trade title, there’s a ton yet to discuss. Those are a few of the biggies.

Year after year, there’s talk on Capitol Hill about year-round E15, sustainable aviation fuel and other renewable fuel issues, but no concrete action is taken by Congress. So, what can be done?

Duncan: We went the tax credits to be right, and we think the extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is a good step.

And the next-generation biofuels, I think, has a positive story to tell. It takes time to build out infrastructure and we want to make sure the demand is there.

I had U.K. Consul General Richard Hyde at my farm and asked him about the opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel for planes coming from Europe and from the U.K. He says, “We’re all in.”

So, they have to refuel somewhere, right? And we know there’s biofuel producers in this state that are making commitments to produce both renewable fuels from both corn and soybeans and that’s a positive.

We want to make sure that the tax credits and the infrastructure remains something that we can rely on, because something that’s here today and gone tomorrow makes people very hesitant to invest the kind of dollars that are needed.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/fhRE4GFPEm1RxzUKPfgigL02MYo=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/VNOHSJYTYFHZJB3PVTXVWRBDCQ.JPG,N,,2025-10-04 20:56:09.260469
