Because nothing says ""sustainable"" like your pakoda oil getting a second life as rocket juice for a 747. Fly high, samosa style!

Indian Oil's Panipat refinery has been crowned the country's first to pump out sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil, The Times of India reported. The word ""sustainable"" makes eco-warriors faint with joy, and SAF is just one ""E"" shy of SAFE. Maybe we should toss in Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's beloved ethanol and call it SAFE: Sustainable, Awesome, Fry-powered Ethanol.

Inspectors from Swiss certification firm Cotecna's Indian arm have certified the Panipat refinery, declaring it fit to turn your post-pakoda sludge into jet fuel. They have also saddled us with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), a UN dream to make planes fly without guilt.

By 2027, India has been roped into blending 1% SAF for international flights, inching to 2% by 2028. Domestic flights will follow. Late arrivals are not new.

INDIA NO STRANGER TO SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

SAF is no stranger to our headlines, even if it makes little headway. Back in August 2018, SpiceJet flew a Bombardier from Dehradun to Delhi on a 75:25 mix of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and jatropha-based biofuel, cooked by the Indian Institute of Petroleum.

In 2022, IndiGo flew with a 10% SAF blend on a ferry flight from Toulouse to Delhi. These trips are made to make headlines, followed by the kind of silence you hear after a flop Bollywood sequel.

Jatropha, that weed we have idolised since childhood for its firepower, was once India's biofuel heartthrob. In the 2000s, we planted it like crazy, believing it would free us from oil imports. It did not. Yields on marginal lands were as pathetic as Raid 2, and it gobbled farmland, jacking up food prices. Now, it's a sidekick, not Shah Rukh Khan of biofuels.

Ethanol has had it better because it found a guardian in Nitin Gadkari. India hit 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025, five years early, saving Rs 1.36 lakh crore in foreign exchange and pumping production from 38 crore litres in 2014 to 661.1 crore litres.

If your scooter is whining about mileage, and your car's fuel injectors are throwing tantrums, you clearly are from the petrol lobby. Tough luck, aam aadmi, tweet your tears, but ethanol is here to stay. Buy an E-20-compliant car and see the blending go up to E-27 as declared.

The government is now eyeing ethanol for SAF via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, aiming for 30 billion litres annually from crop waste and municipal trash. It is pricier than ATF, like Chayos chai versus roadside cutting, but who, if not you, will sustain the sugar industry by buying its byproduct?

REAL PAKODA OF COOKING OIL PUZZLE

Now, the real pakoda of a puzzle: collecting used cooking oil. Where will the Panipat refinery source the crude oil to refine, in this case, used mustard oil. By door-to-door collection, like trash collected every morning? Will we have 3 coloured bins now: green, blue and yellow for the oil? Or grovelling to pakoda-walas to donate their black, tar-like treasure, reused till it's basically liquid regret? The answer, my friend, is frying in the kadhai!

India could churn out 19-24 million tonnes of SAF yearly, but a 5% blending target needs 140 million litres of oil. That's a Himalayan pile of pakodas to fry. Supply chains are shakier than a cycle rickshaw on a Gurugram flyover. Villagers in Chhattisgarh and Karnataka scrounge jungles for jatropha seeds, which then hitch-hike hundreds of miles to refineries.

Here's where you, proud Bharatiya naagrik, become the hero India didn't ask for. Set up a pakoda stall, and you are not just self-employed, you are a cog in the crude oil supply chain to Panipat. Fry hard, dream big! India's gunning for 8-10 million tonnes of SAF by 2040, needing Rs 6-7 lakh crore in investments to cut oil imports by $5-7 billion annually. Over 1.2 million jobs could sprout, if we ever sort out this logistical circus.

So, fuel your imagination, not disappointments. Turning your kitchen oil into jet fuel is like betting on a bullock cart to win Formula 1. If we can somehow wrangle the oily drippings from a billion samosa-holding hands, maybe, just maybe, that cart will zoom past the chequered flag. Until then, keep frying pakodas and save the planet.

In April, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency certified the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 Enhanced Performance (EP) for the type, featuring lighter materials, improved aerodynamics, and upgraded turbine cooling. The result is at least a one percent reduction in fuel burn, translating into lower emissions, reduced costs, and potentially longer nonstop flights.

For airlines, even a marginal gain matters. On an 18-hour flight, the EP could save around $1,200 in fuel. The engine is also certified for 50% sustainable aviation fuel and designed to run on 100% SAF in the future. Delta Air Lines became the first carrier to receive an A350-900 equipped with the EP in June, with other operators expected to follow once FAA certification is complete.

While Rolls-Royce’s upcoming UltraFan may eventually surpass it, the EP offers a ready-now efficiency upgrade that strengthens the A350’s position as a leader in long-haul travel."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/528986518_122242199504064089_892948511151790057_n.jpg?stp=c216.0.648.648a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&_nc_ohc=melCmpG3-LYQ7kNvwGL9zKQ&_nc_oc=AdkAhzgmjtFnoNRrNRRHkST-FFSqaIgGURGimXy6GzibetX7mxRHoMVGPzH84NizaBiDUEwh8NLoJGLkkpbYEVIs&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=4ATcr6FD4issYnhAPpi9Ng&oh=00_AfVFwcGpMQcd9MgzTDR_2_KXsdWktIrf1R84sejqCes_0Q&oe=689C9B11,N,,2025-08-09 00:56:18.943932

Citing Brazil’s long-standing experience with higher ethanol blends, Puri noted that the country has been running on E27 for years without any operational issues. Speaking at a Fireside Chat Session on the sidelines of the Pioneer Biofuels 360 Summit, the minister also alleged that some vested interest groups are actively trying to spread misinformation and derail India's ethanol revolution.

“The E20 transition is already firmly underway, backed by strong policy support, industry readiness, and public acceptance—and there is no turning back,” said the minister.

His comments came in response to growing social media backlash over complaints about decreased fuel efficiency and mileage following the rollout of E20 in the country. Many users criticized the government, arguing that no other country mandates the use of E20 and that fuel prices have not been reduced despite the 20% ethanol blending.

Defending the ethanol policy, Puri highlighted multiple benefits of E20. “It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, enhances engine performance, and has already resulted in foreign exchange savings of over ₹1.4 lakh crore,” he said.

He also pointed to the operational success of 2G ethanol refineries in Panipat and Numaligarh, which convert agricultural residues like paddy straw (parali) and bamboo into ethanol—offering a sustainable solution that addresses clean fuel needs, pollution control, and increased income for farmers.

Puri further underlined the significant rise in maize-based ethanol production, which has grown from 0% in 2021–22 to 42% this year. “This is a transformational shift,” he said.

On the topic of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the minister said the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is working closely with oil marketing companies, airlines, and global technology partners to develop and scale up SAF production and adoption.

""India will follow a phased approach to SAF, just like ethanol,"" Puri said.

The refinery received its certification from Cotecna Inspection India, a branch of the Swiss-based Cotecna Inspection Group, after a detailed verification process. The move is the result of close coordination between the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

The aviation industry is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise because aircraft cannot yet rely on battery-powered propulsion for long flights. SAF is seen as a game-changing solution, capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. It works as a direct replacement for aviation turbine fuel (ATF) without requiring changes to aircraft engines, making it one of the fastest deployable green technologies for the sector.

Panipat’s SAF is also compliant with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), a global framework developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to help airlines meet carbon reduction targets. This compliance ensures the fuel meets both domestic and international sustainability standards, opening doors for global adoption.

Used cooking oil that is often wasted is collected from restaurants, food processing units, and households. It is then filtered to remove food particles, purified to eliminate contaminants, and refined through a series of chemical processes to produce jet-grade SAF. This not only provides an alternative fuel source but also helps prevent improper disposal of waste oils, which can harm the environment.

The government is planning a SAF blending mandate starting with a requirement that 1% of all fuel uplifted for international flights from India must be SAF by 2027. The long-term vision includes expanding this requirement to domestic flights and gradually increasing the blending percentage in the following years.

India has also been conducting test flights with SAF-blended fuel over the past two years, working with airlines, oil companies, and research bodies to ensure the transition is smooth and technically sound. The Panipat milestone now provides the infrastructure backbone to scale up production.

Globally, aviation accounts for about 2-3% of CO₂ emissions, but its share is expected to grow as more people fly. India’s SAF initiative, starting at Panipat positions the country as a serious player in sustainable aviation and could also open export opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.

Conclusion: A Reformed Titan in the Making Thai Airways' turnaround is not just a financial success story but a strategic repositioning for the future.","The global aviation industry is emerging from a turbulent post-pandemic landscape, with carriers racing to rebuild profitability while navigating fuel volatility, regulatory shifts, and shifting consumer preferences. Among these players, Thai Airways International (THAI) stands out as a rare success story—a national carrier that has not only survived a near-bankruptcy crisis but is now poised to redefine its role in the Asia-Pacific aviation ecosystem. With a 26.5% EBIT margin in Q1 2025 (the highest among full-service carriers in the region), a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37 (down from 20.66 in 2019), and a 170-billion-baht five-year strategic plan, THAI's transformation offers compelling long-term investment potential.

Financial Turnaround: From Insolvency to Resilience

Thai Airways' journey from insolvency to financial stability is a masterclass in corporate restructuring. By Q1 2025, the airline had slashed liabilities from 400 billion baht in 2020 to 95 billion baht, while shareholders' equity grew to 55 billion baht. Its liquidity position—152 billion baht in cash and equivalents—provides a robust buffer against market shocks. This financial discipline is reflected in its operating performance: a 12.3% year-on-year revenue increase in Q1 2025, driven by a 21.1% rise in available seat kilometers (ASK) and a 20.8% jump in revenue seat kilometers (RPK).

The airline's EBITDA of 13,661 million baht in Q1 2025 (up 26.5% YoY) underscores its operational efficiency. This outperforms regional peers like Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Cathay Pacific, which are still grappling with post-pandemic recovery.

Strategic Initiatives: Building a Future-Proof Airline

THAI's 170-billion-baht investment plan (2024–2029) is a blueprint for sustainable growth. Key pillars include:

1. Fleet Modernization: 120 billion baht allocated to expand the fleet from 78 to 150 aircraft by 2033, with next-gen Boeing 787s and Airbus A321neos enhancing fuel efficiency and passenger experience.

2. Fleet Rationalization: Reducing aircraft types from eight to four and engine variants from nine to five, slashing maintenance costs and training complexity.

3. Digital Transformation: Upgrading booking platforms, enhancing direct sales (targeting 25% of revenue), and deploying AI-driven maintenance systems.

4. Premium Cabin Expansion: Increasing premium cabin revenue share from 0.5% in 2024 to 10% by 2033, capturing higher-margin business travelers.

5. Strategic Partnerships: A joint business agreement with Turkish Airlines expands THAI's European network to 60+ routes without additional aircraft.

These initiatives align with global trends, such as the shift to fuel-efficient aircraft and digital-first customer engagement. THAI's net-zero emissions goal by 2065 and partnerships with PTT Global Chemical for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) further position it as an ESG leader.

Competitive Positioning: Outperforming Peers in a Challenging Sector

THAI's strategic focus on profitability and operational agility sets it apart. While many carriers rely on tourism—a volatile revenue stream—THAI has pivoted to high-value business travelers, ensuring stable cash flows. Its 22% market share at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) reinforces its role as a regional hub, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projecting 5.2 billion travelers in 2025.

The airline's debt restructuring and liquidity position also mitigate risks. For context, THAI's debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37 is significantly lower than Air France-KLM's 2.8 or Lufthansa's 1.5, offering greater flexibility in volatile markets.

Long-Term Investment Potential: A Buy for Resilient Growth

For investors, THAI's combination of financial discipline, strategic clarity, and operational execution makes it an attractive long-term play. Key catalysts include:

- Fleet Expansion: Deliveries of 45 Boeing 787s and 32 Airbus A321neos from 2027 will drive capacity growth and route optimization.

- Premium Revenue Growth: A 10% premium cabin share by 2033 could boost margins, as business-class tickets typically yield 3–5x higher revenue per seat.

- Digital and ESG Momentum: Enhanced digital platforms and sustainability initiatives align with investor priorities, potentially attracting ESG-focused capital.

However, risks remain, including fuel price volatility and regulatory costs (e.g., CORSIA compliance). THAI's strong liquidity and phased capital deployment—funding the first two years of its plan with existing cash—mitigate these concerns.

Conclusion: A Reformed Titan in the Making

Thai Airways' turnaround is not just a financial success story but a strategic repositioning for the future. By balancing disciplined growth with innovation, the airline is transforming from a national carrier into a global competitor. For investors seeking exposure to a reformed aviation leader with a clear path to profitability, THAI offers a compelling case. As it resumes trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and executes its 170-billion-baht plan, the airline's focus on premium services, digital agility, and sustainability positions it to thrive in the post-pandemic era.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-08 16:56:08.450195

Global SAF production is projected to increase from 2.2 billion liters in 2025 to 14 billion liters by 2030 in the base case, with an accelerated case estimating up to 20 billion liters.

Europe is expected to remain the largest SAF consumer through 2030, supported by the ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and other regional policies.

Current supply is mainly based on waste oils such as used cooking oil and tallow, which face long-term availability constraints.

United Airlines has contracted approximately 14 billion liters of SAF, the highest volume among airlines, with procurement strategies moving toward investment in production capacity.

More than 60 SAF projects are planned to begin operations in 2025.

On 7th August 2025, cCarbon hosted its latest webinar unveiling the 2025 edition of its Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Outlook, offering a detailed assessment of the sector’s current status, policy environment, production pathways, feedstock trends, and forward projections to 2030. The presentation drew on cCarbon’s extensive research across North America, Europe, and Asia, supported by proprietary facility-level tracking, offtake deal monitoring, and policy analysis.

Current Market Status

Global SAF production reached 1.17 billion liters in 2024, up from just 29 million liters in 2019, reflecting a steady growth driven by regulatory mandates, voluntary offtakes, and maturing production technologies. For 2025, output is expected to nearly double to 2.2 billion liters, with North America and Europe leading the way.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, beginning at 2% SAF blending in 2025 and scaling to 70% by 2050, creates long-term demand certainty. In North America, state-level programs like California’s LCFS are generating significant credit volumes, while Asia-Pacific markets such as Japan, Singapore, and potentially China are laying groundwork for rapid adoption.

Feedstocks and Supply Chain Pressures

Waste-based feedstocks dominate current supply: Used Cooking Oil (UCO) – projected to hit 465,000 tonnes in 2025 (CAGR 158% since 2019) while Tallow & Waste Oils – projected at 457,000 tonnes in 2025 (CAGR 105%)

These low-CI feedstocks are highly valued in compliance markets but face long-term constraints. By 2030, renewable diesel and SAF combined could require 80% of global current tallow supply. Vegetable oils such as soy and canola remain secondary due to higher CI scores and sustainability scrutiny. Emerging options like forestry residues, agricultural waste, and ethanol-based feedstocks are expected to scale later in the decade, while Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels remain cost-intensive.

Offtake Agreements and Market Maturation

2022 was a watershed year with 39 offtake deals signed, totaling over 21 billion liters in future supply. Since then, annual deal volume has declined, reflecting market maturation, supply constraints, and a shift toward strategic partnerships and equity investments.

United Airlines leads with over 14 billion liters contracted (≈35% of global airline offtakes) and Southwest Airlines follow with multibillion-liter commitments

Top suppliers include Gevo, Fulcrum BioEnergy, and Alder Fuels, each targeting distinct feedstock and technology niches.

Technology Pathways

The HEFA route accounts for roughly 90% of current production due to its commercial readiness and feedstock compatibility. The HEFA pathway currently dominates SAF production because it is technically mature, commercially proven, and compatible with existing refinery infrastructure. However, its reliance on waste oils and fats such as used cooking oil and tallow limits scalability. Global supply of these feedstocks is finite and already faces competition from renewable diesel production, creating a bottleneck for further HEFA growth.

To meet 2030 production targets and longer-term decarbonization goals, the industry is focusing on scaling three additional pathways that can draw from more widely available or scalable feedstocks

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) – ethanol-based

Gasification/Fischer-Tropsch – municipal solid waste and biomass residues

PtL – green hydrogen plus captured CO₂

Regulatory Momentum

Existing frameworks such as the US Renewable Fuel Standard, California LCFS, Canada’s CFR, and ICAO’s CORSIA are complemented by emerging mandates in Singapore, China, India, and Japan. The US SAF Grand Challenge targets 10 billion liters/year by 2030.

Capacity Build-Out

Over 65 new SAF projects are slated to start in 2025 alone. Planned capacity additions between 2025 and 2028 are dominated by large projects from Shell (15.2 billion liters planned) and SGP BioEnergy (10.4 billion liters), alongside expansions from Neste, TotalEnergies, and major North American refiners.

SAF Certificates (SAFc)

SAFc instruments are emerging to verify and track SAF use, aligned with schemes like ISCC and RSB, and frameworks such as CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive. These certificates trade in a wide range (USD 300–500/tCO₂e abated), with prices negotiated bilaterally.

Challenges and Market Perceptions

While the SAF sector is expanding, several structural issues remain. High production costs — often three to four times higher than fossil jet — continue to slow adoption. Feedstock availability, particularly for waste oils and fats, limits near-term scale-up. Infrastructure for blending, storage, and distribution is still under development in many regions, and the regulatory environment remains uneven across markets.

Polling during the webinar reinforced these themes. Most respondents viewed higher costs relative to conventional jet fuel as the main constraint to wider SAF adoption, consistent with the cost differential outlined in the presentation. Limited availability and supply was the second most cited challenge, reflecting the feedstock constraints and slow project ramp-up discussed earlier. Regulatory incentives, infrastructure readiness, and uncertainty over environmental benefits were mentioned less frequently but remain relevant to scaling.

When asked about the likely timing for cost parity without subsidies, the largest share of respondents pointed to after 2035, underscoring a cautious outlook on near-term competitiveness. A smaller group expected parity between 2030 and 2035, while a notable minority believed it would never occur. These views suggest that market participants expect SAF adoption to remain reliant on policy support and targeted investment for at least the next decade.

Conclusion

The SAF sector is at a pivotal stage. The next five years will determine whether momentum from policy, investment, and offtake commitments can overcome cost and supply constraints. With clear mandates, diversified feedstock strategies, and continued capacity expansion, SAF could deliver a material share of aviation’s decarbonization pathway by 2030.

Joining Growth Energy in celebration of the August 8th birthday are leaders from across the heartland, who have helped to make the RFS America's single most successful policy for increasing U.S. energy security, holding down fuel costs, reducing emissions, and strengthening the farm economy.

Since the RFS became law in August 2005, American biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol. In that same time period, American ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue to American farmers. As a result of these benefits, the program is supported by a broad, bipartisan spectrum of stakeholders.

Growth Energy

""The RFS is the foundation of America's bioeconomy,"" said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. ""It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it's still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren't yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.""

Farmers

""The RFS is more than a law. It's a vital outlet for surplus grains that provides stability and prosperity to American farmers facing higher input costs and uncertain export markets,"" said Bill Couser, a farmer from Iowa who grows commercial corn that he sells to local plants to be processed into fuel ethanol. ""I don't know that our family's farm would be as strong as it is today if it weren't for the RFS and the American biofuels industry.""

""Since the RFS was enacted, America's net farm income has more than doubled. In Iowa alone, biofuel plants purchase more than half the state's corn crop — transforming it into homegrown fuels, high-quality animal feed, food-grade CO2, and a host of other co-products,"" said Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a third-generation corn and soybean farmer based in northwest Iowa. ""It's an integral part of the agricultural supply chain.""

Lawmakers

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard program has helped us produce fuel that reduces our emissions and fosters energy independence—and I'm proud to help continue leading the push in the Senate to increase the use and supply of American-grown, American-made biofuels across the country,"" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). ""We're pushing hard for our bipartisan bill to enable the year-round sale of E15 nationwide, and as founding co-chair of the Sustainable Aviation Caucus in the Senate, I'm working to bolster and help expand our nation's sustainable aviation fuel industry. Investing in American biofuels doesn't just help us reduce our nation's carbon footprint—it helps lower gas prices for middle-class families and support our farmers. It's a win-win-win that would not be possible without the RFS.""

""Over the last 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been essential to empowering heartland communities, adding value to crops grown by our hardworking farmers, securing American energy independence, and giving consumers a cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). ""Iowa farmers already feed our nation, and by guaranteeing homegrown Iowa biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply, the RFS secures their role in fueling our nation's future. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration to ensure the RFS stays strong, so we can keep delivering for Iowa's famers, biofuel producers, and rural communities.""

""Nebraska is the nation's second-largest producer of ethanol, and much of that is made possible by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), established 20 years ago,"" said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). ""The RFS has played a critical role in supporting Nebraska's ag economy, driving both the use and production of renewable fuels across the state. I look forward to continuing to work with the EPA to ensure a strong RFS that will further advance Nebraska's biofuels industry.""

""The Renewable Fuel Standard is one of the federal government's most successful clean fuels policies,"" said Senator Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.). ""For two decades, renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel have saved consumers money, supported Nebraska agriculture, cleaned our environment, and unleashed American energy.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has created incredible new opportunities for our farmers. I've seen firsthand the important markets it creates for our corn and soybean growers, and the cost savings it brings for folks at the pump,"" said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). ""As we celebrate this important anniversary, I remain committed to championing renewable fuels every single day and pushing for policies like nationwide, year-round E15.""

""A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is vital to a vibrant agricultural economy and the success of Iowa biofuels,"" said Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa). ""For twenty years, this American energy initiative has supported Iowa farmers, biofuels producers, and our rural communities by ensuring that Iowa ethanol, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply. The RFS also helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lowers gas prices for families, and incentivizes rural energy production. Representing hardworking farmers and biofuels producers, I will always advocate for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard that invests in rural Iowa, supports the production of homegrown Iowa biofuels, and stands with our farmers and agricultural communities.""

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has provided long-term market certainty and predictability for American biofuels producers, fuel retailers, farmers, and other market participants,"" said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa). ""It's incredible to see how far we've come in blending more homegrown biofuels into our nation's fuel supply—and how the RFS supports Iowa farmers and rural communities. Biofuels play a crucial role in our energy strategy to bolster energy independence and lower costs for consumers. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration and my colleagues in Congress to expand the use of biofuels as part of an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy strategy.""

""I'm proud to support access to new markets for our nation's farmers that strengthens our domestic energy resources,"" said Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio). ""Investing in American biofuels strengthens our energy supply, creates good-paying jobs, and drives economic growth in communities that feed and fuel our nation. By advancing biofuel innovation we're building a more secure, independent, and prosperous future for the American people. As we mark 20 years of the Renewable Fuel Standard, we recognize one of the most impactful commitments our nation has made to energy security and rural prosperity.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been a cornerstone of our nation's energy policy—strengthening rural economies, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating new markets for our family farmers,"" said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.). ""In Illinois and across the Midwest, biofuels mean good-paying jobs, cleaner air, and opportunity. As we look ahead, we must ensure the RFS translates to affordable low-carbon options for consumers while supporting industry growth domestically. I'll continue fighting to make sure biofuels remain a key part of America's energy future.""

Defense contractors are pressing ahead with the development of alternative aviation fuels for military use, even as the Trump administration has moved away from a number of sustainability efforts.

The use of alternative aviation fuel can directly improve mission and operational effectiveness for the United States and its partners and allies, providing “strategic value by increasing energy resilience and broadening the range of viable fuel sources,” said Javier Botello, associate fellow for fuel systems and aviation fuels at Lockheed Martin.

“It allows military operations to tap into synthetic or regionally produced fuels in places where conventional supply chains may be disrupted or constrained. It allows forces to operate across a wider range of bases, including allied or commercial facilities that are [synthetic aviation turbine fuel]-enabled,” Botello said in an email. “For the U.S. military and allied forces, this translates into greater operational reach, logistical robustness and alignment with sustainability mandates.”

Jon Hemler, lead analyst for military aerospace and weapons systems at Forecast International, said leveraging alternative fuels can strengthen energy security by expanding fuel sourcing and reducing fossil fuel dependency.

“For military operations, this could mean flexibility and resiliency for the supply chain and improved logistics,” Hemler said in an email. “Certain [alternative aviation fuels] lower emissions and lead to more effective combustion, which could reduce thermal signatures and improve performance and efficiency for aircraft.”

While alternative aviation fuels offer significant defense advantages, challenges such as lack of infrastructure, limited availability and higher costs still persist, Hemler said.

“At the moment, AAFs only make up a small percentage of in-use aviation fuels, and that translates to higher procurement costs and availability hurdles,” he said.

Additionally, the Trump administration has sought to end various programs and policies aimed at addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices.

For example, on the first day of his second term in January, President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change, and rescinded a number of executive orders issued by former President Joe Biden prioritizing climate and environmental issues in an executive order titled, “Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions.”

Under the previous administration, there was “significant growth” in sustainable aviation fuel production, but the Trump administration has sent “more mixed signals” on pursuing alternative fuel initiatives, Hemler said. The same goes for military sustainability initiatives, such as the Department of Defense Climate Adaptation Plan 2024–2027, which called for the prioritization of climate-informed decision-making and the training and equipping of a climate-ready force.

“There appears to be a continuation of some programs, but the Trump administration has also taken a more critical tone on climate issues while strongly supporting domestic fossil fuel production,” he said. “As a result, continued investments and efforts toward integrating AAFs appear at risk, and it’s unclear how long-term implementation will be affected.”

Despite these challenges, defense contractors are developing several alternative aviation fuels, from synthetic aviation turbine fuel to hydrogen fuel cell technology, experts said.

Synthetic aviation turbine fuel, or SATF, is produced through alternative methods rather than being refined directly from crude oil. These alternative chemical processes include Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a catalytic process that converts carbon monoxide and hydrogen into a variety of hydrocarbons; alcohol-to-jet pathways, which convert alcohols, such as ethanol or isobutanol, into fuel; or converting renewable oils and fats into renewable diesel, Botello said.

While SATF performs “on par” with traditional jet fuel, it does burn more cleanly due to lower sulfur and aromatic content, resulting in “fewer particulate emissions and reduced engine soot accumulation,” leading to enhanced engine health and reduced maintenance demands, Botello said.

“When produced from renewable sources, SATF can achieve 50 to 80 percent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the raw materials and production pathway,” he said. “This supports environmental goals, particularly as defense and aviation sectors strive to meet international climate targets and U.S. Department of Defense objectives.”

One of the more significant challenges the defense sector faces when it comes to synthetic aviation turbine fuel use is the assessment and approval process.

“Military aircraft operate under unique performance and safety requirements,” Botello said. “Any new fuel, including SATF, must therefore undergo a rigorous assessment process that confirms the fuel’s compatibility with aircraft systems under operational stress.”

The Air Force and industry partners are moving forward with approving sustainable aviation fuel such as SATF for military use.

Roberto Guerrero, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for operational energy, said in an email the service’s current focus is ensuring ASTM International’s standards development processes for new sustainable aviation fuels are “compatible with our weapon systems,” as well as “understanding our energy demands and how innovations in both platforms and mission planning systems that reduce fuel demand impacts our operational effectiveness.”

In July 2024, Boeing released guidance to its defense customers that company-built military aircraft can operate on sustainable aviation fuel at the currently approved limits of up to 50 percent blend with conventional fuel.

Boeing Defense, Space and Security CEO Steve Parker stated in a company press release that sustainable aviation fuel “is widely accepted today as a drop-in replacement that works with existing aircraft and also provides opportunities for global interoperability as well as strategic resilience through local fuel production. We hope this [No Technical Objection] will clear the way for more widespread SAF adoption by our military customers and propel greater alignment between commercial and military fuel standards, to the benefit of all.”

In January, Lockheed Martin approved the use of synthetic aviation turbine fuels in the F-35, with the Norwegian Air Force becoming the first to fly the fighter jet with SATF. In June, the company expanded use of the fuel to the F-16 Fighting Falcon and C-130 Hercules.

While Hemler called these developments a “significant step,” it’s less a win for the Defense Department and more a win for international partners and overall interoperability.

“U.S. defense primes are moving the needle forward. … These are aircraft that have a large global footprint and are operated by air forces all over the world,” he said. “So, I think we’re observing a response to international demand.”

Along with alternative fuels, some aviation companies are researching and developing hydrogen fuel cell technology to power next-generation military aircraft.

The fuel cell, which is a device that generates electricity through an electrochemical reaction instead of combustion, takes hydrogen from tanks in the aircraft and converts it chemically into electricity to power the electric propellers.

Val Miftakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “Hydrogen is very lightweight itself and stores more energy per kilogram than even jet fuel, and that’s how we can get this electric platform to potentially go even longer distances with higher payload than jet fuel. And that’s what some of the defense [world] is really interested in, where the aircraft [can loiter] for a number of hours, even longer than what’s possible on jet fuel.”

Hydrogen fuel cell technology can help lower manufacturing and operating costs for military aircraft, Miftakhov said in an interview on the sidelines of the Paris Air Show in June.

Maintenance costs are “much, much lower and fundamentally driven by the fact that you don’t have combustion or high temperature, high pressures that you have to deal with, that the materials have to deal with,” he said. “As a result, your equipment lasts longer and fails less, so maintenance costs are much lower, and maintenance intervals are much longer, so you can have your vehicle in operation for a longer time.”

One of the more significant benefits hydrogen fuel cell technology provides is noise reduction.

“The noise signature, acoustic signature is much lower, but thermal signature is virtually nonexistent, because, again, we don’t have any combustion, so no high temperature on the vehicle,” Miftakhov said. “It’s all under 100, 200 [degrees Celsius], some very low temperatures compared to a turbine or any kind of internal combustion engine.”

Additionally, hydrogen fuel can be made on military bases at the point of need.

“You can do it in a remote operation, you just have a couple of containers that you can drop at one time and deploy the solar panel, deploy the electrolyzer with storage, and you have fuel production right there,” Miftakhov said. “You don’t need to convoy JP8,” the type of jet fuel widely used by the U.S. military.

In March, the Air Force’s innovation arm, AFWERX, awarded ZeroAvia a Small Business Innovation Research grant to conduct a “feasibility study focused on integrating hydrogen propulsion into Cessna Caravan aircraft alongside advanced aircraft automation technology,” a company press release stated.

At the Paris Air Show, Airbus and MTU Aero Engines signed a memorandum of understanding to progress hydrogen fuel cell propulsion, “a promising and critical technology to decarbonize aviation,” an Airbus press release stated.

“If defense officials want to move toward more sustainable fuel options, then they will need to communicate the importance of the technology in securing energy independence and reducing logistical challenges,” Hemler said. “Operationalizing and growing AAFs for military use will require continued budgeting for research and development while addressing energy infrastructure needs.”

Increasing the use of alternative fuels in military aircraft is “a capital-intensive effort that requires cooperation and prioritization among industry partners, government and ministries of defense,” Hemler said. “There needs to be a unified long-term dedication to that goal, and changes in political and spending objectives can affect progress toward that end.”

The trial involved the co-processing of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) with fossil feedstocks using the refinery’s hydrocracking unit.

Around 1,000 tonnes of biogenic material were processed during the pilot, which was certified by Bureau Veritas in line with ISCC standards.

The pilot follows a previous SAF and HVO production test at MOL Group’s Slovnaft refinery in Bratislava earlier this year. In that trial, HVO was produced from cashew nut shell oil and SAF from partially refined used cooking oil, confirming the suitability of existing production units for alternative fuels.

Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President of Fuels at MOL Group, said the latest pilot reflects the company’s intention to expand production.

“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production,” he said. “This readiness underscores our strategic commitment to sustainable mobility, whether in road or air transport.”

Preparation for the Rijeka pilot took eight months due to the specific physical and chemical properties of the new feedstock. During the test, more than 400 samples were collected and analysed by INA’s Central Testing Laboratory, with C14 analysis carried out by the Ruđer Bošković Institute and Isotoptech Zrt.

MOL Group also operates co-processing at its Danube refinery in Százhalombatta, Hungary, where bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously to reduce the lifecycle emissions of conventional fuels.

“We are already playing a leading role in this process in the region, and we are determined to maintain this position through continued investments and innovation,” said Zsótér.

The stock closed with a 1.02% gain, driven by broader sector momentum and order flow dynamics.

Cathay Pacific’s recent procurement of 14 additional Boeing 777-9 aircraft has intensified demand for GE Aerospace’s GE9X engines, which power the 777-9 fleet. The airline now operates 35 GE9X-equipped aircraft under a long-term agreement that includes maintenance and overhaul services. This order reinforces GE Aerospace’s dominance in the high-capacity jet engine market, where the GE9X’s 10% fuel efficiency edge over its predecessor and compatibility with sustainable aviation fuels position it as a strategic asset for carriers seeking operational cost reductions and regulatory compliance.

For Boeing, the transaction indirectly supports its 777X production pipeline, as Cathay Pacific’s fleet renewal aligns with its strategy to modernize aging aircraft. The 777-9’s 20% lower fuel consumption and extended range compared to older models enhance its appeal for long-haul routes, particularly in Asia-Pacific corridors. Cathay’s CEO highlighted the partnership’s role in expanding the airline’s global connectivity from its Hong Kong hub, a move that could bolster Boeing’s visibility in a region critical to its commercial aviation revenue.

“SAF currently produced from used cooking oil, waste palm oil and low-quality vegetable oils has limited production capacity due to competition with the food supply,” he said on Monday.
The company identified that Indonesia has the potential to produce 500 million tonnes of biomass annually, far exceeding their requirement of 100 million tonnes,” Meika added.
According to environmental watchdog Auriga Nusantara, nearly 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared for biomass production between 2020 and 2024.
If the cooking oil-based SAF passes all regulatory and quality benchmarks, it will be green-lit for the first test flight in August.","JAKARTA: Airbus’s Singapore branch has partnered with Indonesian researchers to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from biomass, aiming to source up to 100 million tonnes annually from Indonesia.

Biomass refers to organic materials such as crop waste, wood and other plant-based matter that can be converted into renewable energy, including biofuel for aviation. Airbus is currently collaborating with researchers at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) in West Java on a comprehensive study of biomass availability, logistics, supply chain mapping and optimal factory locations in Indonesia to minimise transportation costs.

Meika Syahbana Rusli, Head of IPB’s Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Centre (SBRC), said Airbus is “very interested” in developing SAF from biomass and has recognised Indonesia’s significant potential as a key supplier.

“SAF currently produced from used cooking oil, waste palm oil and low-quality vegetable oils has limited production capacity due to competition with the food supply,” he said on Monday.

“Airbus estimates that by 2030, SAF must be produced from biomass. The company identified that Indonesia has the potential to produce 500 million tonnes of biomass annually, far exceeding their requirement of 100 million tonnes,” Meika added.

He explained that regions in Sumatra and Kalimantan have large amounts of unused empty palm fruit bunches, while Java Island produces significant volumes of rice straw, which is mostly discarded or burned by farmers.

Despite Indonesia’s strong potential to produce biomass, Meika noted that major challenges remain, particularly in collecting biomass efficiently from farmers, given poor infrastructure in many remote areas.

He also pointed out regulatory gaps and a lack of research on effective and efficient methods to process biomass into plant based jet fuel or bioavtur at scale.

Indonesia has seen a steady rise in both exports and domestic consumption of biomass in recent years, particularly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips. While this trend presents new business opportunities, it also raises concerns over the growing risk of deforestation.

According to environmental watchdog Auriga Nusantara, nearly 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared for biomass production between 2020 and 2024. The group warns that far more forested land could be at risk as the country scales up biomass development, with industries increasingly clearing natural forests and replacing them with fast-growing monoculture plantations.

This expansion threatens the habitats of many endangered species, including orangutans in Sumatra and Kalimantan.

Last month, PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI), the refinery and petrochemicals arm of state-owned energy giant Pertamina, started production of SAF derived from used cooking oil at its Cilacap refinery.

Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of crude palm oil (CPO), has been piloting projects on converting CPO into bioavtur since 2021, as well as exploring the bioavtur potentials of used cooking oil, of which it is the third-largest exporter globally.

If the cooking oil-based SAF passes all regulatory and quality benchmarks, it will be green-lit for the first test flight in August.

The energy ministry is targeting a one per cent share of vegetable oil in its bioavtur blend by 2027 as part of the country’s broader efforts to reduce oil imports and lower carbon emissions.

In a statement made in December 2024, the International Air Transport Association highlighted SAF as a key component in decarbonising the aviation industry and urged governments worldwide to provide incentives for scaling up SAF production. - The Jakarta Post/ANN",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/08/08/3457558.JPG,N,,2025-08-08 11:56:22.316600

In the 1990s, China looked to Brazil for engineering know-how, with turbines for the Three Gorges Dam manufactured in São Paulo.
Bastos also admits that there is a limit to the extent that GWM can localise manufacturing of important components like batteries.
“As to how much we can expect to onshore – that’s a difficult question,” André Cieplinski, of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in Brazil, told Dialogue Earth.
The CEO of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association, Elbia Gannoum, is more bullish on the state of Brazil’s wind industry and the role of government policy.","The three-pointed star of Mercedes-Benz still watches over the highway in Iracemápolis, but the old German car factory beneath it has been under new ownership since 2021.

Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors (GWM), the facility’s new owner, is scheduled to begin production at the site this month. Most of GWM’s sales are still of petrol cars, but the new Iracemápolis plant will focus on hybrids, turning out the Haval H6.

The GWM factory, setting up in Brazil’s industrial heartland of São Paulo state, is just one of several recent Chinese investments in the country’s clean energy sectors that bring manufacturing onshore. Further north, in the state of Bahia, the world’s largest electric vehicle maker, BYD, has already started production of Brazil’s first domestically built battery‑electric passenger car, at a plant that was previously owned by Ford.

BYD has two other factories in Brazil: a foothold in the south-eastern city of Campinas, established in 2015, which makes electric‑bus chassis and solar‑panel modules; and a plant in Manaus, Amazonas state, that assembles lithium‑iron‑phosphate battery packs for BYD buses.

Both the GWM and BYD plants will initially assemble cars from kits imported from China, but the plan is to gradually increase the number of components manufactured in Brazil. “From next year, we will localise several items. We need to be a local company, to produce in Brazil – not just to take advantage of government incentives, but to export to the wider region,” said Ricardo Bastos, GWM Brasil’s director of institutional affairs, in an interview with Dialogue Earth.

Investments by GWM, BYD and Chinese wind turbine maker Goldwind, which purchased a former General Electric factory in 2024, align closely with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s “sustainable” reindustrialisation agenda.

“Manufacturing output is a permanent conversation in Brazil, but this government is particularly keen on pursuing industrial policies, so there is plenty of space for looking favourably at Chinese investment that goes into manufacturing,” Armando Castelar, coordinator of applied economics at the Brazilian Institute of Economics (IBRE), told Dialogue Earth.

On his state visit to Beijing in May, Lula secured several commitments by Chinese firms to invest in clean energy manufacturing, including from turbine maker Windey to build an assembly plant in Bahia. Lula also came back with a USD 1 billion commitment from Envision Energy to build a sustainable aviation fuel complex, and a plan from automaker GAC to break ground on a new EV plant in Brazil by 2026.

Energy cooperation between China and Brazil is not new. In the 1990s, China looked to Brazil for engineering know-how, with turbines for the Three Gorges Dam manufactured in São Paulo. By the 2010s, the dynamic had flipped, and China became a major source of investment and technology for Brazil’s energy sector.

China’s State Grid – the world’s largest utility company – has played a central role in developing Brazil’s electricity grid. It entered the market in 2010 and, after a series of high-value acquisitions, began competing in energy auctions. Deploying the “ultra-high voltage” transmission technology it developed to bridge vast distances in China, the firm built two lines that span the length of Brazil – and it continues to construct some of the country’s most ambitious transmission projects.

Oil has become another pillar of energy cooperation since the 2010s. In 2009, state oil company Petrobras tapped a USD 10 billion oil-for-credit line from China Development Bank, beginning a relationship that has seen China become one of Petrobras’s largest creditors and export markets.

Chinese investment in Brazilian renewables started with hydropower, which still dominates Brazil’s energy mix. Since 2015, China Three Gorges has deployed more than USD 5 billion in hydro acquisitions and upgrades. State Power Investment Corporation followed suit, paying USD 2.4 billion for the São Simão dam in Goiás state, but both firms have since pivoted to Brazil’s wind-rich Northeast region.

Lula also returned from Beijing touting a pledge from China General Nuclear to invest more than USD 500 million in a renewable‑energy complex in Piauí, also in the Northeast, adding to an ever-growing pipeline of Chinese-led wind and solar projects in the region.

A ‘notable’ increase

These investments are part of what Claudia Trevisan, executive director of the Brazil-China Business Council, described to Dialogue Earth as a “notable increase in Chinese-led projects linked to sustainability.”

With vast potential for growth in its already significant solar, wind and biofuels sectors, as well as a huge electricity market and a grid that is already made up of 90% low-carbon sources, many analysts are excited about Brazil’s green future.

“Brazil has the potential to emerge as a green energy hub, not just for Latin America, but for the world – and I think China sees this potential,” Paulo Feldmann, an economics professor at the University of São Paulo, told Dialogue Earth.

On signing the “Fuel of the Future” law, which locks in demand for low-carbon fuels, Lula vowed in October 2024 that Brazil will “deliver the greatest energy revolution on Earth”. Chinese officials and executives also appear optimistic. The CEO of Goldwind has spoken of Brazil’s

“unrivalled” wind resources, while “green development” was placed at the centre of China-Brazil cooperation last November, when the two countries signed an agreement on aligning China’s Belt and Road Initiative with Lula’s New Industry Brazil and Ecological Transformation plans – even if Brazil has continued to snub membership of China’s flagship overseas investment initiative.

But the twin goals of industrialisation and green transformation do not always align, with surging imports presenting challenges to local manufacturing hopes. Last year, the Global South overtook the Global North as the main export market for Chinese solar panels. Meanwhile, emerging EV markets like Brazil remain small in absolute terms, but they are growing fast and overwhelmingly dominated by Chinese exports.

Both these trends have been positive from a climate perspective. In Pakistan, ultra-cheap Chinese panels have triggered a grassroots solar boom, and according to Rodrigo Sauaia, the CEO of Brazilian industry group Absolar, a similar phenomenon is underway in Brazil – “we could talk about a solar transformation in the past ten years,” he told Dialogue Earth.

“As the Global South looks to decarbonise, China’s scale and ability to deliver low-cost clean energy technologies make it an indispensable partner,” said Aya Adachi, an associate fellow at the German Council for Foreign Relations. However, Adachi noted that these countries are not simply looking to import products – “they are adopting local content requirements and tariffs to encourage more value-added production”, she says, noting that “between 2016 and 2024, around two-thirds of global trade defence measures targeting China came from developing countries”.

Edgar Barassa, an expert in e-mobility with Barassa & Cruz consulting, highlighted risks for local industrial capacities. “The challenge is that Chinese firms – facing domestic overcapacity in EVs and batteries – are incentivised to export surplus production or assemble vehicles abroad with minimal integration.” Speaking to Dialogue Earth, he warned that “if left unchecked, this dynamic risks entrenching a peripheral role for Brazil in the clean tech value chain”.

Sticks and carrots

In an attempt to confront this challenge, Brasília has combined an arsenal of sticks and carrots to bring production onshore. Among these, the Brazilian development bank (BNDES) has unlocked BRL 300 billion (USD 54 billion) in subsidised credit under the New Industry Brazil strategy, while the auto‑focused Mover programme provides tax credits to firms so long as they relocate production to Brazil and channel a share of their turnover into domestic research and development.

On the defensive front, the government has reinstated import duties on electric vehicles, rising to 35% by July 2026; re‑imposed tariffs on solar panels, raising them to 25% in November 2024; and approved a hike in tariffs on completed wind turbines, from 11.2% to 25% by January 2026.

To some extent, Beijing and its corporate champions also face a dilemma – whether to keep relying on exports of ultra-competitive Chinese products or to invest in local manufacturing, placating Brazilian demands for investment and helping turn Brazil into a launchpad for Latin American exports.

Brazil can be a base for Chinese production to export to South America,” says GWM’s Bastos, “but for this, we must comply with a lot of local content rules”.

Concern about “unbalanced trade” with countries in the Global South is increasingly prevalent among Chinese think-tankers. Liu Hongzhong, for instance, who teaches economics at Xi’an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi, urges “more balanced and sustainable economic and trade cooperation with countries in the Global South”.

According to Adachi, “Beijing is aware of the tensions created by growing trade imbalances with the Global South, but unlike its often forceful responses to trade actions by high-income nations, China has largely avoided retaliating against developing countries”.

The clutch of manufacturing deals that Lula secured in May are evidence that Beijing is listening, but the jury is still out on how successful Brazil will be in capturing more of the cleantech value chain from China.

“I am cautiously optimistic,” said Barassa, “but the challenge lies in translating memoranda of understanding into investment projects that generate measurable socio-economic outcomes”.

Celio Hiratuka, an associate professor at the State University of Campinas, echoed this sentiment: “It’s too early to tell if the government has been successful,” he told Dialogue Earth. “GWM appears serious about selecting suppliers and is betting on local content, but I think that BYD is still testing the market – their strategy might be to postpone the moment they need to [begin to] produce here in Brazil.”

BYD has faced criticism for flooding the market with imports, including via its car-carrier ship, the BYD Shenzhen, which is the largest vessel of its type in the world.

Bastos also admits that there is a limit to the extent that GWM can localise manufacturing of important components like batteries. “Producing the cells would be very, very expensive, but we are talking with suppliers about assembling batteries in Brazil,” he said.

“As to how much we can expect to onshore – that’s a difficult question,” André Cieplinski, of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in Brazil, told Dialogue Earth. “But even if we can’t onshore the whole battery manufacturing process, if we are able to nationalise other components, the result can be net positive for jobs.”

Although Cieplinski said that the Brazilian development bank has been very important for the development of solar in Brazil, Absolar’s Rodrigo Sauaia suggested that the government has not gone far enough in its industrial policy: “Brazil is the only possible hub for local manufacturing of solar photovoltaics in South America, but for that to develop, there are still some policies we need to work on.”

Referring to the government’s tariffs on solar panels, Sauaia added that, “rather than choke the market, it would be better to establish constructive policies – to use the government’s buying power to create demand and to establish strong industrial policy that incentivises the establishment of manufacturing hubs in Brazil”.

The CEO of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association, Elbia Gannoum, is more bullish on the state of Brazil’s wind industry and the role of government policy. “The Brazilian government has made significant efforts to keep the local supply chain active with job creation and to attract wind turbine manufacturing to the country,” she told Dialogue Earth, noting that “between 60% and 80% of wind turbine components (including blades, towers, and nacelles) are already manufactured in Brazil”.

Hiratuka said: “The Brazilian government is going in the right direction with its industrial policy, but they need to stay firm in the face of pressure from Chinese firms.”

For Hiratuka, the main risk lies in the general election due to be held in 2026: “The current government is moving in the right direction, but everything could change with a political turn at the next election.”",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/08/President-Lula-and-Lei-Zhang-at-the-signing-of-an-agreement-_Ricardo-Stuckert_Palacio-do-Planalto_5fac444a54.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 11:56:34.794137

Parity for different uses and updated utilizations of qualified carbon oxide apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Section Penalty Description Penalty Amount Sec. 666216

Substantial understatement of income tax due to disallowance of applicable energy credits:

Stricter penalty threshold when the IRS disallows a taxpayer's claimed energy credit (e.g., 45X, 45Y, or 48E) due to foreign entity restrictions or material assistance violations

A 1% misstatement of the tax liability triggers a 20% penalty.

Applies to credits disallowed due to FEOC or foreign-sourcing restrictions

Sec. 6695B

Substantial misstatements on certifications provided by suppliers:

New proposed penalty that targets suppliers or manufacturers who issue false certifications regarding domestic content or foreign sourcing

Applies to certifications provided after Dec. 31, 2025

Greater of $5,000 or 10% of credit amount claimed by the taxpayer relying on the misstated certification

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the Act, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after the year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property continues to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

""Energy property"" as defined in section 48 is no longer listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property continues to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits terminate for wind and solar facilities that (i) begin construction after July 4, 2026, and (ii) are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction by July 4, 2026, are not subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar will phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill initially passed by the House of Representatives included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property will be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2027) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit is allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) are apparently not subject to the rule above.

Observation: Residential solar electric property is not subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers is still eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 may qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009, has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power are eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is fixed at 30% and can not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh does not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance is no longer necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate can not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the base credit amount is the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026).

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit terminates for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027; and

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit is terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently do not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate phases out based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, are not credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate phases out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) is credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, is not credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the Act), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025 that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules are required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components are credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers may still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period is extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, can not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and Treasury will provide distinct emissions rates for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z is not credit eligible, and Treasury is authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury is authorized to prescribe rules for sales to related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (and fuel sold or used before July 4, 2025 that has not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) is not allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF does not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) does not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A is extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount is increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and is in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit may be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the “tech-neutral” ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

As of July 4, 2025, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification will not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§48D – Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit

For qualified property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is increased to 35%.

Observation: An advanced manufacturing facility must begin construction before Jan. 1, 2027, to be eligible for credits under section 48D.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The Act does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" are prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X than to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;19

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act; or21

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally means 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" means the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" also means a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

There is an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale does not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" is determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentages are:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentages are:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components, the threshold percentages are:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components, the threshold percentages are:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals, the threshold percentages are:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Act codifies that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury is required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027, applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Treasury must issue material assistance safe harbor tables by Dec. 31, 2026. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier is required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, is not included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification introduces an additional layer of complexity. The statute further authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity may be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty applies to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" means a disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" causes an ""excessive payment"" and incurs the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification is required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

Q: How are you working to push science-based policies to address climate change?
I welcome a vigorous, data-driven debate on climate change to ensure the issue isn’t hijacked to restrict economic and personal freedoms.","Q: How is the Trump administration working to restore sanity to climate policies?

A: In the previous Congress, I served as ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. The budget committee’s top job is drafting and enforcing the annual budget resolution that provides a public framework to manage the public purse. The budget resolution is the blueprint for congressional action on spending, revenue and the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The committee also tracks the appropriations process to ensure spending levels abide by the budget resolution. However, despite there being another Senate committee with responsibility for the environment, the Democrat Senate Majority in the previous Congress derailed the Senate Budget Committee’s top mission to push a radical climate agenda. Instead of rolling up our sleeves to address the national debt and rein in deficit spending, the Budget Committee held 21 “climate change” hearings, with themes on outdoor recreation, “fossil fuel overlords” and a so-called climate-driven insurance crisis. Climate change is a serious issue; an issue that merits a serious, science-based discussion. For years, a partisan-driven effort to create public hysteria about a climate-induced apocalypse has been manufactured by the media and climate activists. They’ve fought to shape public perception that man-made climate change poses an existential crisis to humanity. This whole hog approach to a climate-induced apocalypse was ginned up to allow for a whole-of-government solution. And the Obama and Biden administrations whipped up the climate frenzy to empower the federal bureaucracy and put the government in charge of the economy and people’s everyday lives. Consider the partisan-driven (and misnamed) Inflation Reduction Act that broke into Uncle Sam’s piggy bank to spend hundreds of billions to “tackle the climate crisis” and “advance “environmental justice.” The good news is the Trump administration’s Department of Energy is injecting desperately needed sanity and science into the conversation. In July, it released a peer-reviewed analysis about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions developed by five independent scientists comprising the Department of Energy’s 2025 Climate Working Group, including the former chief scientific officer in the Obama Energy Department.

The Climate Working Group found most extreme weather events in the U.S., such as hurricanes, tornados, floods and droughts, do not show long-term trends and the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather aren’t supported by U.S. historical data. The report’s analysis of solar activity calls into question “consensus” theories that greenhouse gas emissions are primarily responsible for rising temperatures.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright observes that media coverage distorts science about natural disasters, such as this summer’s flash flooding in the Texas Hill Country. Separately, another independent climate scientist, Dr. Roger Pielke Jr., said historical data does not show flash flooding has become more common or severe. He’s also testified before the Senate Budget Committee to impress upon lawmakers the “absolute highest standards of scientific integrity” are needed to shape climate policy.

Q: How are you working to push science-based policies to address climate change?

A: As a lifelong family farmer, I bring common sense environmental stewardship to the policymaking table in Washington. I welcome a vigorous, data-driven debate on climate change to ensure the issue isn’t hijacked to restrict economic and personal freedoms. During the Obama administration, I pushed back on pig-headed federal regulations on cow gas and Meatless Mondays. The livelihoods of Iowa’s 86,000 farm families depend on sustainable practices, conservation and ecosystem management that are rooted in science, not scare tactics. That’s why I’m proud to invite my fellow Iowans to share their expertise to dispel Washington nonsense and a climate consensus driven by a political agenda versus scientific integrity. Last May, I welcomed Dr. Michael Castellano, a professor at Iowa State University’s Department of Agronomy to testify about water scarcity. Through my legislative and oversight work, I’ll continue to push a science-based approach to climate policies, from next-generation renewable energy and biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel and 45Z regulations, to the agricultural and environmental benefits of biochar. If the American people fall hook, line and sinker for the narrative that modern human activity is an existential threat to the planet, then Big Government will keep trying to dictate to American families what cars to drive, what foods to eat, where to live and whether energy resources will keep pace with demand. The world needs an all of the above energy strategy to lift people out of poverty and ensure an adequate food supply. The government shouldn’t put up artificial barriers to energy production, from traditional fossil fuels to alternative energy, including wind and solar.",https://www.grassley.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.png,N,,2025-08-08 11:57:12.326185

Bristow flies BETA's ALIA CX300 conventional take-off and landing (eCTOL) aircraft in first of a months-long series of market survey operations

Delivery of BETA's aircraft to the Test Arena concludes a 6976 km journey across seven countries in the EU; marks company's first operations with a BETA-trained customer pilot

STAVANGER, Norway, Aug. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bristow Norway AS, a subsidiary of Bristow Group Inc., today flew BETA Technologies' all-electric ALIA CX300 aircraft at Stavanger Airport, marking the first operations of Norway's Test Arena for Zero & Low Emission Aviation. The flights, which are being conducted in cooperation with Avinor and the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway (CAA Norway), mark a step toward integrating and scaling Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) in Norway and the surrounding regions.

The Test Arena will consist of a series of evaluation flights over the next several months, to test likely customer routes at Avinor-owned airports throughout Norway. Early routes will see ALIA fly between Stavanger and Bergen airports, with potential for the program to expand to additional routes across Norway later this year. The aircraft will be flown by BETA-trained Bristow pilots.

Today's flight was conducted by Bristow pilot, Jeremy Degagne, and Beta pilot, Nate Dubie. In addition to kicking off Norway's first Test Arena, this flight represents another key step on the road to commercializing AAM. A BETA-trained Bristow crew will pilot and maintain BETA's aircraft throughout the six-month regulatory sandbox evaluation project helping pave the way for future delivery and integration of this technology into the region.

""As a nation wholly dependent on aviation — today as well as in the future — transitioning to a more sustainable aviation industry is a major priority for my government,"" said Minister of Transport Jon-Ivar Nygård.

""This first flight represents a significant step on a long and complex journey. As the Test Arena demonstrates, cooperation between authorities, airports, manufacturers, operators — and not least, political support — is essential. The systemic approach the Test Arena facilitates is unique, and I am proud that Norway is at the forefront.""

""Today's test flight is an important step in turning climate policy into practical solutions. If we are to succeed with the green transition, we must test, learn and build – not just plan. With this test arena, Norway is taking a leading role in the development of zero-emission aviation, while also creating new opportunities for green jobs and innovation,"" said Minister of Climate and Environment Andreas Bjelland Eriksen.

""Bristow is proud to be a part of this cutting-edge program and our participation in this test arena directly aligns with our philosophical 'crawl, walk, run' approach to developing Advanced Air Mobility for commercial operations,"" said Dave Stepanek, Bristow's Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer. ""The information we learn through the test arena program will provide valuable operational insights that could help operators, manufacturers, and regulators better understand how best to move forward towards commercial operations.""

""To be delivering ALIA to our partners at Bristow and kicking off operational testing here in Norway is a big moment for BETA,"" said Shawn Hall, BETA's Chief Revenue Officer. ""Bristow has been with us from the start and shares our drive for progress, and Norway, with its spirit of innovation and modernization, is a perfect place to move this technology forward. Handing off the aircraft to a customer is, in part, a huge milestone, but it's also an important launchpad for all that comes next for the industry.""

Norway has already established itself as a leader in innovative clean mobility, with electric cars comprising 89 percent of new car registrations in 2024. This Test Arena is an evaluation of the benefits of AAM for the region and its residents — as well as an investigation into the requirements to build out an ecosystem for integrated operations.

With its unique design that optimizes for payload, range, and IFR capabilities, ALIA is well-suited for Norway's distributed geography and cold-weather conditions.

""This essential and meaningful step will support the industry, accelerate innovation in new mobility, and strengthen our expertise. We are excited to continue this critical work"", said Lars Kobberstad, Director General of CAA Norway. ""Aviation is a safe mode of transport and a well-regulated sector. As the aviation authority, we will ensure that we facilitate testing new technologies and contribute to safe testing and future integrations. We will learn how rules and regulations must evolve to enable new technologies and concepts. Through this, we aim to build the necessary expertise early on for tomorrow's solutions.""

""The first flight of the Test Arena is a major milestone for Norwegian aviation and for Avinor, and a key step towards future commercial operations of zero- and low-emission flights in Norway,"" said Abraham Foss, Avinor's Chief Executive Officer. ""As a small, open economy with a dispersed population, Norway is entirely dependent on aviation and its broad network of airports. We are strongly committed to driving the long-term transition to a more sustainable aviation sector, while maintaining strong domestic and international connectivity.""

A team of BETA pilots and maintainers have delivered this aircraft, N214BT, to the Test Arena following a weeks-long journey across the EU. The flights, which originated in Shannon, Ireland, have taken BETA's aircraft over the Irish Sea, through the UK, over the English Channel, and to the Paris Air Show — where ALIA flew every day — followed by Germany, Luxembourg, Denmark, and, ultimately, Norway.

Braskem shrugs off US tariffs, expands ops in 2Q

Sao Paulo, 7 August (Argus) — The 50pc tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump on Brazilian exports to the US will have no material impact on Brazilian petrochemical major Braskem, company executives said. Braskem produces basic chemicals and polymers, which are not subject to the tariffs imposed by the US . The company's polymer exports to the US have been occasional and in relatively small volumes. For basic chemicals, exports to the US accounted for less than 1pc of Braskem's total export revenue in the first half of 2025. Braskem's January-June exports totaled R44bn ($8bn). Approximately R390mn shipped to the US in the period, chief financial officer Felipe Jens said during the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday. These included benzene, butadiene, gasoil and pyrolysis gasoline, among other products. The primary factor affecting Braskem's performance is the current global downturn in the petrochemical industry, which has lasted longer than expected and continues to impact the company's entire supply chain, according to the company. Brazil plans In Brazil, Braskem is moving forward with investments in its polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production units in Alagoas and Bahia states. As outlined in the business plan approved by the board of directors in early 2025, the company is allocating approximately R80mn to two projects focused on expansion and technological upgrades. The investments aim to increase production capacity by up to 35,000 metric tonnes (t)/yr, with 15,000 t/yr coming from direct expansion of the two plants and 20,000 t/yr through technological improvements. The initiative also includes upgrades to the company's chlor-alkali plant, which are essential to support the PVC production increase, according to Jens. In addition to industrial expansion, Braskem is implementing an eucalyptus biomass steam generation project at its Alagoas PVC unit. The initiative is expected to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, aligning operations with the company's environmental commitments. ""These actions work together to make our operations more efficient, productive, and sustainable,"" Jens said. ""We remain focused on improving profitability and competitiveness without compromising our environmental goals."" Braskem Idesa back to full ops Braskem Idesa, the company's joint venture in Mexico, resumed full operations of its ethane cracker last weekend, marking a new phase of productivity at the industrial complex in Coatzacoalcos, in Veracruz state. The restart followed a technical shutdown that lasted longer than anticipated but was considered strategic to ensure full processing capacity for liquid ethane, an essential feedstock for polyethylene (PE) production. Chief executive Roberto Ramos confirmed that the cracker returned to full load on 1 August, enabling the replenishment of the complex's three PE plants: one low density PE and two high density PE units. The low density PE plant has reached full capacity, while one of the high density PE plants experienced a technical issue that delayed production by two days but is now also ramping up to full output. A key milestone in this phase is the start of operations at the liquid ethane receiving terminal, inaugurated in May. With the Quimica Puerto Mexico import terminal (TQPM) now active, Braskem Idesa has, for the first time in 15 years since the project began, full ethane supply capacity, which is expected to enhance stability and competitiveness in resin production. ""This asset group including the cracker and the three polyethylene plants represents our most advanced industrial operation,"" Ramos said. ""These are modern, automated and well-designed facilities."" ""With the terminal now operational, we are positioned to demonstrate the full potential of producing high quality resins at competitive cost,"" he added. Potential US asset sale Ramos confirmed that Braskem is negotiating the sale of three polypropylene (PP) plants in the US to fellow PVC producer Unipar Carbocloro. The deal could reach $1bn and includes facilities in Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The move is reportedly driven by financial pressure, with Braskem aiming to reduce cash burn and leverage. Ramos said that the plants have historically generated strong cash flow and that any sale would need to reflect their long-term value. Jens confirmed that Braskem is evaluating divestment options as part of its transformation plan, focusing on liquidity and economic value. While the US assets are strategically important, the company remains open to alternatives that support its broader goals. 2Q results Braskem's domestic resin sales rose by 1pc in the second quarter from a year before and by 3pc from the previous quarter, reaching 829,000t. The increase was driven by early buying, which in turn was prompted by tariff uncertainty. Domestic chemical sales grew by 1pc year-on-year and remained flat from the first quarter, supported by stronger benzene and propylene demand. PP production in the US and Europe held steady at 74pc, down by 4pc from the second quarter in 2024. Sales volumes in those regions rose by 2pc quarter-on-quarter and by 1pc year-on-year, reflecting improved US demand. The company posted a $45mn loss for the quarter, narrowing from a $708mn loss in the second quarter of 2024 and down from a $113mn profit in the first quarter this year.

EU bunker demand up 12pc in 2024 on container traffic

New York, 6 August (Argus) — EU bunker demand in 2024 surged by 4.9mn t to 46.3mn t, up 12pc from the previous year, driven largely by longer container ship voyages as vessels avoided the Red Sea following Houthi attacks. Container ship fuel consumption led the increase, rising by 5.4mn t to 17.0mn t in 2024, according to the latest data from the EU's Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) database. Many container lines rerouted around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, lengthening voyages, and increasing fuel burn. The MRV system tracks marine fuel demand for ships of 5,000 gross tons and above on all voyages involving EU or European Economic Area (EEA) ports. This includes full-voyage fuel consumption, even in international waters, as long as at least one port is within the EU or EEA. MRV-tracked marine carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions followed suit, rising 12pc to 143.2mn t in 2024. For the first time in 2024, the MRV also required reporting of two other greenhouse gases (GHG): methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). Vessel operators reported 59,479t of CH₄ and 8,066t of N₂O, which translate to 1.7mn t and 2.1mn t of CO₂-equivalent emissions, respectively, based on their global warming potential of 28 and 265 times that of CO₂. Of the 59,479t of CH₄ reported to the EU MRV in 2024, the majority, 36,615t, came from LNG carriers, which often use boil-off gas from their cargo as fuel. LNG has lower CO₂ emissions than conventional marine fuel, but LNG or dual-fuel LNG engines can result in methane slip, where unburned methane escapes through the engine exhaust. Another 14,432t of CH₄ came from roll on/roll off passenger vessels (ro-pax), roll on/roll off cargo vessels (ro-ro), and ferries, many of which also run on LNG or LNG dual-fuel engines. MRV does not report different marine fuel types demand, just total demand. By comparison, Rotterdam, Europe's biggest bunkering port, reported 8.6mn t of conventional marine fuel sold in 2024, down 2.7pc from 2023. Biodiesel bunker blends reached 752,103t in 2024, holding steady. LNG and bio-LNG sales were up 52pc to 424,863t, and bio-methanol jumped up to 3,946t from less than 800t in 2023. Sustainable marine fuel demand grew ahead of the start of the FuelEU Maritime regulation in January 2025, which mandated 2pc in GHG emissions cut in 2025.

Regulatory clash set to disrupt ARA biofuel trade

London, 6 August (Argus) — A regulatory mismatch between EU-wide FuelEU Maritime rules and national Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) transpositions in Belgium and the Netherlands is set to disrupt biofuel and marine fuel markets from 2026, particularly in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) bunkering hub. The Dutch and Belgian governments plan to exclude biofuels made from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats — listed under RED Annex IX Part B — from counting towards maritime fuel mandates. This contrasts with FuelEU Maritime, which rewards their use to cut shipping emissions. The divergence is expected to distort supply-demand dynamics and raise compliance costs for suppliers and shipowners. Draft legislation in both countries obliges fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across land, inland shipping and maritime sectors. Under the Dutch RED III draft, Annex IX Part B biofuels — including UCO and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — will count towards land and inland shipping mandates only, capped at 4.29pc and 11.07pc respectively. For international maritime shipping, the cap is set at zero. This means suppliers cannot claim emission reduction units (EREs) for Part B fuels used in maritime shipping, effectively disincentivising UCO-based biodiesel sales in the ARA region. FuelEU Maritime, by contrast, mandates GHG cuts for maritime users starting at 2pc in 2025, rising to 80pc by 2050, and places no cap on Part B fuels. Like FuelEU Maritime, the Dutch RED III draft excludes crop-based biofuels from counting towards maritime GHG reduction targets. But unlike FuelEU, it also bars Annex IX Part B fuels — creating a sharper compliance gap for bunker suppliers. This leaves used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) in a precarious position. Widely used in marine fuels due to its scale and compatibility with existing engines, Ucome-based blends will remain attractive to shipowners aiming to meet FuelEU Maritime targets. But ARA suppliers will need to sell Annex IX Part A fuels — such as bio-LNG or Advanced Fame 0 — to meet RED III targets or face penalties. This could push up Ucome prices, as suppliers seek to offset non-compliance costs. Advanced Fame 0-based marine biodiesel blends are currently attractive to buyers because marine mandates have not yet taken effect. Under the existing system, HBE-G renewable tickets — which will be replaced by EREs next year — can be deducted from the price of Part A fuels, but this may not be viable next year. Part B fuels from the marine sector do not currently generate HBEs. Higher Ucome prices may inflate maritime-generated ERE values and boost demand for Part A fuels, raising overall biofuel costs and reducing ARA's competitiveness. Some shipowners may opt to bunker elsewhere. Many already source marine biodiesel from Asia, where prices are lower. Argus assessed B30 Ucome dob ARA at an average of $805.30/t during May–July, compared with $705.48/t in Singapore. Prices for alternatives like RFNBOs and ammonia remain high, limiting near-term uptake. FuelEU abatement prices for Ucome-MGO and Ucome-VLSFO have been relatively flat this year, but could rise if Ucome prices firm. Market reactions Market participants are exploring ways to navigate the mandates. One option is blending small volumes of Advanced Fame 0 into bunker fuels, although this is logistically complex and could raise prices at ARA ports. Another strategy involves sourcing marine-generated ERE tickets from over-compliant sellers. But supply may be tight, as only a limited share of inland and land-generated tickets can be transferred to the marine sector under the flexible credit allowance. Some suppliers have told Argus they are considering shifting some of their bunker volumes to other ports, including the Mediterranean region. Spain's RED III draft includes a proposed 1.7pc cap on Part B fuels — far more lenient than Belgium and the Netherlands. Spain's marine mandate starts at 1pc in 2027, rising to just 3pc by 2030.

“Our chosen theme reflects Indonesia’s future energy needs: securing our energy supply through sustainable use of biomass and bioenergy,” said Dr Meika Syahbana Rusli, SBRC Chair at IPB University.

One of the conference’s focal points was the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) — seen as both a strategic opportunity and a significant challenge for Indonesia. Dr Meika noted that while the country has made strides in biodiesel production, SAF remains hindered by technical, economic, and logistical obstacles.

“Our roadmap is ambitious: 1% SAF of total fuel by next year, 2.5% by 2030, and 5% by 2035. These targets are not easy to meet,” he acknowledged.

SBRC is also developing technology to convert solid biomass into bio-oil via gasification, an approach that has attracted interest from Airbus Singapore.

With supplies of lipid sources for SAF expected to diminish by 2030, biomass could become the main raw material for production.

Edi Wibowo, Director of Bioenergy at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, stressed that the government is preparing new regulations to accelerate bioenergy development.

“We want to maximise this potential to strengthen national energy independence and security,” he said.

Ocean and Key Ports Update

Due to ongoing operational challenges, the AE11 service will temporarily omit the Port of Genoa and instead divert to nearby Vado Ligure throughout August and September. The diversion is in place to mitigate further delays for our customers and maintain service integrity. We expect this to be a short-term measure and will communicate with our customers when the service returns to normal. Please see more details here and click here for sailing schedules.

To better connect the Caribbean and North Europe with greater reliability, Maersk has launched the new CAX service between Antwerp and the Port of Manzanillo in Panama. The first sailing will be the Maersk Monte Alto, which departs on 29th September 2025. Click here for more information and the full service rotation.

Key terminals across the continent are experiencing some moderate disruption as we move through the summer months. In Northern Europe, Antwerp continues to face high yard density and low gang availability, with waiting times running higher than usual. To help alleviate the situation, customers are kindly asked to collect their import containers as soon as possible after discharge.

London Gateway and the Port of Rotterdam, meanwhile, remain stable, with minimal waiting times and moderate yard density.

Further south, Algeciras and Tanger Med 2 are operating efficiently despite high volumes, although yard peaks are forecasted for the first few weeks of August. Our teams continue to work on contingency plans and will take action to minimise delays for customers, should it be required.

Elsewhere, Maersk has commenced operations at Milazzo Port, Sicily, to strengthen network connectivity for its customers in southern Italy. Vessels will be handled at the Duferco Terminal Mediterraneo (DTM) and bookings are now being accepted.

To stay on top of any updates to your cargo, please sign up for ETA notifications.

Inland Update

In Germany, changes have been made to the import container release process at Hamburg, Bremerhaven, and Wilhelmshaven. Effective from 1st October 2025, the new process will replace the PIN-based release system with a digital authorisation known as ‘secure release order’.

This ensures that only one traceable party at any given time is authorised to pick up full import containers from the port, supporting safe and secure supply chains for our customers. Click here for more information and further details on the German Ports community platform, through which the new process will be facilitated.

Elsewhere in Germany, customers are reminded that inspection fees remain in place if a service is carried out at Export (INE), Import or Trans-shipment (INI). Fees have increased as of 14th July 2025. Read more here.

Heading further south on the continent, ongoing railway maintenance and closures continue to affect inland operations in Italy, with rail services in and out of the Port of Genoa unavailable throughout August. Maersk will strive to minimise the impact of these disruptions by continuing to offer our services by truck, however the situation will result in the need for longer routes and subsequently a Peak Season Surcharge (PSS) to be implemented throughout Italy.

A separate Peak Season Surcharge also comes into force for truck transport in and out of the Port of Venice due to difficulties accessing the terminal. We will continue to monitor both situations and remove the PSS as soon as it becomes operationally feasible to do so.

Finally, in Slovenia, major railway infrastructure upgrades are now under way, reducing available rail capacity across key routes. We advise customers to plan accordingly and consult with Maersk representatives for alternative inland routing. Read more details here.

For more information on ways to connect seamlessly with our rail, road, and barge solutions across Europe, please visit our Inland transportation services in Europe.

Air Freight Update

Recently introduced by the European Commission, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates fuel suppliers delivering to EU airports to blend a minimum percentage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into their supply – starting with 2% in 2025 and growing incrementally to 70% in 2050.

The associated costs are being passed on by airlines and may affect pricing for shipments moving through airports in the European Union and United Kingdom. Due to these additional costs imposed by airlines, Maersk will introduce an SAF surcharge on applicable air freight shipments of €0.04 per chargeable kilogram from 1st September 2025. For further details, please visit our advisory page.

We are seeing increased demand for air freight from Vietnam into the United States of America amid the ongoing tensions between the US and China. Rotate data shows that volumes between Ho Chi Minh City and the US increased 62% in April 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

Sourcing from Vietnam has been increasing in recent years, and we expect air cargo demand to continue from the country if it has more favourable tariff rates than its Chinese neighbours. Please reach out to discuss export options through our global network of partner and own-controlled flights.

Customs Update

At the end of July, the European Union and US agreed on a new deal for trade and tariffs that sets a 15% baseline on goods being exported to the US from the EU. The UK, meanwhile, faces slightly lower baseline tariffs of 10%.

Final terms of the deal are still being ironed out, but we advise getting ahead of the game with proactive measures on your supply chain – including reviewing all origin documentation, understanding stacking risks for EU exports to the US, and preparing for potential cost increases and re-routing strategies.

Our Global Trade and Customs Consultants are on hand to support you with planning ahead and outlining the benefits of the new AI-powered Maersk Trade and Tariff Studio product, should you need any assistance. Please also stay up to date on the latest global tariff information through our dedicated page here, and sign up to hear more from our customs experts in next month’s on-demand webinar around handling ever-changing tariffs and regulations.

Elsewhere, the EU’s latest sanctions package against Russia targets vessels acting as the company’s shadow fleet and – for the first time – third-country financial operators. Export bans are planned for machinery metals, plastics, and chemicals used in industrial production.

We advise customers to audit supply chains to determine any exposure to sanctioned entities, and also monitor financial transactions involving third-country intermediaries. Read more information here.

Ecommerce Update

Ecommerce in Europe is continuing its upward trajectory in 2025, with the likes of Germany expecting to see 4% annual growth and Spain growing 13% year-on-year compared to 2024. As online order volumes surge, consumer expectations for convenience and sustainability are redefining last-mile delivery.

One of the standout trends in recent months is the rapid expansion of Out-of-Home (OOH) delivery options at checkout. No longer a niche alternative, OOH is becoming the new standard across Europe – accounting for 58% of B2C package deliveries according to Last Mile Experts.

As such, more and more companies are looking to capitalise on consumer favourability for OOH options, including UK retail giants ASOS. According to Sendcloud data, 44% of European customers abandon their online purchase if their preferred shipping option isn’t available. Offering a variety of delivery choices – including out-of-home (OOH) options – at checkout is therefore crucial for reducing cart abandonment and securing sales.

Beyond its role in managing hundreds of billions in assets, Julius Baer has also set an ambitious climate agenda, anchored in sustainability, energy transition and net zero goals.

As the finance sector faces rising scrutiny for its environmental impact, Julius Baer is positioning itself as a progressive player through meaningful, science-based commitments.

Energy transition and efficiency

Central to Julius Baer’s decarbonisation efforts is a strategic shift towards energy efficiency and renewable energy.

The bank has transitioned all its Swiss offices to 100% renewable electricity and is replicating this model across its global footprint.

New office locations are selected based on energy efficiency criteria, with most premises adhering to green certification standards such as LEED or BREEAM.

By retrofitting or constructing buildings with sustainability in mind, Julius Baer is embedding climate-conscious infrastructure into its physical operations.

A further step has been the introduction of an internal carbon price of CHF100 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent on business air travel.

This initiative, aligned with UN Global Compact guidance, encourages behavioural change while generating funds to support low-carbon investments.

Sustainability and responsible management

Julius Baer’s broader sustainability strategy is built around two pillars: responsible wealth management and responsible citizenship.

The bank supports clients in aligning their capital with sustainable outcomes, offering ESG reports, climate transparency and bespoke investment mandates.

It aims to shift 36% of its discretionary mandates and balance sheet into companies with validated Science Based Targets by 2025 and 100% by 2040.

“I joined Julius Baer as Head Sustainability and Director of the Sustainability Board in 2019,” writes Yvonne Suter, Head of Sustainability, Member Sustainability Board and Member Responsible Investment Committee at Julius Baer, writes on LinkedIn.

“Together with my team, I oversee and implement the Group’s sustainability strategy, with its two key pillars of responsible wealth management and responsible citizenship.

“I am dedicated to applying credible insight in order to empower investors on their sustainability journey.

“To this end, I am working in partnership with sustainability thought leaders and investment experts to enable positive impact beyond financial returns.”

To further reduce its environmental footprint, the bank has invested in high-impact nature-based projects, including mangrove reforestation in Indonesia and tropical forest restoration in Panama.

It was also the first Swiss financial institution to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in partnership with major airlines, using proceeds from its internal carbon levy to fund these greener alternatives.

Julius Baer was an early adopter of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment and a founding signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Banking.

Internally, it drives sustainability through active governance, employee networks such as “Bärs4Sustainability” and sustainability-themed workshops.

Regular stakeholder engagement and transparency, including sustainability roadshows, reinforce its commitment to responsible practice.

Towards net zero

Julius Baer has laid out clearly defined, Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-approved net zero goals.

It is committed to achieving net zero emissions from its own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030, with a 90% reduction in emissions from a 2019 baseline.

It has been 20 years since Congress passed the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, a bold, bipartisan commitment to strengthen our nation’s energy independence, support rural economies and reduce harmful emissions. For two decades since, the RFS has done exactly what it was designed to do. It has delivered real, measurable benefits to consumers, farmers and the environment. But as we celebrate this milestone, we also need to recognize how to build on our success.

Let’s start with consumers. Every time drivers fill up with fuels like E15 that contain lower-cost, homegrown biofuels, they’re saving money at the pump. The RFS introduced competition into a market previously dominated by fossil fuels. This helped hold down fuel prices for American families, especially during volatile periods for global oil markets. The sum of these savings has kept billions of dollars in Americans’ pockets. It’s a powerful reminder that energy policy can directly improve lives when it puts American innovation and consumers first.

The RFS has also unlocked a wider economic revitalization in rural America. Across the heartland, biorefineries have created tens of thousands of high-quality jobs in engineering, plant operations, research and transportation. These aren’t just numbers on a page. They’re real careers in communities that broader economic shifts have all too often left behind. For rural towns across the Midwest, biofuels are a cornerstone of economic opportunity and growth. Every mile driven on homegrown fuel, and every new job that results, strengthens the economic backbone of rural America.

And no one understands the impact of the RFS more deeply than America’s farmers. For generations, farmers have fed our families and fueled our economy. With the RFS, they have been empowered to help fuel our cars as well. By creating a reliable, high-demand market for corn, soybeans and other feedstocks, the RFS has given farmers a source of stability that is nothing short of essential. This steady demand helps farm families invest in their operations, adopt more sustainable practices and navigate the ups and downs of global commodity markets. The result is a more resilient and innovative agricultural sector.

Of course, the RFS is also a cornerstone of U.S. energy security. Two decades ago, we were heavily reliant on foreign oil. Today, thanks in part to the RFS, we’ve dramatically increased our use of domestically produced renewable fuel. Every gallon of ethanol or biodiesel made here in America is one less gallon we need to import. That strengthens our national security and gives us more control over our energy future. Even when major turmoil engulfed the Middle East in recent months, the American people did not have to contend with significant spikes in fuel prices. That is a major shift from 20 years ago. It’s no exaggeration to say that the RFS has helped rewrite America’s energy narrative moved from dependence to independence — and toward dominance.

And the environmental impact? According to Growth Energy’s research, the RFS has helped curb over 725 million metric tons of carbon emissions since its inception. That’s the equivalent of taking more than 150 million cars off the road for a year. The RFS proves there doesn’t have to be a zero-sum tradeoff between reducing emissions and increasing prosperity. This is a proven solution, already working and improving air quality in communities across the country.

For all the progress we’ve made, there’s more work to do. As I recently told the Environmental Protection Agency, it is essential that we continue to actively build on this success, not scale it back. We need strong, stable biofuels blending targets and consistent oversight of refinery exemptions. We need policies that reward innovation, open up new pathways for sustainable aviation fuel, and ensure that new technologies like carbon capture are fully recognized under the RFS.

The next chapter of the RFS must be one of momentum. That’s why I’m calling on policymakers on both sides of the aisle to recommit to the promise of the RFS. Let’s protect the gains we’ve made. Let’s expand access to higher blends like E15. Let’s modernize the program so it continues to drive innovation, investment and climate progress for the next 20 years and beyond.

The RFS is more than just another policy. It’s a promise. A promise to America’s farmers, to rural communities, to consumers and to our clean air future. That is a promise worth fighting for.

In a breakthrough for India’s clean-energy ambitions, the Panipat refinery has become the first in the country to receive certification to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil. Officials say the move signals a decisive step towards reducing aviation’s carbon footprint while aligning with global climate commitments.

The certification, granted after coordination between key ministries and regulators, confirms the refinery meets UN-backed CORSIA standards to cut global aviation emissions. SAF, which can be blended with conventional jet fuel, offers a cleaner-burning alternative capable of slashing lifecycle emissions and helping airlines meet tightening sustainability targets.

Government discussions are already under way to mandate SAF blending for international flights departing India. The proposal would require airlines to use at least 1% SAF from 2027, rising to 2% in the following years. While not yet approved for regular domestic commercial flights, test runs since 2018 , using biofuel derived from sources like jatropha, have proven the viability of such fuels in Indian skies.

The Panipat facility’s innovation lies in converting a waste stream , used edible oil, into high-value, low-carbon aviation fuel. This not only addresses the issue of safe disposal for cooking oil but also paves the way for a circular economy model, creating new economic opportunities in the collection and processing supply chain. Industry experts note, however, that scaling up production remains the key challenge, as global SAF output is still a fraction of overall aviation fuel demand.

If capacity expands as planned, the refinery’s achievement could mark the start of a greener era for Indian aviation, reducing dependence on fossil-based imports and setting an example for other sectors to adopt waste-to-fuel solutions. From the frying pan to the flight deck, Panipat may well be charting the flightpath to a cleaner future for the skies.

In a world increasingly defined by climate challenges, the intersection of sport, technology, and sustainability has never been more critical. At the heart of this intersection sits an unlikely protagonist: Formula 1. Synonymous with speed, precision, and spectacle, F1 is now carving out a new identity as a global leader in decarbonization and innovation, driving change not only within motorsport but across aviation, logistics, and beyond.

This is the story of how Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and spending caps—two seemingly unrelated innovations—are turning F1 into a case study in sustainability leadership. And it is also the story of Liberty Media, the American conglomerate whose transformation of Formula 1 is not only a masterclass in business strategy but a beacon for how private enterprise can spearhead global climate action. Having had the opportunity to study Liberty Media’s acquisition and transformation of F1 at Harvard Business School, I believe this journey represents one of the most compelling case studies in modern business.

Part 1: The Climate Challenge and the Role of High-Profile Platforms

Global emissions continue to rise, with aviation accounting for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions and expected to triple by 2050 if left unchecked. Transport emissions, particularly from road, sea, and air, remain among the hardest to abate. As global pressure mounts to decarbonize all sectors, the role of high-visibility platforms becomes vital.

Formula 1, with its global fanbase of over 1.5 billion viewers, provides a unique stage. What F1 does reverberates across industries. Its commitment to sustainability is not only a moral imperative but a strategic pivot that positions it as an innovation testbed. Its journey toward net zero by 2030 is ambitious—and central to that ambition is the adoption and scaling of SAF.

Part 2: SAF and Formula 1’s Aviation Footprint

F1 is a logistical behemoth. With 23 races across five continents, the freight, personnel, and equipment movement is staggering. The carbon footprint of this mobility, particularly from air travel and freight, has been significant. Recognizing this, Formula 1 has made SAF adoption a priority, beginning with air freight and travel for the 2023 season.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is produced from waste-based feedstocks like used cooking oil, animal fats, and municipal waste, and can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Yet, SAF faces hurdles: limited supply, high cost, and lack of demand certainty. This is where F1’s adoption becomes pivotal.

By committing to SAF for its logistics and supporting R&D for 100% sustainable fuel for race cars by 2026, F1 acts as a market maker, providing early demand that encourages scale and investment. Its adoption helps create credibility and urgency in the aviation sector, demonstrating that SAF is not a futuristic concept—it is ready now.

F1 teams and logistics partners like DHL are working collaboratively to optimise freight and increase SAF uptake. For instance, DHL’s GoGreen Plus programme, which includes SAF logistics solutions, was first deployed in F1’s global freight transport—a model now emulated across industries.

Part 3: From Fuel to Efficiency: The Spending Cap Revolution

Introduced in 2021, the F1 cost cap limits teams to $135 million per season, excluding certain elements like driver salaries and marketing. Initially seen as a measure to level the playing field, it quickly emerged as a catalyst for sustainable innovation.

In the past, F1 success often correlated with financial firepower. Teams with bigger budgets could outspend rivals, chasing marginal gains through brute force. The cost cap disrupted this paradigm, forcing teams to rethink operations, prioritise efficiency, and innovate within resource constraints.

This mirrors the global challenge of climate action: how do we decarbonise without infinite resources? The cost cap incentivises smarter R&D, leaner logistics, and improved resource management—principles that align with circular economy thinking. Teams are now sharing best practices in material reuse, supply chain transparency, and low-emission operations—knowledge that spills over into real-world mobility and manufacturing sectors.

The race for performance within limits has made F1 a living laboratory for efficiency, offering lessons for companies and governments aiming to achieve net zero with limited capital.

Part 4: Liberty Media: Vision, Strategy, and Sustainability

When Liberty Media acquired Formula 1 in 2017 for $4.4 billion, many questioned whether a US media company could understand or elevate a traditionally European sport. Fast forward to today, and F1 is not only more global, inclusive, and profitable but also more sustainable and innovative.

Liberty Media saw the potential to transform F1 into a multi-platform entertainment and technology brand, not just a racing series. Investments in digital engagement, the Netflix series Drive to Survive, and expanded race locations (e.g., Miami, Las Vegas) brought in new demographics, especially younger audiences.

Critically, Liberty Media recognised that sustainability and growth were not mutually exclusive. The company embedded ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals into F1’s strategy, aligning with global investor expectations. Its push for SAF adoption, carbon-neutral events, and sustainability reporting set benchmarks for sports organisations worldwide.

Having studied Liberty Media’s acquisition and strategy at Harvard Business School, I can attest that it stands as one of the most powerful business case studies in recent history. It is a masterclass in value creation, stakeholder alignment, and long-term vision. It shows how a bold, strategic acquisition can pivot an entire industry toward relevance, profitability, and purpose.

Part 5: Ripple Effects Beyond the Track

F1’s embrace of SAF and spending caps has ripple effects:

Aviation Sector: Airlines and freight companies are watching F1’s SAF adoption closely. Partnerships between F1 logistics and SAF producers create new offtake agreements, stimulating production.

Automotive Innovation: R&D into drop-in fuels for F1 cars informs broader decarbonisation of internal combustion engines (ICE), especially in markets where EV adoption is slow.

Policy and Regulation: Governments are now using F1’s net-zero goals as reference points for national sports sustainability mandates.

Fan Engagement and Behaviour Change: F1 is educating its massive audience on climate solutions, from SAF to efficiency, influencing consumer and corporate behaviour.

Technology Transfer: Innovations in materials, telemetry, and energy systems developed under the cost cap are now entering other industries, from aerospace to consumer electronics.

Part 6: The Future of High-Performance Sustainability

The next frontier is clear: 100% sustainable fuels in F1 cars by 2026, continued scaling of SAF in logistics, and new regulations on energy usage, circular materials, and digital efficiency tools. F1 is positioning itself as not just a racing series, but a sustainability innovation platform.

Its roadmap includes:

Waste-to-fuel technologies, especially from urban and agricultural residues.

Blockchain-enabled traceability for SAF and other low-carbon fuels.

Expansion of sustainability KPIs tied to team performance.

Greater focus on diversity and inclusion, ensuring all talent can contribute to sustainability innovation.

Conclusion: Why This Matters

The world needs credible, high-profile examples of climate leadership. Formula 1, once symbolic of excess, is becoming a model of decarbonised performance. Its adoption of SAF and cost efficiency, under Liberty Media’s visionary leadership, proves that sustainability can drive innovation, profitability, and global engagement.

But the Army Corps didn’t dispute that it denies less than 1% of requests for regulatory permits.
The conservation groups “thus show that the Corps will almost certainly grant NEXT” the regulatory permit that will allow construction, Nelson wrote.","PORTLAND, Ore. (CN) — A federal judge said Thursday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can't duck claims it unlawfully paved the way for a clean fuel manufacturer's construction of a massive renewable diesel fuel refinery along the Columbia River in Oregon.

The challenge to the Army Corps greenlighting the company's use of a levee road can proceed, U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson said in her 23-page opinion.

“Legal consequences flow from the Corps' Section 408 determination,” the Joe Biden appointee wrote .

The dispute centers on a letter the Army Corps sent to NXTClean Fuels, also known as NEXT Renewable Fuels, in which it indicated the company wouldn’t need a full Section 408 review and permission — a process typically required when outside parties intend to alter Army Corps civil works projects.

NEXT Renewable Fuels proposed to build a renewable diesel fuel refinery near Clatskanie, Oregon — a small town around 60 miles north of Portland on the Columbia River.

To construct the facility, the company would need to bring in heavy equipment and building materials to Port Westward Industrial Park via a barge, then transport those materials across the Kallunki Road and Bradbury Slough levee, which is a Corps-constructed civil works project.

Columbia Riverkeepers and 1000 Friends of Oregon oppose the refinery construction at large, citing increased air pollution, more barge traffic, loss of wetlands, a heightened risk of catastrophic fuel spills and potential flooding and water pollution as the primary reasons.

The Army Corps argues that the groups didn’t have standing to bring the challenge, but the court disagreed.

“Plaintiffs allege a credible threat that the levee and refinery harms will occur,” Nelson wrote.

The levee harms, according to the plaintiffs, are the potential for heavy haul trucks to damage the levee, increasing flood risk and threatening catastrophic losses to the farmland it protects.

In their initial 2024 complaint, the groups argued that the letter the Corps sent to the company qualified as a final agency action subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.

The conservation groups argued that the letter “fails to grapple with the threat that driving trucks loaded with heavy construction equipment and refinery components over the levee will 'alter' or even 'injure' the levee within the meaning of [Section] 408.""

The Army Corps argued that the accused harms aren’t imminent because it hasn’t issued final approval for the proposed refinery, and it is unknown when the company will obtain all the approvals. But the Army Corps didn’t dispute that it denies less than 1% of requests for regulatory permits.

The conservation groups “thus show that the Corps will almost certainly grant NEXT” the regulatory permit that will allow construction, Nelson wrote.

Even though the letter doesn’t explicitly allow the company to use the road or begin construction, Nelson found that, “as a practical matter, the letter provides that NEXT can use the road as a haul road without going through Section 408 review.”

“It is true that plaintiffs' alleged injury is partly dependent on NEXT's actions, in the sense that the levee and refinery harms would not occur without NEXT's use of the road and subsequent construction and operation of the proposed refinery,” Nelson wrote. “But the opposite is also true: had the Corps not made its Section 408 determination, the prospect of the asserted levee and refinery harms would not materialize.”

And the Army Corps argument that the company could still use the road if the letter was vacated was not well taken by the court, as Nelson pointed out that using the levee without permission is a misdemeanor.

“It is plausible that NEXT would rely on the Corps' letter in its use of the road and that absent the Corps' letter, NEXT would not act in a way to expose itself to potential criminal liability,” Nelson wrote.

By making the company’s proposal go through Section 408 review, the levee harms could be prevented, Nelson found. Either the Army Corps would deny the company’s request, or it would approve it only after determining that the proposed use of the levee wouldn’t negatively impact the levee.

Nelson also determined that the letter qualified as a final agency action, which makes it subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.

“As a practical matter, by determining that Section 408 does not apply to the proposed refinery, the Corps has stated that NEXT can use the road as a haul road without needing the Corps' permission pursuant to Section 408,” Nelson wrote. “After making such determination, it is reasonable to assume that the Corps would not then request criminal prosecution of NEXT for using the road as a haul road.”

In April this year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certified the A350-900 with the new Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 Enhanced Performance (EP) engine, which may extend the range of the aircraft even further thanks to its use of lighter materials and better fuel economy.

Only a few commercial aircraft can fly further than the A350-900, including other A350 variants such as the A350-1000 and the A350-900ULR, the latter of which is currently the longest-ranging commercial airliner in the world. This article takes a look at what is known so far about the XWB-84 EP, giving an idea of how much it could increase the performance of the A350-900 or other variants.

Improvements Of The Trent XWB-84 EP

According to an Airbus website post made on April 11, the Trent XWB-84 EP engine has several improvements over the previous iteration used for the A350-900, called the XWB-84. For reference, the XWB-84 is a lower-thrust configuration of the XWB, providing 84,200 pounds of force. The larger A350-1000 uses a higher-thrust configuration of the engine, called the XWB-97, which produces 97,000 pounds of force.

The Airbus post announced the certification of the XWB-84 EP with the A350-900 and also cited some design improvements, including an upgraded fan and compressor, improved turbine aerodynamics, and enhanced turbine blade cooling. The improvements of the Enhanced Performance engine will deliver at least one percent lower fuel consumption, which will provide airlines with a reduction in overall operating costs and emissions.

Even the one percent improvement in fuel burn provided by the EP engine may allow the A350-900 to compete with its longer-range sibling variants, and over time, airlines will see the benefit of the EP engine's improvements. Once the engine passes the FAA’s corresponding certification, Airbus expects the engine type to be operated by airlines worldwide, thanks to an estimated fleet saving of five million US dollars per year, according to Rolls-Royce.

The XWB-84 EP Offers Greater Range And Efficiency

Current-generation turbofan engines offer a significant improvement over the previous generation, thanks to state-of-the-art technologies, aerodynamics, and lightweight materials. According to Airbus and Rolls-Royce, the XWB can deliver a 25% advantage in fuel burn (which directly extends range), operating costs, and CO₂ emissions, thanks to the adoption of these features. Julien Puyou, Airbus’ Head of Widebody Programme, iterated the impact of this in the post:

""With EASA's certification of the Trent XWB-84 EP to power the A350-900, we strengthen the aircraft's position as the long-range leader. Together with our partner Rolls-Royce, this latest evolution underscores our joint commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. The Trent XWB-84 is already among the most efficient widebody engines on the market and this enhanced version will deliver even greater performance and efficiency for our airline customers,”

According to Rolls-Royce, the Trent XWB-84 EP is already certified to operate with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends of up to 50%. The engine has the capability to run on 100% SAF in the future, and Boeing also communicated this intention, making the EP future-proof in an era of sustainability in business. Since the XRB entered the market with the A350 ten years ago, the EP represents the culmination of continued development towards efficiency and cost-effective flight.

Which Routes Will The Enhanced A350 Fly?

As mentioned in a July 28 Simple Flying discussion thread, the use of a new disc alloy has the potential to increase performance across both configurations of the Trent XWB engines, the XWB-84 and XWB-97 being used with the A350-900 and A350-1000, respectively. Thus, the greater efficiency of the engines drew speculation as to which routes it might be possible to fly with the increased range of the longer-range aircraft variant.

Flights to Oceania were predicted to significantly expand in airport pairings from Europe, North America, the Middle East, and Asia, with mentions of departure locations like London, Miami, or Istanbul being paired with destinations such as Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, or Brisbane, which would be great news for the tourism industry in Australia, along with the country's flag carrier, Qantas.

Data from PlaneNerd.

As the circumference of the earth is 40,075 kilometers, according to National Geographic, an aircraft needs to reach a range of over 20,038 kilometers to be able to fly halfway around the world at its widest point, since the earth is not quite a sphere, but fatter around the middle. Thanks to the increase in range, the current A350 variants are already closing in on that figure, as seen in the table above. This means that this engine takes commercial airlines one step closer to being able to fly essentially any airport pairing they want.

The UltraFan Is Set To Outperform The Improved XWB

Despite the improvements to the XWB engine, there is a behemoth of a turbofan looming on the horizon in the form of the UltraFan, which promises to offer a much more significant improvement over other current-generation engines, not only among Rolls-Royce models but across all manufacturers. The UltraFan may be capable of carrying widebody aircraft like the A350 further than the XWB, offering a 25% fuel burn improvement over the Trent 700, a first-generation Trent turbofan, and a 10% efficiency improvement over the XWB.

With a fan diameter of 140 inches, compared to the 118 inches of the XWB, the UltraFan will be the largest commercial turbofans in the world when it arrives on the market. Purely in terms of how much air it can displace, the engine will have a large advantage over current-generation turbofans. According to Rolls-Royce, the UltraFan will also have the advantage of being compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel from day one of service.

While its compressor has been improved, the XWB-84 EP is also likely to have values in the same ballpark as the XWB's 9.6:1 bypass ratio and 50:1 pressure ratio. Compared to the UltraFan, which is slated to have a 15:1 bypass ratio and 70:1 overall pressure ratio, the EP will be outperformed significantly in terms of efficiency. However, the EP will likely beat the UltraFan to market by a few years, with ground tests of the UltraFan 30 and UltraFan 80 narrowbody and widebody variants expected by 2028, and flight tests expected before 2030.

The EP Engine Variant May Mean More A350 Sales

Though the UltraFan is impressive, airlines still need reliable solutions in the meantime, and the new and improved XWB fits the bill for complementing airlines' fleets, saving costs and adding marginally more route flexibility. According to FlightGlobal, airlines have already started taking deliveries of A350 aircraft equipped with the new XWB engine, with Delta Air Lines becoming the first carrier to take delivery of an XWB-84 EP-equipped A350-900 in June.

While Singapore Airlines was previously the only customer to be identified by Rolls-Royce for the new EP, that's not the case anymore. The XWB-97 EP is still undergoing ground testing and is expected to be ready to enter the market in 2028.

Notably, the XWB-97 EP is being tested with a focus on operations in hot and sandy conditions, meaning that Emirates may end up being another customer. As stated in the video above, Emirates' President Tim Clark mentioned that the airline would be interested in purchasing A350-1000 aircraft, but stated that the engines would need improvement. The XWB-97 EP would provide that, adding reliability improvements along with increased efficiency.

A Little Goes A Long Way

Overall, while the efficiency improvements are marginal, 1% can make a big difference to the bottom line. For example, the A350-900 burns through about 6,000 kg of fuel per hour of flight. This means that for a six-hour flight, an A350-900 will use around 36 tons of fuel. A 1% reduction over this distance translates to 360 kg or 450 liters of jet fuel, which costs about $400. Savings would be even greater on longer flights, with an 18-hour flight saving an airline around $1,200 in fuel.

Another attractive aspect of the EP will be its increased reliability, and according to Times Aerospace, Rolls-Royce took steps to extend the lifespan of the engine, and as a result, the EP will require less frequent maintenance operations. Pete Young, chief engineer for the Trent XWB-84 EP, said the following about the project and its imminent full introduction:

“The certification of the Trent XWB-84 EP is the result of a rigorous design and testing programme. It reflects the continuous improvement of the Trent XWB family, ensuring it remains a competitive option for airlines navigating evolving industry challenges. We now look forward to its introduction into service in 2025.”

Overall, the engine will provide a good real-term improvement over previous Rolls-Royce engines, allowing airlines to make steady improvements to their fleet capabilities. While the improvements are marginal, the engine remains one of the most efficient available today.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/map.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 21:56:16.928277

Differences in the announced development of SAF quantities between the SAF Monitor and the SAF Outlook are due to different data cutoffs in June and December 2024, the authors explain.
CENA SAF Outlook 2025-2030 – Quantities, Methods and Markets for Sustainable Aviation Fuels is available free of charge as a PDF (32 pages).","(Berlin, Germany) - There are currently 265 projects and initiatives for the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). A year ago, there were 197. The increase is primarily ""attributable to comprehensive studies of the American and Asian markets, as well as company feedback and announcements in German-speaking countries."" This is according to an updated SAF Monitor, a joint database of the federally owned Now GmbH and the Competence Center for Climate and Noise Protection in Air Transport (CENA Hessen).

According to the study, most SAF production projects and initiatives are located in the USA (58), followed by Germany (31) and the United Kingdom (17). Compared to the previous year, the forecast production volume for 2030 has increased from 30 million to approximately 35 million tons of SAF – a growth primarily attributable to increases in Asia from three million to approximately 8,3 million tons (plus 38 percent) and South America by two million to approximately 2,3 million tons (plus 130 percent). In North America, 16 million tons are expected (plus six percent).

Globally, announced SAF production in 2024 was approximately 2,6 million tons—almost exclusively from biogenic processes. Biogenic production pathways are also expected to account for the majority of global SAF production in 2030, while synthetic processes are expected to contribute slightly less than a quarter of total production.

The forecasts for Europe are striking, predicting a decline of 2030 million to just under eight million tons (minus 1,5 percent) for 27. According to Now GmbH, this is due, among other things, to ""changes in the announcements of major projects in Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany,"" which cannot be offset by new, smaller projects.

EU regulation requires SAF blends

The EU regulation ""ReFuelEU Aviation,"" adopted in Brussels in 2023, requires aviation fuel suppliers to provide minimum proportions of SAF: a blend of two percent is required from 2025, and six percent from 2030. Approximately one million tons will be needed to meet the SAF quota in 2025. According to the Data Monitor, these quantities are ""expected to be achievable with the announced production capacities from projects already under construction or in operation.""

EU airports with a passenger traffic volume of over 800.000 people or a freight traffic volume of over 100.000 tonnes per year must allow refueling with SAFs. Exceptions are made for small, remote airports. ""Ideally, airports should also provide alternative ground power options,"" such as hydrogen, according to a Analysis Now GmbH on the impacts of ReFuelEU.

According to the monitor, 21 percent of the quantities announced for 2030 came from projects already in operation, 16 percent from projects under construction (an increase of four percent). Fifty-five percent of the announced quantities were based on projects in the planning stage, and eight percent on project proposals.

Most advanced-stage projects rely on biogenic processes. However, the EU's sub-quota of 1,2 percent for synthetic fuels is likely a problem. This has not yet been secured by 2030. Targeted political measures are needed to ensure investment in appropriate facilities and the implementation of the planned projects.

CENA Outlook and SAF Monitor

The ""CENA SAF Outlook 2025–2030"" analyzes current global SAF production and future production volumes up to 2030. It examines production processes for biogenic electricity-based fuels, revealing the breakdown of production volumes. The report also analyzes the development status of projects, allowing for a realistic assessment of expected production volumes.

The ""SAF Monitor 2025"" is the interactive data visualization of the CENA Outlook. Differences in the announced development of SAF quantities between the SAF Monitor and the SAF Outlook are due to different data cutoffs in June and December 2024, the authors explain. The data is continuously expanded and updated annually.

The advanced biofuels sector is witnessing a surge in investments, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and venture capital activity, reflecting its growing importance in global decarbonization efforts. As the world seeks sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, particularly for hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and heavy transport, financial flows are increasingly directed towards innovative biofuel technologies and production capacities.

Investment in advanced biofuels is primarily driven by ambitious renewable energy mandates, carbon reduction targets, and the increasing demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Governments worldwide are offering significant incentives, such as tax credits and grant funding, to de-risk projects and attract private capital. This has led to billions of dollars committed to strategic joint ventures, new biorefinery construction, and refinery conversions aimed at producing advanced biofuels. Companies are also investing heavily in securing diversified feedstock supplies, from agricultural residues to waste oils and algae, to ensure consistent production.

While the overall investment landscape is robust, M&A activity in the sector can be dynamic and influenced by policy certainty and market conditions. For instance, in recent years, some segments like ethanol have seen notable M&A volumes, partly driven by export growth and the lucrative potential of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) integration. Conversely, other segments, such as certain types of biodiesel, have experienced distress due to oversupply and low credit prices, leading to consolidation under larger, well-capitalized players. Major oil and gas companies are increasingly acquiring or partnering with biofuel producers to integrate sustainable fuels into their energy portfolios.

Venture capital trends indicate a growing interest in early-stage advanced biofuel technologies, particularly those focused on novel feedstocks, improved conversion efficiencies, and waste-to-fuel solutions. Startups with strong business plans, innovative technologies, and clear pathways to scalability are attracting funding, though securing capital for first-of-a-kind plants remains a challenge. The long-term outlook for investments, M&A, and venture capital in the advanced biofuels sector remains positive, propelled by the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions and evolving policy support.

ASTM International (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials) is a global organization that develops standards for materials, products, systems and services across multiple industries. While the organization has numerous standards related to aviation and aerospace, here are some key sustainability-related standards:

D7566 (Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons

E3027 (Standard Guide for Making Sustainability-Related Chemical Selection Decisions in the Life-Cycle of Products)

E3096 (Standard Guide for Definition, Selection, and Organization of Key Performance Indicators for Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes)

E2986 (Standard Guide for Evaluation of Environmental Aspects of Sustainability of Manufacturing Processes)

E2979 (Standard Classification for Discarded Materials from Manufacturing Facilities and Associated Support Facilities)

E3012 (Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes)

E3200 (Standard Guide for Investment Analysis in Environmentally Sustainable Manufacturing)

E3461 (Standard Guide for Principles of Circular Product Design)

F2931 (Standard Guide for Analytical Testing of Substances of Very High Concern in Materials and Products)

ASTM also has numerous standards not directly related to sustainability, but related to advanced aerospace materials such as polymer composites, aluminum alloys and titanium alloys. For example, D3039/D3039M-17 (Tensile Properties of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials) is one of several standards related to composite materials.

EASA

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) works with the European Commission to implement ICAO standards into EU legislation. The EASA has published numerous regulations related to environmental and sustainability issues, such as Article 9 and Article 19 of the Basic Regulation, Annex II (Part-21) of the Implementing Regulation, and the Certification Specifications of CS-34 (emissions), CS-36 (noise) and CS-CO2 (CO2 Emissions). EASA launched its Sustainable Aviation Programme in 2020 in coordination with environmental protection regulations (EU2018/1139, Art. 87) and the European Green Deal. A subsequent EU regulation commonly known as the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation was published as part of a legislative package aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.

GRI

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) develops standards for organizations to report on their environmental and social impacts. The GRI Standards are subdivided into three categories:

Universal Standards — Reporting on human rights and environmental due diligence, in line with intergovernmental expectations, applicable to all organizations

Sector Standards — Reporting on sector-specific impacts, with aerospace and defense one of 40 sectors

Topic Standards — Disclosures relevant to a particular topic

IATA

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and its members committed to a target of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. As part of that initiative, IATA released the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, which aids SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers. The IATA’s Airline Sustainability Reporting Handbook (ASRH) provides guidance on GRI-based reporting, subdivided into eight topics:

Conduct and compliance

Customer experience

Energy and emissions

Labor conditions

Noise

People and development

Supply chain sustainability

Waste and effluents

ICAO

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) develops international standards for aircraft noise, emissions, and fuel venting. For example, the ICAO adopted a CO2 emissions certification standard: Annex 16, Volume III – Aeroplane CO2 Standard (2017) that applies to subsonic jet and turboprop airplanes that are new type designs from 2020. It also applies to in-production airplanes from 2023 that are modified and meet a specific change criteria. This is followed by a production cut-off in 2028, which means airplanes that do not meet the standard can no longer be produced beyond 2028 unless the designs are modified to comply with the standard.

ISO

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a global organization that publishes a wide variety of standards on products and processes. It publishes standards on quality, environmental management and industry-related topics, including the following related to aerospace and other industries:

ISO 9001 (Quality management systems)

ISO 14001 (Environmental management systems)

ISO 15388 (Space systems — Contamination and cleanliness control)

ISO 23312 (Space systems — Detailed space debris mitigation requirements for spacecraft)

ISO 24113 (Space systems — Space debris mitigation requirements)

NATA

The National Air Transportation Association (NATA) developed its Sustainability Standard for Aviation Businesses, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices. The NATA initiative was created to provide fixed base operators (FBOs) and other aviation businesses a self-certification process for pursuing flexible, cost-effective options to lower their carbon footprint by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increasing use of more environmentally friendly energy sources, reducing waste and encouraging sustainability operation-wide.

SASB and IFRS

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) developed standards for disclosing environmental, social and governance information for 77 industries, including aerospace and defense, air freight and logistics and airlines. The standards offer metrics for comparing performance across organizations, identifying sustainability disclosure topics relevant to each industry. The SASB Standards are maintained by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), following the SASB’s merger with the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and subsequent consolidation into the IFRS Foundation.

SAE

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) is a global association of engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive and commercial-vehicle industries. It publishes numerous standards, including Aerospace Material Specifications (AMS), which are specifically related to aerospace and defense. A small sampling of aerospace-related standards include:

AS9100D (Quality Management Systems – Requirements for Aviation, Space, and Defense Organizations) includes ISO 9001 quality management system requirements and specifies additional aviation, space and defense industry requirements, definitions and notes.

AMS1428M (Fluid, Aircraft Deicing/Anti-Icing, Non-Newtonian (Pseudoplastic), SAE Types II, III, and IV)

AMS3143D (Powder Coating Material)

AIR4766/2A (Airborne Chemicals in Aircraft Cabins)

In 2022, SAE and the International Aviation Waste Management Association (IAWMA) formed a joint committee, G-36 Sustainable Waste Management, to develop standards and best practices for products, processes and services in global commercial and business aviation, airports and flight kitchens. SAE also publishes a wide variety of standards related to aerospace and aviation, but not directly related to sustainability, such as DO-178, DO-278, and DO-330, which focus on the development and certification of software for safety-critical aviation systems.

Other initiatives

In addition to numerous regulations and standards, other organizations have launched initiatives and provided guidelines related to sustainability.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), along with aircraft manufacturers and airlines, developed the Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) Program, which provides funding to develop and accelerate the introduction of technologies that will reduce noise, emissions, and fuel burn. FAA has also launched initiatives related to sustainable airports.

The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS) developed 21 guidelines for the long-term sustainability of outer space activities (LTS), which were subsequently endorsed by General Assembly resolution 74/82. The Committee established a new LTS 2.0 working group and five-year workplan in 2022 for continued institutionalized dialogue on issues related to the implementation and review of LTS guidelines.

Professional associations, such as the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), American Society of Civil Engineers (ASME), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and Society of Military Engineers (SAME), have launched initiatives and published guidance documents related to sustainability.

The wide range of organizations involved in sustainability creates numerous standards, regulations and guidelines, many of which undergo ongoing reviews and changes. It is the responsibility of aerospace industry professionals to stay updated with ongoing developments and how those developments might affect current and future practices.",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Sustainability-in-aerospace_AdobeStock_1414766821.jpeg,N,,2025-08-07 17:56:32.693319
,,2025-08-07 21:23:49+00:00,POLITICO,Trump's trade deal is killing a British industry - Politico.eu,Caroline Hug,,,,,https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-trade-deal-us-uk-wheat-farming-ethanol-market/,"SALTEND, England — Jordan Spamer and Stacey Monkman live five minutes from the Vivergo Fuels bioethanol plant in Saltend, an estuary town on Yorkshire’s Humber river.
Vivergo’s plant is now at risk of closure due to the U.K.-U.S. trade deal, which allows 1.4 billion liters of tariff-free American ethanol into the British market.
It’s a volume Vivergo’s managing director Ben Hackett says is equivalent to the entire U.K. bioethanol market.
“This place can take a million tonnes of U.K. wheat each year,” said Jamie Burrows, National Farmers’ Union Crops Board Chair and a farmer in Norfolk.
Hackett describes the situation as “at a T-Junction.” “You go one way, and it’s redundancies, it’s decline, it’s stagnation,” he said.","SALTEND, England — Jordan Spamer and Stacey Monkman live five minutes from the Vivergo Fuels bioethanol plant in Saltend, an estuary town on Yorkshire’s Humber river.

For the past four years, they’ve worked in the firm’s logistics team — tucked away, as they put it, in “a little cabin” on site, “just getting really excited about trucks.”

Normally, the team sees up to 140 lorries a day moving wheat and fuel in and out of the site. But last Friday, the final wheat delivery came and went.

Vivergo’s plant is now at risk of closure due to the U.K.-U.S. trade deal, which allows 1.4 billion liters of tariff-free American ethanol into the British market. It’s a volume Vivergo’s managing director Ben Hackett says is equivalent to the entire U.K. bioethanol market.

Unless ministers intervene, 160 staff at Vivergo — one of only two major bioethanol producers in the U.K. — will lose their jobs from Aug. 18. Thousands more in farming and haulage will also feel the impact.

The general sentiment towards government at Vivergo has been described by its people director Kirsty Hussey as “disappointment, in the sense that [the industry] was overlooked, it wasn’t understood.”

Workers who’d been offered “good salaries” and “the opportunities to learn and grow” are now “concerned about their ability to feed their families,” said Hussey.

Red Wall cracks

The Saltend chemical park is a 10-minute drive from Hull, a once Labour stronghold undergoing political upheaval.

The area has seen rising support for Reform UK, with Luke Campbell, an Olympic boxing gold medalist, sweeping into office as mayor with nearly 50,000 votes in May. His face is now on a mural at his city-center gym, established in 2021, and a gold-painted postbox and phone kiosk celebrates his 2012 victory.

Campbell said that rather than advocating for a bailout, he “would change the clause in Labour’s U.S.-U.K. trade deal, which allows cheap bioethanol fuel to flood into Britain.” The Vivergo site “doesn’t need government subsidy; it’s a profitable business that supports thousands of jobs in the region,” he added.

He described what is happening in Hull as “a political revolution, as people reject the decline of the last 30 years caused by establishment politicians.”

Multiple industries hit

Britain’s bioethanol industry is tied to multiple other industries in the region. It buys wheat from more than 12,000 British farmers, which is carried by lorries, and used to produce fuel for vehicles and high-protein animal feed.

“This place can take a million tonnes of U.K. wheat each year,” said Jamie Burrows, National Farmers’ Union Crops Board Chair and a farmer in Norfolk.

“If you take that demand away, [wheat would] probably be between 15 and 20 pounds a tonne less,” he added. Farmers in the region — still furious about Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ changes to inheritance tax and national insurance — would be forced to export more, facing weaker prices on the European market.

Haulage firms are also affected. Mike Green, who runs Aghaul Limited in North Lincolnshire, said business is already slowing.

“This facility would take grain all year round,” he said. “The plant can process about 1.1 million tonnes a year, and we get heavily involved in that movement, so the impact of that closure is going to be quite widespread. I’m going to have to start potentially looking to diversify the business, there might be possible redundancies.”

Vivergo’s closure would be the latest in a line of potential industry shutdowns within driving distance of the plant. Forty-five minutes away just on the other side of the river, Lindsey Oil Refinery near Immingham has halted production, threatening 420 jobs. Roughly an hour in the other direction, British Steel in Scunthorpe narrowly avoided collapse in April after emergency government intervention.

“This is a fantastic facility supporting a huge portion of U.K. agriculture,” said Green. “There’s a lot of downbeat people. I [have] a tear in my eye that it’s another part of the job that’s going and could go forever.”

Green said he didn’t vote in the most recent elections and describes the area in the region as having a “distrust in politics at the moment, particularly with the Labour government.”

What comes next?

Vivergo Managing Director Ben Hackett said the company is still in discussions with the government, which has appointed Teneo as a strategic adviser on the case.

The firm has requested temporary financial support to offset the impact of the U.S. trade deal and an improved regulatory framework that supports the domestic bioethanol industry.

Hackett describes the situation as “at a T-Junction.” “You go one way, and it’s redundancies, it’s decline, it’s stagnation,” he said. “You go the other way and it’s growth, it’s investment, it’s jobs, it’s prosperity.”

A British government spokesperson said: “We recognise this is a concerning time for workers and their families which is why we entered into negotiations with the company on potential financial support last month.”

They added: “We will continue to take proactive steps to address the long-standing challenges the company faces and remain committed to working closely with them throughout this period to present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods.”

‘I watched it get built’

The company was also expecting a £1.25 billion investment from Meld Energy, to supply feedstock for a new sustainable aviation fuel plant at Saltend, which is now on hold until the government makes the decision.

Dean Brown, who supervises plant operations at Vivergo, has worked there for 15 years, having joined when he was 25 years old as a technician.

“Before coming to Vivergo, I watched it get built,” he said. “I actually pestered the production manager for a good year as they were building the plant, to let me know when this job’s coming up. I want to be part of this, I want to be part of the greener energy and bioethanol future.”

He described the job as “life changing” for him and his family, including his two teenage daughters. He pointed to his computer screen, showing a picture of his daughters catching a giant fish in a Thai river. He said that would have never happened without the job.

Production manager Nick Smalley commutes an hour and a half to work every day “because he loves it so much.”

“I’m a father, I’m a son, a husband, I have a family that depend on me,” he said. “For me to think about losing my job, it’s really hard to swallow.”

Smalley said the government made an “off the cuff decision” with the U.S. — speaking personally, he finds it “hard to trust politicians, given recent events.”

“But we have to trust people and hope they understand our plight, and the benefit we bring to the U.K. economy,” he said. “We’re here to fight to the bitter end — everybody here will do whatever it takes to make this business successful.”","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/05/10543965-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-08-07 19:56:35.998387

“Denver leads with bold ideas, and our vision for the future of our airport is no exception,” said Denver Mayor Mike Johnston. “As we work to make DEN the greenest airport in the world, we must explore every innovative solution available to meet the demands of a growing city and a changing climate.

“Studying the potential of small modular nuclear reactors is a forward-looking step in understanding how we can deliver reliable, clean energy at scale. This is about thoughtful planning, long-term sustainability and our commitment to a healthier planet for generations to come.”

The feasibility study will attempt to answer several critical questions, including whether an SMR solution viable for DEN to meet its long-term electrical and energy needs. According to the airport, it will handle 120 million passengers every year by 2045 and will need to a sustainable power supply to meet the demands of this.

“DEN has already invested in renewable energy sources, including building solar arrays across 100 acres of DEN land; constructing the state’s largest energy performance contract that is saving electricity, natural gas and water; increasing our electric vehicle fleet; achieving LEED Gold and Platinum certification for new construction projects, and more. But we must plan now and explore all possible options so that we are prepared for the future,” said DEN CEO Phil Washington.

“We recognize that the technology is still relatively new and there is much to learn, which is why DEN will conduct a feasibility study to gather facts and information about whether SMRs could potentially help the airport meet its energy demand and clean energy goals in the future, as well as potential challenges.

“We know that anything we would do would require significant investment and that SMRs are complex. So, we are keeping an open mind, learning more and continuing to responsibly plan for the airport’s future.”",https://www.passengerterminaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Denver-launches-biometric-boarding-for-international-departures-e1754576789260.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 18:56:14.815014

Due to the increasing trend of green house gases (GHGs) after burning of fossil fuels, the global climate change impacts are affecting the environment, ecology, flora and fauna. The fossil fuels in the transportation, thermal power generation and other man-made activities create carbon footprints, and the built — environment becomes carbonised. There has been huge challenges in the environment, such as air and water pollution, waste disposal, electricity generation with carbon emissions. To address these challenges, Government of India have taken some key initiatives like bio-fuel policy, green hydrogen mission, net zero emission by 2030, 500 GW power generation from renewable energy by 2030. The Hon’ble Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas during India Energy Week held in February 2025 at New Delhi stated that there has been a link between economic activity and energy use and there will be requirement of more energy as time passes from $4 trillion to $10 trillion economy and beyond. India is moving ahead on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It is preparing the ground for biofuels to be integrated into its supply chain. India has set a target of 5 per cent blending in SAF mandatory by 2030 and there is an opportunity for the export of the fuel of the future. India is also striving to increase the share of gas in the economy to 15 per cent from six per cent. Apart from this, India has also set a target of production of five million metric tons of green hydrogen annually.

Sustainable Biofuel Opportunity For India’s Energy Transition

As India has entered into the transitions towards a cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions, the role of biofuels has emerged as a critical component in reducing carbon emissions and mitigating threat of energy security. Its adoption of biofuels in the energy mix across the globe has been muted as it still faces scrutiny regarding food security, higher costs, and deforestation.

The Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) roundtable at India Energy Week 2025 brought together policymakers, industry leaders and international organisations to address the pressing need for harmonised sustainability criteria for biofuels.

The leaders called for collaborative action to develop transparent, inclusive, and adaptable sustainability frameworks, which would enable sustainable biofuels’ broader adoption and long-term success.

The industry’s huge potential, including its ability to decarbonise and deliver one-third of today’s natural gas consumption and reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 11 per cent has also been considered as one of the positive steps towards net zero emissions drive by 2030. Charlotte Morton Chief Executive of the World Biogas Association, however, has said that there are many challenges due to the lack of acceptability and acknowledgement of biofuels and various discouraging statements about bioenergy.

The biofuels industry is seeking the rightful place in the global energy dialogue. They are critical to decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors like transportation, aviation, shipping, and heavy industries.

Roberto Bocca, Head, Centre for Energy and Materials, and Member of the Executive Committee at World Economic Forum said that the future of bioenergy systems is more complex because they bring more opportunities. More opportunities mean more complexities, meaning infrastructure investment will depend on clarity.

“So, it is critical that we understand the direction, size, volume, and not just the taxonomy but also the potential of these different solutions. This will mean the investments can flow more confidently,” said Bocca.

Over a year after the inception of GBA, led by the US, Brazil, and India, the alliance has expanded to include 28 countries and 12 organisations, including the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the International Energy Agency. It is playing a pivotal role in increasing the adoption of sustainable biofuels on the global stage. The joint collaborative efforts by the industry and academia on sustainable biofuels emphasised a shared commitment to accelerating biofuel development, adoption, and integration into the global energy mix, emphasising international cooperation, policy support, and technological advancements.

The Policymakers also explored the potential of non-food feedstocks in advancing India’s biofuels sector, key opportunities, challenges, and policy considerations for scaling sustainable biofuels and strengthening energy security.

Biofuel for Sustainability

Using agriculture residue for ethanol and SAF production also addresses the problem of stubble burning and allows farmers to generate additional income from waste. It is just one of the agricultural residues (including maize, sugar, used cooking oil, besides municipal waste) that can be supplied as sustainable fuels to the industry. Alternate feedstock, such as sweet sorghum, seaweed, and reusable plastic waste, can give further impetus to SAF’s potential in the country.

As the world shifts to optimal use of all resources, municipal solid waste could be a key input for SAF. Its potential could further increase with higher solid waste generation, better segregation capabilities, and higher diversion of SAF production. Using agriculture residue for SAF production also addresses the problem of stubble burning and enables farmers to generate additional income from waste.

According to initial industry estimates, by 2040, India will have the opportunity to produce 8-10 million tonnes of SAF against the potential demand of around 4.5 million. By then, the SAF blending rate is seen at 15 percent. An estimated 230 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue are unused and could also be used for the 2G ethanol plants being set up by the oil marketing companies.

SAF production in 2024 was around 1 million tonnes. According to IATA, SAF demand is expected to hit 50 million tonnes by 2050. With the right regulation, technologies, demand from consumers, and feedstock for production, could help create a new industry.

Vision 2040 for India’s aviation sector has estimated passenger traffic at 1.1 billion and freight traffic at 1.7 million tonnes. India currently accounts for a little over two percent of the global ATF demand. Given India’s abundant feedstock for SAF and high exposure to exports for ATF (50 percent of ATF produced being exported), India is well-positioned to capitalise on the rising global demand for SAF.

2G Ethanol Plants For Biofuel Production

2G ethanol plant produces ethanol using non-food biomass like agriculture waste, such as rice straw or sugarcane bagasse in place of food crops like corn or sugarcane. 2G ethanol plants are designed to utilise technologies like pre-treatment, hydrolysis and co-fermentation to convert biomass into ethanol, biogas and even bio-CNG. The production process involves pre-treatment to break down biomass, hydrolysis to convert complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars and fermentation to produce ethanol.

Benefits Of 2G Plants

2G ethanol production reduces the dependence on food stocks for biofuel production. It utilises wastes from agriculture resources and contribute to a sustainable and circular economy principles. Government of India has been promoting 2G ethanol through the schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Jivan Yojana offering financial support and incentives to the prospective industry.

Conclusion

Using biofuel like bioethanol and biodiesel as renewable energy can help reducing green house gas emissions and achieve climate targets by 2050, However, the challenges to create infrastructure for harnessing renewable energy sources need to be addressed by the policy makers. Biofuels can reduce dependence on fossil fuels particularly in transport sector.

Founded in 1974 in Switzerland, Cotecna is a leading provider of testing, inspection and certification services. Cotecna Inspection India Pvt Ltd is part of that group. India plans to mandate blending of SAF with conventional ATF to reduce carbon emissions from the aviation sector. The plan is to consider an initial SAF blending target of 1% for all international flights by 2027 and increasing that to 2% in the next year or so. Subsequently, blending may be managed for domestic flights. SAF is not yet permitted for commercial flights in India. SpiceJet had conducted India's first biojet fuel flight, using a blend of 75% regular ATF and 25% biofuel in Aug 2018. The flight, a test run, was operated on a Bombardier Q400 aircraft from Dehradun to Delhi. This biofuel was developed by the Indian Institute of Petroleum in Dehradun, using jatropha as a feedstock. Subsequently, IndiGo conducted demonstration flights using SAF blended with regular ATF when in Feb 2022 it operated its first international ferry flight with a 10% SAF blend from Toulouse to Delhi. Airlines globally and in India have done test flights with blended ATF. However, the biggest challenge everywhere is the availability of SAF in required volumes.

However, EPA has released a proposal to void it’s 2009 endangerment finding that declares GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide, no longer be a threat to the environment.
EPA’s proposal to reverse the Endangerment Finding returns the Clean Air Act to its original purpose, overturning the previous administration’s attempt at climate control via regulation.
Is Voiding the Endangerment Finding a Danger to the Biofuels Industry?
I could be surprised, but I don’t personally anticipate that happening with or without this finding,” Shaw says.","For years, efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from fossil fuels has helped support the growth of the biofuels industry. However, EPA has released a proposal to void it’s 2009 endangerment finding that declares GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide, no longer be a threat to the environment.

EPA’s proposal to reverse the Endangerment Finding returns the Clean Air Act to its original purpose, overturning the previous administration’s attempt at climate control via regulation. Under the Trump administration, the move signals EPA is going to de-emphasize carbon in energy and environmental policies.

Is Voiding the Endangerment Finding a Danger to the Biofuels Industry?

Jordan Fife, president of trading, BioUrja says depending on what the final proposal looks like it could be a game changer.

“If you were to classify carbon as a non-greenhouse gas, and therefore, you would not be able to sequester it and monetize it. So it would be a very big deal.”

Fife says it could also negatively impact carbon pipelines and the carbon markets tied to biofuels.

“It’s not just the pipeline — it’s the actual downstream sequestration. You look at One Earth Energy that’s in Gibson City, Ill., or Indicator, Ill., where ADM is the largest sequester of carbon currently in the country. All of that becomes pretty null and void if carbon is no longer classified as a greenhouse gas,” Fife explains.

Senator Marshall highlighted four pillars of the legislation including increased efficiency in agriculture; healthier, more nutrient-rich food; affordable access to primary care healthcare; and addressing mental health challenges among young people.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, agrees the ruling could mean farmers will have a harder time getting paid for carbon reducing practices as part of 45Z.

“I don’t think you’re going to see voluntary actions by the EPA, by the USDA that are tied to carbon metrics for farming. I could be surprised, but I don’t personally anticipate that happening with or without this finding,” Shaw says.

In fact, he stresses there was no assurance of a payment for farmers for carbon sequestration under 45Z.

“The 45Z calculation today, under the current guidance, does not include a way for the farm practices to be accounted for,” he says.

What is the Potential Impact on Biofuels Policy?

However, when it comes to biofuels policy itself, Shaw says 45Z and the Renewable Fuels Standard will see little to no impact: “The first thing people need to know is it doesn’t affect those at all. Those are laws passed by Congress. The RFS was passed by Congress. 45Z was recently passed by Congress. Those are not EPA regulations that are dependent upon this finding. To change 45Z or to change the RFS, you would actually have to change the law.”

Shaw says EPA’s proposal does send a chilling signal to the marketplace but it won’t halt the Sustainable Aviation Fuel market.

States such as California with their Low Carbon Fuel Standard will also be exempt from this finding.

“We have states that are requiring certain things, both on the transportation side, vehicles, as well as increasingly on airlines as well,” Shaw says. “We have huge markets for ultra low -carbon ethanol both domestically and internationally that are not tied to EPA regulations.”

SAF ambitions at risk Market experts said the SAF mandate is not just about environmental targets, it is increasingly linked to industrial policy and energy security.
The closure of domestic ethanol plants could also jeopardise future SAF projects, such as the GBP1.25 billion Meld Energy SAF plant planned for Saltend Chemical Park, adjacent to Vivergo’s facility.","The Renewable Transport Fuel Association has urged the UK government to urgently amend its sustainable aviation fuel mandate to allow British-made crop-based bioethanol to qualify for use, warning that failure to act could deal a fatal blow to the country’s domestic bioethanol industry.

In a statement issued on Aug. 4, the RTFA said UK-produced ethanol — now displaced from the road fuel market due to a new trade deal with the US — should be permitted for use in SAF production via the alcohol-to-jet pathway, as part of the existing cap on SAF made using hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids.

“Crop-based ethanol should become eligible for the SAF mandate when it is no longer required for decarbonising road transport. We are now in this situation,” RTFA Chief Executive Gaynor Hartnell said. “We’re calling for the mandate to be amended to allow either HEFA or UK crop-based AtJ SAF to meet the HEFA cap.”

Trade deal undermines ethanol sector

The call comes in the wake of the UK-US trade agreement, which came into effect on June 30 and includes a duty-free quota for 1.4 billion liters of US ethanol roughly equal to the UK’s entire domestic market.

As a result, UK producers such as Ensus and Vivergo Fuels are facing severe losses and potential closures.

Both companies have been sounding the alarm for months, warning that the tariff-free access granted to US ethanol has rendered British production economically unviable.

Vivergo’s 420 million liter-per-year plant in Hull has already received its final wheat delivery, with plans to shut down operations by Sept. 13 if no government support materializes.

Mandate fit for the moment?

The UK introduced a 2% SAF mandate this year, with a cap on SAF derived from HEFA mainly made from waste fats and oils, intended to drive investment into alternative production pathways due to global feedstock limitations.

The RTFA argued that domestic ethanol should be recognized as one such alternative.

A 2021 government strategy paper hinted at this direction, stating that a decline in road fuel demand would free up feedstocks like ethanol for aviation fuel production — a shift the RTFA now says must be codified in policy.

“This presents us, and UK industry, an opportunity to push forward the transition of feedstocks currently used for road fuel to other sectors,” the document said.

Industry on the brink

The UK’s two major ethanol producers are both under intense pressure.

Vivergo Fuels, owned by AB Foods, has set a closure deadline of mid-September, citing losses of $3 million per month and a lack of feedstock purchases since June.

Ensus, owned by CropEnergies, is also considering closure and has been up for sale since December 2024 after reporting a GBP19.86 million loss in 2024.

Both companies have engaged in ongoing crisis talks with the UK government, requesting GBP150 million in short-term aid and policy changes, including SAF mandate reform to salvage their operations.

The looming closures threaten more than just ethanol output.

Both plants are key suppliers of byproducts such as animal feed and CO2, the latter of which has faced nationwide shortages in recent years. The knock-on effects could ripple across the UK food, agriculture, and industrial sectors.

SAF ambitions at risk

Market experts said the SAF mandate is not just about environmental targets, it is increasingly linked to industrial policy and energy security.

The closure of domestic ethanol plants could also jeopardise future SAF projects, such as the GBP1.25 billion Meld Energy SAF plant planned for Saltend Chemical Park, adjacent to Vivergo’s facility.

Meanwhile, international projects are progressing. US-based LanzaJet, which recently launched the world’s first commercial-scale AtJ SAF plant, has received planning approval for a 100 million liter/year facility in Wales, although that project has yet to reach a final investment decision.",,N,,2025-08-07 14:57:02.222743

""These technologies still have high production costs, and at a time when the market is still demand-driven,"" the NextChem director explains.
Through this mechanism, biogenic CO2, which is neutral from an environmental perspective, will become a real exchange product to compensate for fossil-origin carbon.","This article is also available in Italian / Questo articolo è disponibile anche in italiano

Based on the forecasts of aeroplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing, passenger air traffic in Europe's skies is set to grow dramatically, doubling by 2050 compared to 2019 levels, with a 59% increase in fuel consumption. This growth is certainly not aligned with decarbonisation targets if kerosene is still used to fuel aircraft. Thus, while there must be a reduction in unnecessary flights (business meetings, flying visits), it will also be vital to replace fossil fuels as quickly as possible with SAF, or Sustainable Aviation Fuels, which have a reduced carbon footprint.

To this end, Europe is requiring airlines operating across the continent to use at least 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050. This is an ambitious target, given the current levels of SAF supply, which are decidedly lacking. Furthermore, demand for these fuels is also on the rise in the USA, India, Japan, and Singapore.

The production of SAF

SAF derives from various production processes, such as the hydrotreatment of waste oils and fats, the gasification of waste, and ethanol conversion. The first type is currently the most widespread in terms of production in Europe.

""HEFA, a technology that generates a biochemical-based kerosene-like product by hydrogenating biogenic waste, is currently the most cost-effective solution and is set to dominate SAF markets until at least 2030,"" says Marco Bonvini, Licensing & Business Development Director at NextChem Tech SpA (Maire Group), one of the main developers of SAF production technology globally. ""This technology mostly involves the use of waste oils collected from restaurants and food processing plants, animal fat (from slaughtering waste or fishery processing, editor’s note), and brown grease, recovered from cleaning processes via grease traps.""

Some systems also use POME (palm oil mill effluent), an oily substance generated during food-grade palm oil processing that is recovered, treated, and processed. In the coming years, considerable growth is also forecast for SAF derived from gasification (syngas products that fuel a Fischer Tropsch reactor) and the conversion of ethanol and methanol (AtJ, Alcohol to Jet), which currently involve average production costs that are 1.6 and 2 times higher, respectively, than the HEFA process.

Also E-jets, synthetic fuels made using water to produce hydrogen with renewable energy and CO2 captured from industrial plants (currently costing up to 4 times as much as HEFA) will, in the future, see significant growth, rapidly achieving technological maturity and thus a considerable reduction of production costs.

A complex market

However, the SAF market remains highly complex. ""These technologies still have high production costs, and at a time when the market is still demand-driven,"" the NextChem director explains. ""Today, businesses' obligations and commitments require greater amounts of SAF than what is available, which can lead to a not insignificant speculative effect. A further complication arises from Emission Trading Systems (ETS), certifications linked to atmospheric CO2 emissions. Through this mechanism, biogenic CO2, which is neutral from an environmental perspective, will become a real exchange product to compensate for fossil-origin carbon. This will benefit systems with biogenic feedstocks such as HEFA or AtJ, which will be able to take advantage of selling their biogenic CO2 and reduce the cost of producing SAF. At the same time, the ETS will impact the cost of E-jet fuels, which will need to purchase, at least in part, biogenic CO2 to use as feedstock”.

For SAF producers, the primary strategy to reduce costs will be to optimise productivity in their plants and secure their supply of feedstock—whether that be oil and fat, waste, alcohol, renewable energy, or CO2.

""The key strategy is to have a lot of facilities, small in size but well distributed, to make the most of local feedstock, diversified based on the availability of the base product and the legislation,"" says Bonvini. ""Therefore, in the United States, raw materials such as corn can be used to manufacture AtJ, while in Europe, we will focus on waste.""

From a market perspective, green flight tariffs should be promoted, as Lufthansa is already doing, to cover the costs of SAF, offering a decarbonisation strategy for businesses and more conscious consumers. According to the IATA (International Air Transport Association), it is now necessary to accelerate subsidies and the creation of new production plants (up to 6,500 are needed), with investments amounting to at least 125 billion euros per year, if we truly want to decarbonise the aviation sector.

The report claims PEMEX remains on track to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.","PEMEX has released its Sustainability Report 2024, headlined by a 5.5% reduction in direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. According to the report, emissions dropped to 57.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMt CO₂e), driven by increased gas use in exploration, production, and processing, along with the integration of energy efficiency projects across its operations.

Indirect (Scope 2) emissions—those from electricity and steam purchased from third parties—rose slightly, from 1.98 MMt CO₂e in 2023 to 2.17 MMt CO₂e in 2024. While indirect (Scope 3) emissions from domestic sales of petroleum products, natural gas, and LPG increased by 9.87 MMt CO₂e, this was offset by a 33.47 MMt CO₂e drop in Scope 3 emissions related to crude oil exports.

Methane emissions fell 12.4% compared to 2023. PEMEX reiterated its target of reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, relative to 2020 levels.

The report claims PEMEX remains on track to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. However, a 2024 investigation by Mexico Evalúa found the company invests just 4.3% of its annual revenue in sustainability—well below what is required to meet its goals. The watchdog also noted PEMEX projects stable oil production until at least 2030 and has not embraced clean energy integration.

Still, some ESG investors, including those aligned with Climate Action 100+ (CA100+), responded positively to recent initiatives. These include the formation of an internal Sustainability Committee in 2023 and the company’s first-ever Sustainability Plan in 2024. CA100+ also highlighted PEMEX’s methane reduction and routine gas flaring elimination targets (both by 2030) as encouraging steps.

Mexico Evalúa attributed these moves largely to regulatory pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which requires bond-issuing companies like PEMEX to disclose their climate impacts and outline mitigation strategies.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-08/pexels-uraw-12281226%20%281%29.jpg?h=b2df51be&itok=_WK8Lpra,N,,2025-08-07 18:56:30.125946

This is the largest purchase of sustainable jet fuel in Asia by volume so far.
The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption.
For instance, apart from having a lower carbon footprint, sustainable aviation fuel has been shown to produce less soot than conventional jet fuel.
Neste’s refinery in Tuas can produce up to a million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel, making it the largest of its kind in the world.","SINGAPORE – Consumers will need to accept that there is an added cost to flying greener, as the price of less polluting jet fuel made from waste materials, such as used cooking oil, will not fall to that of regular fossil fuel any time soon.

But if investments in sustainable aviation fuel are not made today, there could be more to pay later as the planet warms.

DHL Express Singapore managing director Christopher Ong made this point during a media visit on Aug 7 to the parcel delivery giant’s facility in Changi Airfreight Centre which was jointly hosted by Finnish renewable fuel producer Neste.

The two companies inked a deal in July for DHL Express to use sustainable aviation fuel made in Neste’s refinery in Singapore on cargo flights out of Changi Airport until June 2026.

Similar moves have been made by carriers like Singapore Airlines Group and Dubai-based Emirates previously, but on a smaller scale.

In total, 7,400 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel, or around 9.5 million litres, will be supplied to DHL Express, accounting for 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the total fuel used by its fleet of five Boeing 777 freighters here.

This is the largest purchase of sustainable jet fuel in Asia by volume so far.

Mr Ong said sustainable fuels are a key lever to reduce DHL Express’ emissions, 90 per cent of which come from its aviation activities.

He believes that the price premium for greener fuels will narrow over time as production grows, but he said there are no estimates today that suggest that sustainable fuel will ever get to the same price as regular jet fuel.

“I think it is a future we need to accept – that this will be more expensive,” he said.

The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption.

Because of limited availability and the high cost of production, such fuels are two to three times the price of normal jet fuel today.

Neste’s Asia-Pacific head of public and regulatory affairs, Mr Steven Bartholomeusz, said sustainable fuels have environmental attributes that fossil fuels do not.

For instance, apart from having a lower carbon footprint, sustainable aviation fuel has been shown to produce less soot than conventional jet fuel.

In the past couple of years, Neste has faced a more challenging market amid weak demand and increased production capacity from other firms.

This has pushed the price of renewable fuels down and raised demand for the raw materials needed to produce such fuels, squeezing earnings.

Mr Bartholomeusz called for more “demand certainty”, noting the €1.6 billion (S$2.4 billion) Neste invested into expanding its Singapore facility.

“You can’t make that kind of investment purely on the basis that you will have a company like DHL come along and (voluntarily) take our volume,” he added.

Neste’s refinery in Tuas can produce up to a million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel, making it the largest of its kind in the world.

But this capacity has not been fully utilised. In the first half of 2025, Neste produced 497,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel across all of its refineries globally.

Things are set to change in Singapore in 2026, when all flights departing the city-state

must

use sustainable jet fuel

, with an initial national target of 1 per cent use.

Passengers will be charged a levy, which will be used by the Government to buy the fuel needed to meet this target.

Early government estimates suggest that economy-class passengers may have to pay $3 more for short-haul flights, $6 more for medium-haul flights, and $16 more for long-haul flights.

Mr Bartholomeusz said the reality is that the world needs more sustainable fuel manufacturing to reach its 2050 net-zero emissions goal, and policies like Singapore’s 1 per cent target help drive the industry forward.

In response to earlier queries, CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng told The Straits Times that the authority is developing the legislative framework and operational details for the levy, in consultation with the industry.

Asked if Neste plans to expand into other locations in South-east Asia, Mr Bartholomeusz said the company has no such investment plans for now.

Despite challenges such as supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, the company reported a 50% increase in operating profits and a free cash flow of £1.6bn (US$2.13bn).

This financial success is driven by a focused approach on enhancing manufacturing efficiency through low-carbon technologies and long-term resilience strategies.

Expanding Low-carbon manufacturing initiatives

Central to RR's manufacturing evolution is its role as a key player in the UK's Great British Energy – Nuclear programme, where its Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology stands out.

This manufacturing venture, slated to initiate positive cash flow by late 2025, aims for full profitability by 2030.

The project not only boosts local manufacturing in the UK but also signifies potential manufacturing expansion in Europe, supported by strategic Czech utility operator ČEZ Group's investment.

Global interest, such as from Sweden’s Vattenfall, further underscores the potential for clean, modular nuclear power production to aid decarbonisation and grid stability.

Strategic objectives and sustainable manufacturing

Rolls-Royce's efforts to align its manufacturing processes with sustainability goals have also led to substantial achievements.

The company has reduced energy use in operations and facilities by 50%, normalised by revenue and is progressing towards a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and solid and liquid waste.

These efforts reflect its commitment to creating a sustainable future through manufacturing excellence and reducing operational expenses.

Further advancements in RR's sustainable aviation efforts have culminated in testing and validating the use of 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in all civil aero engine types.

Revenue was down 3% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025 at $189.6 million.

The company reduced net loss by 15% to $82.3 million compared to Q2 last year.

Adjusted EBITDA loss was reduced by 22% to 29.0 million compared to a year ago.

Gross bookings, a non-GAAP measurement where Wheels Up attributes the gross revenue of off-fleet charter revenue, were essentially flat at $262 million, down $2 million year-over-year.

Adjusted Contribution Margin showed a 12.2% improvement.

Wheels Up ended the quarter with “over $200 million in liquidity, consisting of $107 million of cash and cash equivalents and our $100 million undrawn revolving credit facility.”

Completion rate for flights stayed at 98% while on-time performance dipped from 91% to 88% year-over-year.

Wheels Up Cost Reductions

Wheels Up also said it will implement “efficiency, productivity, and overhead cost reductions” from its fleet modernization plan to “drive approximately $50 million in annual cash cost savings.”

The full impact of those initiatives won’t be evident until the second half of 2026.

Wheels Up CEO George Mattson, in a letter to investors, wrote:

‘Over the past several quarters, our top priority has been realigning our product, fleet, and operations to better meet customer demand, while advancing our strategic partnership with Delta. This focused execution has strengthened our financial position and laid a strong foundation for sustained, profitable growth. I’m incredibly proud of how our team has continued to deliver exceptional service and operational excellence, even as we invest in modernizing and simplifying our fleet. As we scale our premium jet offering, deepen our collaboration with Delta, and drive greater productivity and efficiency, we remain committed to transforming our business and delivering the most accessible and flexible portfolio of private aviation solutions in the industry.’

Mattson pointed to its fleet transition.

Currently, 17% of its fleet is now premium Phenom 300 light jets or Challenger 300 and Challenger 350 super-midsize jets.

The letter to investors from Mattson shows it growing to 44% of its fleet by the end of the year.

Per the data, its workhorse King Air 350s will still make up 22% of the fleet, down from 35% at the end of 2023.

Mattson also pointed to benefits in its sales integration with Delta, writing corporate membership fund sales were its “fastest growing channel, with an increase of more than 25% year over year in the second quarter.”

He also highlighted leisure sales potential from Delta frequent flyers, saying, “Thousands of Delta SkyMiles customers have engaged with us to learn more about the potential for accessing Wheels Up.”

Membership Fund Sales

While Wheels Up has been shifting its focus away from its strictly programmatic past, membership fund sales still make up a significant part of its business.

It previously referred to the deposits for future flights as Prepaid Blocks.

Its SEC filing reports $260 million in Membership Fund sales for the first half of 2025, which allows us to deduce that $127 million in deposits were taken in Q2.

That is down from $145 million in Q2 of 2024.

Fuel is one of the most critical and complex factors in flight operations. From choosing the right type to calculating how much you’ll need (and where you might need to dump it in an emergency), pilots make a number of fuel-related decisions before the wheels even leave the ground.

In this post, we’ll break down the different types of aviation fuels, walk you through the basics of fuel planning, and explain what really happens when aircraft need to dump fuel. Whether you're in training or just aviation-curious, this guide will give you a solid understanding of the fuel that keeps the skies moving.

Types of Aviation Fuel

What's powering the planes in the sky? The answer isn't a single type of fuel. From jet engines to piston engines, the choice of fuel depends on everything from design to altitude. Let's explore the most common types of aviation fuel and the aircraft they power.

Jet A & Jet A-1 (AFTUR)

Used by: Commercial airliners, business jets, most turbine aircraft Also known as: AFTUR (aviation turbine fuel)

Jet A and Jet A-1 are the workhorses of the aviation world. They are kerosene-based fuels used in turbine engines. The main difference? Jet A-1 has a lower freezing point (−47°C), making it ideal for long-haul, high-altitude flights, especially in colder regions.

Jet A: Mainly used in the U.S.

Jet A-1: Standard fuel for international operations

Think of Jet A-1 as the “global passport” of jet fuels — versatile and freeze-resistant.

Turbofan or turbojet? What's the difference, and which is better? Find out in this comparison of these two powerful jet engines.

Avgas (Aviation Gasoline)

Used by: Piston-engine aircraft (e.g., Cessna 172, Piper PA-28) Types: 100LL (Low Lead) – dyed blue; Avgas 100 – dyed green

Avgas is the aviation version of gasoline. It’s used in smaller aircraft with spark-ignition engines. The most common variety today is 100LL, which, despite the “low lead” name, still contains tetraethyl lead (for octane boosting).

There's a global push to develop unleaded Avgas alternatives that still meet performance demands. So lead is on the way out in the near future.

MOGAS (Motor Gasoline)

Used by: Light sport aircraft, some experimental aircraft, and certain STC-approved certified planes

MOGAS is essentially unleaded auto fuel (the same stuff you put in your car) used in aviation under very specific conditions. It’s cheaper and more widely available, but comes with caveats:

Not suitable for high-altitude or high-performance operations

May have ethanol content, which isn’t ideal for aircraft fuel systems

Jet B or Aftak JP4

Used by: Military aircraft, Arctic region operations, remote bush flying

Jet B is a specialised aviation fuel designed for extremely cold climates. Its composition is a blend of roughly 30% kerosene and 70% gasoline, giving it a very low freezing point of approximately -60 °C. This makes it a practical choice for regions with consistently frigid temperatures, such as Alaska and parts of Canada.

However, Jet B's high volatility and flammability make it trickier to handle and store compared to other fuels. For this reason, it is used sparingly and primarily in sub-zero environments, where its low freezing point is essential for reliability. The military version, known as JP-4, is essentially Jet B with added corrosion inhibitor and anti-icing agents.

Military Fuels

The military needs fuels that can handle extreme conditions — on aircraft carriers, in desert heat, or in freezing altitudes. These advanced fuels are adapted versions of civilian jet fuels with additives for: anti-icing, corrosion inhibition, stability, and storage. Military fuels are robust and adaptable, just like the missions they support.

Examples include: JP-5 — high flash point, perfect for aircraft carriers. JP-8 — Similar to Jet A-1 but with military-specific additives.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

ISAF is the green revolution in aviation fuel, increasingly adopted by commercial airlines around the globe.

Made from renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil, municipal waste, or algae, SAF is chemically similar to Jet A-1 and can be blended up to 50% with traditional jet fuel. No aircraft modifications needed.

Airlines like Lufthansa, United, and KLM are already flying with SAF blends on select routes. The goal? Reduce aviation's carbon footprint without sacrificing performance or safety.

Basic Fuel Planning for Pilots

Fuel mismanagement is a leading factor in aviation incidents, so every good pilot needs to treat this part of preflight prep with serious attention. Good planning ensures you always have enough fuel to handle expected operations and the unexpected — like delays, diversions, or holding patterns.

To make it easier, there’s a handy mnemonic pilots use: TTCAAFE. Each letter stands for a different type of fuel you need to consider. While the numbers may vary depending on the aircraft type, route, and weather conditions, the structure stays the same. Let’s break down the 7 key fuel components.

TTCAAFE

T – Taxi Fuel This covers fuel consumed during engine start, APU usage, taxi to the runway, and any anticipated holding before take-off. It’s typically a fixed amount (e.g. 200 kg), but it can vary depending on airport layout and expected delays.

T – Trip Fuel This is your core fuel load – the amount required to fly from wheels-up to touchdown. It includes the climb, cruise, and descent phases. Trip fuel is calculated using performance data, weather conditions, route structure, and expected aircraft weight.

C – Contingency Fuel This is your buffer for the unforeseen. It’s usually 5% of the trip fuel or 5 minutes of holding at 1,500 feet above the destination airport — whichever is higher. It covers deviations from planned routing, weather, or ATC instructions.

A – Alternate Fuel If a diversion is needed, this is the fuel required to fly from the missed approach point at your destination to your designated alternate airport, including climb, cruise, descent, and landing there.

A – Additional Fuel This applies when there’s no alternate listed (for example, if you’re landing at an isolated airport). Additional fuel typically allows 15 minutes of flight at 1,500 feet above the aerodrome, accounting for weather or runway availability issues.

Important: You’ll have either Alternate or Additional fuel — not both.

F – Final Reserve Fuel Your last line of defence. This is the minimum required if everything else goes wrong:

30 minutes at 1,500 feet for turbine aircraft

45 minutes for piston aircraft It’s not to be touched in normal operations — it’s for emergencies only.

E – Extra Fuel Optional, but smart. This is any additional fuel the commander decides to carry beyond the minimums — based on weather, expected delays, holding patterns, or operational experience.

Fuel Dumping: What, When, and Where

Fuel dumping, also called fuel jettisoning, is when an aircraft intentionally releases fuel in-flight. It’s not something pilots do for fun. It’s a safety manoeuvre, used only when absolutely necessary, usually in emergency or time-critical situations.

Most often, it happens when a plane needs to return shortly after take-off, or divert quickly after departure, but is too heavy to land safely. Long-haul jets typically take off at weights far above their maximum landing weight, so reducing mass becomes a priority before making a safe landing.

When Can It Be Done?

According toICAO Doc 4444, fuel dumping is permitted only in emergency or urgent situations. Examples include:

A medical emergency that requires an immediate return or diversion

A technical fault that makes continuing unsafe

A sudden decompression or engine issue

But fuel can’t just be dumped anywhere. There are rules and procedures for where and how it happens.

Where Does it Happen?

Dumping usually takes place:

Above 6,000 feet AGL

Away from populated areas

Over water when possible

ATC (Air Traffic Control) coordinates with the crew to choose the safest location — typically a designated fuel dumping zone, such as offshore airspace or rural zones. The 6000-foot rule ensures the fuel atomises and evaporates before it even reaches the ground. That’s why you almost never hear of any environmental damage or risk to people below.

We’ve put together a quick collection of 15 Practical Questions and Answers that every student pilot should know cold. Test your knowledge and see how many of them you got right.

Can Jets Dump Fuel Over Cities?

Technically, yes—but it’s extremely rare and only if there’s no safer alternative. Even then, fuel dumped at altitude disperses quickly into mist-like particles.

So no, it’s not raining kerosene on your head. The environmental impact is minimal, and health risks are nearly zero — especially compared to the risk of a damaged or overweight aircraft trying to land.

Not All Aircraft Can Dump Fuel. Here’s a fact: not every plane has a fuel jettison system. Most narrowbodies — like the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737— can’t dump fuel at all. If they take-off heavy and need to return, the only option is an overweight landing.

Is that dangerous? It’s not ideal—but it’s manageable. Aircraft are designed to handle overweight landings when necessary. It may require a thorough inspection afterward, but safety comes first.

According to EASA CS-25, an aircraft isn’t required to meet max landing mass in all scenarios — it must be able to sustain climb gradients and perform safely during a go-around or engine-out situation.

5 Aviation Fuel Facts

Before we end this guide to aviation fuel, let's look at a few quick facts that show one thing: aviation fuel, in every aspect of its production and use, is a critical, high-stakes resource that powers our industry.

1. Aviation Fuel Is Held to Seriously High Standards. Fuel isn’t just pumped into aircraft without checks. Aviation fuel must meet strict international quality standards, regardless of where it’s produced. That means a plane refuelled in Tokyo, Nairobi, or Madrid can trust the same performance and safety level. These standards ensure engine reliability, safety, and efficiency, no matter where in the world you're flying.

2. Jet Fuel ≠ Car Fuel. Here’s the deal: aviation fuel is not your average unleaded.

Jet fuel (like Jet A and Jet A-1) is primarily made from kerosene, a light hydrocarbon that performs well in high altitudes and cold temps.

Avgas (aviation gasoline), often used in smaller piston-engine aircraft, can be leaded or unleaded, and is designed for high-performance spark ignition.

Different fuels, different engines, but both are precision-formulated for aviation use.

3. Aviation Fuel Isn’t Cheap. Aviation fuel is a premium product — and its price reflects that. The refining, testing, and global logistics all add up. While it’s significantly more expensive than car fuel, it offers superior energy density, safety, and efficiency.

4. Avgas = Highly Flammable and Highly Regulated. Yes, Avgas is highly flammable, but so are most fuels. What sets aviation fuel apart is how it's handled and regulated. Every aircraft must have fire suppression systems, and anyone who handles fuel—ground crew, maintenance teams, even some pilots—needs special training.",https://images.ctfassets.net/tx9tltt2q9jh/4H3FOSPk021fpnhXLVu9DO/f0befe5070bd0c04acf0c59028aed761/Cover_Guide_to_Aviation_Fuel.png,N,,2025-08-07 11:58:09.645438

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said current pump requirements have made it less likely that gas stations would sell E15.
In addition, E15 is approved for 96% of vehicles on the road with over 160 billion miles driven using E15.
The fuel ""routinely offers lower prices"" and saves drivers from 10 cents to 30 cents per gallon.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- Legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate this week would require the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to finalize a 2021 rule to update E15 pump labeling and clear the way for stations to use existing underground storage and dispensing equipment for the fuel.

The so-called Ethanol for America Act was introduced by Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Deb Fischer, R-Neb.; and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.; are co-sponsors of the bill while Reps. Adrian Smith, R-Neb. and Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., introduced the bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the House, additional original cosponsors include Reps. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D.; Tracey Mann, R-Kan.; Derek Schmidt, R-Kan.; Mike Flood, R-Neb.; Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa; and Brad Finstad, R-Minn.

The 2021 rule that was ended by the Biden administration would have either eliminated the federal E15 labeling requirement entirely or could have required a new label that says ""contains up to 15% ethanol, safe for use in 2001 and newer passenger vehicles or flex-fuel vehicles, avoid use in other vehicles, motorcycles, boats or gasoline-powered equipment. It may cause damage and is prohibited by federal law.""

The proposed rule would have required gas stations either installing new equipment or replacing old equipment, to ensure compatibility with ethanol blends up to 100%.

The legislation would require the EPA to make E15 fuel labels clearer to consumers.

""We thank Sens. Ernst and Klobuchar, and Reps. Smith and Budzinski, for introducing this common-sense legislation, which would lower pump prices for American consumers, bolster U.S. energy security, and open new markets for our nation's family farmers,"" said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association.

""The most effective way to keep a lid on gas prices is to expand and diversify the domestic fuel supply with higher ethanol blends like E15. Knocking down regulatory barriers and allowing E15 to be stored and distributed in existing infrastructure will lower fuel costs for Americans and strengthen the market's resilience against global supply disruptions.""

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said current pump requirements have made it less likely that gas stations would sell E15.

""Consumer demand for E15 grows each year, but onerous labeling?and underground tank?requirements have prevented many retailers from expanding access to better options at the pump,"" Skor said.

""This important effort will?put more homegrown energy into the marketplace, reduce prices at the pump and open critical new markets for U.S. farmers and biofuel producers.""

Ernst and 16 other members of Congress also penned a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, calling on him to deem existing fuel infrastructure compatible with E15.

Research shows underground storage tanks and dispensing equipment compatible with E10 are also compatible with E15, according to a news release from Ernst's office.

In addition, E15 is approved for 96% of vehicles on the road with over 160 billion miles driven using E15. The fuel ""routinely offers lower prices"" and saves drivers from 10 cents to 30 cents per gallon. Ernst said approving current infrastructure would avoid costly upgrades for retailers.

American Automakers are Not Happy with the Japan Trade Deal General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler-parent Stellantis raised concerns about the trade deal because of the higher tariff rates on imports from Canada and Mexico.","The United States and Japan reached a trade deal that includes reciprocal tariffs set at 15%, a $550 billion investment by Japan in the United States — of which the United States will receive 90% of the profits — and open trade for a list of goods, including cars and trucks, rice, and other agricultural products. Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, and purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. The deal will lower tariffs on Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, potentially making Japanese cars cheaper compared to rival China. However, the deal will still leave American trade policy more restrictive than it was before the Trump administration’s tariff policies. The lower tariff for Japan has caused consternation with American automakers, who have to pay a 25% tariff on imports from their plants and suppliers in Canada and Mexico compared with Japan’s 15% rate. Automotive levies had been a sticking point in negotiations between Japan and the United States for months.

Steel and aluminum tariffs will remain at 50%, which also may be a win for Japan, since it exports more vehicles to the United States than it does steel and aluminum. U.S. automakers will be disadvantaged because they will be paying the hefty levy on steel and aluminum they import for their vehicles.

Based on data from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Japan purchased nearly $80 billion worth of U.S. products in 2024, while the U.S. bought about $148 billion worth of Japanese goods. Cars and auto parts accounted for about $52 billion worth of imported Japanese products, making up more than one-third of products purchased by the United States. In 2024, Japan had shipped about 1.4 million vehicles to the United States, making it the third-largest exporter after Mexico and South Korea. Japan’s auto exports to the United States made up 28.3% of all shipments in 2024, according to customs data.

The tariffs affected the Japanese auto industry, with export deliveries to U.S. ports dropping. Japanese auto exports to the United States fell 26.7% in June, on top of May’s drop of 24.7%. The country’s overall exports to the United States — its second-largest trading partner — declined 0.8% year-on-year between January and June, totaling $70.34 billion.

According to President Trump, Japan and the United States are also working on an additional deal involving Alaskan liquefied natural gas (LNG). The Trump administration is working on a proposed Alaska pipeline to transport natural gas across the state and export it overseas — a $44 billion project. The 810-mile natural gas pipeline would be among the largest in the world, and Japan, South Korea, and other nations are interested in partnering with the United States and investing trillions of dollars in future purchases of LNG from the Alaska facility. The project would provide a shorter shipping distance to Asia than the U.S. Gulf Coast and avoid the Panama Canal, which was under a drought in 2023, causing severe bottlenecks.

Changes to Trade Policy May Not Help the American Auto Market in Japan

American automakers do not produce the small cars that Japanese consumers prefer, so Japanese auto buyers may not want an American automobile or even the best-selling Ford F-150, according to Axios. Japan is a right-hand-drive market, requiring extra engineering, with different safety and emissions standards. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Japan will “take U.S. cars based on U.S. standards, so you don’t have to make a different car” for the Japanese market. But even with that provision, the interest may not be there for the Japanese buyer.

American Automakers are Not Happy with the Japan Trade Deal

General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler-parent Stellantis raised concerns about the trade deal because of the higher tariff rates on imports from Canada and Mexico. According to Matt Blunt, head of the American Automotive Policy Council representing the Detroit Three automakers, “any deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content than the tariff imposed on North American-built vehicles with high U.S. content is a bad deal for U.S. industry and U.S. auto workers.”

General Motor’s second-quarter earnings declined by $1.1 billion, likely due to the tariffs, and the company expects the impact to worsen in the third quarter. The tariffs have cost Stellantis $352 million so far as the company reduced vehicle shipments and cut production to adjust manufacturing levels. Stellantis expects more impact from U.S. tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imports in the second half of 2025.

In April, Trump lowered duties on auto parts and materials, but left in place 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. He also extended a duty-free exemption for North American parts that comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) rules of origin.

Analysis

The deal is a partial sign of relief as it reduces tariffs on Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, lowering costs for U.S. consumers, who can access Japanese cars (which made up 28.3% of U.S. auto imports in 2024) at potentially lower prices than had the tariffs remained at 25%. Similarly, Japan’s commitment to increase U.S. rice imports by 75% and purchase $8 billion in U.S. agricultural goods (e.g., corn, soybeans, bioethanol) opens markets for American producers, fostering export-led growth in sectors where the U.S. might have a comparative advantage. The $550 billion Japanese investment in the U.S., with 90% of profits allocated to the United States, could affect the American energy economy, particularly projects like the proposed $44 billion Alaskan LNG pipeline. This pipeline, by shortening shipping routes to Asia and bypassing Panama Canal bottlenecks, could enhance the competitiveness of U.S. energy exports.

However, the deal retains significant protectionist measures that undermine market efficiency and competition. Most notably, the persistence of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum disadvantages U.S. manufacturers who rely on imported materials, raising their production costs and eroding their competitiveness. For automobiles in particular, this selective tariff structure distorts the market, potentially favoring Japanese auto exports while penalizing U.S. manufacturers, who face higher costs for inputs and a 25% tariff on inputs imported from Canada and Mexico under the USMCA.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Detailed-Earth-Part-Of-Asia-109621244-1024x1024.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 09:56:08.311303

Soon, supply chains that deplete limited resources, generate excess emissions and discard value after use will no longer be socially or economically acceptable.

By 2030, circular intelligence will be the standard for staying in the game; the earlier you start, the further ahead you’ll be.

By 2030, the competitiveness of manufacturers and global businesses will be measured by more than just product quality, pricing or speed. Instead, it will be determined by how intelligently and sustainably they operate. Two forces — the shift to circular economy business models and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI ) — are reshaping the foundations of industrial success.

Each trend is disruptive on its own. But together, they create a powerful opportunity to reinvent value creation, rewire supply chains and redefine how businesses engage with customers, regulators and resources.

The future will belong to those who embrace both. Companies that resist or delay adapting risk facing a harsh new reality: higher costs, lower margins, declining revenue streams and a loss of customer trust and relevance.

Why circular business models are a prerequisite for 2030 competitiveness

Circularity is no longer just a niche sustainability idea. It's quickly becoming a core requirement for doing business. Customers, regulators and investors are converging on a shared expectation: products and services must be designed and delivered without creating unnecessary waste. Supply chains that deplete limited resources, generate excess emissions and discard value after use will no longer be socially or economically acceptable.

But beyond regulatory pressure, there is a strong business case for circularity. Companies adopting circular models lower their risk from raw material price swings, improve profits by extending product value and generate recurring income through repair, refurbishment and product-as-a-service offerings.

Conversely, businesses that remain tied to traditional linear 'take-make-waste' models will find themselves increasingly outpaced. As raw material prices fluctuate and regulations tighten, their cost structures will become more burdensome. Without mechanisms for retaining value — like repair, reuse or remanufacturing — they’ll miss opportunities to generate ongoing revenue and reduce dependency on virgin inputs. These companies will struggle to meet ESG-linked procurement standards, risk exclusion from high-value contracts and lose relevance among customers who expect more than one-time transactions. In 2030, being non-circular won't just be perceived as environmentally irresponsible; it will expose operational weaknesses and erode competitiveness.

The most competitive companies in the coming decade will not be those that sell the most products. They will be those who extract and maintain the most value from each product throughout its complete lifecycle. That is the core of the circular economy and it's rapidly becoming the standard for modern industrial performance.

AI is the engine that will get us there

If circularity is the goal, AI is the driving force to achieve it. AI is changing every aspect of business, from product design and operational management to service delivery.

Manufacturers are already using AI to optimize supply chains, predict maintenance needs, automate production planning and personalize customer interactions. But by 2030, AI will no longer be just a tool for improvement. It will be the foundation for how decisions are made, how processes adapt in real time and how companies stay competitive in a world of constant change.

AI offers speed, intelligence and scale that surpass human abilities. It converts data into insights. It changes generic processes into responsive, personalized workflows. And it helps organizations handle complexity with agility, which is especially important in the circular economy, where reverse logistics, shared ownership and lifecycle management increase operational challenges.

Companies that ignore developing internal AI capabilities risk falling behind in efficiency and innovation. Without AI, their ability to recognize patterns, respond to market shifts and automate more complex tasks will be limited. Businesses that don't adopt AI will grow more slowly, face higher costs and deliver less value to their customers.

Together, AI and circularity create a powerful cycle

While each of these transformations is powerful on its own, their convergence is what truly unlocks a competitive advantage. AI and the circular economy are not separate paths. They are mutually reinforcing strategies for creating the intelligent, resilient and sustainable business of the future.

Consider how AI enhances product lifecycles by analyzing sensor data from connected devices. With this knowledge, manufacturers predict when a product will need servicing, automatically schedule maintenance and identify the best time to reclaim or remanufacture a component. This results in fewer failures, longer asset life and greater customer satisfaction, while also reducing material use and waste.

In circular supply chains, which involve the return and redistribution of products and parts, AI removes friction and complexity. Intelligent agents automatically evaluate a returned item, decide its next life stage and trigger the appropriate actions — whether that’s refurbishment, resale or disassembly for material recovery. These same agents negotiate logistics, confirm availability and even execute contracts autonomously.

AI also plays a critical role in managing complex circular ecosystems. Unlike linear models with clear supplier-customer handoffs, circular systems involve collaboration among recyclers, repair services, logistics providers and users. AI serves as the digital glue between these actors, ensuring smooth coordination, real-time data sharing and adaptive decision-making.

And, at the strategic level, AI-powered analytics enable companies to continuously develop and improve circular business models. They simulate environmental impacts, estimate long-term value and test pricing in fluctuating markets, giving leaders the confidence to adapt faster and smarter.

Together, AI and circularity create a powerful cycle: AI supports scalable circular operations and circular models produce the data-rich environments where AI excels. Companies that combine both will see lower costs, stronger supply chains, better customer relationships and a clearer understanding of how to grow profitably while achieving sustainability goals.

The future won’t wait: Build circular intelligence now

The transformations ahead are not small. They require investment, new skillsets, cultural change and strategic vision. But the payoff is immense.

The leading businesses in 2030 won't just adopt digital tools or claim to be sustainable. They'll be companies that integrate intelligence and circularity into their thinking, working and growth practices.

The path forward begins with a clear understanding: if you are not circular, you will be less profitable, less resilient and increasingly irrelevant. If you are not intelligent and powered by AI, you will be too slow, too costly and too disconnected to keep up.

Now is the moment to act. Start redesigning your products for circularity. Begin developing the data infrastructure and AI capabilities to support lifecycle decisions. Shift your internal KPIs to measure recurring value, instead of one-time sales. Explore how automation and intelligence can transform your customer relationships, operations and ecosystems.

By 2030, circular intelligence won’t just be an advantage. It will be the standard for staying in the game. The earlier you start, the further ahead you’ll be.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_vZ3JN3BftWly7D7sug1PzVMnUzpS4LXkjaI1sM0cWdo.JPG,N,,2025-08-07 08:56:09.370850

Summit competitors Navigator CO2 Ventures and Wolf Carbon Solutions eventually dropped similar carbon capture pipeline projects.","Summit Carbon Solutions has appointed Joe Griffin, a veteran of the natural gas industry, as its new CEO.

Griffin is reaching out to landowners, promising revised proposals that better address their interests.

Summit's pipeline project faces continued opposition from environmental groups and landowners concerned about property rights and safety.

Summit Carbon Solutions, the Ames company seeking to build a $9 billion carbon capture pipeline across five states, including Iowa, has hired a new CEO who’s reaching out to landowners, saying his leadership represents a “fresh chapter” for the embattled company.

Summit said in an email Wednesday, Aug. 6, that CEO Joe Griffin brings almost 40 years of experience ""delivering complex infrastructure projects"" in the natural gas industry.

Before joining Summit, Griffin founded or led about a half-dozen energy companies over two decades, including Hiland Partners LP, a company owned by oil and gas billionaire Harold Hamm, who’s also an investor in Summit Carbon Solutions.

Griffin sent letters to landowners, both those with agreements to allow the Summit to use their property for the pipeline and those with whom the company is seeking terms. He told them the company is preparing to announce business plan updates that “will open new markets and create greater opportunities for the region.”

Griffin also told the landowners with whom Summit is seeking agreements they will receive revised right-of-way proposals “in the coming weeks that reflects our commitment to offering terms that better support landowners and their long-term interests.”

Summit didn’t elaborate on those plans Wednesday. It reiterated its contention that the pipeline, which would carry carbon dioxide from ethanol plants to a sequestration site, would enable the fuel they produce to be used to make sustainable aviation fuel and be sold in California and other markets that require low-carbon fuel.

Carbon capture and sequestration projects also qualify for lucrative federal tax credits.

Iowa is the No. 1 U.S. maker of ethanol, devoting about half its also nation-leading annual corn crop to producing the renewable fuel. But the pipeline proposal has run into heavy opposition, including a movement to stop Summit from using state-granted eminent domain powers to secure land from unwilling property owners.

South Dakota's governor signed a ban into law in March. Iowa lawmakers also approved restrictions on using eminent domain, but Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed the legislation in June. It remains a contentious issue among members of the GOP-dominated Legislature.

A Summit attorney acknowledged at a South Dakota regulatory meeting in April the company will have to provide richer easement offers to win over resistant landowners there. It also still needs to obtain a permit to build the pipeline in South Dakota, which has twice turned it down.

Reason for prior Summit CEO's departure not given

Griffin replaces Lee Blank, a veteran agribusiness executive. Summit declined to comment Wednesday about Blank’s departure.

Its 2,500-mile pipeline across Nebraska and Minnesota as well as Iowa and South Dakota would capture carbon dioxide emissions from nearly 60 ethanol plants. The underground sequestration site is slated to be in North Dakota — if the pipeline can be built across South Dakota to reach it.

Opponents have vowed since its announcement in 2021 to stop the project, which has been plagued with concerns about safety, property rights and potential damage to farmland. Summit competitors Navigator CO2 Ventures and Wolf Carbon Solutions eventually dropped similar carbon capture pipeline projects.

""There is nothing that Summit can do or change to repair the bridges they have burnt over the last four years,"" Jess Mazour, a spokesperson for the Sierra Club's Iowa Chapter, said in a statement. ""Iowans have made it loud and clear, we do not want carbon pipelines and we do not want our land stolen for Summit’s for-profit private project.""

In his introductory letter, Griffin said he’s driven by “being part of the hard work and real-life challenges that come with building something meaningful.""

“I’m the kind of person who’s not afraid to get out in the fields and help alongside the farmers, someone who understands that this project is about more than pipes and technology — it’s about people, land, and communities,” he said.

Most recently, Griffin's served as the CEO and co-founder of Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Intensity Infrastructure Partners, a company established in 2023 that develops and builds pipelines. He was CEO of Sendero Midstream Partners from about 2021 to 2022, when it was sold.

From 2015 to 2022, Griffin served as CEO and was co-founder at Intensity Midstream, which was part of a sale to Energy Transfer LP. From 2007 to 2015, he was the CEO and a board director at Hiland, Hamm's company. It was sold Kinder Morgan Inc.

In 1989, he co-founded Lumen Midstream Co., holding senior management positions and serving as a director until it was sold to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe in 2004. He continued working at the company until 2007, serving as executive vice president overseeing multiple aspects of the business.

Griffin received a Bachelor of Science degree from Oklahoma State University.","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/18/PDEM/82519579007-031825-eminentdomain-ls-17.jpg?crop=6587,3706,x0,y439&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-07 08:56:14.006299

EU bunker demand up 12pc in 2024 on container traffic

New York, 6 August (Argus) — EU bunker demand in 2024 surged by 4.9mn t to 46.3mn t, up 12pc from the previous year, driven largely by longer container ship voyages as vessels avoided the Red Sea following Houthi attacks. Container ship fuel consumption led the increase, rising by 5.4mn t to 17.0mn t in 2024, according to the latest data from the EU's Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) database. Many container lines rerouted around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, lengthening voyages, and increasing fuel burn. The MRV system tracks marine fuel demand for ships of 5,000 gross tons and above on all voyages involving EU or European Economic Area (EEA) ports. This includes full-voyage fuel consumption, even in international waters, as long as at least one port is within the EU or EEA. MRV-tracked marine carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions followed suit, rising 12pc to 143.2mn t in 2024. For the first time in 2024, the MRV also required reporting of two other greenhouse gases (GHG): methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). Vessel operators reported 59,479t of CH₄ and 8,066t of N₂O, which translate to 1.7mn t and 2.1mn t of CO₂-equivalent emissions, respectively, based on their global warming potential of 28 and 265 times that of CO₂. Of the 59,479t of CH₄ reported to the EU MRV in 2024, the majority, 36,615t, came from LNG carriers, which often use boil-off gas from their cargo as fuel. LNG has lower CO₂ emissions than conventional marine fuel, but LNG or dual-fuel LNG engines can result in methane slip, where unburned methane escapes through the engine exhaust. Another 14,432t of CH₄ came from roll on/roll off passenger vessels (ro-pax), roll on/roll off cargo vessels (ro-ro), and ferries, many of which also run on LNG or LNG dual-fuel engines. MRV does not report different marine fuel types demand, just total demand. By comparison, Rotterdam, Europe's biggest bunkering port, reported 8.6mn t of conventional marine fuel sold in 2024, down 2.7pc from 2023. Biodiesel bunker blends reached 752,103t in 2024, holding steady. LNG and bio-LNG sales were up 52pc to 424,863t, and bio-methanol jumped up to 3,946t from less than 800t in 2023. Sustainable marine fuel demand grew ahead of the start of the FuelEU Maritime regulation in January 2025, which mandated 2pc in GHG emissions cut in 2025.

Regulatory clash set to disrupt ARA biofuel trade

London, 6 August (Argus) — A regulatory mismatch between EU-wide FuelEU Maritime rules and national Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) transpositions in Belgium and the Netherlands is set to disrupt biofuel and marine fuel markets from 2026, particularly in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) bunkering hub. The Dutch and Belgian governments plan to exclude biofuels made from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats — listed under RED Annex IX Part B — from counting towards maritime fuel mandates. This contrasts with FuelEU Maritime, which rewards their use to cut shipping emissions. The divergence is expected to distort supply-demand dynamics and raise compliance costs for suppliers and shipowners. Draft legislation in both countries obliges fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across land, inland shipping and maritime sectors. Under the Dutch RED III draft, Annex IX Part B biofuels — including UCO and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — will count towards land and inland shipping mandates only, capped at 4.29pc and 11.07pc respectively. For international maritime shipping, the cap is set at zero. This means suppliers cannot claim emission reduction units (EREs) for Part B fuels used in maritime shipping, effectively disincentivising UCO-based biodiesel sales in the ARA region. FuelEU Maritime, by contrast, mandates GHG cuts for maritime users starting at 2pc in 2025, rising to 80pc by 2050, and places no cap on Part B fuels. Like FuelEU Maritime, the Dutch RED III draft excludes crop-based biofuels from counting towards maritime GHG reduction targets. But unlike FuelEU, it also bars Annex IX Part B fuels — creating a sharper compliance gap for bunker suppliers. This leaves used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) in a precarious position. Widely used in marine fuels due to its scale and compatibility with existing engines, Ucome-based blends will remain attractive to shipowners aiming to meet FuelEU Maritime targets. But ARA suppliers will need to sell Annex IX Part A fuels — such as bio-LNG or Advanced Fame 0 — to meet RED III targets or face penalties. This could push up Ucome prices, as suppliers seek to to offset non-compliance costs. Advanced Fame 0-based marine biodiesel blends are currently attractive to buyers because marine mandates have not yet taken effect. Under the existing system, HBE-G renewable tickets — which will be replaced by EREs next year — can be deducted from the price of Part A fuels, but this may not be viable next year. Part B fuels from the marine sector do not currently generate HBEs. Higher Ucome prices may inflate maritime-generated ERE values and boost demand for Part A fuels, raising overall biofuel costs and reducing ARA's competitiveness. Some shipowners may opt to bunker elsewhere. Many already source marine biodiesel from Asia, where prices are lower. Argus assessed B30 Ucome dob ARA at an average of $805.30/t during May–July, compared with $705.48/t in Singapore. Prices for alternatives like RFNBOs and ammonia remain high, limiting near-term uptake. FuelEU abatement prices for Ucome-MGO and Ucome-VLSFO have been relatively flat this year, but could rise if Ucome prices firm. Market reactions Market participants are exploring ways to navigate the mandates. One option is blending small volumes of Advanced Fame 0 into bunker fuels, although this is logistically complex and could raise prices at ARA ports. Another strategy involves sourcing marine-generated ERE tickets from over-compliant sellers. But supply may be tight, as only a limited share of inland and land-generated tickets can be transferred to the marine sector under the flexible credit allowance. Some suppliers have told Argus they are considering shifting some of their bunker volumes to other ports, including the Mediterranean region. Spain's RED III draft includes a proposed 1.7pc cap on Part B fuels — far more lenient than Belgium and the Netherlands. Spain's marine mandate starts at 1pc in 2027, rising to just 3pc by 2030.

Latvia could allow farmers force majeure

London, 6 August (Argus) — The Latvian government put in place a state of emergency for the country's agriculture sector because heavy rainfall across Latvia has had ""devastating"" impacts on crops including grains and oilseeds. The state of emergency is due to last until 4 November, and could allow affected farmers to exit contracts without facing penalties, according to Latvia's official state publication. Latvia's State Revenue Service and other trading partners could opt out from placing sanctions on farmers for non-fulfilment of sales obligations because of the emergency situation, according to the country's agriculture ministry. Meanwhile, credit and other private financial institutions could revise loan and interest payment schedules without penalty for farmers impacted by the severe weather conditions. Rainfall has been particularly heavy in recent weeks, market participants said. Latvia has received up to 150pc of its average precipitation levels in the past two weeks, meteorological data show. Neighbouring Baltic state Lithuania has received up to 300pc of normal rainfall in the same period. That said, rainfall across the growing season was less severe, with meteorological data showing just 80pc of normal levels received in the past 90 days. Wet weather has deteriorated Latvia's crop quality, with grain and rapeseed sprouting, according to agriculture minister Armands Krauze. And soil moisture levels are preventing harvesting, which could allow for greater degradation the longer crops remain in the soil. Heavy rainfall in recent weeks has caused market participants to mull a higher feed wheat share from northern European countries including Latvia. The ministry has also called for compensation for Latvian farmers from the EU budget, with the ministry currently estimating losses to the value of €63mn (about $73mn). The US Department of Agriculture currently pegs Latvian 2025-26 wheat and rapeseed production at 2.55mn t and 340,000t, respectively — both forecast higher on the year by 84,000t and 91,000t, respectively.

Thai fertilizer demand slows as rice prices fall

Singapore, 6 August (Argus) — Thailand's domestic fertilizer demand is slowing due to low export prices for rice, despite favourable rainfall this year. Above normal rainfall during May-July have supported healthy demand for fertilizers in the domestic market. From May to June, the northeastern region — Thailand's main rice-growing area — received between 21-47pc more rain than normal, according to the Thai Meteorological Department. In July, the downgraded typhoon Wipha continued to bring heavy rains across the country. But importers have noted a slowdown in domestic demand mainly because farmers have lower cash flow due to weak rice export prices. Thai 100pc B white rice export price in June 2025 fell around 33pc on the year under pressure from lower Indian and Vietnamese rice prices, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data. As a result, Thailand's rice exports during January-June 2025 fell 27pc on the year, while Vietnam's exports rose by 6pc and India's by 38pc. The Thai government has launched a campaign this week offering a 200 baht/bag, or 4,000 baht/t, discount for fertilizers, one importer said. There will be three events, each offering around 500t of bagged fertilizers with the discount. But most importers don't think this can significantly boost domestic demand. Import demand started to slow down in July as current stocks were enough to meet domestic needs, importers said. Thailand's rainy season is expected to last until mid-October, but this is also unlikely to raise domestic fertilizer sales as farmers have already bought most of their requirements. Continued weak demand from farmers could reduce import interest for the rest of the third quarter.

The project, which utilizes Topsoe’s proven HydroFlex® technology, is a major investment aimed at enhancing both environmental sustainability and local agricultural value.

The CountryMark refinery, located in southwestern Indiana, currently processes 35,000 barrels of crude oil daily. With the integration of Topsoe's technology, the facility is poised to add a new revenue stream and a sustainable product line. The new unit is expected to produce up to 250,000 barrels of renewable diesel annually, a high-quality fuel that can be seamlessly used in existing diesel engines and infrastructure. The refinery is set to begin co-processing renewable feedstocks in September.

The environmental impact of this initiative is substantial. The renewable diesel unit is projected to enable an annual emission avoidance of approximately 84,500 tons of CO2 emissions.

A key aspect of the project is its focus on creating a locally sourced renewable fuel economy. CountryMark will use soybean oil, supplied by Indiana’s farmers, as the primary feedstock for the renewable diesel. This creates a powerful circular economy loop, where the farmers who own the cooperative supply the raw material that is then refined into fuel for their own equipment and the broader community. This partnership provides a stable, in-state market for Indiana’s agricultural products, strengthening the economic ties between the energy and farming sectors.

Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director of Topsoe Americas, highlighted the strategic importance of the collaboration. “Our collaboration with CountryMark goes back many years,"" Rasmussen said. ""With demand for renewable diesel continuing to grow, we’re excited to partner with CountryMark on their journey to produce cleaner fuels and contribute to America’s low-carbon energy future.”

Echoing this sentiment, CountryMark President and CEO Matt Smorch added, ""We saw this as an opportunity to deliver increased value to CountryMark diesel fuel buyers, increase the demand for Indiana agricultural products, and add value to our refining assets."" This move is part of a larger, over $100 million expansion project at the refinery, which also includes other upgrades to improve diesel fuel quality and production.

Topsoe's HydroFlex® technology, which has been in use since 2010, is a key enabler of this growth. The technology is renowned for its flexibility, allowing refineries to convert a wide range of fats, oils, and greases into high-quality, ""drop-in"" renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-07 07:56:37.428472

To reach this lofty goal, the federal government established a tax credit (dubbed 45Z, in reference to the relevant section of the tax code) to encourage companies to make sustainable aviation fuel.
The entire sustainable aviation fuel enterprise only works if consumers, suppliers, governments and the airlines themselves can count on policy that delivers real climate solutions.
Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to be a true climate solution, but only if it’s done responsibly.","A pyrrhic victory is a win that comes at such a great cost that it is effectively a defeat. Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel may have just earned such a victory.

Nestled in the federal reconciliation bill was a bipartisan biofuels tax provision: It changes how we count emissions from crop-based fuels, including those used for sustainable aviation fuel — the linchpin of the airline sector’s decarbonization strategy.

At first blush, this change looks like a windfall for those invested in getting sustainable aviation fuels off the ground, including the public officials and industry leaders here in Minnesota working to position the state at the forefront of this effort. In reality, it’s a rebuke of science that undermines public trust and threatens the credibility of sustainable aviation fuel as a legitimate climate solution.

The aviation sector is considered difficult to decarbonize because, unlike ground transportation, electrification isn’t a realistic near-term option. Instead, the sector is looking to low-carbon liquid fuels made from a variety of sources, including crops like corn and soybeans.

While sustainable aviation fuel is still fairly new, it’s expected to grow massively in the coming decades, driven by the federal government’s target of producing 35 billion gallons per year by 2050. That would be enough to supply 100% of domestic air travel.

To reach this lofty goal, the federal government established a tax credit (dubbed 45Z, in reference to the relevant section of the tax code) to encourage companies to make sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is awarded based on a fuel’s carbon intensity — a calculation that takes into account the greenhouse gases emitted throughout the fuel’s entire life cycle. That’s things like the fertilizer used to grow the crops, the trains that transport them and the refineries used for processing.

Within this calculation is a critical climate measure called “indirect land use change.” ILUC, as it’s often abbreviated, is a big deal. It is how we account for the emissions consequences of converting forests, grasslands and wetlands into cropland. If we use conventional summer crops like corn and soybeans to make billions of gallons of new fuel, it could require tens of millions of acres of farmland, displacing existing crops which then need to be grown elsewhere.

Inevitably, this means plowing more natural land both in the U.S. and internationally — a significant environmental cost that must be accounted for in any measurement of climate impact.

But the recent change to 45Z in the reconciliation bill erases ILUC from the carbon calculation for biofuels. It’s an accounting trick with potentially grim consequences.

When producers are allowed to pretend their fuel has lower carbon emissions than it actually does, it opens sustainable fuels up to credible accusations of blatant greenwashing. The entire sustainable aviation fuel enterprise only works if consumers, suppliers, governments and the airlines themselves can count on policy that delivers real climate solutions. Without that trust, the market is destined to fail — and hurt farmers and the aviation industry in the process.

To make matters worse, this change also discourages producers from using crops that could be climate solutions. Case in point: An emerging class of very low-carbon biofuel crops called winter-hardy oilseeds. Research shows these crops hold enormous promise for improving water quality, and critically, they don’t cause indirect land use change.

Winter-hardy oilseeds grow in the offseason, between crops like corn and soybeans, so can share acres with these summer staples. They thrive even in the Upper Great Plains, where our harsh winters have historically inhibited this sort of farming. (There were about 5,000 acres of these types of oilseeds in the ground this spring.)

By growing during a time when soil is usually bare, winter-hardy oilseeds help prevent snowmelt and rainfall from washing topsoil, fertilizer and pesticides into our waterways. And by using land when it would otherwise be vacant, farmers have another crop to harvest and sell.

If we prioritize aviation fuel created from these kinds of crops, we can make both flying and farming more sustainable. But these real solutions can’t compete if Congress fudges the math and ignores the climate impact of indirect land use change.

Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to be a true climate solution, but only if it’s done responsibly. That means using science to shape decisions about policy — not carving out exceptions that erode public trust.

If we scale this fuel using sustainable crops and farming practices, we can avoid wide-scale land conversion while benefiting the aviation industry, American farmers and the planet.

“Lufthansa Cargo is not only a long-standing business partner – we also share the same ambition: making airfreight more sustainable. With our joint focus on SAF, we’re laying the foundation to achieve our climate goals while driving innovative supply chain solutions – powered by Lufthansa Cargo’s efficient Boeing 777F freighter fleet.”

Also commenting on the new sustainability partnership, Lufthansa Cargo’s Head of Global Markets, Anand Kulkarni, added,

“We’ve built a long-standing, trust-based partnership with CEVA Logistics. Taking action together on SAF now sends a strong signal: customers and carriers can drive real progress when working hand in hand. Sustainability is not an add-on for us – it’s an essential part of how we fulfill our purpose: Enabling Global Business.”

In other news, Lufthansa Cargo has today launched their new ‘Passive Temp Support Exposure Time Calculator.’ This tool provides an estimate of how long a passively packaged shipment may remain outside of temperature-controlled environments along a given route, based on operational insights. For passively cooled shipments, those without active temperature control, it’s especially important to understand how long a shipment may be exposed to ambient conditions, such as while on the tarmac, enabling customers to select the appropriate packaging solution. The Exposure Time Calculator visualizes infrastructure capabilities, process times, and existing pharma certifications across the transport chain, while factoring in key parameters such as the required temperature range, shipment type (loose cargo, ULD, or BUP), and shipment dimensions. The new tool is available here.

Lufthansa Cargo is one of the world’s leading cargo airlines and part of the Lufthansa Group, Europe’s largest airline group. In 2024, the company generated revenues of 3.26 billion euros and a transport performance of 8.5 billion freight tonne-kilometers, and currently employs approximately 4,200 team members worldwide. Through five cargo hubs in Frankfurt, Munich, Brussels, Vienna and Rome, the carrier transports an average of 2,500 tons of freight per day across an airport-to-airport network that covers 350 destinations in over 100 countries. Lufthansa Cargo markets the belly-hold cargo capacities Lufthansa Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Discover Airlines, ITA Airways and SunExpress, as well as its own dedicated freighter fleet of 18 Boeing 777F and four Airbus A321F. Additionally, around 300 trucks operate daily under a Lufthansa Cargo flight number. Together with its subsidiaries, Lufthansa Cargo offers customized, fast and efficient logistics solutions along the entire supply chain.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b7a7e5_eebc0ba757b2460f90d1d8f4c3239086~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85/b7a7e5_eebc0ba757b2460f90d1d8f4c3239086~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-08-07 11:58:57.106757

With jet fuel around $85/b and SAF still two to five times more expensive, does the spread threaten SAF adoption?
Jet fuel is only 8% of total output.
But with the diesel market shrinking due to electrification, jet fuel -- and SAF by extension -- may gain more room long-term.
But to do so, we must elevate SAF policy above transport ministries.","How are geopolitical uncertainties, low oil prices and policy recalibration affecting SAF investments and mandates?

The energy transition has lost momentum, especially with the recent shifts in US policy and broader geopolitical volatility. Climate priorities are slipping, even in advanced economies, and developing countries never placed them at the top to begin with -- understandably so, as they wrestle with poverty, energy access and infrastructure gaps.

But aviation remains unique. In 2021, IATA committed the global airline industry to net-zero by 2050. ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) followed in 2022. We're still the only sector with alignment at both the UN and industry levels on such a long-term goal. The commitment is there, but the investment environment has shifted.

Trade friction is also intensifying, with the EU and UK scrutinizing biofuel imports from Asia. How could this impact SAF supply chains and pricing?

It's misguided. We're talking about a tiny, emerging market, and already we see trade barriers, antidumping investigations and regional fragmentation.

Europe's SAF-for-Europe approach favors domestic production and certain airports. That creates inefficiencies, raises costs and disadvantages European airlines globally. Instead of growing the pie, we're slicing it too early.

On one hand, they want scale. On the other, they block cost-effective Asian feedstocks. This kind of policy inconsistency hinders global SAF growth. We should prioritize affordable feedstocks, not penalize them.

With jet fuel around $85/b and SAF still two to five times more expensive, does the spread threaten SAF adoption?

It definitely does. Cheap oil weakens SAF's economic case. Historically, clean energy boomed -- wind and solar, for example -- when oil was expensive. We're in an oversupplied oil market that could last into 2026, further lowering incentives.

Refineries also complicate matters. Jet fuel is only 8% of total output. It competes with diesel internally, and diesel itself competes with gas externally. But with the diesel market shrinking due to electrification, jet fuel -- and SAF by extension -- may gain more room long-term.

Given SAF's cost, can airlines feasibly insource fuel production to manage long-term compliance costs?

That's my fantasy: that every airline could produce its own SAF. But realistically, most airlines can't afford it. With forecast net margins of just 3.7%, aviation isn't investment-grade by banking standards. Only a few large carriers with strong balance sheets can take that leap.

If not insourcing, then what's the most viable way to scale SAF fast?

Co-processing. Refineries already have the infrastructure. ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) allows 5% SAF via co-processing today and some believe it could safely go up to 30%. The UK is moving in that direction. It's the cheapest way to scale without major capital expenditure, and yet uptake remains slow. That's baffling.

Aviation lacks decarbonization alternatives, unlike marine or road transport. But upstream SAF still depends heavily on agri-feedstocks. How can upstream costs be managed, especially when fossil jet fuel is cheap?

As an economist, I view the energy transition as one of the greatest economic opportunities of our time. Historically, mobility and energy have driven global growth, from camels and fire to jet engines and fossil fuels. Now we're stalled. That combination no longer delivers the same prosperity.

The next leap forward requires universal access to sustainable, affordable energy. If we achieve that, we could eliminate poverty -- truly.

Aviation plays a part. Decarbonizing this sector creates cascading benefits for others. But to do so, we must elevate SAF policy above transport ministries. It touches agriculture, energy, commerce, labor and education. It's a whole-of-government challenge.

Fossil fuel subsidies remain a big barrier. How can they be better aligned with SAF goals?

Let's take a look at the US tax code that allows oil companies to write off all operational costs. Renewables don't get the same benefit. That's unjustifiable today when fossil firms report more than 20% margins. Shift those write-offs to clean energy. It would likely be budget-neutral, even fiscally positive.

Another underused tool are guarantees. They don't require upfront cash, just reserves. Default rates are low at 3%-4%, and they de-risk investments. Institutions like the World Bank's MIGA use them for sovereign risks. We need similar mechanisms for airline projects, whether state-owned or not. This is how we build investor confidence.

Is the current SAF shortfall compromising IATA 2030 and 2050 climate targets?

Absolutely, but airlines are committed. We're not working from a surplus. Every milliliter short matters. SAF is the strongest lever, but not the only one. We also lack sufficient offset programs and carbon capture deployment.

We're falling short on all fronts, and that delays everything.

What's your outlook on emerging SAF technologies like algae and direct air capture, especially in regions like Japan and the Middle East?

These are promising but won't scale fast enough. DAC, especially, needs to get much cheaper. For now, the most scalable and affordable option remains co-processing with existing infrastructure.

Southeast Asia may soon have surplus SAF volumes. Could those be redirected to the EU or US? What would that mean for pricing and policy?

Possibly, but not immediately. Take China -- they're scaling SAF for domestic use. That alone is a big milestone. Same with carbon credits: even if not fully in CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), China could generate credits for export, but the current focus is domestic use.

Eventually, when markets like China and India satisfy local demand, they'll look to export. At that point, certification must align with global standards -- ASTM, ICAO. I don't foresee problems, as long as the rules are followed.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-07 09:56:17.688813

Gabriela Hiitola, Senior Vice President at Finnair Cargo, said the collaboration is part of the airline’s broader efforts to increase SAF use. “This move supports our goal to reduce emissions in air freight,” she said. “We invite more of our customers to join us in making air cargo more sustainable.”

Tim Ngan, Executive Director and CEO of CN Logistics, said the initiative fits into the company’s long-term goal to operate more sustainably. “This is a key step in our efforts to reach carbon neutrality. Working with Finnair helps us take action against the impact of air cargo on the environment,” he said.

The partnership supports Finnair’s sustainability plan, which aims to cut carbon emissions per tonne of cargo carried by 34.5% by 2033, compared to 2023 levels. The airline’s target has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and is part of its larger aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

To reach these goals, Finnair is increasing its use of SAF, improving flight operations, and using more fuel-efficient aircraft. The airline operates most of its long-distance routes using Airbus A350s, which are 25% more fuel efficient than older aircraft due to better engines, lighter materials, and advanced wing designs.

Sustainability efforts are also part of the airline’s cargo facilities. The COOL Nordic Cargo Hub at Helsinki Airport, which opened in 2018, was built for long-term energy savings. The building, certified for its environmental design, gets about 37% of its energy from nearly 3,000 solar panels. It also includes systems for automated storage, guided truck movement, and waste management.

Finnair is also committed to reducing waste and using resources more efficiently. It is working toward ensuring that all waste at its Helsinki hub is repurposed—for energy, heat, biogas, manure, or materials—with nothing going to landfill. The airline is cutting down on single-use plastics and improving recycling of packaging, cardboard, and cargo-related materials.

For CN Logistics, this partnership is part of its larger “CNL Green Solution” program.

Today, aviation only has Sustainable Aviation Fuel or ""SAF.""
It can safely be used in today's airplanes and flow seamlessly through the current jet fuel infrastructure to any airport in the country.
A major SAF bill in the Washington State Legislature in 2023 was passed nearly unanimously.
One of the biggest challenges to further SAF production and use is the current cost of SAF compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.","You fly across the country to visit your grandma. The owner of a small manufacturing business in Spokane flies to Europe to finalize a large contract. Vital medical supplies are flown to the site of a disease outbreak.

All of the above and an almost endless number of other examples are made possible by commercial passenger and cargo flights and the jet fuel that powers those flights. Almost all of that fuel today is fossil-based jet fuel.

All that fossil-based jet fuel means that aviation accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions today and, if no action is taken, that number is projected to increase to over 20% of global CO2 emissions by 2050 as the aviation industry continues to grow and other sectors decarbonize.

Aviation is one of the hardest industries to decarbonize. The electric power grid now has a variety of decarbonization options with wind, solar, hydro and nuclear. Road transportation has a credible path to decarbonization with electric vehicles. Buildings have energy efficiency solutions, geothermal heating and clean electricity. Today, aviation only has Sustainable Aviation Fuel or ""SAF.""

There are some exciting developments happening with hydrogen and electric-powered aircraft for small planes (and some of that development is happening in Washington state), but both electric and hydrogen power are impractical for commercial jet planes as potential new fuel replacements because it would require entirely new fuel delivery systems and airport infrastructure, as well as new or retrofitted aircraft.

SAF is an aviation jet fuel made from a variety of feedstocks, including waste cooking oils, renewable natural gas made from the biogas released from landfills and dairy manure digesters; it can even be made from CO2 and green hydrogen.

A big benefit for SAF that makes it ideal for quick airline industry adoption is the fact that SAF is a ""drop-in"" fuel, which is certified for use across the world. It can safely be used in today's airplanes and flow seamlessly through the current jet fuel infrastructure to any airport in the country.

""...it produces reduced particulate matter when used in a jet engine...""

But how safe is it? That's a question I always get when someone learns about SAF for the first time. Safety is at the forefront of any new innovation related to aviation, and SAF has already been proven many times over to meet the very strict jet fuel certification standards and to be safe for commercial use. In fact, if you have flown out of Los Angeles, San Francisco or many other airports in the past few years, you've probably flown on a plane that was at least partially fueled by certified SAF.

In addition to SAF's ability to significantly reduce CO2 emissions compared to regular jet fuel, it also provides local airport air quality benefits because it produces reduced particulate matter when used in a jet engine, which is good news for communities near airports and airport workers.

SAF has enjoyed bipartisan support at both the state and federal levels. A major SAF bill in the Washington State Legislature in 2023 was passed nearly unanimously. And, in the recently passed federal tax bill, SAF had strong bipartisan support and was one of the only Inflation Reduction Act incentives to be extended all the way to 2029.

This bipartisan support stems from a number of benefits, including job creation, energy independence and rural economic development, all while providing significant environmental advantages — carbon reduction and air quality improvement. These diverse benefits create enthusiasm for SAF across the political and geographic spectrum.

SAF is particularly important to Washington state because we are a leader in the development of this still very young industry with a number of organizations doing exciting things in our state already. Not only are we the leading aerospace state generally, but we also have specific SAF-focused organizations, including Boeing, which has been a leader in SAF development since 2006, and Washington State University, which is the leading research institution in the country for sustainable aviation fuel.

Washington aviation leaders — including Spokane International Airport — created the first-ever SAF regional assessment in 2010. And the first test flight ever with SAF, a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 flight from London to New York in 2008, was powered by SAF produced in Washington state! That leadership continues today with supportive state SAF-related policies in Washington and with at least two SAF production plants under development in our state. (For the sake of transparency, I want to disclose that I am a consultant with a company that is working to develop one of these plants.)

But the industry has a way to go before reaching a stable cruising altitude with SAF. Less than 1% of aviation fuel consumed globally is currently SAF, which means we need to make significant progress to achieve the industry's goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.

One of the biggest challenges to further SAF production and use is the current cost of SAF compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. Like many new technologies and products, costs are always higher at the start because of large initial capital investments. To combat the cost challenge, there are some state and federal subsidies for SAF to help the industry get off the ground. Like many new energy-related industries, government support is necessary. This was true for hydro, solar, wind and even for oil.

While the SAF industry is still in its early stages, there are no viable alternatives to make flying significantly cleaner and greener over the next 20 to 30 years. This is a ""must have"" if we want to continue to enjoy the benefits of flying in the long term. Without wider SAF adoption, the airline industry and everyone who relies on commercial aviation could find themselves with a critical challenge, as the environmental cost of flying becomes greater and greater.

With Washington in the lead, hopefully in the not-too-distant future, when you fly to see grandma or take a trip for business or receive that next internet-purchased item that arrived by air, that flight will be powered by SAF, potentially even produced here in our home state. ♦",https://media2.inlander.com/inlander/imager/washington-state-and-the-federal-government-are-in-alignment-on-the-development-and-adoption-of-an-alternative-to-jet-fuel/u/slideshow/30277237/comment2-1-4cf6291bf8eec678.webp?cb=1754525012,N,,2025-08-07 06:56:38.257500

As governments and corporations race to meet net-zero commitments, the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market has emerged as a critical battleground. With the global SAF market projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 48–65% over the next seven years, companies that position themselves at the intersection of innovation, infrastructure, and strategic partnerships will reap outsized rewards. Par Pacific Holdings, Inc. (PARR) is one such player, leveraging its Hawaii Renewables joint venture to carve out a pivotal role in this decarbonizing landscape.

The Hawaii Renewables Joint Venture: A Strategic Masterstroke

Par Pacific's collaboration with Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation to form Hawaii Renewables, LLC is a textbook example of strategic alignment. By combining Par Pacific's refining expertise and existing infrastructure in Hawaii with Mitsubishi's global supply chain capabilities and ENEOS's refining acumen, the joint venture is poised to become the largest renewable fuels facility in the state. The project, set to begin operations by year-end 2025, will produce 61 million gallons annually of renewable diesel, SAF, and low-carbon LPGs, with up to 60% of output dedicated to SAF.

This venture is not merely a production facility—it is a scalable platform. The facility's flexibility to adjust feedstock inputs and output ratios ensures it can adapt to shifting market demands, a critical advantage in a sector still refining its supply chains. Moreover, the $100 million investment from Alohi Renewable Energy (a joint entity of Mitsubishi and ENEOS) signals strong partner confidence, with Par Pacific retaining a controlling 63.5% stake to maintain operational and strategic control.

Market Dynamics: Regulatory Tailwinds and Corporate Commitments

The SAF market's explosive growth is driven by twin forces: regulatory mandates and corporate sustainability pledges. The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, aiming for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030, and the UK's 2% blending mandate for 2025 are just the beginning. Airlines such as Air Canada and Air France-KLM are locking in long-term supply agreements with producers like Neste and TotalEnergies, creating a predictable demand curve.

Par Pacific's Hawaii Renewables venture is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends. Hawaii's status as a major air travel hub—serving over 25 million passengers annually—provides an immediate market for its SAF output. The state's reliance on imported fossil fuels further amplifies the urgency for local, low-carbon alternatives. By aligning with global decarbonization goals, the joint venture taps into a market where supply is still nascent but demand is surging.

Competitive Positioning: From Niche to Necessity

While industry giants like Neste and TotalEnergies dominate the SAF space, Par Pacific's approach is distinct. Rather than competing on scale alone, it is leveraging geographic specificity and operational agility. The Hawaii project's proximity to feedstock sources (e.g., used cooking oil, non-food biomass) and its integration with existing logistics networks reduce costs and carbon footprints. Additionally, the joint venture's access to Mitsubishi's Petro-Diamond Terminal in Long Beach, California, ensures a robust feedstock procurement pipeline.

Critics may argue that Par Pacific lacks the brand recognition of its peers, but this underdog status is a strength. The company's focus on niche markets—such as Hawaii's insular energy needs—allows it to avoid direct competition with global giants while building a defensible position in a high-growth sector.

Investment Thesis: Near-Term Catalysts and Long-Term Potential

For investors, the Hawaii Renewables venture offers a dual catalyst. In the near term, the facility's operationalization by late 2025 will generate immediate cash flow and validate the joint venture's scalability. Regulatory approvals and feedstock contracts are already in motion, with Lazard's financial advisory role adding credibility. Longer term, the project aligns with Par Pacific's broader renewable energy transition, potentially unlocking new revenue streams in renewable naphtha and low-carbon LPGs.

However, risks remain. Feedstock price volatility and regulatory shifts could impact margins. Yet, the joint venture's diversified feedstock strategy and strategic partnerships mitigate these concerns. For patient investors, the key is to view PARR not as a traditional energy play but as a renewable fuels innovator with a clear path to profitability.

Conclusion: A Decarbonization Play with Legs

Par Pacific's pivot to renewable fuels is more than a strategic pivot—it is a repositioning for relevance in a post-carbon world. The Hawaii Renewables joint venture exemplifies the company's ability to blend operational rigor with visionary thinking. As the SAF market accelerates, PARR's early mover advantage in a critical geographic market could translate into outsized returns.

“Indonesia is currently undergoing an energy transition toward environmentally friendly energy. Therefore, we have chosen the overarching theme of the sustainable future of Indonesia’s energy security through the utilization of biomass and bioenergy,” said Dr Meika Syahbana Rusli, Chairman of the SBRC at IPB University.

The 10th ICBB was attended by participants from seven countries. This year, the conference also involved collaboration with the International Society for Biomass and Bioenergy.

Dr Meika continued that one of the topics in this forum was the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is considered a major challenge and strategic opportunity for Indonesia.

He mentioned that Indonesia has shown progress in the development of biofuel, especially in the biodiesel sector. However, SAF still faces technical, economic, and logistical challenges.

“We have made considerable progress in the development of biodiesel. However, there are still many challenges for SAF. Our roadmap for next year is to start implementing 1% SAF of total fuel, then 2,5% in 2030, and 5% in 2035. These are not easy targets,” he explained.

Dr Meika said that SBRC IPB University is also exploring technology for converting solid biomass into bio-oil through a gasification process. Airbus Singapore has shown interest in this approach because lipid sources for SAF will become limited starting in 2030, making biomass the main alternative.

“Airbus has expressed interest because the supply of used oil will be limited. They project that future SAF production must be biomass-based,” he said.

Director of Bioenergy, Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), Edi Wibowo, MSi, emphasized that the government is currently drafting various regulations to support the development of bioenergy.

“This bioenergy is for domestic needs. We want to maximize this potential to support national energy independence and security,” he said.

On this occasion, the Vice Rector for Research, Innovation, and Agromaritime Development at IPB University, Prof Ernan Rustiadi, was also present. He appreciated the hard work of the committee and the contributions of national and international partners.

“Our earth is rich in biological resources in terms of quantity and diversity, which have great potential to be converted into bioenergy,” he said.

How F1 is reducing its carbon emissions and moving towards its Net Zero 2030 goal

Destination-driven emissions also fell by 25% as teams began using sustainable aviation fuel and expanded remote broadcast setups to reduce the need for on-site staff and equipment. Freight operations have become more efficient too, and this is through the use of lighter containers, more fuel-efficient aircrafts, and biofuel trucks in Europe, reducing logistics emissions by 9%. Race event emissions decreased by 12% per event, even as the total number of races grow.

Calendar adjustments have also helped, with several Grands Prix being moved to reduce long-distance travel, and regional hubs are being explored to cut unnecessary shipping. Tyres used in races now include FSC-approved natural rubber, and race weekends rely more on clean energy sources.

Looking forward, F1 has committed to using sustainable fuels in all cars by 2026, with F2 and F3 already running on them in 2025. Here, the fuel is designed to work in existing road cars, offering potential for broader carbon reductions outside the sport.

The work so far reflects changes across teams, partners, promoters and suppliers, and next is scaling these efforts, improving race logistics, increasing use of sustainable aviation fuel, and completing the shift to advanced hybrid engines and low-carbon fuels.

Formula 1 says the aim is not just to cut emissions, but to do it in a way that improves efficiency and creates long-term benefits for the sport and its partners, doubling down on their ethos that performance and sustainability can move forward together without slowing down.

Sasol Ltd. plays a leading role in alternative fuels through its Fischer-Tropsch technology, producing synthetic fuels from natural gas and coal.","Report Overview

The Global Alternative Fuels Market size is expected to be worth around USD 688.2 Billion by 2034, from USD 270.2 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 9.8% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, North America held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 43.2% share, holding USD 0.4 Billion revenue.

The alternative fuel concentrates sector is positioned at the forefront of the global energy transition, as major governments progressively mandate lower carbon-intensity transportation and industrial fuels. In the United States, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) under the Energy Independence and Security Act mandates that renewable fuel blending escalate to 36 billion gallons by 2022, with at least 16 billion gallons from cellulosic biofuels, displacing approximately 13.6 billion gallons of petroleum-based fuel, representing about 7% of transport fuel use.

The Indian government has implemented several policies to promote the adoption of alternative fuels. In August 2024, the Union Cabinet approved the modified Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, extending its timeline until 2028-29 and expanding its scope to include advanced biofuels produced from lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as agricultural and forestry residues, industrial waste, synthesis gas, and algae.

Additionally, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative aims to develop 5,000 CBG plants with a total production capacity of 15 million metric tonnes per annum by 2023–24. These initiatives are designed to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, promote cleaner energy sources, and support rural economies.

Driving factors for industrial uptake include regulatory mandates, carbon pricing mechanisms, subsidy frameworks, and increasing corporate sustainability commitments. Lifecycle GHG reduction performance is notable U.S. EPA data indicates corn ethanol yields ~21% reduction, sugarcane ethanol ~61%, cellulosic ethanol up to 129% reduction compared to fossil fuels. Economic incentives, such as farm income gains of USD13 billion annually by 2022, further reinforce growth.

Government policies provide major impetus. India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme mandates 20 per cent ethanol blending by 2025, projected to save USD 4 billion (₹ 30,000 crore) annually in import substitution by 2025. The national biofuel policy allocated ₹5,000 crore to establish seven second‑generation (2G) bioethanol refineries, as part of a larger spending proposal nearing ₹10,000 crore across 12 planned plants. In 2018, the target was set to deploy 5,000 large‑scale biogas plants capable of producing 15 million tonnes (62 mmcmd) of bio‑CNG annually.

Recent state‑level policies are complementing these. The newly launched Biodev Policy (Amended) 2025 in Bihar supports ethanol and CBG development, with 12 operational ethanol units producing 1,617.5 kilolitres per day, and investment incentives for expansion. In Gujarat, dairy cooperative-led investments of ₹3,300 crore are underway to set up ethanol plants totaling 2,800 KLPD capacity, while 30 CBG plants and 32,550 household biogas units are to be installed at a total investment of ₹1,000 crore—powering 80,000 vehicles annually.

Co-Blending of Ethanol and Fuel Ethers: A Strategic Shift in India’s Biofuel Landscape

India is intensifying its efforts to transition towards cleaner energy sources, with a significant focus on enhancing its biofuels program. A notable development in this direction is the adoption of co-blending strategies, particularly the combination of ethanol with fuel ethers like Methyl Tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE) and Ethyl Tert-Butyl Ether (ETBE). This approach aims to improve fuel quality, reduce emissions, and decrease dependency on imported fossil fuels.

The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), in collaboration with the Asian Clean Fuels Association (ACFA), has highlighted the potential benefits of this co-blending strategy. According to their report, the Indian MTBE market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% by 2030, with 75% of this production intended for gasoline-blending applications.

The integration of fuel ethers into the ethanol blend offers several advantages. It enhances the Research Octane Number (RON) of the fuel, leading to better engine performance and reduced knocking. Additionally, this strategy facilitates the use of lower-value hydrocarbons like C4 and C5 streams in gasoline production, making the blending process more cost-effective.

Furthermore, the co-blending of ethanol and fuel ethers can help mitigate the rise in Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) associated with higher ethanol blending percentages, thereby maintaining fuel stability and reducing evaporative emissions.

The Indian government’s commitment to advancing biofuels is evident in its policy initiatives. The target of achieving 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025–26 underscores the nation’s dedication to reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable energy practices. Incorporating fuel ethers into this strategy represents a pragmatic approach to achieving these goals while addressing technical and economic challenges.

Drivers

Government Policy Support for Biofuels

A significant driver for the growth of alternative fuels in India is the robust policy support provided by the government, particularly in the biofuels sector. The National Policy on Biofuels, introduced in 2018 and amended in 2022, has been instrumental in promoting the production and use of biofuels across the country. This policy outlines clear targets and financial incentives to develop the sector, aiming to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, promote sustainable development, and address environmental concerns.

Under this policy, the government has set an ambitious target of achieving 20% ethanol blending in petrol by the end of 2025. This initiative has led to significant investments in biofuel infrastructure.

For instance, in Gujarat, Amul has pioneered India’s first large-scale trial producing bioethanol from whey, a dairy byproduct, and plans to invest ₹70 crore in expanding this initiative, potentially generating ₹700 crore in additional farmer income. Similarly, 14 companies in the state plan to invest ₹3,300 crore in new ethanol facilities with a combined capacity of 2,800 kilolitres per day.

The government’s support extends beyond financial incentives. The Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, launched in 2019, provides financial assistance to bio-refineries to increase the production of second-generation (2G) ethanol derived from agricultural waste and non-food biomass. This initiative aims to promote the establishment of biofuel plants and encourage innovation in biofuel technologies.

Furthermore, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) initiative promotes the production and use of compressed biogas (CBG) as an alternative to conventional fuels. The government encourages private-sector participation to set up plants that utilize organic waste, including municipal solid waste and agricultural residue, for CBG production.

Restraints

Feedstock Availability and Supply Chain Challenges

One of the primary challenges hindering the growth of alternative fuels in India is the inconsistent and unreliable supply of feedstock. This issue is particularly evident in the production of compressed biogas (CBG) and second-generation (2G) biofuels, which rely heavily on agricultural residues and organic waste. The seasonal nature of crop residues, coupled with inadequate collection and storage infrastructure, leads to significant fluctuations in feedstock availability.

For instance, in Punjab, while the state plans to manage 14.8 lakh tonnes of paddy straw by 2025, current efforts have only resulted in the utilization of 2.5 lakh tonnes through operational CBG projects. The remaining feedstock often goes uncollected or is burned, contributing to air pollution and undermining the intended environmental benefits of biofuel initiatives .

The lack of a robust supply chain exacerbates this problem. Inefficient logistics, inadequate storage facilities, and poor coordination between stakeholders lead to high transportation costs and spoilage of perishable feedstock. These issues not only increase production costs but also deter potential investors due to the perceived financial risks. Moreover, the absence of standardized quality metrics for feedstock further complicates the situation, as variations in calorific value and moisture content can affect the efficiency and output of biofuel plants .

Government initiatives like the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme and the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana aim to address these challenges by promoting the establishment of CBG plants and providing financial support for 2G biofuel refineries. However, the success of these programs is contingent upon the development of a reliable and efficient feedstock supply chain. Without significant investments in infrastructure, technology, and stakeholder coordination, the full potential of India’s biofuel sector remains untapped.

Opportunity

Dairy Sector’s Role in Bioethanol Production

A significant growth opportunity in India’s alternative fuels sector lies in leveraging the dairy industry’s byproducts, particularly whey, to produce bioethanol. This approach not only addresses waste management issues but also aligns with the government’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme, which aims to achieve 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025. The success of this initiative is exemplified by Amul’s recent breakthrough in converting cheese whey into bioethanol.

In a large-scale trial, Amul utilized 4.5 lakh litres of whey to produce 20,000 litres of rectified spirit with 96.71% ethanol purity. Building on this success, Amul plans to invest ₹70 crore in a bioethanol plant with a daily capacity of 50,000 litres, potentially generating an additional ₹700 crore in income for its 3.6 million farmer-owners.

This innovative approach not only provides a sustainable solution to waste management but also contributes to the national goal of reducing dependence on fossil fuels. The government’s support through schemes like the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, which offers financial assistance for setting up advanced biofuel projects, further facilitates the growth of such initiatives.

By tapping into the dairy sector’s potential, India can enhance its bioethanol production capacity, support rural economies, and make significant strides towards energy sustainability. The successful implementation of Amul’s model could serve as a blueprint for other dairy cooperatives across the country, fostering a circular economy and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.

Their study focused on an organic crystal believed to be a promising candidate for an ""altermagnet""- a recently proposed third class of magnetic materials. Unlike conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, altermagnets exhibit unique magnetic behavior.

Details of their breakthrough were published in the journal Physical Review Research on July 7, 2025.

""Unlike typical magnets that attract each other, altermagnets do not exhibit net magnetization, yet they can still influence the polarization of reflected light,"" points out Satoshi Iguchi, associate professor at Tohoku University's Institute for Materials Research. ""This makes them difficult to study using conventional optical techniques.""

To overcome this, Iguchi and his colleagues applied a newly derived general formula for light reflection to the organic crystal, successfully clarifying its magnetic properties and origin.

The group also comprised Yuka Ikemoto and Taro Moriwaki from the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute; Hirotake Itoh from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Kwansei Gakuin University; Shinichiro Iwai from the Department of Physics at Tohoku University; and Tetsuya Furukawa and Takahiko Sasaki, also from the Institute for Materials Research.

The team's newly derived general formula for light reflection was based on Maxwell's equations and is applicable to a wide range of materials, including those with low crystal symmetry, such as the organic compound studied here.

This new theoretical framework also allowed the team to develop a precise optical measurement method and apply it to the organic crystal κ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Cu[N(CN)₂]Cl. They successfully measured the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and extracted the off-diagonal optical conductivity spectrum, which provides detailed information about the material's magnetic and electronic properties.

The results revealed three key features in the spectrum: (1) edge peaks indicating spin band splitting, (2) a real component associated with crystal distortion and piezomagnetic effects, and (3) an imaginary component linked to rotational currents. These findings not only confirm the altermagnetic nature of the material but also demonstrate the power of the newly developed optical method.

To qualify for the tax credit, the SAF must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.
Currently, corn ethanol only has a 19% reduction.
“We need to think long and hard about the most efficient, least destructive proven methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Industry executives and lobbyists can spew their propaganda, but the numbers are clear—corn ethanol with carbon capture won’t get close to low carbon SAF.” said Johannsen.","DES MOINES—The Treasury Department’s latest estimates of greenhouse gas reductions show ethanol with carbon capture is not a realistic option for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) tax credits.

Just as with carbon capture and storage, the federal government has provided a tax credit as an incentive for the production of SAF. Producers of SAF are eligible for a tax credit of $1.25 per gallon of SAF produced. To qualify for the tax credit, the SAF must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

Currently, corn ethanol only has a 19% reduction. Other fuel sources scored much higher, such as cooking oil (81%) and rendered fat (80%).

The Treasury Department’s guidance offers multiple pathways for reducing emissions. The accounting for climate-smart farming techniques (like no-till, cover cropping, and the use of enhanced efficiency nitrogen fertilizer) only add up to a 10-point reduction in the carbon intensity score of corn ethanol.

“The detailed numbers produced by the modeling also shine a light on the false promise of carbon capture, since what would be captured at ethanol facilities is only the biogenic CO2—and capturing that fails to make a meaningful difference in the overall calculation of life cycle GHG emissions,” said landowner Jessica Wiskus, who opposes the build-out of carbon dioxide pipelines across Iowa.

Based on EPA numbers of greenhouse gas emissions reported annually, carbon capture of biogenic CO2 at ethanol plants would reduce on-site facility emissions by only 1-5%, putting corn ethanol far below the 50% reduction goal. Ethanol plants emit both anthropogenic and biogenic CO2, but only the biogenic CO2—the CO2 released from the fermentation of the corn—would be captured by the facilities that Summit Carbon has proposed. But not only does the biogenic CO2 account for a tiny fraction of the total CO2 generated through the production of corn ethanol—biogenic CO2 is, in fact, already considered carbon-neutral in the new Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions model released by the U.S. Department of Energy, whether captured or not captured.

“Summit wants to condemn my farmland for their pipeline when the numbers show that their technology won’t make any real difference in mitigating the carbon footprint of ethanol,” said landowner Don Johannsen.

Sierra Club and landowners also question the efficacy of carbon capture technology, for example pointing out concern about the amount of water needed for a massive scale up of carbon capture facilities at ethanol plants.

“We need to think long and hard about the most efficient, least destructive proven methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Industry executives and lobbyists can spew their propaganda, but the numbers are clear—corn ethanol with carbon capture won’t get close to low carbon SAF.” said Johannsen.",https://www.algona.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/favicon-defaults-2.png,N,,2025-08-07 00:56:28.740721

How can we make sure that we are there to innovate around energy and make things work, and how do we keep rural areas thriving?” he said.
But uncertainty continues to rise to the top, including around trade deals, rural economies and health care for rural communities.
While uncertainty has been a word tossed around often in the last few years, Walz said there are things happening in Minnesota to help.","MORGAN, Minn. — In a time of uncertainty, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said one thing that remains certain is the resilience of Minnesota farmers.

“I think there is a deep understanding that, economically, culturally, in our position in the world, it’s incumbent on Minnesota to understand how do we continue to feed an ever-growing world? How can we make sure that we are there to innovate around energy and make things work, and how do we keep rural areas thriving?” he said.

He shared that message during a visit to Minnesota Farmfest on Wednesday, Aug. 6, where he addressed crowds prior to a talk on the future outlook of Minnesota’s agricultural higher education and workforce.

Walz said he’s heard of the depressed commodity prices. He knows the cattle producers are feeling good. But uncertainty continues to rise to the top, including around trade deals, rural economies and health care for rural communities.

“I think overall we’ve had a pretty good summer. I think crops are in pretty good shape; again, those commodity prices are too low, but it’s a resilient group of folks,” Walz said.

Grain marketers noted during the Farmfest event that a big crop in the fields is not helping the current price of commodities. Farmers also commented that, because of those low prices, they need every bushel they can squeeze out of their fields.

While uncertainty has been a word tossed around often in the last few years, Walz said there are things happening in Minnesota to help.

He said being able to come to the table and pass a bipartisan budget and agriculture bill is important in getting things done and funding necessary work. Another area is voluntary conservation programs that producers are jumping up to be involved in like the Ag Water Quality Certification Program .

Minnesota continues to be a leader in agricultural innovation, as it has for decades. He mentioned Norman Borlaug’s work to increase yields and solve world hunger issues in the early part of the 20th century, eventually being named the “father of the green revolution.”

He said Minnesota ag producers remain at the forefront of innovation today and must continue to be supported.

Globally, he mentioned the state government will continue to work to expand markets. He said they’ll make visits to Ireland, Switzerland and Germany soon.

But he said creating markets at home is also of chief importance.

“Ag Commissioner (Thom) Petersen is out a lot trying to establish those new markets. But I think more importantly here, trying to enhance our biofuels here in Minnesota with sustainable aviation fuel.”

Sustainable aviation fuel was a main topic of a Tuesday panel focused on sustainability in Midwest agriculture. While work is advancing in that area, it is one that is not likely to bring farmers relief from low commodity prices in the short-term. But it could be a major boost for those that can weather the current economic hardships and for those generations coming up the ladder.

Walz said Minnesota has an obligation to continue to support the next generation through such avenues as higher education so they can be as resilient as the generations that came before them.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/5a207b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd6%2F7f%2Fe8484a544af2b021e4d677dcebbf%2Fwalzsoybean.JPG,N,,2025-08-06 18:56:24.949070

A decline in renewable road fuel would increase biomass availability in the later 2020s.
Both the waste-derived biodiesel feedstocks and the ethanol feedstocks can be used to create aviation fuel, with the appropriate processing technologies.

It should fall within the HEFA cap, i.e. allowing either HEFA or U.K. crop-based AtJ SAF to be used to fulfil the HEFA cap.

In 2021, in our response to the (first) SAF mandate consultation, we argued that crop based ethanol should become eligible for the SAF mandate when it is no longer required for decarbonizing road transport.

We are now in this situation. UK produced bioethanol is no longer required for decarbonizing road transport. That is not because electrification has eroded demand, but as a consequence of the Tariff Free Quota carelessly and shockingly handed to the US in the US-UK Trade deal agreed on 8th May this year, and which became law on 30th June. As members will be aware, the TRQ covers 1.4bn liters bioethanol, a volume which corresponds to the demand required for supplying E10.

The previous Government was supportive of this position. In Targeting net zero – next steps for the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation: Government response, dated July 2021, it envisaged that a decline in requirements for road fuel would open up the opportunity for these fuels to be used for SAF production. To quote from page 20 of that document:

“We know we will need renewable fuel for aviation and freight. We need to encourage and support these sectors. We are working closely with industry on how to do this, in particular, on proposals for a sustainable aviation fuel mandate, and plan to publish a consultation on this soon. As a result of such a mandate, over time there will be a transition of the renewable road fuels market over to an aviation one. A decline in renewable road fuel would increase biomass availability in the later 2020s. Both the waste-derived biodiesel feedstocks and the ethanol feedstocks can be used to create aviation fuel, with the appropriate processing technologies. This presents us, and UK industry, an opportunity to push forward the transition of feedstocks currently used for road fuel to other sectors.”

The Act includes the following significant transition provisions and other changes with respect to energy tax credits:

accelerates the phase-outs for solar and wind projects under the tech-neutral investment tax credits (ITCs) and production tax credits (PTCs), but retains the longer runway for non-wind and solar generation (e.g., storage, hydropower and geothermal);

modifies the advanced manufacturing PTCs (45X Credits) by curtailing wind-component eligibility, providing temporary credits for metallurgical coal, and revising rules for integrated producers;

extends the eligibility timeframe for clean fuel production tax credits (45Z Credits) and modifies the 45Z Credit values and computation methodology;

eliminates after 2025 tax credits for commercial and residential electric vehicles (with a phase-down depending on volume of cars sold), individual tax credits for residential solar systems and the tax credits for charging stations and energy efficient homes; and

adopts foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules imposing certain foreign supply chain and ownership restrictions on taxpayers seeking certain tax credits, including ITCs and PTCs.

These changes are discussed in greater detail below. A quick reference chart and applicability roadmap are included at the end of this Alert.

Key Changes Affecting Energy Tax Credits

Sections 48E (Technology-Neutral ITC) and 45Y (Technology-Neutral PTC)

If a wind or solar facility does not begin construction within one year of the Act’s enactment (i.e., by July 4, 2026), then ITCs and PTCs are terminated unless the facility is placed in service on or before December 31, 2027. New “beginning of construction” guidance is expected to be issued pursuant to a recent executive order (discussed below).

The phase-out of the Section 48E ITC and Section 45Y PTC for all other qualified facilities — including energy storage facilities and fuel cells — begins in 2034. Facilities that begin construction in 2034 will be eligible for 75% of the full credit amount, dropping to 50% for construction beginning in 2035, and phasing out entirely for projects beginning in 2036 or later.

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the 48E ITC and 45Y PTC will no longer be available for investments in certain qualified properties under Section 25D — such as solar water heating or residential small wind energy systems — if the taxpayer rents or leases the property to a third party during the taxable year.

Executive Order Targeting Solar and Wind Credits

On July 7, 2025, the president issued an executive order (the EO) directly targeting ITCs and PTCs for solar and wind facilities. The EO directs Treasury to issue new “beginning of construction” guidance for purposes of Sections 45Y and 48E by August 18, 2025. According to the EO, this guidance will restrict “the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” This guidance could significantly impact safe harbor strategies on which taxpayers have historically relied.

This EO signals the Trump administration’s intention to increase enforcement of the technical requirements for solar and wind energy tax credits. This additional scrutiny builds upon the Biden administration’s ramp-up in audits of taxpayers claiming green energy tax credits. Taxpayers should maintain detailed, contemporaneous documentation to support eligibility for any credits claimed.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing)

The Act phases out or eliminates the Section 45X Credit at different rates depending on the component or critical mineral produced.

For critical minerals — excluding metallurgical coal, which is newly eligible but only through 2029 — the 45X Credit begins to phase out starting in 2031. Specifically, the credit is reduced to 75% for critical minerals produced in 2031, 50% in 2032, 25% in 2033 and fully eliminated for critical minerals produced in 2034 and beyond.

The current phase-out schedule for the 45X Credit for advanced manufacturing of solar and storage components remains unchanged. However, the credit is eliminated for wind components sold after December 31, 2027. Additionally, for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, battery modules qualify for the credit only if they are “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, and other energy collection equipment.”

Under the “FEOC Ownership Restrictions” described below, for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, taxpayers are ineligible for the 45X Credit if they either receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity or are themselves classified as a prohibited foreign entity.

Finally, the Act introduces new requirements for vertically integrated producers that generate multiple 45X Credits by manufacturing more than one eligible component. For taxable years beginning after 2026, the credit will be available only if the “primary” eligible component is integrated into a “secondary” eligible component within the same facility and the secondary component is sold to an unrelated party. In addition, at least 65% of the secondary component’s direct material costs must be attributable to primary components mined, produced, or manufactured in the U.S.

Section 45Z (Clean Fuels)

The Act extends the Section 45Z Credit for two years through December 31, 2029, but eliminates the $1.75 increased credit value that was previously available for sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) produced after 2025.

For clean fuels produced after 2025, the 45Z Credit is unavailable if any foreign feedstocks — that is, feedstocks that are not produced in the U.S., Mexico or Canada — are used in their production. And for clean fuels that can be used as feedstocks for other clean fuels (such as clean ethanol used to produce clean jet fuel), the definition of “transportation fuel” has been revised to require that the base fuel not be one for which a 45Z Credit is claimed.

When determining a fuel’s carbon intensity, the Act excludes emissions attributed to indirect land use change, which should in many cases reduce the carbon intensity and increase the credit’s value. For example, if a forest is cleared to grow crops for biofuels, the net emission increase associated with the land use change will be excluded from the lifecycle analysis, resulting in lower reported emissions. The Act also removes negative emissions rates — except for certain animal manure feedstocks — when calculating the value of the 45Z Credit.

Under the “FEOC Ownership Restrictions” described below, the 45Z Credit is unavailable to any taxpayer that is either a specified foreign entity for taxable years after July 4, 2025, or a foreign-influenced entity (ignoring, for this purpose, any payments made to a specified foreign entity that provides the specified foreign entity with certain effective control over the taxpayer’s facility).

The SAF credit under Section 6426 is eliminated for any SAF (i) for which a 45Z Credit is claimed, if such SAF was sold or used after July 4, 2025, or (ii) sold or used after September 30, 2025.

The Act adds a new 20-cent-per-gallon small agri-biodiesel producer credit under Section 40A. The new credit — which can be stacked with the 45Z Credit and transferred under Section 6418 — is available for fuel produced after June 30, 2025, and sold or used before 2027.

Section 45Q (Carbon Capture and Sequestration)

The Act retains the Section 45Q Credit for qualified facilities that start construction before 2033. For equipment or qualified facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the amount of the 45Q Credit for enhanced oil recovery activities and carbon sequestration activities is the same. Beginning in 2027, the credit’s value is indexed for inflation.

Under the “FEOC Ownership Restrictions” described below, for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the 45Z Credit is unavailable to any taxpayer that is either a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity (ignoring, for this purpose, any payments made to a specified foreign entity that provides the specified foreign entity with certain effective control over the taxpayer’s facility).

Section 45V (Clean Hydrogen)

The Act terminates the Section 45V clean hydrogen PTC for facilities that begin construction after 2027.

Publicly traded partnerships are allowed to treat income from the transportation or storage of liquified or compressed hydrogen as “qualifying” income.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

Historically, direct or indirect ownership by certain individuals and entities incorporated in or with a strong nexus to China, North Korea, Russia or Iran (each, a ""covered nation""), jeopardized eligibility for the clean vehicle and advanced microchip tax credits. However, using supply chains with components from a covered nation did not previously impact credit eligibility. The Act introduces new FEOC rules that expand these restrictions and include both ownership and supply chain involvement.

FEOC Ownership Restrictions

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the Act prohibits any taxpayer that is a “prohibited foreign entity” from claiming most ITCs and PTCs. Prohibited foreign entities include “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities.”

A “specified foreign entity” is an FEOC or covered nation described in one of several lists maintained pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal years 2021 and 2024 or any “foreign-controlled entity.” A “foreign-controlled entity” includes a subnational government body, agency or instrumentality of a covered nation, as well any entity that is 50% or more owned by, or that is organized or has its principal place of business in, a covered nation (or a subnational body, agency or instrumentality thereof).

A “foreign-influenced entity” is any entity with respect to which one or more specified foreign entities:

can appoint directors, executives or equivalent officers;

hold an aggregate 40% or more of the equity (or 25% if held by a single specified foreign entity);

for publicly traded companies, hold an aggregate 15% or more of the debt; or

receive, in the prior taxable year, payments under a contractual arrangement giving a specified foreign entity (or an entity related thereto) specific authority over “key aspects” of, or intellectual property rights related to, a qualified facility or energy storage technology owned by the entity or an eligible component produced by the entity.

There is a limited exception for bona fide purchases or sales of intellectual property rights that do not confer “effective control” on a specified foreign entity. However, under the statutory language, it appears that entering or modifying an intellectual property licensing agreement with a specified foreign entity after July 4, 2025, generally is deemed to confer “effective control,” resulting in the licensee being treated as a “foreign-influenced entity” (and thus a prohibited foreign entity).

The determination of whether a taxpayer is a prohibited foreign entity is made on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers) and on the last day of the taxable year for all subsequent years (i.e., on December 31, 2027, and thereafter, for calendar-year taxpayers).

For the Section 48E ITC, the Act includes a 10-year recapture period if a taxpayer claiming the credit for any taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027, makes certain “applicable payments” during the recapture period. Applicable payments include those made to a specified foreign entity that result in such entity obtaining effective control over a qualified facility.

FEOC Supply Chain Restrictions

Projects that begin construction after 2025 — based on the now-codified solar and wind start-of-construction safe harbors1 — will be ineligible for ITCs and PTCs if they receive “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” This restricts eligibility for projects that rely heavily on components sourced from China or other covered nations. A limited transition safe harbor applies to products manufactured under contracts executed before June 16, 2025.

The Act uses a “material assistance cost ratio” to determine if a taxpayer received “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” If a project’s ratio is below the applicable threshold percentage, then the taxpayer is treated as having received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity, rendering the project ineligible for ITCs and PTCs.

The material assistance cost ratio is computed by dividing (i) the direct costs of manufactured products (for qualified facilities or energy storage property, as defined in existing domestic content guidance) or direct material costs (ii) for eligible components not attributable to a prohibited foreign entity by the total direct material costs.

As shown below, the applicable threshold percentage — below which credit eligibility is lost — varies by facility, property or component type, and depends on the taxable year in which construction begins on the facility or property or the component is sold (starting in 2026).

48E Tech-Neutral ITCs and 45Y Tech-Neutral PTCs Begins Construction in: 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 and after Qualified Facility (e.g., solar PV, wind) 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% EST 55% 60% 65% 70% 75% 45X Credits for Eligible Components Components Sold in: 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 and after Solar 50% 60% 70% 80% 85% Wind 85% 90% N/A N/A N/A Inverter 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% Battery Component 60% 65% 70% 80% 85% 45X Credits for Critical Minerals Components Sold in: 2026–2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 and after 0% 25% 30% 40% 50%

The Act also directs Treasury to publish “safe harbor tables” in future guidance, which taxpayers may rely on to determine the percentage of costs attributable to manufactured products or eligible components — provided they do not know the listed percentage is inaccurate. In the interim, taxpayers may rely on the tables included in IRS Notice 2025-08, issued under the existing domestic content rules.

Significant Treasury and IRS guidance will be needed to help taxpayers interpret and comply with these new FEOC supply chain restrictions.

Section 6418 (Transferability), Depreciation

The Act preserves transferability of renewable energy tax credits under Section 6418 for the full duration of the applicable credit period. However, it introduces an FEOC restriction that prohibits the transfer of any portion of the credits under Sections 45Q, 45X, 45Y, 45Z or 48E to any specified foreign entity.

In addition, the Act restores bonus depreciation (i.e., 100% expensing), including for energy properties. Qualified facilities eligible for ITCs and PTCs are also eligible for 5-year accelerated depreciation.

Kushaagra Nandan is well versed in the gambit of green energies and is upbeat about India’s leadership role in lowering carbon emission. Here he speaks candidly about India’s quest for green energy — challenges, bottlenecks and solutions — that could take india forward towards green and clean future with India Business & Trade (IBT), in arrangement with The Pioneer. Here are the excerpts.

How is India placed for the global leader in biofuel technology?

India is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in biofuel technology — not just on cost, but through strategic strengths that foster innovation and scale. Our diverse agro-climatic zones demand adaptable, multi-feedstock technologies, which naturally drive R&D and innovation. Combined with India's excellence in engineering, this enables the development of scalable, affordable solutions tailored for both domestic and global markets. Another key advantage is the growing synergy between startups, academia, and policymakers in the clean energy space — creating a dynamic ecosystem for biofuel innovation. With a large and growing domestic market demand for alternate fuels, India is well placed to build and refine biofuel models that are globally relevant.

According to IEA, India is poised to become the fastest growing bioenergy market in the world by 2030, expected to contribute more than a third of global bioenergy demand growth.

Key initiatives like the National Bioenergy Programme, SATAT, GOBARdhan, and advancement in achieving E20 targets along with net-zero objectives through just energy transition reflect India's long-term commitment to clean energy.

At RED, we're contributing to this national mission through our four integrated verticals-T-EPC, project development, feedstock aggregation, and product manufacturing — covering the entire biofuel value chain. As part of our efforts toward India's goal of establishing 5,000 Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants by 2030 under SATAT, we've launched comprehensive engineering solutions for small-scale CBG plants. These solutions aim to bring innovation, quality, and affordability to the forefront of the CBG sector, reinforcing India's potential to export complete project solutions — from technology to financing frameworks.

With E20/E30 blending goals, is India's ecosystem truly ready?

India's E20 rollout marks a significant milestone, signalling strong policy intent and commendable progress by the industry along with the evolving ecosystem to support this transition at scale. However, Engine compatibility remains a key concern, particularly across older segments of the vehicle fleet. At the same time, upgrades are urgently needed across the fuel value chain — especially in storage, logistics, and the widespread availability of multi-grade dispensers. Equally critical is the need to strengthen quality control and monitoring frameworks to ensure fuel consistency and performance. Without this, even the best policy targets risk falling short in implementation. For the transition to be successful, it must be phased and regionally calibrated, with alignment from OEMs, awareness among consumers, and coordination across all stakeholders.

How can biofuel projects become more attractive?

To make biofuel projects more attractive to ESG and institutional investors, it must focus on reducing risk and increasing scalability. Long-term policy stability and clear regulatory frameworks are foundational — they create market confidence allowing certainty and long term visibility to investors.

Standardising key components like plant designs, feedstock contracts, and performance benchmarks will improve bankability and ease due diligence for financial institutions.

Equally important is the availability of blended finance tools-such as green bonds, viability gap funding, and partial risk guarantees — that can help de-risk early-stage investments and lower project costs.

Monetising carbon credits through verified MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) systems can unlock additional revenue streams and strengthen project viability. Most critically, we need transparent, ready-to-scale platforms — like the one we're building at RED — that offer integrated techno-financial solutions.

These platforms serve as bridges between clean energy projects and serious capital, enabling investment at scale and speed.

How can biofuel demand empower rural farmers?

Farmers need to be one of the key stakeholders in India's biofuel journey. With the right ecosystem in place, the growing demand for biofuels can transform agri-waste — such as crop residue, bamboo, and other biomass — into a consistent income stream for rural communities.

To make this a reality, we need structured procurement programs that ensure fair pricing and assured offtake.

It is also important to have access to shared infrastructure — like rental balers, mobile chippers, and transport-along with the establishment of village-level collection centres and pre-processing hubs. These measures will not only help monetise crop waste but also will significantly reduce stubble burning and related emissions. At RED, we've already begun enabling this shift. One of our four core verticals is feedstock aggregation, where we collect feedstocks like paddy straw, soya husk, and cane trash for biofuel production. Today, we operate more than 56 round balers making us the largest aggregation fleet operator and service provider in the country.

I strongly believe that by making farmers one of the primary stakeholders-not just suppliers — we can create a model where clean energy and rural prosperity go hand in hand.

Can digital technologies transform the biofuel value chain?

Yes, I believe digital technologies will play a pivotal role in transforming the biofuel value chain. AI can help in forecasting biomass availability by analysing weather patterns, cropping cycles, and market data-allowing for smarter planning. IoT sensors installed in digesters offer real-time insights into feedstock quality, system performance, and yield efficiency, enabling predictive maintenance and minimising downtime. Blockchain, too, is proving valuable by ensuring transparency and traceability in feedstock sourcing and carbon credit validation.

At RED, we're actively embracing this digital shift. We're deploying drone-based baling audits and digital plant dashboards that are streamlining operations, improving visibility, and driving better decision-making across the value chain.

Can India emerge as a global SAF supplier?

India has the potential, resources and market demand to become a major player in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market, but it will take coordinated, strategic action across policy, infrastructure, and innovation. A Deloitte India report highlights that India generates 230 tonnes of agricultural residue, a resource that can be channeled into SAF production. Combined with waste oils, this positions India strongly on the raw material front.

However, to match the momentum of regions like the US and EU — where robust mandates and incentives are already in place — India needs policy mandates for SAF blending in domestic aviation, along with investments in technology, refining capacity, certification mechanisms, and sustained R&D.

Public-private partnerships, access to enabling finance and export-friendly frameworks, will be key to unlocking India's role in the global SAF supply chain.

How can India ensure credibility in its biofuel sustainability claims?

Sustainability in biofuels must be transparent and led by science. Mandating lifecycle emission assessments, encouraging third-party certifications, and using non-edible, waste-based feedstocks are key. Further, investments in zero-liquid discharge and water recycling systems in manufacturing units will help reduce water usage. I believe that all sustainability initiatives undertaken should be verifiable, auditable and a core part of business operations.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.","The Minnesota Star Tribune reported last fall that the first sustainable aviation fuel, made from a Minnesota-grown crop called winter camelina, powered a Delta Air Lines flight from the Twin Cities to New York City. It marked the beginning of a plan by Minnesota SAF Hub—a coalition including Bank of America, Delta, Ecolab, and Xcel Energy—to eventually convert all Delta flights from MSP to bio-based jet fuels to reduce greenhouse gases.

You may think the sole star of the show here is sustainable aviation fuel. But, as a long-ago radio personality used to say, now for the rest of the story.

By tapping into the market for plant-based aviation fuel, University of Minnesota researchers at the Forever Green Initiative are commercializing two oil-producing plants—winter camelina and domesticated pennycress—that can give farmers a payday for planting winter cover crops that hold soil, take up excess nutrients, and help protect the quality of Minnesota’s streams and groundwater.

Mitch Hunter, associate director of the University’s Forever Green Initiative, says “What we’re trying to do is develop crops that make farmers money, and in the process, provide all those environmental benefits that we’ve been trying to get to for so long with very little success.”

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also recently awarded the University $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand project. It was selected as one of six projects working to “advance the production of low carbon intensity, purpose-grown energy crops critical to accelerating a clean energy bioeconomy.

From Cover Crops to Jet Fuel

This story really begins with “the big brown spot”—the vast agriculture region of the upper Midwest that stands barren from October through April, with nothing growing to protect the soil. “You can see the brown of this uncovered landscape from space,” says Hunter.

That bare earth is prone to wind and water erosion. Runoff of nutrients, especially nitrogen, into streams and groundwater fertilizes lakes, pollutes sources of drinking water, and contributes to the “dead zone” at the end of the Mississippi River. Says Hunter, “When soil has nothing living on it, rain falls, filters through the soil, and draws those nutrients directly into our waterways. You have to have a plant living there to take up the nitrogen and the phosphorus.”

The solution—plant something, anything, to hold soil and take up excess nutrients until the next cash crop is planted. A recent report by Forever Green partners, including consultants Ecotone Analytics and Friends of the Mississippi River, estimated that widespread use of cover crops could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23 percent and soil erosion by 35 percent by 2050.

But folks have promoted cover crops for a long time. “They get a lot of buzz, and they’re adopted in Minnesota on 2 or 3 percent of the total cropland, despite years and years and years of education and investment and incentives,” says Hunter. “So that model isn’t working.”

The problem? Cover crops take both time and money.

The Many Contributions of the Forever Green Initiative

So about 30 years ago, the late Don Wyse, Forever Green cofounder and codirector, began working with farmers to grow a perennial rye grass that not only anchors soil, but can be sold for commercial grass seed. Says Hunter, “All of a sudden, you transformed the cropping systems in that region to have perennial cover for a large part of the rotation, and it was all because they developed a crop that actually made farmers money.”

Wyse and his colleagues went prospecting for other potentially profitable cover crops. Of 15 or so, two are pertinent to our story today. The first is winter camelina, an old crop from Europe related to cabbage, kale, broccoli, and canola. Like canola, it produces tiny seeds with an oil content as high as 35 percent. The other is pennycress, a new crop bred from a ubiquitous weed. Like camelina, it is rich in oil, exceptionally winter hardy, and even quicker to grow and mature.

Forever Green’s plan is to target the more than 2 million acres in Minnesota used to raise spring wheat, corn silage, alfalfa, and small grains—crops that are harvested in early fall. Then farmers can plant winter camelina or pennycress, let it grow through late fall, winter, and early spring, and harvest the oil seed crop in late spring before planting the next cash grain crop.

But how to market camelina or pennycress oil seeds to get a good price? Selling them for food-grade oil means competing with a lot of well-established oils like canola and sunflower. Sustainable diesel fuel is a possibility, but ground transportation seems to be moving toward electrification.

Enter sustainable aviation fuel, a use that’s growing exponentially. Aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global emission of the carbon dioxide that drives climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Like other fields of transportation, aviation seeks to reduce its fossil fuel use.

Trains, trucks, and automobiles have been able to replace internal combustion engines with electric motors and massive banks of batteries. Unfortunately, in the air, every ounce counts—so aviation has looked to fuels from renewable biological sources such as used cooking fat and dedicated energy crops.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.

Hunter adds that state incentives and private support will continue to further the development of sustainable fuels and environmentally beneficial farming practices

“That market is extremely hungry for oil,” says Hunter. “If we had a big supply right now, we could sell it.”

The Dutch and Belgian governments plan to exclude biofuels made from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats — listed under RED Annex IX Part B — from counting towards maritime fuel mandates. This contrasts with FuelEU Maritime, which rewards their use to cut shipping emissions. The divergence is expected to distort supply-demand dynamics and raise compliance costs for suppliers and shipowners.

Draft legislation in both countries obliges fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across land, inland shipping and maritime sectors. Under the Dutch RED III draft, Annex IX Part B biofuels — including UCO and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — will count towards land and inland shipping mandates only, capped at 4.29pc and 11.07pc respectively. For international maritime shipping, the cap is set at zero. This means suppliers cannot claim emission reduction units (EREs) for Part B fuels used in maritime shipping, effectively disincentivising UCO-based biodiesel sales in the ARA region.

FuelEU Maritime, by contrast, mandates GHG cuts for maritime users starting at 2pc in 2025, rising to 80pc by 2050, and places no cap on Part B fuels. Like FuelEU Maritime, the Dutch RED III draft excludes crop-based biofuels from counting towards maritime GHG reduction targets. But unlike FuelEU, it also bars Annex IX Part B fuels — creating a sharper compliance gap for bunker suppliers.

This leaves used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) in a precarious position. Widely used in marine fuels due to its scale and compatibility with existing engines, Ucome-based blends will remain attractive to shipowners aiming to meet FuelEU Maritime targets. But ARA suppliers will need to sell Annex IX Part A fuels — such as bio-LNG or Advanced Fame 0 — to meet RED III targets or face penalties. This could push up Ucome prices, as suppliers seek to to offset non-compliance costs.

Advanced Fame 0-based marine biodiesel blends are currently attractive to buyers because marine mandates have not yet taken effect. Under the existing system, HBE-G renewable tickets — which will be replaced by EREs next year — can be deducted from the price of Part A fuels, but this may not be viable next year. Part B fuels from the marine sector do not currently generate HBEs.

Higher Ucome prices may inflate maritime-generated ERE values and boost demand for Part A fuels, raising overall biofuel costs and reducing ARA's competitiveness. Some shipowners may opt to bunker elsewhere. Many already source marine biodiesel from Asia, where prices are lower. Argus assessed B30 Ucome dob ARA at an average of $805.30/t during May–July, compared with $705.48/t in Singapore.

Prices for alternatives like RFNBOs and ammonia remain high, limiting near-term uptake. FuelEU abatement prices for Ucome-MGO and Ucome-VLSFO have been relatively flat this year, but could rise if Ucome prices firm.

Market reactions

Market participants are exploring ways to navigate the mandates. One option is blending small volumes of Advanced Fame 0 into bunker fuels, although this is logistically complex and could raise prices at ARA ports.

Another strategy involves sourcing marine-generated ERE tickets from over-compliant sellers. But supply may be tight, as only a limited share of inland and land-generated tickets can be transferred to the marine sector under the flexible credit allowance.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-08-06 13:56:44.899884

PAUL — A large increase to air and water permit fees rolled out on Friday, Aug. 1, by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has now been paused.
It is clear that more conversation and engagement are needed before the agency moves forward with application fee increases outlined in state rules.
A rule established in 2009 specifies that air and water permit application fees must be adjusted for inflation over time.
A water application fee that includes such infrastructure as feedlots in 2025 was $310 per point.
Likewise, the air application fee would have increased from $285 per point to $400.","ST. PAUL — A large increase to air and water permit fees rolled out on Friday, Aug. 1, by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has now been paused.

The announcement came after industry leaders and political leaders representing agriculture called the rollout untimely and unexpected .

On Tuesday morning, MPCA interim assistant communications director Dan Ruiter shared a statement from MPCA about the pause:

“The MPCA appreciates the feedback we received over the last week about the planned permit application fee increases. It is clear that more conversation and engagement are needed before the agency moves forward with application fee increases outlined in state rules. The MPCA will be pausing implementation of all air and water permit application fee increases while we schedule engagement sessions to hear additional feedback and plan thoughtful next steps. The agency values our shared work with permit holders to protect the environment and human health.""

Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, released a statement about the fee increase on Friday, Aug. 1. He shared that despite more than a dozen feedlot rulemaking meetings across the state in recent months, the increases were not previewed or communicated to the Department of Agriculture or Minnesota’s farmers and producers.

“I’m disappointed that these increases were not discussed in the many meetings that occurred in recent months surrounding feedlot permitting,"" Putnam said in a news release. ""I’ve talked to hundreds of farmers, and most aren’t opposed to updates to feedlot permitting. But they are rightly concerned about being shut out of the process — and that’s what happened today.""

When news of the pause was announced on the first day of Farmfest , on Tuesday, Aug. 5, Putnam was glad to hear that the MPCA would be hosting sessions to hear from the agriculture community.

He added that while increases to the fees were needed, that should be done in an approach that involves communicating with those it affects.

The fee increases stem from an attempt to adjust for inflation, and the fees have not been changed since 2009.

Prior to the pause, ag groups were made aware of the increase in an email on Thursday, July 31, from MPCA Feedlot Section manager Lisa Scheirer:

“On August 1, 2025, the MPCA is updating application fees for air and water permits. A rule established in 2009 specifies that air and water permit application fees must be adjusted for inflation over time. This update will align permit fees with the existing rule and help secure sufficient resources to protect Minnesota’s environment.”

The fees are to support the agency’s work “to protect Minnesota’s environment and public health by partially funding the technical review, analysis, implementation, compliance and enforcement that goes into every permit issued by the MPCA,” according to the MPCA website .

The original increases of 48% and 56% were not well received by ag groups, who quickly voiced their opposition to the way the changes were implemented without prior notice.

A water application fee that includes such infrastructure as feedlots in 2025 was $310 per point. That would have increased to $485 for fiscal years 2026-2027 under the original increase. Likewise, the air application fee would have increased from $285 per point to $400.

Through this platform, companies can effectively trade the environmental benefits associated with their use of SAF, a key component in reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

During the demonstration period, the participating companies successfully registered trading information on the platform, leading to successful transactions through a matching process based on trading terms and the signing of bilateral contracts. The platform's ability to ensure transparency and appropriateness in its processes—from registration to matching and contracting—was also confirmed through an evaluation by a third-party organization, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK).

The successful outcomes of this initial phase are a significant step forward for the project partners. The demonstration test not only allowed the companies to gain valuable knowledge about Scope 3 environmental value trading but also helped them identify key issues and areas for improvement.

With the first phase now complete, the project is moving into its second phase, which will see an expansion in the number of participating companies. This expansion is designed to further boost awareness of Scope 3 environmental value and to ramp up trading volume. The project partners will use this next phase to refine the scheme and consider various approaches ahead of its full-scale social implementation. This forward-looking approach underscores a strong commitment to establishing a robust and transparent framework for SAF-related carbon trading, which could serve as a global model for aviation decarbonization.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-06 12:56:48.604410

“This marks a significant step for CN Logistics to expand our efforts in driving CNL Green Solution’s Carbon Neutrality and CoCreate Green with Finnair.
We look forward to further develop the adoption of SAF and engage with more stakeholders to reduce the burden of airfreight carbon emissions on our planet,” he said.
For CN Logistics, the partnership is part of its commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainable logistics under its CNL Green Solution framework.","Finnair and CN Logistics International Holdings, a Hong Kong-based logistics company under DP World, have announced a new partnership to support the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in air cargo. As part of this initiative, CN Logistics has co-funded a batch of SAF with Finnair to help reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions associated with its cargo shipments.

“This is an important step in our ongoing efforts to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel, and we are excited to begin this collaboration with CN Logistics,” said Gabriela Hiitola, Senior Vice President, Finnair Cargo. “We look forward to expanding our SAF partnerships in the future and invite all our customers to join us in reducing carbon emissions in air freight.”

Tim Ngan, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of CN Logistics, echoed the importance of the collaboration. “This marks a significant step for CN Logistics to expand our efforts in driving CNL Green Solution’s Carbon Neutrality and CoCreate Green with Finnair. We look forward to further develop the adoption of SAF and engage with more stakeholders to reduce the burden of airfreight carbon emissions on our planet,” he said.

This collaboration aligns with Finnair’s broader sustainability strategy, which includes a science-based target to reduce its carbon emissions intensity—measured as CO2e per revenue tonne kilometre (RTK)—by 34.5% by 2033 from a 2023 baseline. The target has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and supports the airline’s long-term ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Finnair’s approach to emissions reduction includes expanding the use of SAF, investing in fuel-efficient flight operations, and operating a fleet of Airbus A350 aircraft on most long-haul routes. These aircraft use lightweight materials, next-generation engines, and adaptive wing-shape technology, making them 25% more fuel efficient than older A330 models. The airline also aims to lower operative aircraft weight and explore new technologies to improve energy efficiency.

Sustainability is integrated into Finnair’s infrastructure as well. The COOL Nordic Cargo Hub at Helsinki Airport, opened in 2018, was designed with long-term energy efficiency in mind. The terminal, certified by BREEAM, operates with support from nearly 3,000 solar panels that supply about 37% of the facility’s energy needs. Automated warehousing, guided truck yard systems, and waste management strategies further optimise the terminal’s environmental performance.

In addition to fuel and infrastructure improvements, Finnair has also committed to circular economy principles across its operations. The airline is working toward a company-wide target of 100% material management, ensuring that all waste ending at its Helsinki hub is either reused as energy, heat, biogas, manure, or material—completely avoiding landfills. Finnair has introduced measures to phase out single-use plastics, promote the recycling of packaging and cardboard, and explore reuse and recycling strategies for cargo nets, straps, and wood materials.

For CN Logistics, the partnership is part of its commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainable logistics under its CNL Green Solution framework. The collaboration with Finnair illustrates how freight forwarders and airlines can jointly take responsibility for climate impact and co-develop low-emission solutions for global trade",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2024/01/29/62026-finnair-now-operates-28-flights-a-week-connecting-helsinki-and-paris-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 12:57:18.583557

Rolls-Royce's SMR programme holds potential to significantly reduce fossil fuel dependency, aligning supply chain strategies with national net-zero targets.

""Our multi-year transformation continues to deliver,"" says Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO of Rolls Royce. ""Our actions led to strong first half year results, despite the challenges of the supply chain and tariffs. We are continuing to expand the earnings and cash potential of Rolls-Royce.

""We also delivered continued strong operational and strategic progress in the first half of 2025. A strong start to the year gives us confidence to raise our guidance for 2025. We see these targets as a milestone, not a destination, with substantial growth prospects beyond the mid-term.""

Growth in battery storage and green tech

Rolls-Royce's expansion into battery energy storage systems (BESS) represents another substantial move improving its supply chain infrastructure.

With significant orders from Lithuania's Ignitis Group, the division is poised to bolster revenue across the Power Systems sector and achieve breakeven shortly.

Demand for digital infrastructure and energy resilience is fuelling annual growth, with an anticipated 20% increase in the power generation segment, driven by backup power needs for data centres.

The progression from hardware to integrated sustainability within product development is increasingly crucial. As Rolls-Royce advances new-technology engines offering lower emissions and superior fuel efficiency expected by 2028, the focus remains on minimising the environmental footprint throughout the supply chain.

Military engine advancements further underscore the commitment to energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact.

Supply chain sustainability

Rolls-Royce has established multiple initiatives aimed at optimising supply chain sustainability and operational efficiency.

The organisation has already achieved a 50% reduction in energy usage across its operations and facilities.

Furthermore, using 2019 as a baseline, it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions from operations, facilities and product testing by 46%, with a 2030 target set to reduce these emissions even further.

These initiatives highlight substantial progress in achieving metrics vital to sustainable supply chain performance, such as reducing waste and enhancing recycling processes.

Rolls-Royce's strategy from 2015, based on its 2014 performance, has been pivotal in mitigating risks, minimising emissions and cutting costs company-wide.

Aviation advancements

In the civil aerospace sector, Rolls-Royce has improved the fuel efficiency and durability of its engine designs, a critical step towards decarbonising aviation supply chains.

In 2023, the company verified the compatibility of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across all its civil aero engine models, fulfilling a 2021 pledge to eliminate engine-technology barriers related to SAF use.

Key achievements including enhanced engine lifespan and optimised fuel consumption through models like the Trent XWB-84EP and Trent 1000 TEN reflect data-informed advancements driven by digital engineering.

“This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry,” adds Simon Burr, Group Director of Engineering, Technology and Safety at Rolls-Royce.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/bf18345b01372c17cae03943e09c817e:806eaf16dd0ac064b260a8d39fccb65a/rr-saf-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 12:57:28.632694

The ethanol plant will use approximately 1.2 million tons of corn annually, about 6% of Paraná’s corn output.
Construction of the ethanol plant is expected to begin in 2026, using the company’s own funds, and could be completed by the end of 2027.
Including the ethanol plant, Potential Group’s total investments since 2012 will reach around R$6 billion.
In addition to ethanol, corn processing produces DDG (dried distillers grains), a high-protein byproduct used in livestock feed.","Sao Paulo: The Potential Group has announced plans to invest R$2 billion in building a new corn ethanol plant in Lapa, Paraná, as part of its larger goal to create one of the world’s largest biofuel complexes. The announcement was made by company vice president Carlos Eduardo Hammerschmidt in an interview with Reuters, reports LNG.

The ethanol plant will use approximately 1.2 million tons of corn annually, about 6% of Paraná’s corn output. The state, Brazil’s second-largest corn producer, is on track to harvest a record 20 million tons in the 2024/25 season.

Construction of the ethanol plant is expected to begin in 2026, using the company’s own funds, and could be completed by the end of 2027.

The new facility will join an already expanding biodiesel plant and a soybean crushing facility currently under construction, scheduled for completion in the first half of 2026. The soybean unit will supply raw material to the biodiesel operation, which is being upgraded to increase capacity from 900 million to 1.62 billion liters per year. The soybean plant will have a crushing capacity of 1.2 million tons annually.

Looking ahead, the company also plans to build a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant at the same site. However, Hammerschmidt said that due to limited global demand and the high cost—estimated between R$3 billion and R$4 billion—the SAF plant is not part of the immediate investment plans.

“The goal is to build the largest biofuels complex in the world,” said Hammerschmidt, whose family founded the company in the 1950s. Including the ethanol plant, Potential Group’s total investments since 2012 will reach around R$6 billion.

The company’s expansion aligns with Brazil’s increasing need for biofuels, especially after the government raised the required blend of anhydrous ethanol in gasoline to over 30% from August 1. Paraná currently imports ethanol from other states, highlighting the local demand.

Hammerschmidt emphasized the advantages of corn ethanol in boosting farmer income and supporting food and fuel integration. “Corn is a smart option. The second corn crop, once used mainly to cover soybean harvest costs, is now becoming a major income source,” he said.

In addition to ethanol, corn processing produces DDG (dried distillers grains), a high-protein byproduct used in livestock feed. “Biofuels have helped Brazil’s meat industry grow,” Hammerschmidt added, noting that soybean meal, also used for animal feed, is a key product of the group’s biodiesel operations.

As part of the broader project, Potential Group will also invest R$200 million in building two pipelines—one for ethanol and one for biodiesel—connecting Araucária to the Lapa industrial complex. These pipelines are expected to serve other cities as well.

“We will supply both biodiesel and ethanol directly to the fuel distribution bases,” Hammerschmidt said, adding that the site’s proximity to the Petrobras refinery in Paraná will be a further advantage.

The company’s long-term vision includes continuing to expand its presence in bioenergy, agriculture, and logistics as demand for renewable fuels grows globally.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EthanolCorn-BT.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 12:57:35.189722

The plant will produce low-carbon oil for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and a regenerative biofertilizer, marking the company’s first large-scale deployment of its bioconversion technology, reports EnergyTech.

The project was officially launched at a signing ceremony held at the Palácio Piratini, where Cemvita signed an agreement with Invest RS, the state’s investment agency. The facility will manufacture two main products: FermOil, a renewable oil made from crude glycerol used as SAF feedstock, and FermNPK, a biofertilizer aimed at promoting regenerative farming practices.

State officials welcomed the initiative, calling it a step forward for both the economy and the environment. “This partnership with Cemvita strengthens our commitment to sustainability, encourages high-impact investments, and creates opportunities in renewable energy, agriculture, and industry,” said acting governor Gabriel Souza at the event.

Cemvita CEO Moji Karimi pointed to the region’s infrastructure, access to essential raw materials, and supportive policies as key factors behind the decision. “Brazil, and particularly Rio Grande do Sul, fits well with Cemvita’s goals,” he said.

The plant will be the first in the world to use Cemvita’s technology on an industrial scale. This process converts crude glycerol — a waste product from biodiesel production — into sustainable oil and agricultural inputs.

Rio Grande do Sul was chosen for the facility due to its established biodiesel industry, reliable transport network, and government backing for clean energy projects. Invest RS President Rafael Prikladnicki said the agency would support the project by helping with technical needs, supply chain development, and regulatory processes.

Cemvita had earlier partnered with local biofuel company Be8 to help strengthen the SAF supply chain in the region.

Leandro Evaldt, Deputy Secretary of Economic Development, said the project blends economic growth with sustainability. “It reflects our commitment to inclusive growth and highlights our supportive environment for businesses,” he said.

Sustainable aviation fuel was the central opportunity of discussion that had farmers hopeful for a new market and businesses like Delta Airlines hopeful for local access.
Charlotte Lollar, director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, agreed.
“Officials on the Japanese airline … that’s the first thing he said: ‘We want sustainable aviation fuel,'” Wertish said.
That's because determining the carbon index score of any crop does not have a standardized measuring tool, according to Julia Silvis, managing director of the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub.","MORGAN, Minn. — Farmers gathered inside the Farmfest grounds in Morgan on Tuesday, Aug. 5, said they needed something to improve the current negative margins they are seeing in major commodities. They also needed something that would get the next generation excited about farming.

Minnesota Farmers Union president Gary Wertish said farmers must look to emerging opportunities. Wertish was on a panel speaking to the topic of building sustainability in Midwest agriculture on Tuesday afternoon of Minnesota Farmfest’s three-day event in Morgan, Minnesota. Sustainable aviation fuel was the central opportunity of discussion that had farmers hopeful for a new market and businesses like Delta Airlines hopeful for local access.

Jerry Groskruetz, farm director of KDHL Radio, a Faribault, Minnesota, radio station, said one thing putting sustainable aviation fuel in a strong position is that it’s where ethanol was 30 years ago in the state, yet even before farmers are pushing for the industry to grow, a market already exists.

“We’re ahead of where we were 30 years ago,” Groskruetz said.

Charlotte Lollar, director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, agreed. She said not only does a market exist, but existing infrastructure can also be used to create the jet fuel that companies like Delta , and those around the world are looking for. Every commercial airline has a target of reaching some level of sustainability, she said.

“And that market is huge. Every year, we consume about 100 billion gallons collectively, globally, of conventional jet fuel,” Lollar said.

While Minnesota wants to lead in the area of SAF, the world also wants SAF. Wertish said this became clear on a trade tour to Japan.

“Officials on the Japanese airline … that’s the first thing he said: ‘We want sustainable aviation fuel,'” Wertish said.

Several factors are involved in getting Minnesota and the world, SAF, though.

Panel members shared that the SAF tax credit in Minnesota is helpful in pushing this industry forward. It offers tax credit to producers of sustainable fuels and those that blend it, both are areas that require expensive infrastructure. But there was discouragement that the 45Z credit at the federal level has not made it across the finish line. That credit is another tax incentive for those who produce sustainable fuels. Like getting anything else done, it requires looking beyond party lines, Wertish said.

The good news is that experts know how to make SAF, it is currently being used, and they know you can make it from a variety of crops, wood, oils and fats. On the infrastructure front, Minnesota is planning to complete construction of a SAF blending facility that would be the third in the country.

But there remains work to be done on the most sustainable way to make SAF.

It makes sense that corn would be in the crosshairs as it is already grown on about 8 million acres, or about a third of farm acres in the state, according to Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen. But ask what the best crop is and you may get different answers. That's because determining the carbon index score of any crop does not have a standardized measuring tool, according to Julia Silvis, managing director of the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub. She said this is a key area that farmers need to share their input on because of competing methods of tracking carbon.

“Try to say to the people who are building these systems, we need it to be more standardized. We need to have it not be as burdensome to use or to understand, frankly,” she said. The public and banks need to be able to understand the method.

The SAF Hub has seen major movement since it started two years ago, including the first flight with SAF out of Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport last year. They announced that a blending facility is being built at the Pine Bend Refinery near Rosemount, Minnesota, and they worked to create a consortium of buyers of SAF.

This year they are focused on an opportunity to announce production of SAF in the state. The blending facility is expected to be operational this winter. She noted that there are headwinds they must face at the federal level, but that through coming together and building innovations, they will find a way forward.

“You know it’s good for energy and resilience,” Silvis said. “It’s good for rural communities. It’s good for the environment, it burns cleanly. And it fits in with sort of the domestic energy agenda that we are seeing develop from the Department of Energy.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/4c4e153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3715x2814+0+0/resize/1407x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2Fab%2Fc275372d484b9fb463174c05d13f%2Ffarmffestgather.JPG,N,,2025-08-06 07:56:15.997852

A joint Canadian-ASEAN research project conducted by the ASEAN Secretariat, GHD, Boeing, and Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development found that Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam could become net exporters by 2040, while Japan and South Korea emerge as major regional importers.

Rice straw has been identified as the feedstock group with the lowest carbon intensity score across multiple Southeast Asian countries, offering the most environmentally sustainable pathway for SAF production that can reduce aviation emissions by up to 80% over the fuel's lifecycle.

Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community Satvinder Singh emphasized that this initiative marks a significant step in advancing ASEAN's commitment to sustainable aviation while driving economic growth and enhancing energy security.

The expansion of SAF feedstock supply is expected to stem from enhanced farming practices, mechanization, improved irrigation, and crop optimization rather than land expansion, ensuring sustainable growth without increasing deforestation while creating opportunities for job creation and workforce diversification across the region. ✈️

Branded ‘Alternative Fuel’, the new offering brings together the best of both worlds for its clients – enhanced customer value and an improved footprint.

Companies around the world rely on Yusen Logistics for their logistics and supply chain demands. The Tokyo-headquartered company has offices in 437 cities in 46 countries, and operates 748 distribution centres and offices, supporting transport solutions by sea, air, and land.

Investing in a more sustainable footprint is a strategic objective for Yusen Logistics. Their mission is to become “a leader in sustainable logistics by 2030” and the “go-to sustainable logistics service provider” from Asia. To achieve this vision, the organisation is already taking concrete steps – setting internal emissions targets and adopting greener solutions, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

New carbon insetting solutions

In logistics, carbon insetting involves reducing emissions directly within a company’s own supply chain or industry – for example, by switching to biofuels or investing in electric trucks.

Part of Yusen Logistics’ broader and overarching sustainability agenda, the newly launched Alternative Fuel proposition was developed through a comprehensive strategic and new product development process. This process involved the input and collaboration between leaders from within the business, key experts, and general stakeholders.

Key design criteria of the offering include sustainability at its core and agility to meet an ever-changing business landscape. Another key goal is ensuring the offering is highly actionable – meaning that people understand how the solution works and how it contributes to sustainability goals.

Co-design sessions

To move from ambition to action, Yusen Logistics started with a joint ambition-setting session featuring senior management and the Corporate Sustainability team.

“Jointly, we mapped out what success would look like, not only in terms of carbon emissions, but also from the perspective of customer engagement, internal capabilities and commercial growth,” said Mitch Kobayashi, Head of the Corporate Sustainability Unit at Yusen Logistics. “We also clarified the key goals of the new Alternative Fuel offering and outlined what is needed for it to underpin our 2030 Strategy.”

In a next step, AllChiefs facilitated six design sessions across different departments to construct the offering and ensure alignment with the existing green solutions of Yusen Logistics.

“During the sessions, dynamic working groups collectively shaped the Alternative Fuel offering as a part of the wider green logistics ambition. The sessions were characterised by active collaboration, open and engaged discussions, and co-creation that led to new and innovative approaches,” said Bonne Goedhart, Co-Owner of AllChiefs.

Customer Insights

Well aware of the importance of the customers during this journey, the project team gathered insights from account managers and key accountant managers. This helped them understand customer feedback, previously requested solutions, needs, expectations, and other critical topics.

‘’These conversations revealed what our logistics clients need when it comes to sustainability, and how a service provider such as Yusen Logistics could stand out in a crowded landscape,” reflected Cedric ‘t Hart, Sustainability Lead at Yusen Logistics.

Data collected from customers included views on factors such as cost, service, compliance, and supply chain resilience, as well as data on emissions and SBTi targets. Bringing this input together, the project team ensured that customer demands drove the key design principles, and that prioritisation was aligned to what customers really need. It also fed into the strategy for go-to-market.

Rolling out the solution

In May, Yusen Logistics unveiled its new offering to clients. To support the uptake of the offering on the customer side, Yusen Logistics and AllChiefs developed a comprehensive ‘Green Solutions Guide’ to facilitate knowledge sharing among the organisation, and customer engagement materials.

Meanwhile, internally, Yusen Logistics rolled-out a communications program, providing stakeholders at all levels with information on the new offering and its dynamics. Those responsible for selling and delivering the offering received a training program to equip them with the know-how and capabilities to drive the offering.

Main takeaways

According to Franziska Weber, Managing Consultant at AllChiefs, the project demonstrated the importance of building innovative green solutions with the end customer in mind. “Generic sustainability solutions don’t work. Through real conversations, about real challenges with actual customers, Yusen Logistics was able to design offerings that truly deliver what customer want.”

Goedhart emphasized the need of going beyond delivering strategic documents. ‘’Without internal alignment and ownership, even the best green solutions won’t work. Investing in knowledge building, and ensuring there is a follow-up loop, is not a nice-to-have, it’s essential.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-08-06-08394388-Yusen_Logistics_partners_with_AllChiefs_to_develop_a_new_carbon_insetting_offering_spot.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 07:56:26.245567

As demand for reliable, lower-carbon energy intensifies, legacy fossil fuel giants and emerging players alike are rethinking how energy is sourced, produced and consumed.

Renewable electricity from wind and solar continues to gain ground, but for hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation, shipping and heavy industry, alternative fuels remain essential.

The bill contained many components typically included in a farm bill.
""The big problem that I have with the reconciliation package is, it should have been done in the farm bill,"" she said.

The forum, titled ""Developing a Reliable Ag Policy Safety Net,"" was moderated by Mark Dorenkamp of Brownfield Ag News and was preceded by comments by Stephen Vaden, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. On the panel were Reps. Angie Craig, Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber.

The four representatives largely discussed the budget reconciliation — or ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" — act passed by Congress earlier this summer. The bill contained many components typically included in a farm bill.

Craig, the lone Democrat on the panel, is the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee. Kicking off comments from the panel, she first listed things she liked in the bill, like crop insurance improvements, updated reference prices, and tax provisions like the 199(a) stepped-up basis . But she didn't hold back on what she saw as problems with the process used.

""The big problem that I have with the reconciliation package is, it should have been done in the farm bill,"" she said.

She noted the nutrition title of a traditional farm bill had been ""gutted"" by the package and that other priorities, like the farm loan program that will expire in September, access to the Rural Energy for America Program, specialty crop programs and more, couldn't be dealt with in the reconciliation bill and will have to be legislated separately, in what she and others on the panel dubbed a ""skinny farm bill.""

""All of that could have would have been done in a traditional farm bill,"" Craig said.

Her harshest comments were for how the bill cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid , saying the moves will hurt rural communities.

Finstad, Fischbach and Stauber generally agreed with the things Craig liked about the bill but also defended the things she disliked, most notably the SNAP cuts. They noted explosive growth in the funding put into SNAP in recent years, along with an error rate that adds up to billions of dollars that haven't gone to feeding people.

Finstad, a farmer, said the budget reconciliation rebalanced farm programs with the nutrition programs that have dominated past farm bills.

""We finally put the farmer back in the farm bill,"" Finstad.

Fischbach focused much of her time on the tax components of the bill, including the 199(a) provision for estate taxes and the expansion of the 168(k) provision on depreciation to include ag properties. She acknowledged that the bill wasn't perfect and that more needs to be done on the 45(z) provision on renewable fuels and on sustainable aviation fuel.

""The good in this bill is overwhelming,"" she said.

While the panel focused largely on the budget reconciliation bill, the representatives also discussed trade and tariffs, the Make America Healthy Again Commission, gray wolves, conservation, California's Proposition 12 law on animal welfare and its impacts on agriculture nationwide, and other points related to ag policy. On trade and tariffs, there was a general consensus that more attention is needed on trade and that recently announced trade deals were signs of optimism for agriculture. However, Craig noted the general ""chaos"" of the past six months and the impact of that on consumers and the markets.

The topic of the MAHA Commission and the work of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy brought perhaps the most agreement from the panel, with Craig and Finstad deriding Kennedy's methods as unscientific and harmful to agriculture.

""I don't want to listen to Robert Kennedy on anything,"" Craig said.

""We're in bizarre times when a Kennedy is disliked by Republicans and Democrats,"" Finstad said.

On the MAHA subject and others, Finstad repeatedly said agriculture needs to go ""on the offense"" to explain the industry's needs, priorities and successes.

""It's our opportunity to rise to the occasion,"" he said.

Before the panel began, Vaden discussed what's going on at USDA. He said the agency has paid out $1.46 billion to more than 255,000 farmers since July 10 as part of the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, for weather disasters in 2023 and 2024. The agency also has paid out $8 billion to more than 571,000 farmers for the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program for economic assistance due to low commodity prices. Vaden said the simplified application process has helped expedite relief. He said his own brother reported getting money direct deposited into his account within three business days of signing his application at his local Farm Service Agency office.

Vaden lauded recent trade deals with the European Union, Indonesia, Japan, Phillipines and the United Kingdom and said agricultural trade is at the forefront of the discussions on trade. He also cheered the work of the Department of Justice on fighting back against California's Prop 12 and explained that the economics of living in Washington, D.C., was at the heart of a recent move to establish USDA hubs in Raleigh, North Carolina, Indianapolis, Fort Collins, Colorado, Salt Lake City and Kansas City, Missouri, rather than keep as many employees in Washington.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/2fdd2be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1098x624+0+0/resize/1876x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2F07%2F3ce376a3451fb9b4d50a2820fda0%2Fsafety-net-forum-at-farmfest.png,N,,2025-08-06 05:56:16.639185
