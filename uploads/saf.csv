“Our farmers and foresters have always been innovators and our Government is putting their expertise and world‑class production practices at the centre of growing Australia’s low carbon liquid fuel industry.","The Albanese Government is investing $1.1 billion to help unlock the vast economic opportunities on offer from low carbon liquid fuels.

This is all about helping to maximise the economic and industrial benefits of the shift to clean energy and net zero.

This investment will help ensure we have strong supply chains for the more sustainable fuels that can power our trucks, cargo ships and planes into the future.

The new ten‑year Cleaner Fuels Program will stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The first production of ‘drop‑in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow. But the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 – highlighting the untapped potential of developing local refining and value‑adding capability.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock will help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make our fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production‑linked incentive builds on the Government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2‑e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

Quotes attributable to the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers MP

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen MP

“Making cleaner fuels here, from Australian feedstocks, creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up, like plane travel and construction machines.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production. A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Quotes attributable to Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Murray Watt

“As demand for air travel grows, and more goods are moved by road and rail, it’s essential we invest in future fuels that allow us to facilitate this increasing demand while meeting our net‑zero targets.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Julie Collins MP

“We’re committed to unlocking more opportunities to harness our feedstocks, which is why this investment is great news for our farmers and our regional communities.

“Producing more low carbon liquid fuels right here in Australia won’t just benefit our fuel security and emissions reduction, it will support Australian farmers, foresters and our regions.

“Our farmers and foresters have always been innovators and our Government is putting their expertise and world‑class production practices at the centre of growing Australia’s low carbon liquid fuel industry.

“This investment will complement our National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy – which we are developing so our agricultural sector can seize the economic opportunities that come with feedstocks.”",https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/sites/ministers.treasury.gov.au/themes/custom/ministers/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-17 02:58:29.340251

Sustainable fuels are proposed for those parts of the transport chain that cannot be easily electrified. This includes jets, ships, construction machines, and – in some cases – heavy trucks.

“The global net zero transformation is an enormous economic opportunity for Australia and producing low carbon liquid fuels is an important part of that opportunity,” treasurer Jim Chalmbers said in a statement.

“Becoming a world leading producer of low carbon liquid fuels is a really big chance for Australia to be part of a really important growing global supply chain.”

Liquid fuels currently account for around half of Australia’s national energy use, so the government believes replacing fossil fuel-based liquid fuels with cleaner alternatives could have a dramatic impact on its emissions targets, and will present economic opportunities.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion worth of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow. But according to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), an Australian based low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth as much as $36 billion by the middle of the century.

“Making cleaner fuels here, from Australian feedstocks, creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up, like plane travel and construction machines,” said Chris Bowen, federal minister for climate change and energy.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production. A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

The funding to set up the new Cleaner Fuels Program – not to be confused with the program of the same name that was legislated in 2001 for implementation in 2006 – is aimed at backing Australian innovators in making a greener fuel supply, paving the way for low carbon fuels to be made available to early adopters.

Further details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place through the remainder of this financial year, with grants to be awarded through a competitive process.

Recipients of those grants will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

This new production-linked incentive builds on support provided by the federal government through its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

Aimed at seeding a new industry that could be worth $36 billion in 2050, the government investment also aligns with net zero targets and the strategic importance of a domestic supply for planes, trucks and cargo ships.

“Transport sector emissions are growing and will soon become the highest component of total national emissions. Diesel is the largest single source of energy demand in Australia today but is largely imported,” a CSIRO report backing the new domestic industry this year said.

The Albanese government made low carbon liquid fuels a priority under its Future Made in Australia agenda last year, tipping $250 million into its research and development.

The Cleaner Fuels Program announced Wednesday will offer up to $1.1 billion in competitive grants that are “production-linked”, with eligibility details to be developed through consultation this financial year.

But projects will need to align with the government’s community benefits principles for taxpayer support, like job creation and regional development.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains,” Treasurer Jim Chalmers said.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.”

The government said it expects the new industry’s cleaner ‘drop in’ fossil fuel alternatives – which can be used in conventional engines – to begin production by 2029.

Around half of Australia’s energy use comes from liquid fuels and switching to the cleaner alternatives like sustainable aviation fuel or renewable diesel offers a huge climate and economic opportunity.

While solar and wind are vital to the clean energy transition, they are not always practical for industries like aviation, shipping and heavy freight. With demand for practical, scalable solutions rising, low-carbon biofuels could become a game-changer in reducing emissions while creating jobs across regional Australia.

What are low-carbon biofuels and why this matters

Low-carbon biofuels, often called low-carbon liquid fuels, are alternatives to fossil fuels made from renewable feedstocks. These can include crops like sorghum, sugar and canola, or waste materials such as used cooking oil and tallow. The fuels produced range from renewable diesel and biodiesel to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Crucially, many are ‘drop-in’ fuels, meaning they can replace or blend with conventional fuels without requiring major changes to engines or infrastructure.

This makes them particularly attractive for transport modes that are difficult to electrify or power with hydrogen in the short term. Heavy haulage, shipping and aviation can benefit from low-carbon biofuels sooner rather than later.

How they work in practice

Low-carbon biofuels are produced through several key steps. First, the feedstock is sourced from agriculture or waste streams. Next, conversion processes like hydroprocessing, fermentation or chemical upgrading turn the feedstock into liquid fuel. Finally, the refined fuel is distributed and used either directly or in blends with fossil fuels.

The versatility of these fuels means they can cut emissions without waiting for massive infrastructure overhauls. Trucks, planes and ships can start reducing their carbon footprint with minimal disruption.

Environmental impact: the promise and the pitfalls

The promise

When produced sustainably, low-carbon biofuels offer significant greenhouse gas savings. Some studies suggest Australia could avoid around 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 if the industry scales up. Domestic production also strengthens fuel security, reducing reliance on imports and protecting supply chains. Beyond climate benefits, the industry promises billions in economic value and thousands of regional jobs.

The pitfalls

The environmental credentials of biofuels depend on how feedstocks are grown and processed. If cultivation is carbon-intensive or leads to deforestation or biodiversity loss, the net benefit shrinks. Land competition with food crops is another risk. Scaling production requires investment in refining, certification and infrastructure. Costs remain high for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel, meaning government policy and market demand will shape the speed of uptake.

Labor’s latest announcement

The $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program announced by the Labor Government will provide grants over 10 years to build Australia’s capacity to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the initiative as a central part of building a “Future Made in Australia,” adding:

“We want to make sure that Australia is at the forefront of this global shift, cutting emissions while creating good jobs at home.”

The funding signals a strong commitment to tackling emissions from transport and industry while opening new export opportunities. The government estimates the low-carbon fuels sector could grow into a $36 billion industry by 2050, cutting millions of tonnes of emissions and securing long-term economic gains.

What’s expected from leadership and industry

Policy certainty will be essential to attract private investment. Standards for sustainability, certification of fuels, and clear guarantees of origin will build confidence in the sector. Feedstock sustainability is also critical; if done right, Australia could turn agricultural residues and waste into a climate solution, not a liability.

Building the necessary refining, blending and distribution facilities will take time, but early action is key. By the mid-2030s, low-carbon fuels must be produced at scale if they are to meet Australia’s climate targets.

Strengthening fuel security

Low-carbon biofuels offer Australia a rare chance to cut emissions in some of the hardest-to-abate sectors without waiting for next-generation technology. With Labor’s $1.1 billion commitment, the pathway is clearer than ever. If the fuels are produced sustainably, they could become a cornerstone of Australia’s clean energy future, slashing emissions, strengthening fuel security, and creating jobs where they are needed most.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Low-carbon-biofuel.png,N,,2025-09-16 21:56:28.591509

“A strong domestic biofuels industry will help diversify the market opportunities for producers, a key element of risk management.”

“This isn’t just about cleaner fuels. It’s about creating jobs, diversifying farm businesses, and ensuring our regions remain at the forefront of Australia’s transition to net zero.”

The NFF has long called for increased domestic production of biofuels. The industry’s 2030 Roadmap to a $100 billion industry highlights biofuels as a critical lever for growth by helping to diversify farm income, improve resilience, and contribute to Australia’s climate commitments.

“Alongside the sustainability benefits, building this industry here will also strengthen Australia’s sovereign fuel capability by reducing our reliance on imports.”

The NFF said it also looks forward to working with its members and Government in the development of the Government’s ‘National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy’ to ensure feedstock supply is sustainable, competitive and well-integrated with regional development.

“Today’s announcement is a welcome investment in Australia’s LCLF industry. Domestic LCLF production can strengthen Australia’s energy security and unlock new economic opportunities, ensuring Australia remains fuel-secure, sustainable, and resilient.

“Australia produces an abundance of crops suitable for biofuel production, including canola and other oilseeds. Our world-class sector and established grain supply chains are well-placed to supply domestic LCLF production.”

Quotes attributable to CANEGROWERS CEO, Dan Galligan:

“Almost half of the Queensland’s sugarcane is recognised by the world’s three biggest sustainability gatekeepers as a global leader in sustainable farming. This gives immediate confidence to airlines, freight and heavy industry that local feedstocks meet global benchmarks.

“Our growing region stretches along the Queensland coastline, alongside major population hubs. We also have a cane rail network stretching thousands of kilometres, linking farms to mills and multiple deep-water ports.

“This footprint shortens supply chains, cuts costs, and de-risks a rapid scale-up of domestic low-carbon liquid fuels. With sugarcane feedstock alone, Queensland could deliver more than 30% of Australia’s aviation fuel demand.

The thresholds will tighten overtime — wind and solar projects must show 40% non-PFE content in 2026, rising to 60% by 2030.
Projects beginning construction after December 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible.
Looking Ahead The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions.
Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.","I. Background

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law, marking a significant turn in US clean energy policy. The new law dismantles or narrows many of the clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). For developers, manufacturers, and investors, the message is clear: access to federal tax credits is shrinking, and the rules for eligibility are tightening.

Days after signing the OBBBA, on July 7, President Trump reinforced this policy shift with an executive order (EO 14315) directing federal agencies to end support for wind, solar, and other “green” technologies. Treasury was tasked with enforcing accelerated deadlines and stricter rules to prevent projects from using safe harbors to lock in credits for wind and solar. Together, the OBBBA and EO 14315 set the stage for a new framework that scales back incentives and imposes tougher compliance hurdles, particularly around foreign ownership and supply chain sourcing.

II. New IRS Guidance: “Beginning of Construction” Rules

The IRS acted quickly, following EO 14315 with Notice 2025-42, which provides new rules addressing when wind and solar projects are considered to have “begun construction” for purposes of qualifying for the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively.[1] This notice significantly narrows the pathways available to developers.

The familiar “5% safe harbor” introduced under Notice 2013-29 and further clarified under various IRS notices, such as Notice 2018-59 and Notice 2022-61 (Prior Notices), is eliminated for most wind and solar projects. Instead, taxpayers must now satisfy the “physical work test,” which requires that physical work of a significant nature begins before July 5, 2026. That said, the 5% safe harbor is preserved for small-scale solar projects (1.5 MW or less), recognizing the unique challenges for distributed generation.

Qualifying work under the physical work test can include on-site activities such as excavation for wind turbine foundations or installation of racking for solar panels, as well as certain off-site manufacturing activities performed pursuant to binding written contracts. Preliminary steps like permitting or site clearing are not counted toward the physical work test.

Once construction begins, projects must maintain a continuous program of construction (i.e., the “continuity requirement”). That said, the “continuity safe harbor” from the Prior Notices still exists. If a project is placed in service within four years of the end of the year in which construction began, the project is treated as having satisfied the continuity requirement. If the construction period extends beyond the four-year safe harbor, a solar developer can no longer rely on merely showing “continuous efforts” but must be able to demonstrate a continuous program of construction that involves continuing physical work of a significant nature.

Fortunately, Notice 2025-42 preserves a list of excusable disruptions, such as weather, interconnection delays, and permitting delays, for purposes of satisfying the continuity requirement.

Finally, it is worth noting that Notice 2025-42 specially provides that the “beginning of construction” rules set forth in the notice are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the new restrictions on foreign involvement discussed below. Such guidance is currently being prepared by Treasury.

For developers, the takeaway is clear: simply incurring costs or securing contracts will no longer be sufficient. Projects must demonstrate physical progress of a significant nature on or before the July 4, 2026 deadline to remain eligible for PTCs or ITCs without being subject to the accelerated December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

III. Change Under the OBBBA

New Restrictions on Foreign Involvement

A central feature of the OBBBA is the creation of the Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) regime. The goal is to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector, especially from countries deemed adversarial to the United States, such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

The rules operate on two levels:

Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs): entities directly tied to adversarial governments or named in laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIEs): entities where an SFE has significant influence, such as owning at least 25%, holding certain debt interests, or having contractual control.

Even if a developer isn’t itself an SFE or FIE, projects can still lose eligibility if (1) they begin construction after December 31, 2025, and (2) they rely too heavily on goods or services sourced from PFEs. Treasury will measure this through a “material assistance” test, which compares overall project costs with the portion tied to PFEs. The thresholds will tighten overtime — wind and solar projects must show 40% non-PFE content in 2026, rising to 60% by 2030. Similar rules will apply across technologies, from batteries to inverters to critical minerals.

While official safe harbor tables won’t arrive until late 2026, transitional relief allows developers to rely on IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications in the meantime. Developers will need to closely track supply chains now, as eligibility will become progressively harder to maintain. As noted above, the “beginning of construction” rules under Notice 2025-42 for purposes of determining whether a project is eligible for PTCs or ITCs are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the “material assistance” restrictions. Until Treasury issues specific guidance, the historic “beginning of construction” rules remain applicable for this purpose.

Key Changes by Credit

Investment Tax Credit (Section 48E): Wind and solar face early termination deadlines — in order to be eligible for this credit, construction must begin on or before July 4, 2026, or, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026, such projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. As discussed earlier, Notice 2025-42 introduced new rules on when wind and solar projects are considered to have begun construction, which further narrows eligibility. That said, other technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and hydrogen retain longer timelines, with a gradual phaseout starting in 2034.

Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y): Similarly, wind and solar projects must meet the July 4, 2026 “beginning of construction” date or the December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline. Other technologies, such as geothermal, hydrogen, and nuclear projects, are subject to the same phaseout schedule as the Section 48E ITCs.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits (Section 45X): Wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027 are ineligible for the Section 45X credit. With respect to critical minerals, the OBBBA (1) included metallurgical coal as an applicable critical mineral, and (2) provided for a critical mineral phaseout beginning in 2031 (except for metallurgical coal, which phases out beginning in 2030). In addition, the OBBBA tightened the definition of “battery modules” eligible for the Section 45X credit by clarifying that a battery module is comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality. The PFE rules also apply here, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate sourcing strategies.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q): Credit amounts are equalized at $17 per ton (base) for carbon captured from industrial and power facilities (increased to $85 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied) and $36 per ton (base) for direct air capture (increased to $180 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied), regardless of end use. But PFE restrictions will now limit who can claim or transfer the Section 45Q credits.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U): The Section 45U credit for electricity production at existing nuclear power plants that were operational at the time of enactment of the IRA (i.e., placed in service prior to August 16, 2022) remains intact through 2032, but with new restrictions on sourcing nuclear fuel from covered nations. Specifically, after December 31, 2027, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel was not sourced from covered nations or “covered entities” (unless pursuant to a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023). In addition, SFEs are not eligible to claim the Section 45U credit after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, and FIEs cannot claim the Section 45U credit for tax year beginning after the second anniversary of the date of enactment.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V): Eligibility for the per kilogram credit for qualified clean hydrogen production now requires construction to begin before 2028, significantly shortening the runway for new projects. Projects beginning construction after December 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (Section 45Z): The Section 45Z credit for the production of certain transportation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel has been extended and is available through 2029, but with narrowed eligibility and stricter sourcing rules. PFE restrictions also apply. For example, for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, the enhanced rate for sustainable aviation fuel is no longer available and the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20%.

Direct Pay and Transferability (Sections 6417 and 6418): Both remain available, but credits cannot be transferred to PFEs (immediately for SFEs and two years later for FIEs).

IV. Looking Ahead

The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions. While certain technologies like nuclear and hydrogen retain more favorable treatment, the overarching trend is a sharp contraction in federal support for wind, solar, and PFE-linked projects.

Below is a list of action items for developers to do now:

Move quickly on project starts. Wind and solar developers must begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 to preserve credit eligibility while retaining the four-year “continuity safe harbor” to place the project in service; otherwise, such projects that begin construction after the first anniversary of the enactment of the OBBBA have to be placed in service by the end of 2027.

Focus on the Physical Work Test. For wind and solar projects, developers can no longer “begin construction” by satisfying a 5% safe harbor (other than certain small-scale solar projects of 1.5 MW or less). Paying or incurring costs for the manufacturing of project components is no longer enough — developers must plan for tangible, qualifying construction steps that constitute physical work of a significant nature, both for purposes of showing that construction began and for purposes of maintaining a continuous program of construction.

Track supply chains. The introduction of the PFE regime intended to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector means that developers and manufacturers must strengthen the supplier due diligence process and carefully document sourcing of key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance and build strategies to reduce foreign exposure.

Plan for shorter timelines. Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.

Monitor Treasury guidance. Future notices (including notices regarding the PFE regime and the beginning of construction rules for the PFE regime) will shape enforcement and safe harbor rules; staying up to date will be critical to avoid disqualification.

In this new era, careful planning and compliance will be essential to securing clean energy tax incentives, and maintaining strong documentation will be key to supporting credit eligibility and ensuring investors and tax credit purchasers that the underlying credits are secure. Please reach out to Gregg M. Benson or your Mintz relationship attorney if you have any questions regarding the changes to the clean energy tax credits under the OBBBA and relevant guidance.

Already, over ₹3,000 crore has been committed under central and state schemes to support SAF production.
European carriers like KLM and Lufthansa are already offering low-carbon flights at a small premium, showing that sustainable aviation can be integrated successfully,” he said.
Concerns remain over food security if agricultural feedstocks are diverted to fuel production.
“With proper planning, innovation, and collaboration, India has the potential to become a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel.”","Airlines across the world will not adopt sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) unless they become cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel, Jimmy Olsson, President of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Association (Safa), has said, reports Businessworld.

Speaking to BW Businessworld, Olsson stressed that the responsibility lies with fuel producers to innovate and bring down SAF costs while maintaining environmental integrity. “If you set up your SAF plant in the correct manner, it is very much financially viable,” he said, adding that the entire value chain — from feedstock collection to final fuel production — needs to be reimagined.

India, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, currently accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global aviation turbine fuel (ATF) demand, exporting nearly half of its production. Passenger traffic is projected to rise from 220 million in 2023-24 to nearly 390 million by 2030, while freight volumes are expected to more than double to 5.1 million tonnes, according to a Deloitte study.

ATF demand is likely to reach 15–16 million tonnes by 2030. This rapid growth, coupled with increasing carbon emissions, makes SAF adoption critical.

India has announced blending mandates of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. SAF is expected to contribute between 53 and 66 per cent toward India’s net-zero aviation targets by 2050.

Abundant domestic feedstocks — including agricultural residues, sugarcane, sweet sorghum, and used cooking oil — provide a strong foundation. These can cut carbon intensity by up to 84 per cent, ICAO studies show.

“With careful planning, technological adoption, and efficient supply chains, SAF can be produced and supplied in a way that is practical, financially sustainable, and beneficial to all stakeholders,” Olsson said.

At present, SAF costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock. Agricultural residue-based SAF is priced at USD 550–650 per tonne, used cooking oil at USD 800–900, and sugarcane at USD 300–400.

Domestic demand at 5 per cent blending is expected to reach 0.8 million tonnes by 2030, but with a production potential of 8–10 million tonnes, India could not only meet domestic needs but also export. Already, over ₹3,000 crore has been committed under central and state schemes to support SAF production.

Olsson noted that at low blending mandates of 1–5 per cent, the cost impact on airlines is minimal. “Even low-cost carriers can adopt SAF without affecting profitability. European carriers like KLM and Lufthansa are already offering low-carbon flights at a small premium, showing that sustainable aviation can be integrated successfully,” he said.

Concerns remain over food security if agricultural feedstocks are diverted to fuel production. Olsson argued that linking SAF to farmer incomes, employment, and sustainable practices is essential.

India’s crop residue management programmes, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, have already reduced stubble burning by up to 69 per cent, cutting a million tonnes of CO2 emissions and adding USD 14 million to farmer incomes. “Any sustainable SAF business in India must consider all stakeholders — it must support rural livelihoods, remain affordable, and not compromise food security,” Olsson emphasised.

With domestic SAF production potential far exceeding projected demand, India has the opportunity to reduce aviation emissions while positioning itself as an exporter.

“By addressing price, sustainability, and social impact together, India can develop a robust SAF market that benefits airlines, passengers, and communities alike,” Olsson said. “With proper planning, innovation, and collaboration, India has the potential to become a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-4.png,N,,2025-09-16 17:56:15.561163

United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark

NEWARK, N.J., Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- United CEO Scott Kirby was in Newark (EWR) today to celebrate the airline's operational turnaround at EWR and discuss the bright future for the carrier's premier East Coast hub.

This summer, United celebrated its best operational summer ever at EWR, putting the airport on par with JFK and LGA for on-time performance. In fact, United flights out of Newark arrived on-time more often this summer than flights operated by airlines out of JFK or LGA.*

These rankings come as more than six million people flew United on-time through Newark this summer, the most in the airline's history.** In addition, United's Connection Saver technology helped more than 28,000 customers make tight connections in Newark this summer.

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin. Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Additionally, United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark.

""Newark is operating better than ever and United's future here is bright – that's a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,"" said Kirby. ""I want to also thank Secretary Duffy, FAA Administrator Bedford, Governor Murphy and all the national, state and local leaders who helped ensure that Newark remains a safe and reliable crown jewel for millions of domestic and international travelers. As the FAA and DOT implement their plan of increased staffing and improved technology, the reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.""

""Millions of passengers each year rely on Newark Airport for their travel needs. Over the past several months, we have worked diligently with our partners at the Port Authority and the FAA to move towards a return to full capacity at Newark Airport, and I am pleased with our progress,"" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. ""United's continued investment in Newark Airport will serve as a significant economic driver for our region, creating thousands of new jobs for New Jersey communities. I thank United CEO Scott Kirby for his partnership in supporting our region's world-class transportation infrastructure.""

In April and May, challenges associated with air traffic control staffing, technology outages and runway construction led to a concentrated number of delays and cancelations out of Newark. But since that time, bookings and customer confidence in flying through Newark have bounced back thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees, including:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2

Beginning in May, the FAA limited Newark flight operations to 68 per hour. This was down from a high of 86, a number that was well above EWR's maximum theoretical capacity even in ideal operating conditions. The FAA has tentatively limited flights out of Newark to 72 per hour through summer 2026.

In July, the FAA installed a new fiber optic network to support the air traffic control system

""We're building a brand new air traffic control system, and we started by addressing the challenges of outdated technology at Newark,"" said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. ""This summer, the FAA took immediate action to relieve substantial inconveniences to the traveling public—deploying a temporary satellite backup system, upgrading fiberoptic technology, expanding high-bandwidth telecommunications, increasing controller staffing, and limiting arrivals and departures. Through strong partnerships with the Port Authority and United, we made significant progress this summer.""

United invests more in Newark destinationsAs the gateway to the Atlantic, Newark plays a critical role in connecting passengers to United's industry-leading international network.

United's most talked about 2025 destination, Nuuk, Greenland, will return to Newark for summer 2026 following a successful and enthusiastic first season.

This summer, EWR had more international departures (over 20,000) and more departures to Europe (more than 8,200) than any other United hub

This summer, all of United's 32 European destinations were served from EWR

In 2025, United serves 82 international destinations from EWR

EWR serves the most international destinations unique to United (seven) of any hub

By the end of 2025, United will have grown its international network in EWR by 12 destinations since 2018, including the six additions this year

EWR has more widebody departures than any other United hub

United hiring in Newark United proudly employs more than 14,000 people in the Newark/New York City area, including more than 3,000 pilots at its pilot base and more than 5,700 flight attendants.

United looks to hire another 2,500 employees before the end of 2026.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Comes to NewarkUnited will be the first airline to bring sustainable aviation fuel to Newark, with plans to purchase up to one million gallons from Neste for use at EWR this year. United purchased more than 13 million gallons of SAF in 2024, more than any other U.S. airline.

Assembly Bill 222 will provide SAF producers a $1.50 per gallon tax credit. Incentivizing this multi-billion-dollar industry to flourish here will be a big win for Wisconsin farmers and timber producers.

“Wisconsin produced SAF presents an exciting new market opportunity for our farmers and timber producers. Capitalizing on our state’s geographic location and strong agricultural industry will allow us to become a leader in producing this sustainable fuel, which ultimately creates a long-term, reliable market for our farmers and timber producers. I am excited to see this legislation move forward,” said Rep. Steffen.

SAF is jet fuel made from renewable, often low value, energy crops. Under AB 222, in order to qualify for the credit, the fuel must be produced in Wisconsin, derived largely from renewable sources, and energy crops must be grown in the U.S. The credit will take effect in 2028.

“Wisconsin has the talent, the drive, and the natural resources to be a world leader in the production of SAF. Our forests’ health is at risk if we do not continue to find new uses for our fiber. SAF is truly a win-win on every front,” said Sen. Quinn.

With a fleet size approaching 500 regional jets, mainly Bombardier CRJ variants and Embraer 175s, the airline covers North America on behalf of American Eagle, United Express, Delta Connection and Alaska Airlines, carrying 42 million passengers in 2024.

“Today marks a significant milestone in regional aviation as we collaborate with SkyWest to bring the MAEVE Jet to life,” said Martin Nuesseler, Maeve Aerospace Chief Technology Officer.

“This investment, made by the largest regional airline in the world, not only validates our vision but also establishes a partnership that supports the development of the MAEVE Jet by providing important input from an operator to generate a real impact in the market and for more sustainable air travel. Together, we are redefining the future of regional connectivity.”

Why is SkyWest partnering with Maeve?

Maeve’s aircraft design has evolved in recent years. From an all-electric high-wing propeller-driven aircraft with eight engines to the twin hybrid electric engine M80 in 2023, and now to its current form – the MJ 500 MAEVE jet, a 76 to 100-seat, rear-engined, hybrid-electric open-rotor regional aircraft.

Financial terms of the equity deal have not been disclosed, but SkyWest is understood to be investing more than just money. The airline has committed to providing input into design, performance, and operations during the development phase, giving the developers important real-world feedback from an airline that could, in theory, become one of its most important clients.

The partnership and announcement of ‘launch customer’ status for SkyWest implies that the airline will take early deliveries of the new aircraft, once certified. Should that come about, it could provide SkyWest with a much-needed new technology replacement for its ageing CRJ fleet.

According to Planespotters data, SkyWest’s 138-strong CRJ-700 fleet averages over 20 years of age, with some of the oldest examples 25 years old or more. Its 57 CRJ-900s are, on average, younger, although some individuals are more than two decades old.

SkyWest has already ordered more Embraer E175s, but will be looking ahead to the next technology aircraft. Embraer shelved its plans for an E175-E2, leaving airlines reliant on small regional jets with an older technology model. While the MAEVE Jet might be some years away, it’s a hope for SkyWest and a more efficient future fleet.

For a startup like Maeve, securing SkyWest as a launch customer is a powerful vote of confidence.

The company markets its MAEVE Jet as the first clean-sheet regional jet to be introduced in over 20 years. It promises a hybrid-electric regional aircraft that will let airlines cut fuel burn and CO₂ emissions by up to 40% with conventional fuel, and up to 95% when partnered with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

MHI RJ Aviation Group is also partnering with Maeve Aerospace

Also teaming up last year with Maeve Aerospace is MHI RJ Aviation Group, a Canadian-based subsidiary of MHI (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries).

MHI are no stranger to the world of regional jet design, with its subsidiary Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation having developed the SpaceJet. The aircraft first flew in prototype form in November 2015, but ultimately the project ended during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scope clause also had an effect, as it limits regional jets to 76 seats and a maximum takeoff weight of 86,000lb to protect mainline pilot jobs. This was a key reason the Mitsubishi MRJ SpaceJet failed in the US market. Maeve avoids this pitfall by designing its aircraft to remain within scope clause limits, making it a viable option for regional carriers.

Whilst there is no timeline yet for certification or entry into service for the MAEVE Jet, the market for hybrid-electric airliners is heating up, with competition from California-based Heart Aerospace.

Although the Heart ES-30 design is considerably smaller and slower, with only 30 seats, they do have 250 orders from customers such as United, Mesa Airlines, and ES-30 launch customer Air Canada.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Maeve-Aerospace-MAEVE-Jet-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-16 15:56:29.893361

The company's NovaSAF™ Pricing Framework, published today as a white paper, provides validation that its biogas to both RFNBO and Bio SAF pathway can meet the tough EU sustainability mandates and airline price targets.

Independent assessors at Peterson Solutions have confirmed Syzygy's NovaSAF1 facility is set for dual ISCC EU certification for both advanced biofuels and RFNBO, recognizing its innovative use of manure-based biogas and renewable electricity.

""We're proving that SAF can meet the toughest sustainability standards while reaching cost levels that make sense for airlines,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""Our goal is to make sustainable flight the new standard, not the exception.""

Why this matters

For airlines under mounting pressure to meet EU mandates, U.S. incentives, and CORSIA requirements, SAF has often been too scarce and too expensive. Syzygy's strategy promises a different outcome. By marrying low-cost biogenic feedstocks with renewable electricity, NovaSAF positions itself as a credible alternative to HEFA biofuels, which dominate the market today but are constrained by feedstock availability.

Syzygy's model hinges on hub-and-spoke production, where modular units produce Fischer-Tropsch crude from biogas, which is then upgraded to SAF at centralized hubs. The company argues the economics work at scales starting around 100,000 tons per year—small enough to be achievable, large enough to matter.

The company says NovaSAF costs can beat today's bioSAF prices in a variety of scenarios, including high feedstock cost scenarios such as $25/MMBtu for biogas or $0.15/kWh for renewable power. In Europe, SAF prices could track at $1,800/ton for advanced biofuels and $3,000/ton for e-SAF. In the U.S., incentives could bring effective pricing down to parity with fossil jet fuel, with credits adding $5–8 per gallon in value.

A call to early movers

Syzygy is actively opening structured offtake discussions now, aiming to lock in commitments as SAF mandates and ESG deadlines loom. ""This is the moment to secure your future fuel supply,"" Best said. ""Airlines that act early will gain access to scalable, compliant volumes of SAF—ensuring not just regulatory alignment, but a pathway to net zero.""

United had its best operational summer ever at Newark, putting the airport on par with John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport for on-time performance, Kirby said.
The turnaround follows a two-month period in April and May when Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) was plagued by a series of technology outages that cut off communication with air-traffic controllers and resulted in flight delays and cancellations.
""Newark is operating better than ever and United's future here is bright – that's a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,"" Kirby said.

United had its best operational summer ever at Newark, putting the airport on par with John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport for on-time performance, Kirby said. More than 6 million people flew on-time through Newark this past summer.

The turnaround follows a two-month period in April and May when Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) was plagued by a series of technology outages that cut off communication with air-traffic controllers and resulted in flight delays and cancellations. Some controllers took trauma-related leave, adding to a staffing shortage at the Philadelphia facility that manages Newark’s airspace.

But since that time, bookings and customer confidence about flying through Newark have rebounded, Kirby said, thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees. Factors in the turnaround include:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which had limited Newark flight operations to 68 flights per hour in May, has tentatively raised the limit to 72 flights per hour through the summer of 2026.

The FAA installed a new fiber optic network in July to support the air traffic control system, which had been a contributing factor to previous communication outages.

""Newark is operating better than ever and United's future here is bright – that's a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,"" Kirby said. As the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation increase staffing and improve technology, “reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.""

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin, he said.

Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

United now employs more than 14,000 people in the Newark/New York City area, including over 3,000 pilots at its pilot base and more than 5,700 flight attendants. The airline expects to add more than 2,500 Newark employees between now and the end of 2026.

United will also be the first airline to bring sustainable aviation fuel to Newark, with plans to purchase up to 1 million gallons from Neste for use at EWR this year. United purchased more than 13 million gallons of SAF in 2024, more than any other U.S. airline.

Diamond Green Diesel, or DGD, a U.S. leader in renewable diesel production, imports beef tallow from a supplier fed by Brazilian slaughterhouses fined for illegal deforestation. These include a plant that purchased cattle from a rancher described by Brazilian authorities as the “largest destroyer of the Amazon” ever investigated.

Repórter Brasil obtained documents about DGD’s supplier chain and identified, in addition to this case, connections to at least two other slaughterhouses that bought cattle from ranchers fined for practices associated with large-scale illegal deforestation.

These cases raise a red flag about the potential harmful climate impacts of alternative fuels. Despite biofuels’ image as a ‘green’ fuel, the use of livestock inputs in their production can increase deforestation, warns Tim Searchinger, a senior researcher at Princeton University. “The reason land is being deforested is to meet growing demand for food and biofuels,” he says.

Deforestation accounts for around 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to United Nations estimates. In Brazil, it is the leading driver of such emissions.

On its website, DGD claims its industrial plant can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to fossil diesel. However, it does not mention any measures to prevent the purchase of tallow sourced from deforested pastures. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to fueling cars and trucks, DGD’s Texas facility produces SAF — short for “sustainable aviation fuel,” a product intended to reduce the climate footprint of the aviation industry. Avfuel Corporation, one of the main independent jet fuel suppliers in the U.S., received the first SAF delivery from DGD in December 2024.

From forest destruction to biofuel production

According to customs documents reviewed by Repórter Brasil, DGD regularly purchases beef tallow from the Fasa group, a Brazilian company specializing in processing slaughterhouse byproducts. DGD and Fasa belong to the same economic group, as the Brazilian company was acquired in 2022 by Texas-based multinational Darling Ingredients, one of DGD’s owners through a joint venture with Valero Energy. Also headquartered in Texas, Valero Energy is one of the largest fuel producers in the U.S.

The Fasa group has subsidiaries in the Amazon called Araguaia and Rio Verde, which source tallow from various slaughterhouses in the region. The supplier’s history, according to official documents obtained by the report, includes Frialto, a slaughterhouse from Mato Grosso identified through GTAs (animal transport guides) purchasing cattle from a rancher arrested by the Brazilian federal police in 2023. He was accused by Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office of clearing an area of forest equivalent to about 12,000 American football fields and is identified by the agency as the largest Amazonian deforester ever investigated.

One month after the arrest, Repórter Brasil revealed that Frialto had bought cattle from the rancher and his relatives. Now, the outlet has obtained an official letter from the government of Mato Grosso, dated October 2023, related to the renewal of Frialto’s operating license. In the document, a Fasa subsidiary is listed as the recipient of residues generated by Frialto. According to customs records, this same Fasa unit sent beef tallow to DGD multiple times between 2023 and 2024.

At the time of the arrest, Frialto stated it had suspended business with the rancher’s properties. Repórter Brasil contacted the slaughterhouse again to inquire about its dealings with Fasa and any measures taken to avoid sourcing from illegally deforested areas but received no response.

Fasa, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, and DGD also did not respond to requests for comment.

Another illegal deforestation case linked to DGD’s supply chain involves the LKJ slaughterhouse. Cattle movement records accessed by Repórter Brasil show that in July 2023, LKJ purchased animals from a ranch in Brazil’s Cerrado biome — called Apucarana Farm — which had 381 hectares embargoed after environmental authorities confirmed illegal deforestation. The Cerrado is another native biome in Brazil facing rapid destruction and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

A Fasa subsidiary in Pará state regularly received residues from LKJ between 2022 and 2023, according to corporate documents obtained by Repórter Brasil showing truck routes for raw material deliveries. That same subsidiary also supplied beef tallow to DGD from 2023 to 2024, according to customs records.

When contacted, LKJ attributed the cattle purchase from Apucarana Farm to a failure in its internal procedures, stating that it has a policy of not buying from embargoed areas. (See the full response here.) The company claimed it has since blocked both the farm and another property from the same supplier from future sales. LKJ did not comment on its business relationship with Fasa.

Like other slaughterhouses, LKJ is a signatory to an agreement with Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office — known by its Portuguese acronym, MPF — that requires adopting anti-deforestation criteria in cattle procurement in the Amazon. In May of this year, the MPF released audit results focused on LKJ’s operations, revealing that roughly 2,700 animals slaughtered by the company in 2022 — about 8 percent of the audited sample — did not meet the agreement’s criteria. It was the worst result among the six audited slaughterhouses in the state of Tocantins, where LKJ is located.

In 2023 and 2024, in addition to sourcing tallow from Fasa, DGD also imported tallow directly from Minerva, Brazil’s second-largest beef company, customs data show.

Last year, a study by the organization Mighty Earth identified the company as one of the clients supplied by the largest deforester in the Brazilian Pantanal, who was fined the highest penalty ever imposed by the Mato Grosso State Department of the Environment. The individual was held responsible by the state’s Civil Police for the destruction of 81,200 hectares of native vegetation — an area larger than the island of Manhattan — through the aerial spraying of pesticides containing chemicals also found in “Agent Orange.” At the time of the publication, which used data gathered by Repórter Brasil, the company reported that it had blocked the rancher from future business.

Minerva’s plant in Araguaína, in the state of Tocantins, is among those listed in customs documents exporting tallow to DGD. A 2021 Repórter Brasil report showed that this facility had purchased cattle from a rancher fined for illegally clearing 198 acres of Amazon rainforest. Another investigation that same year revealed that the plant’s indirect supply chain included a farm where Brazilian authorities rescued workers from conditions analogous to slavery.

Minerva was contacted to comment on its cattle procurement policies and its relationship with DGD, but did not respond.

Brazil is exporting more tallow to the U.S.

In 2022, Brazil exported 63,000 tons of tallow to the U.S. In 2023, that number jumped to 202,000 tons. And in just the first five months of 2025, Brazil had already shipped 111,000 tons, according to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services.

The increase coincides with the acquisition of the Fasa group by Darling Ingredients. Last year, the U.S. was the destination for 90 percent of all Brazilian tallow exports.

Beef tallow is derived from bovine tissue waste and has a relatively low production cost, as it is extracted from less valuable parts of the animal, such as the carcass. Its use is often described as “animal recycling” and is commonly promoted as a solution for disposing of slaughterhouse residues.

Because it is considered a byproduct, tallow is not subject to the same traceability requirements as beef. However, according to Searchinger, tallow is a valuable commodity for the food industry — it is, for example, widely used in animal feed. When diverted to fuel production, he explains, it increases the demand for vegetable oils and other fats to replace it. “This, in turn, increases pressure on land,” he says.

Searchinger argues that the growth of biofuels is only viable because of public subsidies. He believes that instead of supporting the sector, rich countries should fund environmental conservation in the Global South.

“A $100-per-ton CO2 tax on airline tickets could generate a $100 billion annual fund. That money could be used to pay countries like Brazil to conserve their forests and boost livestock productivity in already cleared areas,” Searchinger suggests.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/desmatamento-parque-guaraja-mirim-alessandro-falco-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-16 11:56:40.779769

The milestone caps aviation’s complete recovery from the pandemic collapse, but the path back reveals fundamental shifts in how the industry operates.

Behind the seemingly modest 0.1% increase in total daily emissions lies a more complex story: airlines achieved a 7.4% improvement in fuel efficiency per available seat kilometer (ASK) while accommodating substantially more passengers. The mathematics of this recovery challenge long-held assumptions about the relationship between aviation growth and environmental impact.

The Recovery Paradox

Here’s what makes July 18 significant: airlines delivered 8.2% more ASKs than August 2, 2019 while increasing total emissions by just 0.1%. Flights crept up only 3.7% over six years, yet carriers found ways to accommodate surging demand through a wholesale reimagining of capacity deployment.

The numbers tell the story. Average aircraft size grew by eight seats to 175 passengers per flight. Route distances stretched 3% longer to 1,626 kilometers on average. Flight times? They barely budged—up just 1.3% to 138 minutes despite busier airspace and longer routes.

Efficiency Context

The 7.4% efficiency improvement represents approximately 187,000 tonnes of CO₂ saved daily compared to 2019 operational standards, though absolute emissions still increased 0.1% due to capacity growth exceeding efficiency gains.

When Plans Meet Reality

The efficiency gains become more intriguing when viewed against operational headwinds. Flight-weighted average aircraft age jumped 17% to 11.6 years—exactly the opposite of what efficiency playbooks recommend. Post-COVID supply chain snarls and unexpected engine durability issues with newer aircraft meant airlines couldn’t simply buy their way to better performance.

Instead, they had to extract more from what they had. The result: proof that operational innovation can deliver efficiency gains even when fleet modernization slows. It’s a finding that challenges conventional wisdom about the primacy of new technology in driving environmental progress.

Fleet Reality

Supply chain constraints and engine reliability issues resulted in older aircraft handling more operations than planned, yet airlines still achieved significant efficiency improvements through operational optimization.

Beyond the Flight Plan

EmeraldSky’s analysis goes deeper than standard industry calculations, which often miss 15-25% of actual emissions by relying on theoretical flight plans rather than operational reality. The system tracks 47 variables across more than 100,000 daily flights—everything from actual taxi times and routing changes to weight variations and holding patterns.

This granular approach reveals efficiency improvements in unexpected places. Airlines didn’t just optimize cruise flight—they squeezed time from ground operations, streamlined routing coordination, and fine-tuned their networks. The 7.4% improvement represents the cumulative effect of hundreds of operational refinements, many invisible to passengers but clearly visible in the fuel burn data.

Data Methodology

EmeraldSky’s comprehensive tracking reveals operational efficiency improvements across multiple dimensions, including areas like ground operations and routing optimization that standard industry fuel burn calculations typically exclude.

What 18 July, 25 Already Tells Us

EmeraldSky’s real-time tracking confirmed what the industry suspected: July 18 was just the beginning. Emissions on 18 July 25 exceeded the 2019 record, and seasonal patterns suggest new peaks will become routine during Northern Hemisphere summer travel seasons.

The question now isn’t whether aviation will set more emissions records—it’s whether the efficiency improvement trajectory can accelerate enough to bend the curve. With easier operational gains likely exhausted and sustainable aviation fuel still comprising less than 1% of consumption, the industry faces the mathematical reality that continued growth will require more fundamental changes to maintain environmental progress.

Financially, this partnership reduces exposure to volatile fuel prices and regulatory penalties. For instance, the GE9X's 10% fuel efficiency gain could save Silk Way an estimated $1.2 million annually per aircraft, assuming current jet fuel prices. These savings are amplified by GE's investment in additive manufacturing and composite materials, which lower engine weight and further enhance performance.

ESG-Driven Investment Thesis

The GE-Silk Way alliance exemplifies how ESG alignment can drive shareholder value. GE Aerospace's $2.7 billion 2024 R&D budget—focused on hybrid electric propulsion and Open Fan architecture—positions it to lead the next phase of aviation decarbonization. For investors, this spending is not merely a cost but a strategic bet on technologies that will dominate the 2030–2050 regulatory landscape.

Silk Way's commitment to SAF and ISO 14001 certification also enhances its appeal to ESG-focused investors. While the airline has not yet disclosed 2024–2025 SAF usage metrics, the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) upcoming SAF accounting methodology (launching in April 2025) will provide a standardized framework for quantifying emissions reductions. This transparency will enable Silk Way to report progress toward net-zero goals, a key factor in attracting green bonds and ESG-linked financing.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Investors and the Planet

GE Aerospace and Silk Way West Airlines have forged a partnership that transcends traditional supplier-customer dynamics. By integrating advanced engine technology with a cargo fleet optimized for scalability and sustainability, they are creating a blueprint for the future of aviation. For investors, this collaboration offers dual benefits: exposure to the high-margin aerospace services sector and alignment with global ESG trends that are reshaping capital allocation. As the IATA's SAF reporting framework and CORSIA compliance deadlines loom, the GE-Silk Way model will likely serve as a benchmark for how strategic innovation and environmental stewardship can coexist—and thrive—in the post-pandemic era.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1758035026404.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-16 11:57:08.065450

This summer, United celebrated its best operational summer ever at EWR, putting the airport on par with JFK and LGA for on-time performance. In fact, United flights out of Newark arrived on-time more often this summer than flights operated by airlines out of JFK or LGA.*

These rankings come as more than six million people flew United on-time through Newark this summer, the most in the airline’s history.** In addition, United’s Connection Saver technology helped more than 28,000 customers make tight connections in Newark this summer.

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin. Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Additionally, United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark.

“Newark is operating better than ever and United’s future here is bright – that’s a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,” said Kirby. “I want to also thank Secretary Duffy, FAA Administrator Bedford, Governor Murphy and all the national, state and local leaders who helped ensure that Newark remains a safe and reliable crown jewel for millions of domestic and international travelers. As the FAA and DOT implement their plan of increased staffing and improved technology, the reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.”

“Millions of passengers each year rely on Newark Airport for their travel needs. Over the past several months, we have worked diligently with our partners at the Port Authority and the FAA to move towards a return to full capacity at Newark Airport, and I am pleased with our progress,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. “United’s continued investment in Newark Airport will serve as a significant economic driver for our region, creating thousands of new jobs for New Jersey communities. I thank United CEO Scott Kirby for his partnership in supporting our region’s world-class transportation infrastructure.”

In April and May, challenges associated with air traffic control staffing, technology outages and runway construction led to a concentrated number of delays and cancelations out of Newark. But since that time, bookings and customer confidence in flying through Newark have bounced back thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees, including:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2

Beginning in May, the FAA limited Newark flight operations to 68 per hour. This was down from a high of 86, a number that was well above EWR’s maximum theoretical capacity even in ideal operating conditions. The FAA has tentatively limited flights out of Newark to 72 per hour through summer 2026.

In July, the FAA installed a new fiber optic network to support the air traffic control system

“We’re building a brand new air traffic control system, and we started by addressing the challenges of outdated technology at Newark,” said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. “This summer, the FAA took immediate action to relieve substantial inconveniences to the traveling public—deploying a temporary satellite backup system, upgrading fiberoptic technology, expanding high-bandwidth telecommunications, increasing controller staffing, and limiting arrivals and departures. Through strong partnerships with the Port Authority and United, we made significant progress this summer.”

United Invests More in Newark Destinations

As the gateway to the Atlantic, Newark plays a critical role in connecting passengers to United’s industry-leading international network.

United’s most talked about 2025 destination, Nuuk, Greenland, will return to Newark for summer 2026 following a successful and enthusiastic first season.

This summer, EWR had more international departures (over 20,000) and more departures to Europe (more than 8,200) than any other United hub

This summer, all of United’s 32 European destinations were served from EWR

“Business aviation operates in a fragmented ecosystem,” explains Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR.
“We don’t anticipate business aviation will be priced out or deprioritized in the USA, as business aviation has been at the forefront of adopting and integrating SAF into the supply chain,” he says.
Ricci says “Business aviation may not always command the same priority as commercial airlines in the SAF market.
“Particularly at tier one and tier two business aviation hubs,” Ricci says.","As the aviation industry races toward decarbonization targets, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the primary pathway to reducing emissions. However, the fragmented nature of business aviation’s supply chain creates several hurdles in securing consistent access to this critical fuel source.

“Business aviation operates in a fragmented ecosystem,” explains Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR. “Unlike commercial carriers that benefit from large, centralized fuel purchasing and dedicated airport infrastructure, business aircraft rely heavily on fixed-base operators and decentralized supply chains.

“This makes consistent SAF access more difficult, particularly at secondary or regional airports.”

The infrastructure challenges are particularly acute for smaller airports that serve business aviation. C.R. Sincock, II, executive vice president of Avfuel Corporation says, “The primary limitations to SAF availability stem from geographic and infrastructure constraints, particularly around access points like blending terminals and truck racks. With only a handful of blending facilities in operation, transporting SAF from these locations to smaller airports presents both economic and logistical challenges.”

The SAF landscape

The supply for sustainable aviation fuel chain remains in its infancy compared to traditional jet fuel infrastructure. “The SAF supply chain is still developing and remains relatively immature in breadth compared to the established production infrastructure for traditional Jet-A,” Sincock explains. “Currently, the primary pathway used to produce SAF is the HEFA-SPK process, whereby SAF is derived from used cooking oils and tallow.”

Production capacity, while growing, still lags significantly behind demand. “SAF production is steadily increasing but supply still lags behind the volumes required to both reach industry goals, like America’s SAF Grand Challenge to produce 3 billion gallons annually by 2030, and the various mandates in the UK and EU,” Sincock says.

This creates a complex web of challenges. “One of the primary challenges is the geographic gap between where SAF is produced, where it’s blended and where it’s ultimately used, making efficient distribution a logistical hurdle,” Sincock explains.

Commercial competition

The situation becomes more complex as major airlines sign substantial multi-year offtake agreements with SAF producers. “Larger hub airports are typically prioritized for SAF deliveries due to their existing airline contracts, robust infrastructure and direct pipeline supply from refiners,” Sincock explains.

“Access to pipeline-fed fuel storage enhances SAF distribution’s efficiency and economic viability.” This prioritization has become particularly evident in regulated markets. “This has become especially evident in the EU where mandates and different country’s regulations favor delivery to high-traffic airports within the producing country’s boundaries,” Sincock notes.

However, Sincock remains optimistic about business aviation’s position. “We don’t anticipate business aviation will be priced out or deprioritized in the USA, as business aviation has been at the forefront of adopting and integrating SAF into the supply chain,” he says.

The numbers support this assertion. “Business aviation continues to punch above its weight, while it accounts for roughly 4% of total jet fuel consumption, it is responsible for more than 10% of all SAF usage,” Sincock notes.

Despite this leadership, concerns about long-term access persist. Ricci says “Business aviation may not always command the same priority as commercial airlines in the SAF market. However, what offsets this is flexibility. Business aircraft can often refuel at airports with SAF availability, and many operators are leveraging book and claim models.”

Regional disparities

Geographic location significantly impacts SAF access, with notable differences between markets. “Europe, particularly in countries like the Netherlands, France, and Sweden, has more consistent SAF availability at major business aviation airports due to both regulatory pushes, for example blending mandates, and infrastructure readiness,”Ricci says. “North America is still largely opportunistic, SAF is available at a few key hubs but not widely.”

The European regulatory environment creates both opportunities and challenges. “In the EU, however, SAF is more challenging to obtain outside of major hubs,” Sincock explains. “This is largely due to legislated mandates that prioritize larger airports and airline carriers, making SAF access and logistics more difficult for smaller airports,” he says.

Some operators are finding innovative ways to address supply chain concerns through local production. Johan Emmoth, CEO and FBO manager at Grafair Flight Management in Sweden, has pioneered an approach that addresses environmental concerns about SAF transportation.

“Historically SAF has had to be transported over long distances, which sometimes leads you to think — how good is that for the environment when the fuel had to travel overseas or by trucks?” Emmoth explains. “What’s very interesting for us now is that Sweden actually has a refinery that can produce SAF locally and it is not too far from our FBO. We got our first locally produced SAF driven to us in a dedicated trailer that’s only used for full blend SAF. And it’s been pulled by a truck that only runs on 100% renewable diesel fuel, so it’s environmentally friendly.”

Storage challenges

The technical aspects of SAF distribution present both opportunities and obstacles. “From a storage perspective, SAF is treated simply as jet fuel. They both conform to ASTM D-1655 specifications,” Sincock explains. “Because of this, in most cases, SAF is intermingled with jet fuel in the airport’s established fuel storage system, and management systems carefully track its inventory.”

However, the distribution infrastructure creates more complex challenges. “To help lower supply costs, larger airports benefit from pipeline access and higher load capacity,” Sincock notes. “In contrast, smaller airports rely on a trucking system to deliver SAF. This may be a less economical option than pipeline transport, but it works within the system’s existing infrastructure.”

The scale of operations at smaller airports creates additional economic pressures. “Additionally, the scale of fuel uplift is smaller, making the business case for physical SAF delivery less compelling for suppliers focused on volume and throughput,” Ricci says.

Book and claim solutions

To address supply chain gaps, fuel suppliers have developed book and claim systems that allow operators to purchase SAF’s environmental benefits without requiring physical delivery at their location.

“Through Avfuel’s book and claim system, customers can purchase the environmental attributes of SAF, the emissions reduction benefit that is linked to actual SAF volumes delivered elsewhere,” Sincock explains. “This allows customers to claim the sustainability value without requiring physical SAF to be available at their specific location.”

The adoption of these programs has accelerated significantly. “We’ve seen a significant uptick, both in volume and in the sophistication of client questions,” Ricci says. “Operators, flight departments, and even fractional jet owners are now integrating SAF credit purchases into broader sustainability strategies. The demand isn’t just compliance-driven, it’s reputational and competitive as well.”

However, some operators prefer the transparency of physical SAF delivery. “I think book and claim will remain the major model. It makes the most sense,” Emmoth explains.

Market demand

The demand profile for SAF in business aviation shows encouraging trends. “Demand for SAF is growing steadily, driven by strong interest from sustainability-focused operators and Fortune 500 companies,” Sincock says. “The highest demand comes from those with defined ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] targets and active carbon offset programs.”

FBOs are responding with infrastructure investments. “Particularly at tier one and tier two business aviation hubs,” Ricci says. “FBO operators that have been early movers, have invested in tank modifications, SAF-ready fuel trucks, and staff training.”

Looking ahead, industry experts anticipate continued growth in SAF availability. “By 2030, I envision SAF being routinely available at most major bizav hubs in North America and Europe, with scalable options in Asia and the Middle East,” Ricci forecasts. “Pricing will likely remain at a premium, but we expect more stability and incentives to narrow the gap.”

Industry leaders identify several key areas requiring attention to accelerate SAF adoption. “First and foremost, we need consistent, stable, long-term policy support, such as tax credits and incentives, at all levels of government to encourage the significant investment required for SAF production,” Sincock says.

Awareness of SAF remains equally critical. “Secondly, ongoing education is critical, not just for end-users, FBOs and airports, but also for government agencies to build widespread understanding of SAF’s environmental benefits when clients are deciding to go in the green direction and making sure it’s not just green washing.

“Sweden has a history of flight shaming and environmental consciousness, so I think it’s a good to show SAF is an option but it’s up to the customer to choose whether they’d like to have.”

“Third, we must encourage end users to engage on how their flight departments can play a role in meeting corporate ESG goals through SAF adoption,” Sincock explains.

The path forward for business aviation’s SAF access will likely require a multi-faceted approach. While book and claim systems provide immediate scalability, operators like Grafair show that physical SAF delivery can work when supported by local production and dedicated infrastructure. The industry’s challenge lies not in choosing between these models, but in developing parallel systems that serve different market segments and operational needs.

Success will ultimately depend on continued investment in production capacity, infrastructure development, and education initiatives that help operators understand their options. As Emmoth notes, “You need to produce SAF and pump it into the system. What we’re doing puts SAF on the table for decision makers and big companies.” With business aviation punching above its weight in SAF adoption, the sector’s continued leadership in sustainable fuel integration will be crucial for achieving industry-wide decarbonization targets.",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/82-3756897089-68835a103ee28.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:56:11.528100

I thank United CEO Scott Kirby for his partnership in supporting our region's world-class transportation infrastructure.""

In April and May, challenges associated with air traffic control staffing, technology outages and runway construction led to a concentrated number of delays and cancelations out of Newark. But since that time, bookings and customer confidence in flying through Newark have bounced back thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees, including:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2

Beginning in May, the FAA limited Newark flight operations to 68 per hour. This was down from a high of 86, a number that was well above EWR's maximum theoretical capacity even in ideal operating conditions. The FAA has tentatively limited flights out of Newark to 72 per hour through summer 2026.

In July, the FAA installed a new fiber optic network to support the air traffic control system

""We're building a brand new air traffic control system, and we started by addressing the challenges of outdated technology at Newark,"" said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. ""This summer, the FAA took immediate action to relieve substantial inconveniences to the traveling public—deploying a temporary satellite backup system, upgrading fiberoptic technology, expanding high-bandwidth telecommunications, increasing controller staffing, and limiting arrivals and departures. Through strong partnerships with the Port Authority and United, we made significant progress this summer.""

At the time of the arrest, Frialto stated it had suspended business with the rancher’s properties.
The company claimed it has since blocked both the farm and another property from the same supplier from future sales.","DGD (Diamond Green Diesel), a U.S. leader in renewable diesel production, imports beef tallow from a supplier fed by Brazilian slaughterhouses, which purchased it from farms fined for illegal deforestation. These include a plant that purchased cattle from a rancher described by Brazilian authorities as the “largest destroyer of the Amazon” ever investigated.

Repórter Brasil obtained documents about DGD’s supplier chain and identified cases with connections slaughterhouses that bought cattle from ranchers fined for practices associated with large-scale illegal deforestation (more details below).

These cases raise a red flag about the potential harmful climate impacts of alternative fuels. Despite biofuels’ image as a ‘green’ fuel, the use of livestock inputs in their production can increase deforestation, warns Tim Searchinger, a senior researcher at Princeton University. “The reason land is being deforested is to meet growing demand for food and biofuels,” he says.

Deforestation accounts for around 13% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to UN estimates. In Brazil, it is the leading driver of such emissions.

On its website, DGD claims its industrial plant can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil diesel. However, it does not mention any measures to prevent the purchase of tallow sourced from deforested pastures. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to fueling cars and trucks, DGD’s Texas facility produces SAF – short for “sustainable aviation fuel” – a product intended to reduce the climate footprint of the aviation industry. Avfuel Corporation, one of the main independent jet fuel suppliers in the U.S., received the first SAF delivery from DGD in December 2024.

From forest destruction to biofuel production

According to customs documents reviewed by Repórter Brasil, DGD regularly purchases beef tallow from the Fasa group, a Brazilian company specializing in processing slaughterhouse by-products. DGD and Fasa belong to the same economic group, as the Brazilian company was acquired in 2022 by Texas-based multinational Darling Ingredients, one of DGD’s owners through a joint venture with Valero Energy. Also headquartered in Texas, Valero Energy is one of the largest fuel producers in the U.S.

The Fasa group has subsidiaries in the Amazon – called Araguaia and Rio Verde – which source tallow from various slaughterhouses in the region. The supplier’s history, according to official documents obtained by the report, includes Frialto, a slaughterhouse from Mato Grosso identified through GTAs (animal transport guides) purchasing cattle from a rancher arrested by the Brazilian Federal Police in 2023. He was accused by the Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office of clearing an area of forest equivalent to about 12,000 American football fields and is identified by the agency as the largest Amazonian deforester ever investigated.

One month after the arrest, Repórter Brasil revealed that Frialto had bought cattle from the rancher and his relatives. Now, the outlet has obtained an official letter from the government of Mato Grosso, dated October 2023, related to the renewal of Frialto’s operating license. In the document, a Fasa subsidiary is listed as the recipient of residues generated by Frialto. According to customs records, this same Fasa unit sent beef tallow to DGD multiple times between 2023 and 2024.

At the time of the arrest, Frialto stated it had suspended business with the rancher’s properties. Repórter Brasil contacted the slaughterhouse again to inquire about its dealings with Fasa and any measures taken to avoid sourcing from illegally deforested areas but received no response.

Fasa, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, and DGD also did not respond to requests for comment.

Another illegal deforestation case linked to DGD’s supply chain involves the LKJ slaughterhouse. Cattle movement records accessed by Repórter Brasil show that in July 2023, LKJ purchased animals from a ranch in Brazil’s Cerrado biome — called Apucarana Farm—which had 381 hectares embargoed after environmental authorities confirmed illegal deforestation. The Cerrado is another native biome in Brazil facing rapid destruction and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

A Fasa subsidiary in Pará state regularly received residues from LKJ between 2022 and 2023, according to corporate documents obtained by Repórter Brasil showing truck routes for raw material deliveries. That same subsidiary also supplied beef tallow to DGD from 2023 to 2024, according to customs records.

When contacted, LKJ attributed the cattle purchase from Apucarana Farm to a failure in its internal procedures, stating that it has a policy of not buying from embargoed areas (see full response here). The company claimed it has since blocked both the farm and another property from the same supplier from future sales. LKJ did not comment on its business relationship with Fasa.

Like other slaughterhouses, LKJ is a signatory to an agreement with Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office (MPF) that requires adopting anti-deforestation criteria in cattle procurement in the Amazon. In May of this year, MPF released audit results focused on LKJ’s operations, revealing that roughly 2,700 animals slaughtered by the company in 2022 – about 8% of the audited sample – did not meet the agreement’s criteria. It was the worst result among the six audited slaughterhouses in the state of Tocantins, where LKJ is located.

In 2023 and 2024, in addition to sourcing tallow from Fasa, DGD also imported tallow directly from Minerva, Brazil’s second-largest beef company, customs data show.

Last year, a study by the organization Mighty Earth identified the company as a client of deforester in the Brazilian Pantanal, who was fined with the highest penalty ever imposed by the Mato Grosso State Department of the Environment. The individual was held responsible by the state’s Civil Police for the destruction of 81,200 hectares of native vegetation – an area larger than the island of Manhattan – through the aerial spraying of pesticides containing chemicals also found in “Agent Orange.” At the time of publication, which used data gathered by Repórter Brasil, the company reported that it had blocked the rancher from future business.

Minerva’s plant in Araguaína (Tocantins state) is among those listed in customs documents exporting tallow to DGD. A 2021 Repórter Brasil report showed that this facility had purchased cattle from a rancher fined for illegally clearing 80 hectares of Amazon rainforest. Another investigation that same year revealed that the plant’s indirect supply chain included a farm where Brazilian authorities rescued workers from conditions analogous to slavery.

Minerva was contacted to comment on its cattle procurement policies and its relationship with DGD, but did not respond.

Brazil is exporting more tallow to the U.S.

In 2022, Brazil exported 63,000 tons of tallow to the U.S. In 2023, that number jumped to 202,000 tons. And in just the first five months of 2025, Brazil had already shipped 111,000 tons, according to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services.

The increase coincides with the acquisition of the Fasa group by Darling Ingredients. Last year, the U.S. was the destination for 90% of all Brazilian tallow exports.

Beef tallow is derived from bovine tissue waste and has a relatively low production cost, as it is extracted from less valuable parts of the animal, such as the carcass. Its use is often described as “animal recycling” and is commonly promoted as a solution for disposing of slaughterhouse residues.

Because it is considered a by-product, tallow is not subject to the same traceability requirements as beef. However, according to Searchinger, tallow is a valuable commodity for the food industry – it is, for example, widely used in animal feed. When diverted to fuel production, he explains, it increases the demand for vegetable oils and other fats to replace it. “This, in turn, increases pressure on land,” he says.

Searchinger argues that the growth of biofuels is only viable because of public subsidies. He believes that instead of supporting the sector, rich countries should fund environmental conservation in the Global South.

“A $100-per-ton CO₂ tax on airline tickets could generate a $100 billion annual fund. That money could be used to pay countries like Brazil to conserve their forests and boost livestock productivity in already cleared areas,” Searchinger suggests.",https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/desmatamento-parque-guaraja-mirim-alessandro-falco-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:57:05.334420

New Zealand has launched its first whole-of-sector Aviation Action Plan, with headline measures including permanent access to RNZAF Base Ohakea as an alternate runway for wide-body aircraft and targeted support for vulnerable regional air routes.

The 25-point roadmap, unveiled on 15 September at the Aviation Industry Association Conference in Wellington by Associate Transport Minister James Meager, sets out a programme of deliverables to address regulatory bottlenecks, workforce shortages, fragile regional connectivity and the transition to lower-carbon aviation.

“Aviation is vital to New Zealand’s economic prosperity and our way of life,” Meager said. “This plan is a practical roadmap that tackles the challenges head-on — from strengthening regional connectivity and passenger rights to embracing new technologies and building a skilled workforce.”

A major milestone for New Zealand’s aviation sector

The Action Plan is the first of its kind, developed jointly by industry and government through the Interim Aviation Council following the Air Navigation System Review.

It marks a decisive attempt to provide long-term leadership for an industry that contributes more than 5.6 per cent of GDP and supports thousands of jobs across tourism, trade, logistics and essential services.

Meager stressed that progress is already underway. “We’ve made progress on several fronts, including $30 million in loans from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to support regional routes, and the start of a first-principles review of Civil Aviation Authority funding,” he told delegates.

The Interim Council will now transition into a permanent Aviation Council to provide oversight and refresh the plan every three years.

Civil Aviation Authority reforms to support aviation growth

A central focus is on reforming the regulatory environment. The Civil Aviation Authority and Ministry of Transport will rework rules for emerging technologies such as drones and uncrewed aircraft, while also introducing a two-year rolling programme of rule changes to accelerate decision-making.

Certification wait times are to be shortened through better resourcing, digitised systems and automation of routine processes. The government’s stated ambition is a framework that is robust, internationally credible and agile, maintaining safety standards while supporting innovation.

Industry bodies have highlighted the need for such reforms. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has previously criticised New Zealand’s airport economic regulatory framework as “not fit for purpose,” urging changes to ensure fairer and more efficient outcomes for airlines and passengers.

Aviation workforce shortages and new training pathways

Workforce reform is another urgent priority. Ringa Hora, the workforce development council, will update pilot training by the end of 2025, creating an airline-approved qualification that can be completed more quickly and aligned more closely with industry needs.

A broader package will address retention, recruitment and diversity, with an emphasis on encouraging more Māori and women into aviation careers.

“The aviation workforce is critical to the success of the whole aviation system,” said Meager. “We need to make aviation an attractive and sustainable career path, so that the sector has the skilled people it needs to grow.”

International mutual recognition of licences will also be pursued, allowing skilled personnel to move more easily between jurisdictions.

RNZAF Ohakea runway access and future aviation infrastructure

One of the most eye-catching measures is the decision to make RNZAF Base Ohakea permanently available as an alternate runway for widebody aircraft by December 2026.

The move underscores the need for resilience in the face of disruption at Auckland or Wellington and highlights growing civil–military cooperation.

The plan also directs the mapping of future aviation infrastructure requirements, including capacity for sustainable aviation fuel, electrification of smaller aircraft, and new technologies such as electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles.

Airports and airlines will work with the government to ensure the system can adapt to next-generation needs.

Support for regional air routes and stronger passenger rights

The fragility of regional routes has been acknowledged with targeted support.

New Zealand’s regional airlines have faced mounting pressures in recent years, with rising fuel, maintenance and regulatory costs making thin-margin routes increasingly hard to sustain.

Smaller carriers such as Sounds Air and Air Chathams have struggled to finance new aircraft and maintain connectivity, with Sounds Air announcing the sale of five Pilatus PC-12s and the withdrawal of several routes.

The plan authorises the use of the Regional Infrastructure Fund to help small airlines acquire or lease aircraft, refinance debt on concessionary terms, and invest in IT systems to enable interlining with larger carriers. These measures are intended to secure lifeline connections for communities until market conditions improve.

Passengers are also in focus. By early 2026, the Aviation Council will introduce improvements to make air travel more accessible for disabled people, while the Ministry of Transport will review consumer rights against international benchmarks on disruption, refunds and compensation.

Sustainable aviation fuel and net-zero growth plan

In line with New Zealand’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, the plan outlines steps to support the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and alternative propulsion.

Work will begin in 2025 with Australia on regional supply chains for SAF, while the government will reaffirm its participation in the international Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Electric aircraft and uncrewed aerial systems are also flagged as opportunities to transform the economics of regional routes and create new markets in agriculture and forestry.

Air New Zealand’s recent decision to drop its 2030 carbon intensity target, citing slow progress on new aircraft deliveries and SAF availability, highlights the importance of these policy interventions in bridging near-term gaps and sustaining momentum toward net zero.

Permanent Aviation Council to drive accountability

Perhaps the most significant feature of the plan is its structure. Every action has a named lead organisation, a delivery timeline and a monitoring mechanism.

The new permanent Aviation Council will report annually to the Minister and refresh the plan every three years, ensuring that it remains a living document rather than a static policy exercise.

“This plan is not a one-off document,” said Meager. “It is a foundation for long-term change, with accountability built in, to make sure our aviation sector continues to connect us, lift prosperity and support communities across New Zealand.”

How New Zealand’s aviation plan compares internationally

New Zealand’s initiative sits alongside similar moves overseas. Australia’s 2024 Aviation White Paper laid out 56 policy initiatives spanning workforce, regional connectivity, regulation, safety and emissions.

The UK has also submitted its State Action Plan to ICAO, with comparable emphases on SAF and emissions tracking.

Closer to home, New Zealand’s Space and Advanced Aviation Strategy 2024-2030 already sets ambitions in regulation and R&D for advanced aviation.

The new Action Plan builds on that foundation, giving the sector a more integrated and accountable framework for the future.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Air-Chathams-ATR-72.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:57:31.008356

Indian Diesel Export to EU At 11 Month High Before a Looming Ban on Russian Crude Oil

Indian diesel exports to Europe surged to an eleven month high as EU plans to ban Russian crude oil from third countries. India exported 260,000 per day last month, 63% percent increase from July, reported Independent. European buyers are building reserves while they can to stockpile the oil.

Almost all the cargoes exported were from Reliance Industries, India’s largest private refiner. The EU banned the direct import of Russian oil in February 2023 and from January 2026, it will also ban the import from third countries.

China’s Push for Renewable Energy Can Fuel Global Energy Transition

China’s rapid adoption of green energy and reliance on electricity can result in the decline of the world’s usage of fossil fuels by 2030. Between 2015 and 2023, China’s final energy consumption fell by 1.7% across buildings, infrastructure, and transport and electricity use rose 65%, reported CarbonCopy.

China is investing heavily in renewable energy. In 2024, China invested $625 billion in clean energy, which is 31% of the global investment. This has also led to decline in power and technology prices that is helping many emerging economies shift to clean energy.

Fossil Fuels Subsidies in US for Have More Than Doubled Since 2017

The United States subsidises the fossil fuel industry of $31Billion per year. This figure has more than doubled since 2017 which is likely an understatement due to the difficulty in quantifying the financial gains from some government support, reported The Guardian.

According to the report, these handouts can pose a massive barrier to decarbonisation, which is very crucial to avoid the worst impact of climate change. US President Donald Trump’s signature tax-and-spend bill will further aggravate the issue as it is poised to hand out another $4Billion per year across the next decade.

Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever?
“One percent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 percent of aviation emissions.
With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry—and wider business travel sector—is running out of time to decarbonize.","Most corporate travel managers are still on their first steps of their sustainability journeys. It is clear that, no matter what the messages are that are emerging from the EU or the White House, that more companies are taking those steps.

Those companies in the early stages of their sustainability journeys will quickly mature thanks to the proliferation of technology and expertise in the market today.

“There is an expectation in the uplift of the quality of sustainability data to finance-level, audited data,” said CTM head of sustainability Lauren Hook. “What this means is the need for accurate and timely data will become increasingly important for businesses at both ends of the sustainability maturity spectrum.”

While we have seen that companies are reacting to regulatory pressure more than anything else in their sustainability strategies, peer pressure is also important.

“We are seeing very significant pressure being applied by some of the largest companies in the world, in particular, Microsoft, AstraZeneca, Salesforce, Schneider Electric and Siemens [are] asking their suppliers to report on their emissions and set up their own forward-looking targets,” said Adam Braun, founder and CEO of Clarasight.

“We actually believe that added business pressure is more powerful than just the regulatory pressure. Often, we're hearing from companies saying we need to do more than just report on last year's emissions. We now need to set credible targets going forward and then have both a system of record and a system of action to be able to credibly achieve that goal.”

Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Aspen believes we will see more carbon budgets being used by corporates. Indeed, Concur is set to facilitate carbon budgets in its booking tool this quarter.

In May, Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Apsen told BTN Europe that it will be the first organization to take advantage of the new capability, with “several corporates lined up for the initial rollout, including a mix of Fortune 500s.”

Aspen believes that carbon budgets at the team level will be the most popular. “How can an individual make that decision? If they think their trip is more important than their boss's trip in two months’ time they’re going to book it anyway,” he said. “There are also many places out there where there is only one flight a day. If your carbon budget said you now have to reduce your carbon by 10 per cent then that is useless information—you are going to take that one flight.”

He continued: “When you have budgets at a division level with 10,000 people, it is too impersonal. What does it matter that you are emitting one tonne of CO2 when the division still has thousands of tonnes to emit.” Teams are therefore the sweetspot where a budget is most meaningful and can truly change behavior and thus impact.

FLYING TOWARDS 2050

Decarbonizing aviation in particular will remain crucial to decarbonizing business travel by 2050. The figure below shows a range of different pathways that aviation might achieve net zero by 2050. It shows scenarios outlined by IATA, ICAO, the International Council on Clean Transportation and the Air Transport Action Group.

American Express Global Business Travel’s head of sustainability, Nora Lovell Marchant, said the figures reveal that “the low-hanging fruit is basically gone” but that sustainable aviation fuel, shown in green, is a major part of all these scenarios.

Operations (shown in yellow), such as using greener flight paths, and tech (in blue), like more fuel-efficient planes, make up another significant part of the emission reductions.

Carbon removal and market-based measures (light grey), such as carbon pricing in Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme, are also important in many of the scenarios. Other scenarios leave residual emissions (in dark grey)—carbon emissions that cannot be removed by other methods—that need to be offset in some other way.

CONTROLLING DEMAND

Many of the scenarios include a purple bar denoting demand impact or reduction—i.e. reducing the demand for business travel.

Will fewer business trips be part of the solution? The BTN Intelligence survey showed that 46 percent of travel managers are promoting the use of virtual meeting tools instead of face-to-face travel, although few if any companies are mandating this.

Katharina Riederer, co-founder of eco.mio, said: “Obviously it's the best solution not to travel but the difficulty in our industry is that this industry exists because of travel, so reducing travel... no one really wants to push that. Also, when I do my booking, I have already decided that I have to travel and I have already got the approval.”

Nora Lovell Marchant said the pandemic showed that meetings could move to Zoom. “Now aviation traffic is growing because people know the value of business trips and putting people in front of people,” she said. “Are there some business trips that can and should be replaced with Zoom? Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever? Absolutely.”

She continued: “We need to think about how to decarbonize that... because even the most liberal non-profit organizations recognize that other types of solutions besides demand management alone will be needed in order to decarbonize aviation.”

Benjamin Park, head of travel and sustainability at Parexel, expects sustainability in business travel to become more data-driven, with increased transparency and accountability. “Emissions methodologies will evolve, and corporates will need to adopt more granular tracking and reporting,” he said.

Park also believes that employee and customer expectations will increasingly influence corporate travel programs. “For roles requiring travel, the maturity of a company’s sustainable travel strategy may become a differentiator in talent attraction and retention,” he said.

Park added: “While cost management remains important, we are seeing a shift toward ‘purposeful travel’ where the value of each trip is weighed against its environmental impact. This mindset helps us reduce unnecessary travel while preserving essential face-to-face patient and customer engagement.”

As Advito’s senior director of sustainability Julien Etchanchu said, in spite of delays to the full roll-out of CSRD, “at some point, we will have to travel less not just because of the environment but because at some point there will be an energy crisis.”

Could unbridled aviation growth be managed through taxes and fees that are reinvested in the industry’s pursuit of net zero? “One percent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 percent of aviation emissions. People want to travel. At the moment, someone traveling once every 10 years is taxed in the same way as a business traveler traveling 20 times a year.

“The problem is you don’t pay for the pollution you make—that is the ultimate issue. You could imagine a frequent flyer levy where the first trip is free of tax, the second you start to increase it a bit and by trip 10 you are highly taxed and ever more highly in business class. The pressure for levies will grow,” warned Etchanchu.

With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry—and wider business travel sector—is running out of time to decarbonize. While plans, policies and ideas are rife, now is the time for action.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is reshaping the landscape of air travel and sustainable tourism by offering a viable alternative to conventional jet fuels. Airports and airlines across the globe are actively integrating SAF into their operations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and foster more environmentally responsible travel. Portland International Airport (PDX) and Delta Airlines are leading the charge in the United States, demonstrating a clear commitment to sustainability in aviation. These initiatives have implications beyond the aviation sector, extending into the tourism industry, where the demand for eco-conscious travel options is rapidly increasing.

Portland International Airport and Delta Airlines Leading SAF Adoption

Portland International Airport recently received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel, with Delta Airlines being the first commercial airline to utilize this blend. The fuel is composed of two main components: conventional jet fuel, which constitutes half of the mixture, and the feedstock, which provides the sustainable element. The blending process results in a fuel that can be directly used by aircraft without requiring modifications to engines or airport infrastructure.

The adoption of SAF at PDX aligns with broader efforts to improve local air quality and reduce carbon emissions. By transitioning to blended fuels, flights departing from Portland can contribute to lowering the airport’s environmental impact while supporting the local community. While the cost of SAF remains two to three times higher than conventional jet fuel, Delta Airlines has been actively working with suppliers to manage expenses and increase adoption without compromising operational efficiency.

Challenges and Criticisms of SAF

Despite the benefits, the use of sustainable aviation fuel has faced criticism. Some environmental organizations, such as 350PDX, argue that SAF could be a form of greenwashing rather than a definitive climate solution. Concerns have been raised about the risks associated with storing combustible fuels in sensitive areas, such as earthquake-prone zones along rivers. Additionally, producing SAF at the scale required to meet global aviation demand would necessitate an unprecedented increase in production, potentially leading to environmental impacts from land use changes and agricultural practices.

The debate highlights the importance of balancing innovation in sustainable fuels with rigorous oversight and accountability. Advocates emphasize that SAF should be part of a broader strategy, which includes alternative technologies, carbon offsetting, and innovations in flight efficiency to achieve meaningful reductions in aviation-related emissions.

While speaking to BW Businessworld, he emphasised that fuel producers bear the responsibility to innovate and reduce SAF costs while maintaining environmental sustainability, ensuring adoption is feasible across India, Europe, the US, and the Asia Pacific.

India’s aviation sector is growing rapidly, driven by rising domestic travel and expanding international connectivity. India currently accounts for roughly 2.5 per cent of global ATF demand, exporting nearly half of its production, highlighting the potential for domestic SAF adoption.

With the country poised to become one of the world’s largest aviation markets, concerns over rising carbon emissions are mounting. Aviation’s share in India’s transport emissions is expected to increase significantly. Policymakers and stakeholders are exploring sustainable alternatives like SAF to meet climate targets while keeping air travel affordable for India’s price-sensitive passengers without disrupting the sector’s growth.

According to the Deloitte study, Passenger traffic in India is projected to grow at about 10 per cent CAGR, rising from 220 million in 2023-24 to nearly 390 million by 2030. Freight volumes are expected to increase at a 13 per cent CAGR, from 2.4 million tonnes to 5.1 million tonnes. ATF demand is set to double to 15 to 16 million tonne.

Is SAF Feasible for India?

Achieving net-zero aviation emissions in India depends on integrating SAF with traditional jet fuel. Initial SAF blending mandates focus on international flights, but scaling domestic production is critical. Abundant feedstocks, including agricultural residues, sugarcane, sweet sorghum, and used cooking oil, offer a pathway to a competitive SAF ecosystem. Efficient integration of technology, rural supply chains, and production infrastructure is necessary to make SAF adoption practical, sustainable, and aligned with India’s aviation and climate goals.

India’s SAF blending targets are 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. SAF is expected to contribute 53 to 66 per cent toward India’s net-zero aviation targets by 2050. Key technologies include HEFA, alcohol-to-jet, fischer–tropsch and power-to-liquid. Domestic feedstocks such as agricultural residues, used cooking oil, sugarcane, and sweet sorghum can reduce carbon intensity by up to 84 per cent, making SAF technically feasible and sustainable for the Indian market.

“If you set up your SAF plant in the correct manner, it is very much financially viable,” Olsson said. He added, “The key is to rethink and innovate across the entire SAF value chain, from feedstock collection to final fuel production. At low blending mandates of 1 to 5 per cent, the cost impact on Indian airlines is minimal. With careful planning, technological adoption, and efficient supply chains, SAF can be produced and supplied in a way that is practical, financially sustainable, and beneficial to all stakeholders.”

Can Airlines Afford SAF?

The high cost of SAF raises concerns for Indian airlines, particularly low-cost carriers. Gradual integration, blending mandates, and innovative pricing strategies are needed to ensure airlines remain financially viable. Oil companies and policymakers must support SAF production, blending, and logistics infrastructure. The goal is to maintain operational efficiency while meeting India’s environmental commitments, ensuring the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel does not disrupt the affordability of air travel for passengers.

SAF costs about two to five times more than regular jet fuel, depending on feedstock. Using agricultural residues costs USD 550 to 650 per tonne, used cooking oil USD 800 to 900 per tonne, and sugarcane USD 300 to 400 per tonne. Notably, domestic SAF demand at 5 per cent blending is expected to reach 0.8 million tonnes by 2030. With a production potential of 8 to 10 MT, India can meet domestic needs and even export. In India, over 3,000 crore Indian rupee has already been committed under central and state schemes to support SAF production.

“At low blending mandates of 1 to 5 per cent, the price impact on airlines is minimal,” Jimmy Olsson said. He added, “Airlines can manage SAF costs through a blended approach and adjust pricing strategies. Even low-cost carriers can adopt SAF without affecting profitability. European carriers like KLM and Lufthansa are already offering low-carbon flights at a small premium, showing that sustainable aviation can be integrated successfully while keeping operations viable.”

Does SAF Threaten Food Security?

Concerns about land use, crop availability, and nutrition emerge when SAF feedstocks come from agriculture. Effective SAF adoption must avoid disrupting food security while supporting rural development. Linking SAF production to farmer incomes, employment, and sustainable practices ensures socio-economic benefits. The challenge is to implement SAF policies that achieve environmental goals without straining India’s food system, ensuring that sustainable aviation fuel supports communities, airlines, and the nation’s climate commitments.

India’s SAF feedstocks, including crop residues and used cooking oil, can reduce carbon intensity by 72 to 84 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel. Crop Residue Management programs in Haryana and Punjab reduced stubble burning by 45 to 69 per cent, cut one million tonnes of CO2 emissions, saved lives, and increased farmer incomes by USD 14 million. Global SAF hubs, like Singapore Changi Airport, demonstrate integrated supply chains and modular blending, offering lessons for India’s aviation sector.

“Any sustainable SAF business in India must consider all stakeholders,” Jimmy Olsson said. He added, “It is crucial that SAF production supports rural livelihoods, remains affordable, and does not compromise food security or nutritional needs. A well-designed SAF ecosystem can uplift farmers, provide economic opportunities, and still reduce aviation emissions significantly. By addressing price, sustainability, and social impact together, India can develop a robust SAF market that benefits airlines, passengers, and communities alike.”

India’s aviation sector is at a critical juncture, balancing rapid growth with environmental responsibility. With domestic SAF production potential exceeding projected demand, the country can reduce aviation emissions while exploring export opportunities. Gradual blending mandates, supply chain innovation, and strategic pricing can allow airlines to adopt sustainable fuel without affecting profitability. Olsson highlighted, “With proper planning, innovation across the SAF value chain, and a collaborative approach, India has the potential to become a global SAF hub, benefiting airlines, passengers, and rural communities alike.”",https://static.businessworld.in/1605260979_mxTK8R_aviation.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 03:56:26.815464

Zenith Energy hopes the Portland terminal will be filled with renewable energy, and the facility already has plenty of room to store sustainable aviation fuel.

JT Hendrix, terminal manager for Zenith Energy, said the fuel has two components.

“You have your conventional jet fuel, which is 50 percent of the blend, and the feedstock, which is the blending component. We blend those two together — that’s how you get your sustainable aviation fuel,” Hendrix said.

Portland International Airport received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel earlier this month. Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger said in a statement,

“We’re excited about this step toward bringing sustainable aviation fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities.”

Delta Airlines was the first commercial airline to use the fuel at PDX. But the cost to keep jets in the air isn’t cheap. Charlotte Lollar of Delta Airlines said the airline is working with different suppliers to manage expenses.

“Today it’s two to three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, so our ambition is to work through the supply chain to bring the cost down as much as possible,” Lollar said.

While flying with sustainable fuel is costly, Lollar said Delta is committed to lowering expenses while moving toward a greener way to take to the sky.

Not everyone is convinced sustainable aviation fuel is a solution. 350PDX, a Portland-based nonprofit focused on climate justice, shared a statement with KGW warning the fuel may be a form of greenwashing.

“The real problem here is that so-called renewable fuels and biofuels are a false climate solution,” the group said.

The statement added that Zenith’s operations already pose significant risks because the terminal stores highly combustible fuels on an earthquake liquefaction zone along the banks of the Willamette River. The organization also raised concerns about risks to local neighborhoods and public oversight.

“By adding ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ to their portfolio, they are supercharging that risk,” 350PDX said. “When you add the word ‘sustainable’ or ‘renewable’ it sounds better, but it’s greenwashing at best. First, this is still a fuel and it still releases CO2 into the atmosphere. Second, the land use changes needed to produce this fuel can lead to increased pollution and a decrease in nature-based carbon sequestration solutions. Third, ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ sounds like a complete solution, but to meet aviation needs it would require an 18,887% increase in production this decade, based on 2022 production levels.”

350PDX urged greater accountability from companies and wealthy individuals who contribute to emissions and called for a climate superfund to fund adaptation and resiliency efforts in Oregon.

“There are a multitude of options for innovation that do not require the sacrifice of North Portland communities or communities in feedstock production areas throughout the U.S. that are already dealing with the air, soil, and water impacts of monocrop agriculture,” the group said.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/3791fe97-baca-4b88-a149-25590ddd00b8/20250916T003735/3791fe97-baca-4b88-a149-25590ddd00b8_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 23:56:18.904983

Australia's Construction Waste: Transformation Through Circular Design

A recent report ""Australia's Waste[d] Opportunity 2025"" (AWO Report) has identified that Australia's construction industry stands as the nation's largest source of waste, which reportedly contributes to a staggering 29% of Australia's total waste.

The AWO Report describes ""waste"" as a valuable material which stakeholders have failed to value. It observes that the average building project discards 141kg of material per square metre, which amounts to AU$384 per square metre on wasted materials. The top three categories of wasted materials are ""Mixed Concrete, Masonry and Tile"", ""Soil, Sand and Rubble Fines"" and ""Timber"".

The AWO Report makes recommendations which are intended to drive accountability and circularity in construction. Importantly, it notes that design decisions play an important role in setting the circular direction and recommends practices such as setting clear objectives and targets for design, construction, operation and end of life stages to reduce waste through the building's life cycle.

It also recommends that construction and lease contracts can include on-site material management, the obligation to report against material benchmarks, and/or setting out de-fit or deconstruction responsibilities.

At a policy level, the AWO Report suggests embedding circular targets into national policies and ensuring national building regulations prioritise circular principles. It recommends that State governments can also introduce financial incentives and dedicated grants.

Unless changes are made, the AWO Report warns that Australia is expected to waste up to $64 million in construction materials over the next five years.

Australia's Low-Carbon Liquid Fuel Opportunity

Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and Deloitte recently released a report ""Refined Ambitions: Exploring Australia's Low Carbon Fuel Potential"" (Refined Ambitions Report). It identifies that Australia may have the potential to build a low-carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry which could have a AU$36 billion market opportunity by 2050.

LCLFs are renewable alternatives to traditional fossil-based liquid fuels. Common examples include sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and synthetic e-fuels.

The Refined Ambitions Report identifies that Australia is a major user of liquid fuels, which is central to the energy demands of 11 major sectors of the nation's economy. However, as the world decarbonises, Australia's dependence on imported liquid fuels will leave these sectors exposed to international volatility.

It is anticipated that Australia will still require 30 billion litres of liquid fuels, predominantly in the mining, aviation and long-haul freight sectors. The Refined Ambitions Report anticipates that among other benefits, an LCLF industry:

Will enhance the nation's fuel security by developing sovereign capability and resilience;

Is critical to ensuring the long-term competitiveness of these industries; and

Can deliver significant economic benefit to Australian farmers and fuel producers.

Consultation Paper: Climate-related Transition Planning Guidance

The Treasury is developing guidance for climate-related transition planning and is inviting feedback on the direction and design of the guidance. The consultation period started on 15 August and will end on 24 September 2025.

The objective of the guidance is to support organisations to address climate risks and opportunities, and to enhance overall financial market resilience. In practice, this means supporting organisations to plan for climate risks and seize opportunities, while meeting expectations of transition plans from investors, lenders and other stakeholders. Accessible, clear, and robust transition plans can help investors and lenders understand the long-term business strategy of organisations, price risk and make capital allocation decisions.

The Consultation Paper is divided in two parts:

Part A - Outlines the role of transition planning and proposed design approach; and

Part B - Provides illustrative draft guidance aligned with the proposed approach.

Appendix A to the Consultation Paper includes a list of relevant materials consulted by the Treasury, including the Transition Planning Guide of the Australian Institute of Company Directors published in July 2025.

The main objectives of the guidance are to:

Support international alignment to make it easier to compare transition plans;

Outline domestic policy and regulatory considerations;

Balance encouraging high ambition with providing flexibility; and

Take a ""climate first but not only"" approach.

The Australian Government committed to publishing the guidance by the end of 2025. This is one of the priorities under the Sustainable Finance Roadmap.

Productivity Roundtable: Reforming Federal Environmental Laws

The federal government convened the Productivity Roundtable from 19 to 21 August 2025 in Canberra. The event built on propositions to improve Australia's productivity, economic resilience and strengthen budget sustainability, as proposed by stakeholders during the public consultation period held in June and July of this year.

Among the key topics discussed was the need to reform and expedite approvals required under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC). The proposed reforms aim to streamline the approvals process by removing duplication between state and federal processes and will introduce strong national environmental standards that will set minimum expectations for a project. The discussions also highlighted the need for an independent regulator to be held to account for the speed and quality of its decisions.

The revised EPBC is expected to be proposed by the end of the year, which is six months ahead of schedule.

On or around 29 July 2025, a coalition of 26 Republican state finance officials sent letters to various major investment firms to warn them against using ""long-term risk mitigation"" strategies that involve ""speculative assumptions about the future"" such as climate change.

The letters emphasise the importance of investment firms' traditional fiduciary duty, which is said to act as a safeguard to facilitate ""efficient capital allocation"" based on financial, not political considerations. The letter requests investment firms to take the following steps to confirm their commitment to their traditional fiduciary duty:

Stop framing ""deterministic future outcomes as long-term risks"" to justify ""immediate ideological interventions"" through utilising corporate engagement or proxy voting, with climate change being an example of this issue;

Commit not to use ""passive investment vehicles for activist proxy voting or corporate engagement"";

Commit not to embed international political agendas into ""default investment strategies and corporate engagement"", citing net-zero climate mandates and EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive as examples;

Have ""clear and transparent proxy voting guidelines and stewardship practices"" that focus on shareholder value, not environmental or social goals; and

Provide full disclosure about all of its affiliations and collaborative initiatives that may influence its investment strategy or priorities, citing Climate Action 100+ as an example.

The letters invite investment firms to respond and provide detailed evidence that the firms' practices align with traditional fiduciary standards.

ICJ Advisory Opinion on States' Climate Change Obligations

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has released its Advisory Opinion on the ""Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change"". The ICJ that the consequences of climate change are ""severe and far-reaching"" and pose an ""urgent and existential threat"".

In summary, the ICJ reinforces that states have an obligation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under international law. The failure to do so may constitute ""an internationally wrongful act"" which is attributable to that state.

This follows the UN General Assembly's 2023 request for an advisory opinion outlining state obligations related to environmental protection, including any legal consequences for states causing significant climate harm.

The ICJ opines that all state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are obliged to implement measures to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. There is a further obligation imposed on developed countries to lead the charge in combating climate change by limiting their GHG emissions and enhancing their GHG sinks and reservoirs.

This ICJ opinion is not legally binding, however the obligations that it identifies are under international law. The ICJ notes that states are obliged to regulate the activities of private actors which impact climate change, sustainability and human rights.

This milestone accelerates Intimiti’s mission to reduce textile waste while driving innovation at the intersection of circular textiles and clean energy, transforming end-of-life clothing into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Australia’s textile footprint highlights the urgency of intervention: 373,000 tonnes of new clothes are imported annually, while 200,000 tonnes of clothing still end up in landfill every year. Despite well-meaning donations, 210,000 tonnes of garments sent to charities or bins often cannot be resold or recycled, leaving the nation with a recycling rate of just 2 percent.

Through Innovate P2X funding and in collaboration with Macquarie University, Intimiti will help reshape the textile value chain by proving that end of life clothing can be reengineered into high value energy solutions. By bridging material innovation with clean energy, the company seeks to demonstrate a scalable model for true circularity where fashion waste is transformed into fuel for a decarbonised future. This breakthrough not only diverts valuable fibres from landfill and reduces microplastic pollution, but also delivers renewable fuel to the aviation sector, one of the hardest industries to decarbonise.

“This initiative is more than innovation, it’s reimagining waste as opportunity,” says Jason, Project Lead at Intimiti Australia. “By valorising waste streams, we’re creating high-impact circularity in textiles and energy industries.”

With Innovate P2X support, Intimiti aims to show that fashion waste can find a second life as clean energy, helping both people and the planet move toward a sustainable future.

The plan was developed by the Interim Aviation Council, which included NZ Airports and Auckland International Airport among its members. It sets a shared direction for a safe, sustainable and innovative aviation system that enables growth and strengthens New Zealand as an aviation nation.

Billie Moore, Chief Executive of NZ Airports, said the plan is an important opportunity to align industry and government efforts.

“This is the first time that government and industry have come together to set out a long-term strategy for aviation.

“New Zealand relies on aviation to connect our people and businesses, to support tourism and trade, and to deliver essential regional services. Despite this, the sector has often been a footnote in transport policy due to the heavy focus on land transport in the Crown budget.

“The Government deserves huge credit for elevating the role of aviation in its economic growth strategy.”

The Aviation Action Plan addresses several areas of particular importance to the airport community:

A two-year civil aviation rule-making programme to make the regulatory environment more agile and responsive, while maintaining high safety and security standards.

A new indicator framework to track the health of the aviation system, providing data on costs, efficiency, and performance to guide better decision-making.

As confirmed in a previous announcement from Ministers Jones and Meager, support for vulnerable regional routes through the Regional Infrastructure Fund, including concessionary finance for aircraft and IT investment to enable interlining between regional carriers and larger airlines.

A greater focus on future infrastructure requirements, including integrated airspace planning to support busier and more diverse air operators.

Collaboration with Australia on a regional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) strategy to support the transition to cleaner energy.

The Action Plan was a major recommendation from the 2023 Air Navigation Systems (ANS) review, which highlighted the public good role of aviation in New Zealand, and the need for future investment.

“We would like to acknowledge the Ministers who progressed the ANS review, and Minister Meager who has delivered this plan. We hope this work will have bipartisan support so that aviation remains a national priority.”

NZ Airports will continue to work with Government and industry partners to deliver the plan’s initial commitments.",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:56:51.402000

Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are members of Project SkyPower, an international CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF.
The collaboration addresses the urgent need for scalable, high-integrity SAF solutions and supports broader policy goals, including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).
The pricing assumptions are within the lower end of current industry benchmarks, and the offtake agreement is expected to reach finalization by September 2026.","Haffner Energy, a leading solid biomass-to-clean fuels solutions provider, and Luxaviation Group, a leading global operator in the business aviation sector, are strengthening their partnership with a non-exclusive 15-yr offtake agreement in Europe with fixed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) volume and price terms.

Luxaviation and Haffner Energy first joined forces to accelerate SAF production and promotion when Luxaviation signaled interest in SAF-dedicated entity SAF Zero in June this year.

Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group, said: “This agreement marks a decisive move from vision to reality. For Luxaviation, securing long-term SAF supply is not only an investment in our operations – it is a commitment to our clients and to the industry’s future. Together with Haffner Energy, we are setting the benchmark for how business aviation can accelerate the scale-up of sustainable fuel production across Europe, establishing a new standard for our industry.”

Luxaviation operates one of the largest fleets of private aircraft worldwide. It is actively committed to the decarbonization of aviation through a three-pronged strategy: improving fuel efficiency; reducing emissions by actively increasing SAF use and electrification of ground operations; and buying offsets for remaining GHG emissions. Since 2021, Luxaviation’s annual sustainability report tracks progress against targets. In 2023, Luxaviation launched “Go-to-Zero” Investment Fund to foster SAF production.

“We are very pleased with this offtake partnership with Luxaviation as it will significantly facilitate the financing of our SAF projects in Europe. Securing long-term offtake agreements is one of the most crucial conditions for financing SAF production facilities, as they guarantee the purchase of SAF at a stable price over periods exceeding five years,” said Haffner Energy co-founder and CEO Philippe Haffner.

France-based Haffner Energy relies on its 32-yr experience to design, manufacture, supply, license and operate proprietary disruptive clean fuels solutions, including critical technology for SAF production, using all types of biomass residues wet or dry, such as agricultural and municipal waste. The company has already announced the development of a couple of SAF projects, notably in France and in Iceland. In both cases, full scale production is expected to be reached by 2030 when the next stage of the European SAF mandate kicks in, requiring airlines to blend SAF in their jet fuel at a 6% ratio or higher.

Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are members of Project SkyPower, an international CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF.

The collaboration addresses the urgent need for scalable, high-integrity SAF solutions and supports broader policy goals, including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). The pricing assumptions are within the lower end of current industry benchmarks, and the offtake agreement is expected to reach finalization by September 2026.

The move marks another major retreat from renewable energy projects by one of the world's biggest oil companies.

Despite Shell's pullback and accusations of the company participating in greenwashing, demand for alternatives to fossil fuel-based jet fuel continues to rise.
Airlines including United and Lufthansa have signed major agreements to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, while the European Union has adopted mandates requiring a growing share of aviation fuel to come from renewable sources in the coming years.","Shell has officially abandoned one of Europe's most ambitious efforts to turn waste into low-carbon jet fuel, raising fresh concerns about the oil giant's commitment to renewable energy, per The Guardian.

What's happening?

Shell has scrapped plans to complete a massive biofuels facility in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, that was once set to become one of Europe's largest converters of waste into green jet fuel.

The company began construction in 2021 with hopes of producing 820,000 tonnes (904,000 tons) of biofuels annually, around half of which would have gone toward sustainable aviation fuel, per The Guardian.

After pausing construction last year over technical challenges, Shell has now confirmed the project is dead, citing that it would be ""insufficiently competitive"" to deliver affordable low-carbon products.

Why is this important?

The move marks another major retreat from renewable energy projects by one of the world's biggest oil companies.

Aviation currently accounts for about 3% of global carbon pollution, according to the International Energy Agency, and experts widely agree that cutting those emissions is critical if the world hopes to slow down rising temperatures.

Sustainable aviation fuel, made from waste cooking oil and animal fat, is considered one of the most viable near-term solutions, yet supply remains limited and costs stay high.

Scrapping the project is another example of fossil fuel giants prioritizing short-term profits over long-term responsibility.

What's being done about it?

Despite Shell's pullback and accusations of the company participating in greenwashing, demand for alternatives to fossil fuel-based jet fuel continues to rise.

Airlines including United and Lufthansa have signed major agreements to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, while the European Union has adopted mandates requiring a growing share of aviation fuel to come from renewable sources in the coming years.

The landmark event brought together global leaders, policymakers, innovators, and industry stakeholders to shape a cleaner, more resilient future for the aviation sector through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Organized by the SAF Association, the conclave carried the theme “Powering the Future of Sustainable Aviation” with a special focus on building a “Farm to Aviation Fuel Economy.” The event spotlighted India’s vast potential to become a global hub for SAF innovation, feedstock production, and deployment. Rohit Kumar, Secretary General of SAF Association, emphasized the need for a unified approach, stating, “SAF Association is a collective platform for catalysing and shaping India's SAF roadmap by aligning efforts with global initiatives. Through collaboration, technology, and policy, we can make India a SAF powerhouse.” He added, “Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents a significant opportunity for the 'Make in India' initiative due to its potential to boost domestic manufacturing, reduce reliance on imports, and promote green energy innovation. SAF is important for India for several strategic, environmental, and economic reasons.” Jimmy Olsson, President of the SAF Association, highlighted the socio-economic potential of SAF in India. “SAF is a natural fit for Make in India – it combines green energy goals with economic development, technological innovation, and job creation in rural parts of India. By investing in SAF, India can lead the global shift toward sustainable aviation while strengthening its domestic industry,” he said. Shashank Chaudhary, Additional CEO of Invest UP, underlined the role of states in SAF development. “Uttar Pradesh government is projecting itself as the national hub for SAF production. We are promoting doubling the farmers’ income with our initiatives,” he stated. Dr. Anita Gupta from the Department of Science and Technology stressed the importance of talent and innovation in building the SAF ecosystem. “There is greater need to empower the sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem. There are unique opportunities that India possesses as we have a huge talent pool,” she noted. With over 750 million metric tonnes of biomass and 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue annually, India stands uniquely positioned to meet its domestic SAF needs and emerge as a global exporter. As the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market, India’s clean fuel push aligns well with its feedstock availability, cost-effective production, and supportive policy environment.",https://www.whispersinthecorridors.com/uploads/news/2025/Sepetmber/15/Untitled-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 23:56:42.258751

Renewable diesel is made by hydroprocessing or hydrotreating fats, oils, or waste lipids in a way that produces molecules much closer to petroleum diesel.
With California’s demand for fossil diesel shrinking while renewable diesel fills the market, refiners are left with a surplus of petroleum diesel they cannot sell in state.
Renewable diesel supply depends on feedstock that may be limited, or become more expensive, especially waste oils or fats.
Diesel has lagged gasoline in its decline because there was a ready substitute in renewable diesel, but once electric freight and delivery vehicles hit the road at scale, fossil and renewable diesel alike will fall.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

In a recent article, California Refineries Close as Gasoline Demand Slips into Permanent Decline, I wrote that diesel consumption in California had not declined even as gasoline demand slipped. Jeremy Martin from the Union of Concerned Scientists reached out to me to point to some data I’d missed. I reviewed it and saw that renewable diesel plus biodiesel now supply more than 70% of diesel consumed in California. Fossil diesel consumption has declined faster than I thought. That changes how we should think about the state of refining, the role of refineries, and what their future might be.

Renewable diesel and biodiesel are often lumped together, but they differ in how they are made, how they perform, and how much emissions they avoid. Biodiesel, also called FAME biodiesel, is made by chemically reacting fats or oils with an alcohol, usually methanol, in a process called transesterification. It has oxygen in the molecule and typically needs to be blended with petroleum diesel in many engines.

Renewable diesel is made by hydroprocessing or hydrotreating fats, oils, or waste lipids in a way that produces molecules much closer to petroleum diesel. It is a drop-in fuel, meaning engines and infrastructure built for regular diesel can use it without modification. According to CARB’s lifecycle studies, renewable diesel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 65% compared with petroleum diesel depending on feedstock such as waste oils or tallow, while biodiesel’s emissions reductions vary more depending on feedstock and blending ratio.

Refineries cannot easily change the basic yields they get from crude oil, and heavy crudes in particular deliver a relatively fixed gasoline-to-diesel ratio. With California’s demand for fossil diesel shrinking while renewable diesel fills the market, refiners are left with a surplus of petroleum diesel they cannot sell in state. The response has been to export that diesel into other markets, often in Latin America or Asia, where demand for middle distillates is stronger. This keeps refineries operating but reduces margins, since exports are usually at lower prices than domestic sales and add shipping costs. The structural imbalance between what California needs and what refineries are designed to produce is one of the forces eroding their long term viability.

Among the two refineries discussed, the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles is definitely closing. It has been confirmed that the 139,000 barrels-per-day LA area facility will begin winding down operations in early September 2025, and permanent closure is expected by October 2025. The Valero refinery in Benicia is a bigger concern for policymakers because it accounts for a large share of Northern California’s refining capacity. Valero has announced its intent to close or restructure the Benicia refinery by April 2026, citing high regulatory costs and declining demand. But there are active discussions in Sacramento about state funding or regulatory relief to keep it operating.

Keeping Valero open is more politically and practically important because the Los Angeles region has more refining capacity overall than the Bay Area, so loss of Benicia would produce greater supply disruptions, especially in Northern California. Analysts estimate that the combined closures of Phillips 66 LA and Valero Benicia could remove roughly 17% of the state’s gasoline refining capacity.

The fuel policy framework known as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard is central to all of this. Under LCFS, fuel producers are required to reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of fuels sold in California. Renewable diesel and biodiesel earn credits when their CI is below the benchmark. These credits can be traded. The more demand there is for low CI fuels the greater the price on fossil fuels or fuel pathways that do not meet CI targets. California’s LCFS pathways show that renewable diesel from used cooking oil, tallow, or waste lipids often performs better, with lower CI, than feedstocks like soybean oil. Biodiesel’s CI depends strongly on feedstock, energy used in processing, land use, and transportation.

There are risk points in this transition. Renewable diesel supply depends on feedstock that may be limited, or become more expensive, especially waste oils or fats. Scaling up renewables risks feedstock scarcity or competition with other uses such as food or international markets. Biodiesel may face limits on blend levels or performance in cold weather. Regulatory and permitting burdens remain high. Also refinery closure or conversion faces large capital costs, labor impacts, and local community consequences.

The economic implications are clear. Refineries built for gasoline and fossil diesel have product slates optimized for those markets. As diesel is displaced, their ability to adjust output matters. Refiners may shift to processing more renewable diesel themselves, or importing it, or converting existing refining units. For Phillips 66, shutting LA means lost jobs, lost local refining throughput, and increased imports. For Valero Benicia, the stakes are higher for Northern California given its role in supply and because keeping it open is under active negotiation.

The remarkable rise of renewable diesel in California is best understood as a bridge rather than a permanent solution. The credits and incentives under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard created a strong market for drop-in replacements that could be used immediately in heavy duty engines, but that displacement is temporary. Over the next decade, battery-electric trucks will begin to scale in exactly the same way that passenger cars already have. The economics of charging infrastructure, battery pack size, and total cost of ownership are improving year by year, and when fleets begin adopting electric trucks in volume, the effect on diesel demand will be unmistakable. Diesel has lagged gasoline in its decline because there was a ready substitute in renewable diesel, but once electric freight and delivery vehicles hit the road at scale, fossil and renewable diesel alike will fall. The best estimate is that this will trail gasoline’s decline by about ten years, giving California a temporary period of high renewable diesel penetration before a longer term contraction in overall diesel consumption.

Another factor shaping refinery futures is that the same waste oils, fats, and plant-derived lipids that now flow into renewable diesel will be diverted to other sectors under policy pressure. Aviation is pushing hard on bio-sustainable aviation fuel because there are no near-term alternatives for long-haul flights. Maritime shipping is also beginning to blend bio-fuels to meet international decarbonization targets. As more of California’s low-carbon feedstock supply is redirected toward these uses refiners will be forced to reconfigure units once again. That shift would add another layer of adjustment for the state’s remaining refineries, which would have to balance smaller gasoline markets, declining fossil diesel, and growing external competition for renewable feedstocks.

Going forward, diesel displacement looks likely to increase under current policy pressure. Electric trucks will play a role. Renewable diesel capacity may increase. But fossil diesel is likely to shrink more rapidly than most forecasts assume. Getting the technical details right matters. I got the diesel wrong before. It matters for policy, for markets, for refining jobs, for fuel security.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-15-2025-09_53_48-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-09-15 14:56:16.231713

I would say that it is at stage zero. And we would like your (industry's) feedback. We would also reach out to our line ministries to seek their views on the draft.”

Biomass at the heart of decarbonisation push

Speaking at the same conclave, Dr Sangita M Kasture, Scientist G at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), stressed that biomass will be central to India’s efforts to decarbonise aviation.

“We need to understand how much biomass is available and how much of it is being utilised. The government is already conducting a study to ascertain these things and find out how much can be made available for production of SAF,” she said during the inaugural session.

The assessment is expected to provide a clearer picture of the feedstock base that India can mobilise to support SAF production at scale, particularly from agricultural residues and waste streams.

India’s SAF journey so far

India has already taken initial steps to integrate SAF into aviation. In 2018, SpiceJet operated the country’s first biofuel-powered test flight. More recently, in 2023, AirAsia India and Indian Oil collaborated on India’s first commercial flight using an indigenous SAF blend on the Delhi–Pune route.

At the international level, India has reaffirmed its commitment to align with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050. Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu recently underscored India’s readiness to support these targets, emphasising that domestic initiatives on SAF will form a key part of the strategy.

Industry prepares for scale

Alongside policy discussions, India’s fuel and bioenergy industry has begun investing in capacity and technology to prepare for large-scale SAF adoption. Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery has secured ISCC-CORSIA certification and is targeting 35,000 tonnes of SAF production by 2025. Praj Industries, in collaboration with LanzaJet, has commissioned a 1 kilolitre per day Alcohol-to-Jet demonstration plant in Pune, and has already powered a commercial flight with its output. Meanwhile, TruAlt Bioenergy is planning a 15–20 kilolitre per day commercial facility in Karnataka.

The report, titled “SAF Samarthya – The opportunity of AtJ SAF in India”, marks one of the first industry-backed assertions that India’s role in the global aviation fuel transition may extend beyond consumption to export leadership.

The paper notes that while the government has already set SAF blending targets of 1 percent by 2027 and 5 percent by 2030 for international flights, the abundant feedstock base and developed ethanol ecosystem could enable production volumes well in excess of domestic needs. “After meeting domestic demand, India could position itself as a regional exporter to markets with binding SAF requirements,” the report says.

Surplus feedstock and ethanol ecosystem

India produces over 500 crore litres of ethanol annually and generates more than 400 million tonnes of surplus biomass every year, including agricultural residues, forestry waste, and municipal solid waste. This resource pool, coupled with the country’s low-cost renewable power, gives India a competitive edge in scaling Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) fuel production.

The knowledge paper draws a parallel with the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), which helped India move from 1.5 percent petrol blending in 2014 to 20 percent in 2025, five years ahead of schedule. The same logistics networks, pricing mechanisms and procurement systems used by oil marketing companies for ethanol can be repurposed to support SAF production and distribution.

First wave of commercial projects

Several companies are already investing in capacity and technology to prepare for this transition. Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery recently became the first domestic player to secure ISCC-CORSIA certification, targeting 35,000 tonnes of SAF by 2025. Praj Industries, in collaboration with LanzaJet, has commissioned a 1 kilolitre per day AtJ demonstration facility in Pune, while TruAlt Bioenergy is planning a 15–20 KTPD commercial plant in Belagavi, Karnataka.

Industry experts see these developments as the foundation for scaling up production not just for India’s aviation sector but also for export markets in the EU, UK and US, where binding SAF mandates are tightening and demand is expected to outstrip local supply.

A strategic pivot

With its fast-growing aviation sector — expected to field 1,600 aircraft by 2030 and 2,200 by 2035 — India is already one of the largest potential SAF markets.

AfA members are helping customers adapt to shifting trade flows and rising costs by keeping freight moving and offering practical solutions in uncertain markets, Fried told members of the Los Angeles Air Cargo Association.

Fried pointed to pressures that continue to test supply chains, including cyber risks exposed by the CrowdStrike outage, an increase in extreme weather events, and geopolitical instability from Ukraine, the Red Sea, and the Taiwan Strait.

He added that aging airport warehouses, truck congestion, and outdated facilities still hold the industry back, underscoring the importance of federal investment in cargo infrastructure.

“Forwarders are the stabilizing force when disruption hits,” said Fried.

“We were tested by shocks in 2024, and we adapted. We are ready to protect shippers and keep goods moving through whatever comes next.”

AfA members are also finding opportunity, he said. Reshoring and nearshoring are shifting flows from China toward Southeast Asia and Mexico, while defense logistics and pharmaceuticals continue to deliver steady volumes, while semiconductors are establishing high-value growth corridors.

“Los Angeles is at the center of global trade, and our community depends on forwarders to keep supply chains resilient,” said David Gibson, President, Los Angeles Air Cargo Association.

“As tariffs shift and regulations tighten, AfA members are proving that they are not just adapting, they are leading. Their ability to find solutions in the face of uncertainty is what keeps cargo moving through LAX and beyond.”

Fried said forwarders are applying technology beyond the hype, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) already being used in pricing, Customs automation, and fraud detection, while automation and paperless processes are driving efficiency.

He added that sustainability remains a critical test, with demand for greener supply chains rising faster than the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“Policy shifts and regulation will continue, but forwarders are the partners who bring resilience, compliance, and solutions,” Fried concluded.

“Our members are essential to maintaining confidence in global trade.”

Sustainability will be a key topic at AfA’s AirCargo Conference in Orlando next February, for which registration is now open at airforwarders.org.

India generates approximately 2.4 million tonnes of used cooking oil annually, but the report points out that nearly 60% of it is improperly recycled back into the food system, despite clear disposal regulations. Most UCO comes from commercial kitchens (65%), while the rest is scattered across households. The report recommends creating structured collection systems with strict quality control and traceability to consolidate this fragmented resource into viable volumes necessary for expanding Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)—the most mature SAF production pathway.

Crop Residue: From Environmental Hazard to Clean Fuel Source

Each year, millions of tonnes of crop residue, primarily paddy straw, are burned across northern India, causing severe pollution and health issues. In 2021 alone, around 13 million tonnes were burnt in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. The report suggests that organized biomass marketplaces and aggregation mechanisms could turn this waste into a reliable feedstock for SAF production, while also mitigating air pollution.

Pilot projects in Haryana have already shown success, with a 54% reduction in stubble burning across 666 villages when residue collection was linked to industry demand.

Sweet Sorghum: An Efficient Crop for Sustainable Fuel

The report also highlights sweet sorghum as a promising alternative ethanol crop to support Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) SAF production. Though it yields slightly less ethanol compared to sugarcane, its water efficiency—using five times less water—and shorter growing cycle of four months make it highly suitable for semi-arid regions, offering a more sustainable and climate-resilient feedstock option.

Unlocking Export Potential Through Supply Chain Reforms

Currently, India’s fragmented and seasonal feedstock supply chains discourage large-scale SAF investments. The report argues that formalizing collection systems—such as UCO recovery and stubble-to-fuel initiatives—combined with encouraging cultivation of water-efficient crops like sweet sorghum, will provide a steady, low-carbon feedstock supply.

With India already exporting nearly half of its Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), the report forecasts that increased SAF production could make the country a competitive exporter to global aviation hubs such as Dubai and Amsterdam, where SAF mandates are becoming increasingly stringent.

“India has a vast raw material base to become a global SAF leader,” the report concludes. “The key is to formalize and integrate supply chains connecting farmers, households, and waste generators with fuel producers.”

With infrastructure bottlenecks still a challenge, proximity to fuel infrastructure and demand centres positions early developers to scale more efficiently as the market matures.","The energy transition is facing significant headwinds, especially for those industries operating at the leading edge, like the power to X value chains. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been one of the shining lights of the energy transition, with investment and regulation remaining strong in the geopolitical turmoil. SAFs have more regulatory certainty than any other energy transition technologies. The UK has emerged as a SAF leader, with a strong SAF mandate in effect since January 2025, and a revenue certainty mechanism which is expected to be in place by the end of 2026. The EU also put into force its SAF mandate (ReFuelEU Aviation), and we would expect a revenue certainty mechanism to follow. Positive signals are also coming from other countries, including Japan, with a 10% blending target proposed by 2030,[1] and India with a proposed blending target of 1% for international flights from 2027.[2]

Recently, SLR sponsored the Global SAF Summit, chairing a panel with cross-representation from feedstock suppliers, SAF developers, and airlines representing the Middle East, Europe, and North America, covering flag carriers, the low-cost model, and cargo.

What was very clear from the discussions is that even with the regulatory certainty, the industry is facing significant bottlenecks and is wrestling with how to get the risk-reward balance right across the end-to-end value chain.

Here we discuss the overarching three lessons we learned about how risk-reward can be rebalanced, bottlenecks can be broken, and SAF developers today can turn their first mover risk into a first mover advantage.

The risk-reward balance

We know from across the energy transition that the markets which can accept the most expensive solutions are those with the most price elasticity. Aviation is one of these sectors.

Air travel is a luxury. Only ~11% of the world’s population take a flight annually with less than 4% taking international flights and even fewer flying more than once a year.[3] Air cargo transports circa 33% of the value of world trade, while only transporting less than 1% of its volume.[4] It is primarily used for transporting high-value, perishable or time sensitive goods. Therefore, the cost of decarbonisation passed down to end-consumers is very palatable politically. This is why SAFs have seen more regulatory stability than anywhere else in the energy transition, and why aviation will remain a key target industry to decarbonise.

The challenge, however, is that airlines, where this price elasticity sits, are notorious for going out of business. In 2023, 17 airlines filed for bankruptcy,[5] and just last month Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy just months after emerging out of Chapter 11 after declaring bankruptcy in 2024. [6],[7]

Airlines are highly capital-intensive businesses that are laser-focused on maximising operational efficiencies, given their very tight margins (IATA’s Airline Profitability Outlook for 2025 assumed an average net profit margin of 3.7%).[8] The largest variable cost by far is fuel. Therefore, airlines themselves are as much about optimising fuel costs as about optimising capital assets: Airlines tend to change their fuel contracting every year at each airport, if possible, and have whole teams dedicated to buying and hedging fuels. Their whole system is built around not taking risk.

As a result, the current market for aviation fuels has been optimised so that airlines can always buy the fuel at the cheapest commodity price possible. The pricing is based on large fuel volumes sold at the Platts market price plus a very small differential.

The SAF industry is currently asking the market to operate drastically differently, with long-term offtake agreements of 10 - 15 years, often on a take-or-pay or cost-plus model. This is driven by their investors’ need for long-term certainty, essentially leading to airlines being asked to underpin the bankability of SAF developers’ debt.

This current risk-reward balance is clearly misaligned, especially given the two to five times cost differential between SAF and conventional fuels. This is why SAF is still struggling to take off. Finding ways to unlock project debt financing and reducing the cost of capital is key to addressing the imbalance and accelerating SAF deployment. This means lenders’ perception of ‘first of a kind’ (FOAK) SAF project risks will have to change.

One of the biggest perceived project risks is revenue uncertainty. The upcoming UK revenue certainty mechanism and similar future measures in the EU can address this, but they must be designed to support decarbonisation without crippling the aviation industry or SAF developers. Compliance has to be cheaper than paying penalties for inaction.

The FOAK nature of many SAF plants and perceived and real associated risks is a further challenge to lenders, blocking debt financing and driving up cost of capital. More work is needed to manage risk and the lender’s understanding and perception of them.

One way to tackle the real development risks typically associated with any FOAK project, is to share them more equitably across stakeholders. This could take the form of direct investments from a broader group of stakeholders, or joint cross-industry ventures, particularly involving those organisations whose business success is closely tied to the aviation industry and who face the greatest exposure if the sector fails to decarbonise.

Bottlenecks in the route to market

Driven by the clear demand signal set by the mandates, the number of new producers is growing rapidly. In the UK alone, 26 unique SAF projects have been awarded funding under the Advanced Fuels Fund Scheme since 2022.[9] The project developers are predominantly start-ups who are new to this space, but oil and gas majors and conglomerates are also represented (e.g. Equinor and Essar). Projects cover a rage of pathways, including gasification, power-to-liquids (PtL), pyrolysis, ethanol-to-jet, and methanol-to-jet. In the EU, SAF is currently dominated by HEFA SAF (produced from oils and fats, such as used cooking oils, animal fats or vegetable oils), but policy and industry plans are explicitly pushing for more diverse pathways (e.g. e-fuels sub-mandate), and therefore this picture is changing fast.

While the technologies, conversion pathways, and developers are highly diverse, the infrastructure they are relying on to get their fuel to market is constricted and often operated by only a handful of large players. Blending points, fuel terminals, pipelines, and the airport fuel infrastructure, are managed and locked down by the existing fuel industry (e.g. single suppliers or small consortia). All routes to market for new SAF currently have to pass through this bottleneck. This creates high entry barriers for SAF producers through restricted access, complex permitting, or inflated fees.

This is why the mandates have been designed to target the companies that own the bottleneck. But there also has to be further disruption to release the stranglehold and break the bottleneck. Joint ventures could allow for new entrants to develop onsite and shared fuel infrastructures to ease restrictions and capture a growing market. This will require both additional investment and a different approach to how fuel farms and other airport infrastructures are operated. Book and claim will also play an important role as it can help bypass the physical infrastructure bottlenecks by allowing SAF to be credited to end users without requiring direct delivery.

First mover advantage

As we have seen, first movers in SAF face a unique set of challenges. They must navigate infrastructure bottlenecks, operate within evolving policy frameworks, and often sit at the higher end of the cost curve. With few operational plants to serve as benchmarks, perceived technology risk remains high. This makes financing more difficult, increasing the cost of capital and likely driving up insurance premiums.

However, there are also significant first mover opportunities that go beyond building brand recognition, getting an early share of the market, and developing know-how and intellectual property. First movers can also turn their challenges into opportunities by controlling key steps in the value chain: strategic locations, feedstocks, and distribution infrastructure.

First movers in SAF have a unique opportunity to secure limited strategic locations with access to low-cost feedstocks, existing jet fuel and export infrastructure, and nearby offtakers. Since feedstock and logistics costs heavily influence the levelised cost of SAF (especially for e-SAF which depends on scarce biogenic CO₂ and affordable renewable electricity) early access to these resources is a major advantage. With infrastructure bottlenecks still a challenge, proximity to fuel infrastructure and demand centres positions early developers to scale more efficiently as the market matures.

Securing and managing the flow of feedstocks is a key opportunity on its own. Building strong relationships with feedstock suppliers through innovative contract development, joint ventures, or direct investment could secure first movers’ market position. This is where oil and gas majors can have an edge over new entrants, as they have decades of experience in managing the flow of molecules. To take advantage of this opportunity, new entrants must learn how to operate as a fuels business, not only as technology developers or plant operators. Developing the right partnerships to unlock and build the relevant know-how will be key.

As discussed in the previous section, fuels infrastructure represents a significant bottleneck restricting access to offtakers for new entrants. First movers can turn this situation into an advantage, forming joint ventures to co-develop onsite or shared infrastructure that break existing bottlenecks and provides some control of the supply chain.

The knowledge paper draws a parallel with the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), which helped India move from 1.5 percent petrol blending in 2014 to 20 percent in 2025, five years ahead of schedule. The same logistics networks, pricing mechanisms and procurement systems used by oil marketing companies for ethanol can be repurposed to support SAF production and distribution.

First wave of commercial projects

Several companies are already investing in capacity and technology to prepare for this transition. Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery recently became the first domestic player to secure ISCC-CORSIA certification, targeting 35,000 tonnes of SAF by 2025. Praj Industries, in collaboration with LanzaJet, has commissioned a 1 kilolitre per day AtJ demonstration facility in Pune, while TruAlt Bioenergy is planning a 15–20 KTPD commercial plant in Belagavi, Karnataka.

Industry experts see these developments as the foundation for scaling up production not just for India’s aviation sector but also for export markets in the EU, UK and US, where binding SAF mandates are tightening and demand is expected to outstrip local supply.

Policy support and financing

The report also recommends a suite of policy instruments to make exports viable, including Viability Gap Funding of Rs 150 crore per project, production-linked incentives, CAPEX subsidies, concessional finance, and a dedicated SAF fund. It argues that replicating the financial de-risking that enabled India’s ethanol success is critical to building a globally competitive SAF industry.

A strategic pivot

With its fast-growing aviation sector — expected to field 1,600 aircraft by 2030 and 2,200 by 2035 — India is already one of the largest potential SAF markets. But by leveraging surplus feedstock and ethanol infrastructure, the country could move beyond self-sufficiency to emerge as a regional hub for SAF exports, the report concludes.",https://media.assettype.com/energywatch%2F2025-09-15%2Fzkprvr3b%2Fsustainable-aviation-fuel-energy-watch.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 16:56:27.710166

The event aimed to open up new opportunities to position Phu Quoc, Vietnam's largest island, as a new aviation and tourism hub in the region.

The U.S.-Vietnam Aviation Partnership Roundtable was attended by U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Marc Knapper, together with representatives from 15 leading American corporations in aviation, technology, and financial services, including global names such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Systems, Collins Aerospace, GE Aerospace, Honeywell, United Airlines, Rapiscan Systems, Gulfstream, BNP Associates, Corgan, Gensler, Hill International, KBR, Oshkosh AeroTech, and Otis Elevator.

Their presence at the roundtable not only demonstrated the vast potential for cooperation, but also reaffirmed the international community’s confidence in the growth of Vietnam’s aviation and tourism industries.

The roundtable was regarded as one of the largest international aviation cooperation events held in Vietnam this year. It was positioned as an investment promotion platform, where businesses from both countries - particularly in the fields of aviation and hospitality - had the opportunity to meet, exchange insights, and explore new avenues for cooperation.

Within the framework of the roundtable, Sun Group introduced Sun PhuQuoc Airways – Vietnam’s first airline pursuing the “resort airline” model, fully invested and developed by the group.

True to its mission reflected in the name, Sun PhuQuoc Airways is building a hub-and-spoke network with Phu Quoc at the center, directly connecting major cities domestically and internationally.

This approach aims to provide every traveler with easier access to Phu Quoc – hailed as the world’s second most beautiful island after the Maldives.

More than an airline, Sun PhuQuoc Airways is positioned as a strategic cornerstone in Sun Group’s diversified ecosystem of experiences on the Pearl Island, encompassing luxury resorts, entertainment complexes, wellness services, shopping, gastronomy, and world-class shows.

Together, they form a seamless journey, where each flight does not simply transport passengers to a destination but ushers them into a complete holiday experience - from the sky to the ground.

In parallel with commercial aviation, Sun Group is implementing plans to upgrade Phu Quoc International Airport to ICAO Code 4E standards, expanding its scale to 1,050 hectares with more than 100 aircraft stands.

This synchronized investment - from ground infrastructure to an advanced airline fleet - demonstrates Sun Group’s long-term and methodical vision, working alongside local authorities to transform Phu Quoc into a new aviation and tourism hub for the region.

At the roundtable, U.S. corporations brought forward a range of cutting-edge solutions. Representatives from leading planning and design firms emphasized the importance of building human-centered “smart airports.”

Technology giants such as Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Rapiscan presented solutions spanning from cloud computing and data management to advanced security screening and fuel-efficient operations.

Experts from GE Aerospace, Gulfstream, and Honeywell Aerospace further highlighted the global trend toward sustainable aviation, with a strong focus on flight safety, intelligent operations, and the application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Dang Minh Truong, chairman of Sun Group, said: “For Sun Group, aviation is not merely a means of transportation, but a strategic infrastructure to elevate the stature of a destination. We are building a comprehensive aviation ecosystem — from airport infrastructure to commercial airlines and premium services — with the vision of transforming Phu Quoc from a paradise for leisure into a new aviation and tourism hub of the region.

""The presence of leading US corporations today opens up valuable opportunities for collaboration, enabling us to learn from cutting-edge technologies while reaffirming our commitment to sustainable development and global integration.”

The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility proposal forms part of a broader effort to establish Teesside as a hub for low‑carbon aviation fuel manufacture.
Linking production to CCS can reduce emissions further, but CCS projects themselves have drawn scrutiny over cost, capacity and timing.
Alfanar, a diversified Saudi firm with interests in energy and engineering, has not yet published a detailed timetable or financial close date for Lighthouse Green Fuels.
“Developments such as Lighthouse Green Fuels put our region at the forefront of a growing industry which is primed for massive expansion and will deliver thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment in coming years.","The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility is proposed for the North Tees industrial cluster and would convert more than 1.5Mt of sustainably sourced biomass waste into up to 180M litres of SAF a year, according to company figures. That output is equivalent to fuelling roughly 25,000 short‑haul or 2,500 long‑haul flights annually.

Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said he secured the pledge during a visit to Riyadh last week, meeting senior Alfanar executives including vice‑chairman Sabah Al Multaq. The mayor said he would champion the scheme with the UK government as it progresses towards construction.

Alfanar’s plan envisages more than 2,000 jobs during the construction phase and about 240 permanent roles once the plant is operational. Project backers also say the facility will link to carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure being developed off the Teesside coast by the Northern Endurance Partnership, reducing lifecycle emissions. They estimate more than 750,000t of carbon dioxide could be avoided when the plant is coupled with CCS.

The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility proposal forms part of a broader effort to establish Teesside as a hub for low‑carbon aviation fuel manufacture. The Department for Transport has previously awarded almost £40M from its Advanced Fuels Fund to Alfanar and four other Teesside businesses to support SAF development in the region.

The project would represent one of the larger private investments in UK SAF production to date, but it faces the usual hurdles for industrial-scale energy projects: securing final investment decisions, planning consents, feedstock supply chains and long‑term offtake agreements with airlines or fuel distributors.

Critics of biomass‑derived sustainable fuels warn that sustainability depends on feedstock sourcing and land‑use impacts, while supporters point to the potential to decarbonise hard‑to‑electrify sectors such as aviation. Linking production to CCS can reduce emissions further, but CCS projects themselves have drawn scrutiny over cost, capacity and timing.

Local officials have promoted Teesside’s existing industrial infrastructure, port capacity and emerging CCS network as advantages for attracting low‑carbon industry. If completed, the Lighthouse plant would add to a cluster of projects seeking to position the area as a centre for energy transition and green manufacturing.

Alfanar, a diversified Saudi firm with interests in energy and engineering, has not yet published a detailed timetable or financial close date for Lighthouse Green Fuels.

Mayor Houchen said: “It is outstanding news that Alfanar has committed to delivering this project on Teesside and it’s a further example of the transformative global investments we are bringing to Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool.

“Developments such as Lighthouse Green Fuels put our region at the forefront of a growing industry which is primed for massive expansion and will deliver thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment in coming years.

The E190-E2 is a substantially upgraded version of the older E-190s operated by Virgin Australia until 2018, when they were retired as part of the fleet consolidation on the Boeing 737.
Virgin Australia ordered the new aircraft last year on the back of improving load factors and financial results after emerging from receivership following the pandemic.
The aircraft will be based in Perth and employed on regional routes in Western Australia, replacing the ageing Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Network Aviation on Virgin’s behalf.
Virgin Australia Regional Airlines group executive Nick Rohrlach said the delivery of the new aircraft was a landmark day for aviation in Western Australia.","The first of eight new Embraer regional jets for Virgin Australia made a stopover in Canberra last week on its delivery flight to Perth.

Named ‘’Coral Bay’’, the aircraft completed the 26,000-kilometre ferry flight from São José dos Campos in Brazil via stops in Texas, California, Hawaii and Fiji before stopping in Canberra for a top-up for its final leg to Perth.

The E190-E2 is a substantially upgraded version of the older E-190s operated by Virgin Australia until 2018, when they were retired as part of the fleet consolidation on the Boeing 737. But the E190 offered much lower fuel burn, and was well suited to shorter and ‘’thinner’’ routes to regional centres that don’t require a 180-seat 737.

Upgrades include new-generation engines, a revised wing, and enhanced cabin features and products. The new aircraft will be fitted with 100-seat interiors, comprising 92 economy-class seats in a four-abreast configuration, and eight three-abreast business-class seats. Some of the economy-class seat rows will have ‘’Economy X’’ seats with additional legroom as a cost premium.

Virgin Australia ordered the new aircraft last year on the back of improving load factors and financial results after emerging from receivership following the pandemic.

This was followed earlier this year by the airline being relisted on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) for the first time in five years, the receipt of government approval for Qatar Airways to invest in the airline, and the resumption of international services from Sydney to Doha using Qatar Airways equipment and crews.

The aircraft will be based in Perth and employed on regional routes in Western Australia, replacing the ageing Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Network Aviation on Virgin’s behalf. Compared with the F100, the E190-E2 is much quieter, burns 30 per cent less fuel and produces 30 per cent fewer emissions.

The new aircraft are capable of flying legs up to six hours long, and are powered by new-generation Pratt & Whitney PW1900G geared turbofan engines. These are similar to the larger PW1500Gs installed on Qantas’s new and slightly larger 130-seat Airbus A220s, which are based in Canberra, and the larger-still PW1100G used by Jetstar’s Airbus A321NEO and Qantas’s new A321XLR.

While the E190-E2s’ primary role will be supporting Virgin Australia Regional Airlines’ (VARA) extensive fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) contracts across the state’s vastly dispersed mining communities, the cabin configuration will allow them the flexibility to operate regular passenger services during quieter charter periods.

VARA was formed from Virgin’s 2013 acquisition of Skywest, which had operated in the state for more than 60 years.

VARA currently operates about 250 flights a week, servicing regional centres including Albany, Broome, Busselton, Derby, Esperance, Exmouth, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Kununurra, Newman, Onslow and Port Hedland from its Perth base. These are a mix of revenue passenger and mining fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) services. In addition, VARA links Kalgoorlie with Melbourne, Broome and Kununurra with Darwin, and Port Hedland with Bali.

Virgin Australia Regional Airlines group executive Nick Rohrlach said the delivery of the new aircraft was a landmark day for aviation in Western Australia.

“The E190-E2 is a game-changer,” he said.

“It is more fuel-efficient, quieter and more comfortable than anything else operating in the state’s charter market today. It will significantly improve the travel experience for our charter clients and give us greater flexibility across VARA’s operations.

“When it enters service next month, this aircraft will fly charter routes and also support commercial services primarily within Western Australia to destinations like Darwin, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Port Hedland and Broome.

“As we build scale with the E2 fleet over time, we will be able to explore expanding its use across our national network.

“The E190-E2 is 30 per cent more fuel-efficient than our retiring Fokker 100s and has the lowest noise profile of any aircraft in its segment. It is also future-ready, certified for up to 50 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and capable of operating on 100 per cent SAF.”

Three more E-190E2s are scheduled to join the VARA fleet in Perth by early 2026, with the remainder by the end of 2027.",https://psnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/09/Virgin-Australia-Embraer-E190-E2-Csmith-Photography-08-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:56:57.932363

The political-related expenses included $30,000 for annual membership to the Federal Labor Business Forum, which allows for GrainGrowers attendance at various Labor events, and a further payment of $2520 was made to the forum during the year for attendance to other events.

Another $11,000 was paid to the National Party to attend various similar political functions during the year.

In the financial report, the organisation commented that “these expenditures further complement GrainGrowers advocacy and policy agenda”.

Investment portfolio breakdown

Management of GrainGrowers’ investment portfolio continued to bring gains for the organisation during FY25.

Most of these gains came from a $5.238M jump in the value of investments categorised as “units in unlisted Australian Infrastructure fund” to $47.768M.

This is the organisation’s second-largest investment classification, under “units in unlisted Australian managed funds”, which also rose in FY25 from $56.92M to $58.505M.

GrainGrowers credited “proactive management and long-term asset allocation” behind the success of its investment portfolio.

“This strategic approach has effectively positioned GrainGrowers’ portfolio to navigate through financial market volatility in the year and has enabled the portfolio to gain from the financial market recovery in the final quarter of the current fiscal year,” the report said.

In the accompanying Annual Report, GrainGrowers’ chair Rhys Turton said the organisation continued a policy of disciplined financial management.

“GrainGrowers financial position remains strong and together with a disciplined spending policy, we continue to effectively represent and serve over 15,000 members nationally,” Mr Turton said.

“Our grower relations and thought leadership work ensures we provide a robust ideas ecosystem that can solve emerging and future issues while still exploring opportunities for immediate growth and innovation for the industry.

“As examples, projects and initiatives undertaken include our comprehensive and industry wide Grain Sustainability Framework and Inputs of the Future report including the active exploration of biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).”

GrainGrowers’ priorities

The Annual Report identified key areas of focus for GrainGrowers during the financial year.

GrainGrowers chief executive officer Shona Gawel said “one of the biggest issues” was the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority review of paraquat and diquat.

She said there was a “huge amount of resourcing dedicated to this critical issue”.

“Knowing we needed data to underpin our response, the grower survey we ran received over 1120 responses,” Ms Gawel said.

“In addition to the submission response, we also focused on ways to engage with the broader community.

“GrainGrowers ran a community awareness campaign with a fantastic video featuring growers across the country about how they safely and responsibly use tools like paraquat and diquat on their farms.”

Ms Gawel said the organisation had focused its efforts on six key issues for the industry to focus its resources and skillset.

“As a grower representative organisation, there is a desire at times to “be and do all things”.

“We have a committed team who take pride in being of use to our growers.

“However, GrainGrowers has found that we can create the most impact by prioritising and subsequently have focused on six key issues: carbon and climate, farm business, farm inputs, grain freight and supply chains, trade and market access and biosecurity.

“This gives us capacity when emerging issues arise.”",https://www.graincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-105945.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:15.257244

Airport passenger cap will stifle growth - O'Brien Meanwhile, Minister O'Brien said retaining Dublin Airport's passenger cap will stifle its growth.","Minister for Transport Darragh O'Brien said he is ""hoping"" for an agreement between the board of Dublin Airport Authority (daa) and its chief executive Kenny Jacobs.

Legal teams representing both sides are currently locked into negotiations which could lead to Mr Jacobs leaving the organisation.

Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland Minister O'Brien confirmed any exit package, which would to be paid to Mr Jacobs would have to be approved by the Minister.

Asked if he had received details of an exit package for Mr Jacobs, Minister O'Brien said: ""we haven't got there yet.""

Minister O'Brien said that Mr Jacobs and his team had been ""central"" to delivering growth at Dublin Airport.

The talks between the two legal teams are expected to continue over the coming days.

Mr Jacobs has led the state body which is responsible for the operation of Dublin and Cork Airports since January 2023.

There have been reports of tensions between the board of directors of the daa and Mr Jacobs.

He is understood to have been subject to two protective disclosures which have not been upheld, meaning the chief executive was exonerated.

The Department has been kept informed of developments and Mr Jacobs remains in position.

Any exit package for Mr Jacobs would also have to be approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Jack Chambers.

It is understood that the Government's position is that any settlement for Mr Jacobs would be tied to his entitlements.

The daa annual report said: ""Total remuneration in respect of Mr Jacobs for 2024 amounted to

€374,830 (2023: €347,457) which included basic salary of €284,235 (2023: €267,837) and pension contributions and other taxable benefits of €90,595 (2023: €79,620).""

The daa board is due to meet in Cork in a pre-scheduled meeting on Friday.

A spokesperson for the daa declined to comment on the negotiations regarding Mr Jacobs' future.

Airport passenger cap will stifle growth - O'Brien

Meanwhile, Minister O'Brien said retaining Dublin Airport's passenger cap will stifle its growth.

The Department of Transport will begin the process of removing the Dublin Airport passenger cap in the coming weeks.

The cap, which stands at 32 million passengers per year, was imposed in 2007 as part of the planning conditions around the development of Terminal 2.

At the time, the airport had about 23 million passengers.

Legal proceedings by airlines have effectively suspended the cap, with questions referred to the European Courts.

Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Mr O’Brien said the airport is a ""critical economic driver for the country, not just for the region, and any stifling of that growth obviously has a direct economic impact"".

""I've had a series of meetings over the course of the last number of months, particularly with our legal advisors, and I'll be coming forward to Cabinet, hopefully before the Budget, with legislative options that is in seeking approval to proceed with drafting Heads of Bill and the general scheme,"" he added.

Mr O’Brien said he was in favour of the removal of the passenger cap, which could see up to 60 million passengers pass through the airport per year, if the growth was managed in a sustainable manner.

""You have obviously got to do that on a phased basis. One is not going to jump from 36 million to 60 million in the course of one, five, ten years,"" he said.

He said a ""couple of very significant planning decisions"" have been made.

""The night flights issue has been addressed in July, which gives clarity to the airport and indeed to residents around the operation of the airport at night,"" he said.

""We're expecting, very, very shortly in the coming weeks, a positive decision on Metrolink, which is a transformative project for the airport, and indeed for the region.""

""The physical infrastructure around the airport that existed back in 2007 when this planning permission was granted and that condition was put in place, has changed greatly and will change further,"" he added.

Mr O’Brien said that there would ""unquestionably"" be an increase in greenhouse gas emissions if the passenger cap is removed, but added that the aviation sector had responsibilities to combat that potential increase.

""What also is in that [planning] application, and which is understood in the aviation sector, is the responsibilities they have to bring forward the use of alternative fuels, such as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel),"" he said.

""Airplanes are far more advanced technologically now and are more efficient in relation to fuel use.

""We have obligations on the climate side and I'm acutely aware of that as Minister with responsibility for that.

""We've seen emissions reduce over the last two years in Ireland, whilst our economy and population continues to grow. So we're making advances in many areas, and this is a balance that we will have to strike.""

Mr O’Brien said he had already met with a number of residents groups to hear and discuss their concerns.

""I have met with the residents group from St Margaret's over the summer,"" he said.

""I'll be meeting with them again. I've met with residents in Portmarnock. I know the area intimately as I've spent my whole life here.

""I also know that there are many residents here who understand we need to grow the airport, and indeed a lot of those residents do, and there are others who have concerns and I continue to engage with them, absolutely.""

'Inevitability' around cap removal

A member of the Oireachtas Transport Committee member says there has been an inevitability about the removal of the cap at Dublin Airport for some time.

Fianna Fáil TD Cathal Crowe, said aviation likes certainty and if an airline doesn't feel it is being properly accomodated it can easily move to another jurisdiction.

Legislation takes time, he said on RTÉ's Today with Claire Byrne, and will probably be passed sometime next year.

Mr Crowe said aviation has come on ""light years"" and there are more efforts underway to make aircrafts more environmentally friendly.

He added that Ireland is an island nation that needs connectivity and economic development.

Opportunity to examine airport activity regulation - O'Gorman

Green Party leader Roderic O'Gorman said if the cap at Dublin airport is changed, it could be an opportunity to examine whether passenger numbers is the right way to regulate activities at Dublin Airport.

Roderic O'Gorman said there could be an opportunity to look at emissions and noise and reward those airlines that are upgrading their fleet and using quieter and more fuel efficient aircrafts.

""We have to understand the scale of what Minister O'Brien is proposing, and we should be regulating Dublin Airport in terms of what is generated by increased passenger numbers,"" he said on RTÉ's Today with Claire Byrne.

""Focusing on the actual emission of the passenger brings a greater degree of fairness into the equation,"" he added.

More aircraft means more noise

A spokesperson for St Margaret's The Ward Residents forum says more aircraft will mean more noise and there are already outstanding issues in relation to noise from Dublin airport.

Niamh Maher said residents find it ""incredulous"" that the Minister for Transport would remove the cap without resolving these issues first.

""The problem extends past St Margaret's The Ward to everywhere a flight path crosses over,"" she said.

""If there's an increase in passenger numbers, which equals increased flights, that is going to get even worse,"" she added.",https://www.rte.ie/images/001df17c-1600.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:18.926662

“We found that information about Canada’s carbon removal sector is scattered all over the place,” Na'im Merchant, executive director of Carbon Removal Canada, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada.
Based in Toronto, Carbon Removal Canada works to accelerate the “responsible scale-up of carbon removal.” The Carbon Console was funded via a partnership with RBC.
A plurality of the current removal capacity is from rock-based carbon removal that involves mineralizing CO2, followed by ocean-, land- and air-based methods.
Canada could lead the world in carbon removal, Carbon Removal Canada said in a 2023 report, noting advantages such as its clean electricity, skilled energy workforce and fostering of companies.","A website made by non-profit Carbon Removal Canada that summarizes the state of the emerging sector and planned capacity across the country is intended to “solve a pretty critical market intelligence problem,” the organization’s head said.

Released today, the Carbon Console tracks the Canadian carbon removal industry, which captures the greenhouse gas from the environment through various means and buries it in different mediums. The non-profit suggests Canada could reap tens of billions of dollars in economic activity from the sector.

“We found that information about Canada’s carbon removal sector is scattered all over the place,” Na'im Merchant, executive director of Carbon Removal Canada, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada. The console is meant to “centralize all that information in one platform in a transparent manner.”

Today, there is enough carbon removal capacity to extract 101,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, with almost 12 million tonnes planned, according to the Console. There are 78 companies in the sector operating in Canada, made up of technology providers, project developers and operators.

Policy makers can take a peek to inform policies, while the private sector can make better-informed decisions such as where to site a project, Merchant said.

Based in Toronto, Carbon Removal Canada works to accelerate the “responsible scale-up of carbon removal.”

The Carbon Console was funded via a partnership with RBC.

Where Canada’s carbon removal industry stands today

The organization collected publicly available data, made direct outreach to carbon removal industry players, and conducted its own research drawing from sources such as media reports and pitches made to local governments to create the Console.

Governments, community groups and local non-governmental organizations were highly interested in the Carbon Console so they could be better informed about the nascent sector, Merchant said.

Not all carbon removal technology is the science-fiction-like direct air capture that filters CO2 from the atmosphere. Nature-based solutions such as converting forestry and agricultural biomass into biochar, a carbon-rich solid material, are popular.

Under 50 projects are currently underway. A plurality of the current removal capacity is from rock-based carbon removal that involves mineralizing CO2, followed by ocean-, land- and air-based methods.

Merchant is “amazed at just the amount of projects that are operating or under development or planned.” The 11.9 million tonnes of planned capacity was “a big shock,” as Carbon Removal Canada expected closer to one million. It is a sign companies are building a diverse scope of projects and carbon removal is no longer a “science experiment,” he said.

The 11.9 million tonnes would represent a sliver of the 708 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted in 2024 across Canada.

One metric that is absent on the Carbon Console is the amount of investment committed into the sector. Carbon Removal Canada plans to add more data points to the website over time, Merchant said, including the dollars put toward the technology.

How Canada could lead in the sector

British Columbia is an innovation leader in the sector, Merchant noted. Companies based in the province include Carbon Engineering, Arca and Svante.

At the project level, carbon removal has high potential in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Alberta particularly stands out because many large-scale projects are planned to be sited in the province, the provincial government has extended generous policy support, and the province has “an entrepreneurial business approach,” Merchant said.

Atlantic provinces could forge ahead in ocean-based carbon removal, he added. Players housed in the region include Aeon Blue, Planetary Technologies and CarbonCure.

Canada could lead the world in carbon removal, Carbon Removal Canada said in a 2023 report, noting advantages such as its clean electricity, skilled energy workforce and fostering of companies. But Merchant warned the country risks falling behind the likes of the U.K. or the European Union because of insufficient government policies.

He laid out three recommendations for the Canadian government to stay ahead in the race:

creating market certainty for companies by helping to secure buyers and funding;

expanding the investment tax credit for all forms of carbon removal, not just direct air capture; and

more targeted research and development funding for carbon removal, such as Natural Resources Canada making a project stream for the technology.

Carbon removal, in the non-profit’s view, is an investment that can be supported using unspent money in funds, Merchant said. The industry is a “critical sector” that should be supported by the federal government, and the carbon removal credits it generates could even be an export opportunity, he added.",https://squall.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/posts/2025091204-carbon-console-800x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:23.189465

The paper pitched Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) SAF, produced from ethanol, as the most strategic pathway for India to cut emissions, reduce crude oil imports and create green jobs.
“India stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainable aviation journey.
With a strategic push, we can decarbonise our skies and become a regional and global SAF hub,” Vijay Nirani, SAFA senior vice president, said in a statement.
ICF has projected that global SAF output will grow tenfold to nearly 20 million tonnes by 2030.","India could emerge as a major global hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the back of its robust ethanol ecosystem, surplus agricultural residues and rapidly expanding aviation market, according to a new report.

The report, SAF Samarthya – The Opportunity of AtJ SAF in India, launched on September 15, 2025 by consultancy ICF in collaboration with the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Association (SAFA), underlined that with aviation contributing 2-3 per cent of global carbon emissions, India faces both a “challenge and opportunity” to decarbonise while sustaining its air travel boom.

The findings come ahead of the government’s planned national SAF policy to meet Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) norms and decarbonise the sector.

The paper pitched Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) SAF, produced from ethanol, as the most strategic pathway for India to cut emissions, reduce crude oil imports and create green jobs.

“India stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainable aviation journey. We need a roadmap that not only sets the blueprint for SAF production and uptake but makes all stakeholders key custodians of this transition,” said Vasudevan S, Head of Aviation, Travel and Tourism (India & APAC), ICF, in a statement.

India has set indicative SAF blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, rising to 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights, equivalent to around 700 million litres of SAF demand by 2030.

Industry leaders including Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), Praj Industries, TruAlt Bioenergy and Avaada Group are already investing in production capacity and technology.

There has been some early progress. Praj Industries has commissioned a one kilolitre-per-day AtJ demo plant in Pune, while IOCL recently became the first domestic firm to secure ISCC-CORSIA certification at its Panipat refinery. Several second-generation (2G) ethanol plants by IOCL, BPCL and HPCL are also coming online, ensuring a ready feedstock base.

“We believe India has the raw materials, technological know-how and entrepreneurial spirit to build a thriving SAF ecosystem. What is required now is the collective will—commitment, collaboration and bold decision-making,” Rohit Kumar, SAFA secretary general, said in a statement.

India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), which scaled petrol blending from 1.5 per cent in 2014 to 20 per cent by 2025, offers a blueprint for SAF rollout, the paper noted. Ethanol capacity has risen eightfold to 13.8 billion litres in under a decade, creating infrastructure, supply chains and policy experience that can be repurposed for AtJ.

India produces over 500 crore litres of ethanol annually and about 754 million tonnes of agricultural biomass, of which 228 million tonnes is surplus and available for energy use. Surplus feedstocks are concentrated in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, making them prime zones for SAF clusters.

“India has abundant agricultural waste, low-cost renewable energy and a large domestic aviation market. With a strategic push, we can decarbonise our skies and become a regional and global SAF hub,” Vijay Nirani, SAFA senior vice president, said in a statement.

However, high production costs — currently three to five times that of conventional jet fuel — remain the key barrier. Feedstock accounts for 50-70 per cent of costs, followed by capital-intensive conversion infrastructure.

The report called for viability gap funding of Rs 150 crore per project, production-linked incentives, tax breaks, low-interest loans and carbon credit frameworks to de-risk private investment.

It also urged a national-level mapping of feedstocks, upgrades at airports and oil marketing terminals for SAF storage and blending, industry-academia skill programmes and stronger cross-ministerial coordination.

“Government incentives, a dedicated SAF consortium, and sustainable feedstock policies will be essential. With coordinated efforts, India can drive economic growth and innovation while meeting its climate goals,” stressed Jimmy Olsson, President, SAF Association.

ICF has projected that global SAF output will grow tenfold to nearly 20 million tonnes by 2030. After meeting domestic demand, the report argued that India could tap export markets with binding SAF mandates, turning aviation decarbonisation into a major economic opportunity.

“Together, government and industry can transform India’s aviation sector into a model of sustainable growth, innovation and climate leadership,” said Ajay Mathur, Mentor, SAF Association and former DG, International Solar Alliance.

If India replicates its ethanol success in SAF, the report concluded, it could not just participate in the global clean fuel transition but shape it, emerging as a key driver of innovation, investment and leadership in sustainable aviation.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-15%2Fgwynejjx%2FiStock-1202297867.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:39.186524

He pointed out that sugar production in India is much costlier than in Brazil.
Without ethanol, nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced closure, Gadkari noted.
“If farmers start producing fuel, electricity, aviation fuel, bitumen and hydrogen, along with food, villages will prosper,” he said.
He added that boosting irrigation by 65% and increasing milk production could address many challenges faced by farmers in Maharashtra.","Pune: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said that ethanol production has been a lifeline for sugarcane farmers and sugar mills in Maharashtra, reported The Times of India.

Speaking at the tenth anniversary of the Naam Foundation, started by actors Nana Patekar and Makarand Anaspure for watershed management and drought relief, Gadkari said that the sugar industry was under severe strain but survived because of ethanol. He added that work is underway to produce isobutanol as an alternative to diesel, and that plans are being drawn up to create sustainable aviation fuel from biogas.

He pointed out that sugar production in India is much costlier than in Brazil. While the cost in Brazil is about Rs. 27 per kg, in Maharashtra it is around Rs. 32-33. “Brazil can sell sugar internationally at around Rs. 30, but our mills lose Rs. 2-3 per kg,” he said. Without ethanol, nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced closure, Gadkari noted.

He urged farmers to think beyond food crops. “If farmers start producing fuel, electricity, aviation fuel, bitumen and hydrogen, along with food, villages will prosper,” he said.

According to him, the use of corn for ethanol has also given farmers better prices. Rates have risen from Rs. 1,200 per quintal to Rs. 2,800 per quintal, and production has tripled in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra, where farmers take three crops a year.

On broader issues, Gadkari stressed the need for better water management to improve farming and rural life. He said disputes between states on sharing river water had created complications, but most of the 23 conflicts have now been resolved. He added that boosting irrigation by 65% and increasing milk production could address many challenges faced by farmers in Maharashtra.

Later in the day, at another programme organised by Geeta Dharma Mandal, Gadkari was honoured. While addressing the gathering, he suggested using modern tools like videos and reels to share the teachings of the Bhagavad Geeta with the youth. He said this could help them understand the meaning of life and politics. “Politics should focus more on social reforms than on power. The real problem today is not disagreement, but the absence of ideas,” he remarked.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Nitin-Gadkari-6.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:57:16.495408

According to the analysis, these improvements saved an estimated 187,000 tonnes of CO₂ daily compared to 2019 operational standards.
However such gains were not enough to offset the growth in capacity, which is why total emissions still went up.
The EmeraldSky analysis suggests that new daily emissions records will become routine during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer travel season.
Andrew Doyle, Senior Director – Market Development, Cirium, stressed the importance of fleet modernisation and integrating innovative technologies to mitigate emissions.","A new analysis by aviation analysts, Cirium, reveals that daily CO₂ emissions from passenger jets reached a new peak in July, marginally exceeding the previous record set in August 2019.

However, the latest report from Cirium’s EmeraldSky platform reveals that, while total daily emissions saw a modest 0.1% increase, airlines achieved a significant 7.4 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency per available seat kilometer (ASK) compared to 2019.

The efficiency gains came despite the average age of aircraft increasing by 17% to 11.6 years, contradicting the common belief that a newer fleet is the only way to improve performance. Instead, airlines focused on operational refinements, including streamlining ground operations, optimizing flight routes, and more efficient network management.

According to the analysis, these improvements saved an estimated 187,000 tonnes of CO₂ daily compared to 2019 operational standards. However such gains were not enough to offset the growth in capacity, which is why total emissions still went up.

The EmeraldSky analysis suggests that new daily emissions records will become routine during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer travel season.

The authors conclude that, while the industry’s recent efficiency improvements have been faster than historical trends, continued growth will require more fundamental changes, with sustainable aviation fuel still making up less than 1% of consumption.

Andrew Doyle, Senior Director – Market Development, Cirium, stressed the importance of fleet modernisation and integrating innovative technologies to mitigate emissions.

“While geopolitical factors present significant challenges, the aviation industry’s commitment to modernising fleets is a testament to our proactive approach to sustainability,” he said.

Established in 2010, Lootah Biofuels was the first commercial biofuel company in the Middle East.

It is partnering with international production facilities to add this fuel to its extensive portfolio of bio-based products. The fuel is produced from Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and waste-derived fats, in accordance with ASTM D7566-24 and ICAO CORSIA standards.

The fuel produced from used cooking oil and waste-derived fats, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. The fuel can be blended with traditional Jet A-1 fuel up to 50 per cent by volume and offers cleaner combustion with very low sulfur content.

""As one of the first local suppliers of SAF, we are proud to launch SAF in the UAE market and showcase it at Dubai Airshow to local and international stakeholders and leading companies in the aviation industry,"" said Yousif Lootah, CEO of Lootah Biofuels.

Lootah added, “This initiative reflects Lootah Biofuels’ sustainable commitment to innovation, reinforces our alignment with the UAE’s sustainability vision, and brings us closer to our aspirations of collaborating with global aviation partners to accelerate decarbonization.""

The launch aligns with global aviation industry efforts to reduce carbon emissions and the UAE’s commitment to advancing aviation sector sustainability goals.

The UAE government has committed to investing heavily in sustainable aviation technologies as part of its broader Net Zero 2050 strategy. The country’s two major airlines - Emirates and Etihad - have also invested heavily to tap into the nascent global SAF market.

Emirates recently expanded its partnership with Neste for the supply of over 3 million gallons of blended SAF in 2024 and 2025, and took delivery of 3,000 metric tonnes of neat SAF from Shell Aviation at London Heathrow Airport.

UAE’s flag carrier Etihad has committed for more than a decade to pioneering the development of SAF supply chains in the UAE and beyond, and since 2019 has driven the Boeing Greenliner Programme sustainability initiative.",https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews%2Fimport%2F2024%2F03%2F27%2FSTOCK-Emirates-SAF-Neste-Amsterdam_18e7f118ed5_large.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 07:56:08.472004

That means the technique – known as CCUS – has yet to scale up, still relies on taxpayer support and should only be pursued after other green solutions, key industry players told a recent conference in London.

Companies and governments that depend heavily on fossil fuel revenues have long promoted CCUS technology as a way to carry on producing and consuming fossil fuels while keeping emissions down.

But over 50 years since the first project began operating, CCUS is still barely used. According to the Global CCS Institute, just 50 facilities were running around the world in 2024, with the capacity to capture about a thousandth of global emissions.

Most of those capture CO2 from gas facilities and pump it underground to squeeze more oil from reservoirs, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

At this month’s Carbon Capture Global Summit 2025 – organised by Leader Associates – business representatives admitted that the technology has failed to expand on a commercial scale despite strong government support. CCUS momentum has even “plateaued a wee bit” in 2025, said Mhairidh Evans, head of CCUS research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Subsidies still needed

Julia Dubinina, a former Shell manager now developing oil and gas firm Harbour Energy’s carbon storage business, was asked if CCUS is entering its “deployment phase”. She replied that it is “too early to talk about scale”, adding “we need to be careful of not trying to fly before we can walk”. “There is still quite a lot of work to be done,” she added.

She remains cautious partly because “public funding is an absolute must for every project, and scaling is kind of limited when you need public funding for every single project,” she explained.

The industry depends on subsidies because capturing and transporting CO2 is among the most expensive climate solutions. In 2021, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists reported that while solar and wind investments usually save money, CCUS costs $50-200 per tonne of CO2 captured.

In a keynote speech at the conference, Katharina Beumelberg, sustainability chief at Heidelberg Materials – which produces cement, aggregates, concrete and asphalt – acknowledged the sector’s reliance on taxpayer support.

Praising the Norwegian government’s funding for one of the company’s CCUS projects, she said: “We need these funding processes to be able to do this pioneering work because, otherwise, from the private sector it would be unrealistic to get there”. She added: “Whatever we do in the end needs to make money.”

Beumelberg called for more taxpayer support for CCUS. Noting that three-fifths of Heidelberg’s products are used in government-funded projects, she said governments should create a market for carbon-free products, “recognising that a carbon-free product in the end does need to come with different pricing because it is carbon-free”.

Because of its high cost, most experts say CCUS should be reserved for sectors that are hard to clean up in other ways like steel, chemicals and particularly cement.

Expensive last resort

Cement-making produces 8% of global emissions, more than any country apart from the US and China, as fossil fuels are burned to heat limestone and the chemical process itself releases CO2.

But Rozemarijn Wesby, vice-president of CCUS at the world’s biggest cement company Holcim, told the conference that even in cement, the high cost of CCUS means it is only the “last piece of the puzzle”.

That’s because Holcim’s decarbonisation goal is more important than its CCUS goal, she said – and CCUS is one of the more expensive ways to cut emissions. For that reason, Holcim is first ensuring that its power is “green”, fuels are “sustainable and renewable” and emissions avoided “wherever possible”.

Evans of Wood Mackenzie echoed this, saying governments and companies should prioritise energy efficiency, then “electrifying everything that we possibly can with renewables, then fuel switching [and] substituting” before “at the last, directly abating or removing carbon dioxide”.

Wesby stressed that using CCUS only as a last step limits costs and prevents oversized “downstream” infrastructure. The CCUS infrastructure discussed at the conference included pipelines and trains to move CO2, terminals to store, compress and load it onto ships, and underground storage sites.

A Nature study published this month, however, found that the world’s CO2 storage potential is far more constrained than previously thought. Lead author Matthew Gidden of the University of Maryland argued in a post on CarbonBrief that governments should prioritise who gets access to storage space.

Carbon capture for gas plants?

Electricity is one of the easiest sectors to decarbonise because renewable power is often cheaper than fossil fuels. As of 2024, only five fossil-fuel power plants had CCUS, all of which used the CO2 for EOR. Only one, Huaneng Yangpu in China, is a gas power station and that is just a demonstration project.

Nonetheless, the UK government financially supports a CCUS project at a gas plant in England’s Northeast and is considering support for another in Wales run by power firm Uniper. Mike Lockett, Uniper’s UK head, said that Germany’s new centre right-led government had also “opened the door for gas-fired CCS”.

Supporters say such plants produce flexible and dispatchable power, unlike solar and wind. Critics argue batteries, demand management, nuclear and cross-border interconnections can provide sufficient backup.

Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus, a UK-based clean energy, electric vehicle services and heat pump company, said recently that – while it’s useful for cement – subsidising CCUS for energy is misguided.

Jackson, who is also an official adviser to the UK government, told the Financial Times Weekend Festival that the technology has “been a gift to the oil and gas industry to carry on what they’re doing and carry on the fiction that somehow enormous amounts of public money should enable them to keep doing it”.

“It’s a boondoggle for oil and gas – and we would be better off in the UK just burning unabated gas, because the cheaper we make electricity, the cheaper our heat pumps and electric cars are going to be and they are the key to emissions reductions,” he said.

Risk of pipeline leaks

Building out CCUS on a large scale will involve vast CO2 pipeline networks. These come with risks: In 2020, a landslide caused a carbon pipeline to leak in the US state of Mississippi, hospitalising at least 45 people. High concentrations of CO2 can cause headaches, drowsiness, elevated heartbeat and blood pressure, and even death.

Climate Home News asked Niko Bosnjak, policy and communications lead at carbon pipeline operator Open Grid Europe (OGE), which is converting German gas pipelines to carry CO2, if similar leaks could happen in Europe.

He said he had heard about the Mississippi incident, although he didn’t “know exactly what happened”. OGE, he added, is working on a security framework and “looking at the thickness of the pipeline in a way that is supposed to provide more security”.

Despite such concerns, CCUS has continued to receive strong political backing. US President Donald Trump, for example, cut subsidies for other green technologies but expanded support for CCUS, while India is preparing CCUS subsidies.

“The need for CCS is broadly recognised at the political level,” said Shell’s CCS general manager Kelly Ripley. Oil and gas giant Shell is launching CCUS projects – especially in North America and northwest Europe – she added, and is “doing a lot of learning from this political and regulatory perspective and also hoping to bring other countries on the same journey with us”.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/Carbon-Capture-Summit-2025-QEII-Centre-London-Photographer-Simon-Callaghan-Photography-1348-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 07:56:14.285582

“One per cent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 per cent of aviation emissions.","Most corporate travel managers are still on their first steps on their sustainability journeys. It is clear that, no matter what the messages are that are emerging from the EU or the White House, that more companies are taking those steps.

Those companies in the early stages of their sustainability journeys will quickly mature thanks to the proliferation of technology and expertise in the market today.

“There is an expectation in the uplift of the quality of sustainability data to finance-level, audited data,” says CTM’s head of sustainability Lauren Hook. “What this means is the need for accurate and timely data will become increasingly important for businesses at both ends of the sustainability maturity spectrum.”

While we have seen that companies are reacting to regulatory pressure more than anything else in their sustainability strategies, peer pressure is also important.

“We are seeing very significant pressure being applied by some of the largest companies in the world, in particular, Microsoft, AstraZeneca, Salesforce, Schneider Electric and Siemens [are] asking their suppliers to report on their emissions and set up their own forward-looking targets,” says Adam Braun, founder and CEO of Clarasight.

“We actually believe that added business pressure is more powerful than just the regulatory pressure. Often, we're hearing from companies who are saying we need to do more than just report on last year's emissions. We now need to set credible targets going forward and then have both a system of record and a system of action to be able to credibly achieve that goal.”

Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Aspen believes we will see more carbon budgets being used by corporates. Indeed, Concur is set to facilitate carbon budgets in its booking tool this quarter.

In May, Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Apsen told BTN Europe that it will be the first organisation to take advantage of the new capability, with “several corporates lined up for the initial rollout, including a mix of Fortune 500s.”

Aspen believes that carbon budgets at the team level will be the most popular. “How can an individual make that decision? If they think their trip is more important than their boss's trip in two months’ time they’re going to book it anyway,” he says. “There are also many places out there where there is only one flight a day. If your carbon budget says you now have to reduce your carbon by 10 per cent then that is useless information – you are going to take that one flight.”

He continues: “When you have budgets at a division level with 10,000 people, it is too impersonal. What does it matter that you are emitting one tonne of CO2 when the division still has thousands of tonnes to emit.” Teams are therefore the sweetspot where a budget is most meaningful and can truly change behaviour and thus impact.

FLYING TOWARDS 2050

Decarbonising aviation in particular will remain crucial to decarbonising business travel by 2050. The figure below shows a range of different pathways that aviation might achieve net zero by 2050. It shows scenarios outlined by IATA, ICAO, the International Council on Clean Transportation and the Air Transport Action Group.

American Express Global Business Travel’s head of sustainability, Nora Lovell Marchant, says the figures reveal that “the low-hanging fruit is basically gone” but that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), shown in green, is a major part of all these scenarios.

Operations (shown in yellow), such as using greener flight paths, and tech (in blue), like more fuel-efficient planes, make up another significant part of the emission reductions.

Carbon removal and market-based measures (light grey), such as carbon pricing in Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme, are also important in many of the scenarios. Other scenarios leave residual emissions (in dark grey) – carbon emissions that cannot be removed by other methods – that need to be offset in some other way.

CONTROLLING DEMAND

Many of the scenarios include a purple bar denoting demand impact or reduction – ie reducing the demand for business travel.

Will fewer business trips part of the solution? Our survey showed that 46 per cent of travel managers are promoting the use of virtual meeting tools instead of face-to-face travel, although few if any companies are mandating this.

Katharina Riederer, co-founder of eco.mio, says: “Obviously it's the best solution not to travel but the difficulty in our industry is that this industry exists because of travel, so reducing travel... no one really wants to push that. Also, when I do my booking, I have already decided that I have to travel and I have already got the approval.”

Nora Lovell Marchant says the pandemic showed that meetings could move to Zoom. “Now aviation traffic is growing because people know the value of business trips and putting people in front of people,” she says. “Are there some business trips that can and should be replaced with Zoom? Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever? Absolutely.”

She continues: “We need to think about how to decarbonise that... because even the most liberal non-profit organisations recognise that other types of solutions besides demand management alone will be needed in order to decarbonise aviation.”

Benjamin Park, head of travel and sustainability at Parexel, expects sustainability in business travel to become more data-driven, with increased transparency and accountability. “Emissions methodologies will evolve, and corporates will need to adopt more granular tracking and reporting,” he says.

Park also believes that employee and customer expectations will increasingly influence corporate travel programmes. “For roles requiring travel, the maturity of a company’s sustainable travel strategy may become a differentiator in talent attraction and retention,” he says.

Park adds: “While cost management remains important, we are seeing a shift toward ‘purposeful travel’ where the value of each trip is weighed against its environmental impact. This mindset helps us reduce unnecessary travel while preserving essential face-to-face patient and customer engagement.”

As Advito’s senior director of sustainability Julien Etchanchu says, in spite of delays to the full roll-out of CSRD, “at some point, we will have to travel less not just because of the environment but because at some point there will be an energy crisis.”

Could unbridled aviation growth be managed through taxes and fees that are reinvested in the industry’s pursuit of net zero? “One per cent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 per cent of aviation emissions. People want to travel. At the moment, someone travelling once every ten years is taxed in the same way as a business traveller travelling 20 times a year.

“The problem is you don’t pay for the pollution you make – that is the ultimate issue. You could imagine a frequent flyer levy where the first trip is free of tax, the second you start to increase it a bit and by trip ten you are highly taxed and ever more highly in business class. The pressure for levies will grow,” warns Etchanchu.

With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry – and wider business travel sector – is running out of time to decarbonise. While plans, policies and ideas are rife, now is the time for action.

Michael Schneider: Usually our jet fuel consumption [annually as an industry] is 300 million tonnes.
Michael Schneider: Everyone has to play its part.
Michael Schneider: I think the crux of the problem is indeed the proliferation of methodologies and calculators.
Michael Schneider: Multimodality is important and could be part of the answer but it is a very European discussion as we have a very well-developed train network.","Michael Schneider is assistant director for aviation environment at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade association for the world's airlines. It represents some 350 airlines – which account for more than 80 per cent of global air traffic – and helps formulate industry policy on critical aviation issues, including sustainability and the environment. BTN Europe's Andy Hoskins spoke to Michael Schneider in early September.

BTN Europe: IATA is committed to net zero by 2050 and you have detailed roadmaps of how the aviation industry can achieve this. But 2050 is not all that far off now – is it still achievable?

Michael Schneider: It is indeed a big challenge and it’s not so far off. If you look at the five roadmaps we have addressing different areas you might think it is very challenging and particularly if you look at SAF [Sustainable aviation fuel]. The development of SAF is absolutely critical – 65 per cent of the industry's decarbonisation will come from SAF.

What we have not seen yet is the ramping up of it [SAF production] as we would have hoped. This is due to a number of different factors – feedstock availability, the large investments that need to be made, and of course governments have to play their part too, putting in place the right environment and mechanisms to allow SAF production to scale up, and it needs to happen rapidly. We need between 5,000 and 7,000 SAF production facilities – it’s a staggering number – and a new plant can cost $1 billion so there has to be the right environment to make it happen.

But SAF is not the only contributing lever. There are technological improvements, operational improvements… every new aircraft can be between 15 and 25 per cent more fuel efficient. Then of course there are other propulsion methods – hydrogen can play a role in short-haul aviation. And then there is a remainder of CO2 emissions that we cannot reduce by deploying SAF and we need to look at CO2 removal tech.

We are still very confident that we can meet net zero 2050 conditional on those things falling into place.

BTN Europe: At 65 per cent of emission reductions, there is a heavy reliance on SAF. There are EU and UK mandates on adoption in place now, but what are the biggest challenges in driving up SAF production?

Michael Schneider: Usually our jet fuel consumption [annually as an industry] is 300 million tonnes. We will have produced 2 million tonnes [of SAF] by the end of this year, so that is not even 1 per cent of what's needed. But this will rapidly grow.

With the mandates, it’s a two-edged sword. In a way it makes those producing SAF really focus because in renewable fuel production not everything is used for SAF. Unfortunately, what we’re seeing in Europe is that compliance costs have increased. SAF has got more expensive because the mandate is on the SAF suppliers not on the airlines and they want to pass on the cost. They see an opportunity to increase the price in this way and they call it a compliance cost so we’re seeing the cost of SAF in Europe being higher than in any other part of the world. It’s concerning and it’s an effect of a mandate.

In that sense we would think maybe incentives work better and we have seen that in the US with the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] and the subsidies that have been offered to those who produce renewable fuel, and that really works well. We see the volumes there increasing rapidly. In Europe the decision was to do it via mandate and that has had a worse effect as we can see happening now. We have stats and charts on this that show how the cost per tonne of SAF has increased since the mandate was introduced.

BTN Europe: What else can governments do? What can IATA do?

Michael Schneider: Everyone has to play its part. Airlines are willing to make an investment – it’s a large investment; SAF is an expensive commodity. The profit margins [for airlines] are razor thin. We used to say it was a cup of coffee per passenger and maybe now it’s two cups of coffee because oil prices are a bit lower. But that is still not much and it does not give much room for extra investment. New aircraft models are being introduced and fleet renewal is already happening.

It is really on governments to create the right environment and the incentives to help make those steep investments in a production plant. But as long as you can make a lot of money with conventional fuels, there is a problem. A lot of subsidies, let’s be honest, don’t go into the renewable areas – it goes into the petroleum industry and fossil fuels. We’d rather see subsidies going into something linked to renewable fuels. And then of course we need governments to make it easier to build those plants by giving planning permissions and cutting the red tape.

On the technological aspect of SAF production, there are ways for established oil companies to repurpose some of their faculties to produce SAF. It is limited in terms of adding capacity but every drop of SAF that can be produced plays its part so it’s also on the oil majors to deliver. Unfortunately over the last two years we have seen some of the major producers row back.

[Editor's note: In the same week that this interview took place, news broke that Shell has cancelled the construction of a major biofuel production plant in the Netherlands due to cost concerns]

BTN Europe: In corporate travel there is sometimes confusion and scepticism around SAF. Deals are announced by airlines for SAF that doesn’t exist or is not actually supplied to or flown by that airline...

Michael Schneider: There are many commitments from airlines and these are important signals for producers. But if you’re an airline based in Kenya you don’t have direct access to SAF. However, there is SAF in the US and maybe San Francisco airport can offer it to them even though they don’t fly there, and it can be used by another airline. So you have SAF ‘book and claim’ where you can detach the environmental attribute from the product and this environmental attribute is certified and linked to proof of sustainability. You can invest in those attributes and account for them via the [IATA] SAF Registry.

It’s a seamless system that allows producers to transfer the attributes to the airline in an immutable way via the system. The airline can then decide how to reduce its offset obligation via CORSIA and put it in front of the state.

At the moment, there are clusters of SAF [production] happening in North America and in Europe, and also starting now in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, but there are still areas where not much is happening so the book and claim approach really helps. It gives everyone access [to SAF]. In the end it doesn’t matter who actually flies with that SAF; what’s important is that it’s not counted twice. The registry takes care of that.

BTN Europe: There are a large number of emissions calculators and methodologies in the market and these can produce very different estimates and cause confusion for corporates. What sets IATA’s CO2 Connect methodology apart from others?

Michael Schneider: I think the crux of the problem is indeed the proliferation of methodologies and calculators. That is certainly confusing for travellers. We realised early on that this is a major issue not just for passengers but for airlines too. If you’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the latest [fuel-efficient] aircraft and it’s not reflected in a model... then it is not fit for purpose and that’s disappointing for airlines. You want your investment reflected.

As a standard-setting organisation, we understood the problem early on. In 2016 we finalised a cargo emissions methodology and that was followed by the standard on the passenger side and here we needed to involve not only the airlines but other organisations too, such as the ISO [International Organization for Standardization]. But the difference here – and is what we strongly advocate for and it’s super important – is the use of primary data.

A lot of calculators out there use data that is based on modelled information that is often outdated and provides a crude look. But when looking at a given flight, the load factor is very important. You can have a very fuel-efficient aircraft but if it is half empty then the CO2 emissions per passenger are very high. So you need good load factor information and you need the fuel burn information, and you need to calculate the fuel consumption in a standardised way.

The idea is to have a global approach so that airlines know exactly what they’re measuring – block off, block on times; do I include the auxiliary power unit?; do we include non-revenue passengers? There’s so much detail so you need to have a very, very good understanding and a standardised approach. We need that primary data and it needs to be independently validated.

We have access to all that information and I think that’s our great strength. We are working with the airlines and they understand that we all need to work together to generate a good industry average but can also distinguish between different airlines. If you’ve invested in fleet or in SAF then that should be reflected in the calculation.

Ideally, you would get the same result [an emissions figure] across all methodologies but that is not the case at the moment. But we feel this one [CO2 Connect] is being developed by the airlines for the airlines, and for their customers, and that this is the right approach because it offers the great advantage of primary data and that is absolutely critical.

BTN Europe: How many member airlines participate currently?

Michael Schneider: Around 70 airlines have contributed fuel burn data and more than 150 have contributed operational data, meaning load factor information. We have a big target this year – we want to hit 100. I think it’s feasible; we have good traction now at alliance level. Given the time spent on this project until now, it’s been a very good result.

BTN Europe: What’s preventing more airlines from participating?

Michael Schneider: In general, airlines have always been reluctant to share sensitive data and this is extremely commercially sensitive data because it’s fuel burn information and it’s about load factor. These tell you exactly how well or how badly an airline is performing. It requires some consideration and persuasion... more and more airlines are ready to take that step.

I think a lot of airlines realise customers want emissions transparency. There is an expectation among people and especially among businesses. They need to understand what the impact of taking a flight is even more so on the corporate side. They have targets and they need to understand if they’re hitting those and how they can maybe reduce some of their impact from flying. Companies are becoming very selective in their choice of airline and they cannot do this unless they have the right data in front of them.

BTN Europe: IATA is pro-aviation expansion and you laud passenger growth and airline performance. How do you balance that with the urgent need decarbonise? That’s a difficult balancing act.

Michael Schneider: Absolutely right. In the big scheme of things we certainly contribute to global emissions – around 2.5 to 2.7 per cent – but if we want a licence to grow we must have concrete plans [to decarbonise]. Those plans are reflected in the roadmaps we have in place about what we think the solutions are.

But we should not lose sight of the benefits of aviation. There are 100 million jobs indirectly linked to the industry – it’s the guy who drives people to the airport or the small shop at the airport. It’s also small island states and countries that rely on tourism. It’s critical for them and it delivers huge value, but of course we must reduce our impact.

I love aviation and fully understand its impact and how in particular the younger generation might be concerned about flying, but they get value [from it] – it allows them to study abroad, to visit other places. No other sector delivers those benefits. It’s easy to say we should just stop flying but that would have such a huge impact on this world. It is a humongous task that we have in front of us but I’m still hopeful we can reach our targets and reduce emissions as planned by 2050.

BTN Europe: You alluded to it earlier, but will the cost of SAF and of sustainability efforts in general, get passed down to passengers in the form of higher fares?

Michael Schneider: Airlines have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – an effort that is expected to cost $4.7 trillion over the period 2024 from 2050. So yes, this is likely to impact airfares. However, this investment will ensure that aviation can deliver its direct contribution of 3.9 per cent of global GDP and 86.5 million jobs globally while addressing its estimated 2.5 per cent share of global carbon emissions.*

BTN Europe: Some governments are clamping down on domestic flights where rail services exist. Do you agree that makes good sense for the environment?

Michael Schneider: Multimodality is important and could be part of the answer but it is a very European discussion as we have a very well-developed train network. In the European context, there are opportunities that could be explored – for anything below 500km I think it makes sense to rely on what’s there [in terms of rail infrastructure]. We all need to work together where it makes sense.

BTN Europe: Every so often we see talk of frequent flyer taxes or, most recently, a premium flyer tax, where funds raised could be invested in sustainability initiatives. What are your thoughts on those?

Michael Schneider: The Global Solidarity Levies Task Force’s (GSLTF) proposal disregards the role of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which was agreed through the International Civil Aviation Organization and is the world’s first globally agreed mechanism to manage carbon emissions from an industrial sector – in this case international aviation.

In addition, the GSLTF has not released any assessment of the impact that such a levy would have on the economies of the very states to which it aims to funnel the funds, or the broader impact it will have on all travellers. It has also not detailed how such funds would be used. *

Belo Horizonte International Airport

Robson Freitas has developed and led the BH Airport plan for the resumption of airport operations post-COVID-19, as well as being responsible for leading the group of Directors and Managers at the airport, defining the three main pillars of recovery: Health and Safety of People, Institutional and Integrated Communication and Institutional Partners. These central pillars include ensuring hygiene and health and social distances measures for passengers, users, and the airport community, in addition to participating in strategic committees involving the public sectors to comply with regulatory rules. Freitas developed the COVID guardians programme, who were responsible in monitoring and following up on the measures already implemented for COVID-19 and advising users, employees and other people on compliance with distancing, hygiene and health measures recommended by health authorities. He also developed a COVID booklet with information and guidance for the airport community regarding good hygiene and health practices and led the beginning of the publication of a monthly newsletter with passenger curve information, allowing the planning of reopening and rehiring by commercial stores. Freitas also supported the reduction of OPEX by planning the temporary closure of areas, toilets and equipment in common use and internalising some activities.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

With over three decades at Zurich Airport, Emanuel Fleuti has witnessed the evolution of sustainability from a fringe concern to a core strategic pillar. As the airport’s long-serving environmental lead, he brings continuity, context and conviction to Zurich’s decarbonisation journey. He shares more with Holly Miles.

Zurich Airport’s (ZHR) environmental strategy centres on eliminating unnecessary combustion processes across the airfield. “We have fixed ground power and pre-conditioned air for aircraft, and we have battery-powered GSE and vehicles to reduce the combustion emissions,” says Emmanuel.

One of Zurich’s boldest moves, however, dates back to the mid 1990s, when it introduced an emission-related landing fee. “Aircraft that did not have the latest engine technology had to pay more on a surcharge,” he explains. “That motivated not just the airlines, but also the engine manufacturers to redesign engines and come up with cleaner technologies.”

This was a progressive move back then, as the idea of polluter-pays pricing was not widespread in aviation at the time.

“That was probably the most important initiative we took in addition to mandating the use of our TCA and 400 hertz systems that we have, which meant in return, a restriction on the use of auxiliary power units. “

While in the beginning around 50% of airlines were paying an additional surcharge, now most aircraft meet modern standards, however the principle remains. “Even the most modern aircraft still emit, so they still have to pay a little bit.”

Driving the energy transition

Zurich has committed to a master plan for energy and infrastructure decarbonisation, focusing on both consumption and production. “First, we reduce energy use on the consumer side with appliances, infrastructure, heating and cooling demand. Then we improve production with renewable energy,” says Emmanuel. “We’re switching to geothermal ground heat with heat pumps and photovoltaic plants to produce electricity.”

As of 2025, the airport is purchasing 100% renewable electricity. On the heat side, around 20% is currently sourced from renewables, with plans for continued expansion.

Crucially, Emmanuel says the economics make sense. “The upfront initial costs are going into changing fossil energy production to geothermal or heat pumps. But over time, we’ll save energy on the operational side.”

Backing breakthrough fuels

With long-haul aircraft dominating Zurich’s traffic profile, Emmanuel is realistic about the limitations of electrification and hydrogen at his airport. Instead, Zurich Airport is taking a pioneering role in backing breakthrough technologies such as solar fuels.

“We think that sustainable aviation fuels will be key for the airport’s decarbonisation. Long-haul aircraft can only fly with drop-in fuels such as SAF.”

“We are supporting the new solar-to-liquid technology. It’s a start-up company here in Switzerland,” he says. “In the new plant, Jet A1 aviation kerosene will be produced, but also diesel for trucks and petrol for cars. We’ve gone into an offtake agreement to take some of the diesel.”

Tackling scope 3 emissions

Zurich is taking a multi-pronged approach to Scope 3 emissions, from electrifying handling equipment to influencing staff travel habits.

“We are looking at ground handlers: how can we support them in their electrification process? How can we provide electric charging stations?” Emanuel says. On the staff side, Zurich offers public transport passes and encourages home working where feasible.

“Of course, not all jobs are suitable,” he acknowledges. “But if someone only commutes to work by car four days instead of five, that’s a 20% reduction.”

Electrifying the fleet

At the end of 2024, Zurich put its first electrically powered waste collection vehicle into operation. Zurich has a roadmap to reach net zero for its vehicle fleet by 2040. But it’s not always straightforward.

“We cannot accelerate this too fast because the technology has to evolve first. The main obstacle is the availability of the required vehicle types,” says Emanuel. “We’ve started with electric trucks, but snowploughs, for example, may need much longer endurance than what batteries can hold. So, we can only go as fast as suppliers can provide this technology, as it is not off-the-shelf. That’s why we’re also going into synthetic diesel to power those vehicles that cannot run on battery.”

Designing for the future

The airport is also preparing for the realities of climate change.

“Futureproofing for us is thinking ahead in longer terms, in 15 to 25 years,” says Emanuel. “It is about climate change, biodiversity and energy usage. Do we have enough sunlight? Yes, we do. Do we have enough technology to use it? No, we don’t. We need to bridge that gap.”

Juli 2025 hat die weltweite Passagierluftfahrt einen absoluten Rekordwert beim CO₂-Ausstoß erreicht. Mit 2523 Tonnen Kohlenstoffdioxid lag der Wert knapp über den 2520 Tonnen vom 2. August 2019. Allerdings waren dafür aktuell 103.009 Flüge verantwortlich, während es damals 99.327 waren. Sprich: Im Durchschnitt ist jeder einzelne Flug weniger klimaschädlich, aber es gibt fast vier Prozent mehr Flüge. Das zeigen Daten des Luftfahrt-Analyse-Anbieters Cirium.

Und der hat auch die Airlines unter die Lupe genommen. Er wählte als Einheit den CO₂-Ausstoß geteilt durch die angebotenen Sitzplatzkilometer (im Englischen Available Seat Kilometers, kurz ASK). Der wird berechnet, indem man die Zahl der verfügbaren Sitze mit den zurückgelegten Kilometern multipliziert.

Wizz Air lässt alle anderen Fluggesellschaften hinter sich

Das Ergebnis: Wizz Air erreichte im Jahr 2024 einen Wert von 53,9 Gramm CO₂ pro Sitzplatzkilometer - und ist damit die weltweite Nummer eins mit dem niedrigsten Wert von 100 untersuchten Fluglinien. Das erreichte der ungarische Billigflieger 222 Sitzen pro Flugzeug, einem Flottenalter von 5,1 Jahren und einer Streckenlänge von 1551 Kilometern, alles im Durchschnitt (siehe auch Tabelle).

Den globalen Platz zwei nimmt Frontier Airlines aus den USA ein mit 54,4 Gramm CO₂/ASK, Rang drei sichert sich die türkische Pegasus mit 57,1 Gramm. Auf Platz 20 in der Gesamtwertung liegt Ryanair mit 63,0 Gramm. Unter den zehn größten Airlines der Welt (gemessen nach Sitzplatzkilometer) erzielt die irische Airline damit sogar den besten Wert, gefolgt von Southwest Airlines (68,9) und Delta Air Lines (74,4).

Wichtigster Faktor: dichte Bestuhlung des Flugzeugs

Im regionalen Ranking für Westeuropa platziert sich auf Rang zwei hinter Wizz Air die portugiesische Azores Airlines (61,4). Auf Platz drei folgt die griechische Aegean (61,6).

Die Verwendung von nachhaltigem Flugkraftstoff, im Jargon SAF (die Abkürzung steht für Sustainable Aviation Fuel) genannt, hat Cirium in der Analyse noch nicht berücksichtigt. Das Analyseunternehmen verweist darauf, dass die derzeitige SAF-Produktion erst 0,53 Prozent des weltweiten Kraftstoffbedarfs abdeckt. «Die umweltfreundlichsten Fluggesellschaften sind womöglich diejenigen, die mutig genug sind, die Anzahl der Passagiere in einem Flugzeug zu überdenken», so Mike Malik von Cirium. Neben dem Faktor der dichten Bestuhlung sei das Flottenalter wichtig sowie die Flugplan- und Streckenplanung.

Ein Airbus A330-900 mit 459 Plätzen ist Spitzenreiter

Bei der Betrachtung einzelner Flugzeugmodelle von einzelnen Fluglinien ist auch ein neues Modell mit einer dichten Bestuhlung ganz vorn: der Airbus A330-900 von Cebu Pacific mit einer reinen Economy-Class-Bestuhlung mit 459 Plätzen. Es folgen mit der Boeing 787-8 von Jetstar und der Boeing 787-9 von Scoot zwei weitere neue Modelle. Dahinter platzieren sich aber auch etliche ältere Modelle wie beispielsweise der Airbus A319 von Allegiant Air. Diesen Teil der Untersuchung hat Cirium mit Daten aus der ersten Jahreshälfte 2025 durchgeführt.

Einen Punkt nennt Cirium nicht explizit, obwohl er in einer der Ranglisten eine wichtige Rolle spielt: die geringere Umweltbelastung von Turbopropantrieben gegenüber Jettriebwerken. Denn es gibt auch eine Analyse für einzelne Routen, aufgeteilt in Kurz-, Mittel- und Langstrecken. Dabei geht es um die größten Verbesserungen von 2023 auf 2024.

Austrian Airlines auf Platz eins - dank ATR 72 von Braathens

Und bei den Kurzstrecken auf Platz eins liegt die Austrian-Airlines-Route zwischen Wien und Klagenfurt. Ihr CO₂ pro Sitzplatzkilometer-Wert ist um 29,7 Prozent gesunken. Statt den eigenen Embraer E195 setzt die Lufthansa-Tochter auf der Strecke mittlerweile nämlich die ATR 72 von Braathens ein.

Mit einer Verbesserung von 27,1 Prozent steht auf Platz zwei die Verbindung zwischen Belo Horizonte-Confins und Ilhéus von Azul.

RSI Oversold: Internal diagnostic score 6.62 — neutral with a better track record than WR.","Market Snapshot

Takeaway:

(CTAS) faces a weak technical outlook amid mixed analyst views and solid fundamentals. Investors are advised to proceed with caution.

News Highlights

Recent news affecting the broader market includes developments in the fuel ethanol industry, where new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology is boosting commercial viability. This could indirectly benefit Cintas if demand for industrial services in energy and logistics grows. Additionally, a report highlights that assets in the ETF industry across Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) have hit a record high of $1.25 trillion. While not directly tied to Cintas, this reflects increased market participation and liquidity that may influence investor sentiment.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The market is divided when it comes to Cintas. The simple average analyst rating is 3.00, while the weighted rating—factoring in historical performance—is 4.30. These scores suggest a generally neutral to optimistic view, though the current price trend is negative (-3.65%), creating a mismatch between analyst expectations and actual price movement.

Return on Assets (ROA): 4.79%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Net Income / Revenue: 55.86%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Return on Equity (ROE): 10.45%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 17.51%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Diluted Earnings Per Share (YoY): 19.67%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

The strong fundamentals suggest Cintas is performing well on operational and earnings metrics, but technical indicators remain bearish. Investors should watch for alignment or divergence between these two signals in the coming weeks.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows into Cintas show a complex picture. While overall inflow ratio is 55.90% (a positive sign), the breakdown reveals that small investors are net sellers (trend: negative). In contrast, large and extra-large investors are net buyers, with block inflow ratio at 56.65% and extra-large inflow ratio at 62.30%. This suggests institutional confidence in the stock despite retail caution.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Cintas is struggling. The technical score is 3.94, indicating a weak signal with a bearish bias. Here’s how the key indicators stack up:

Williams %R (WR) Oversold: Internal diagnostic score 3.73 — suggesting a neutral rise with mixed historical returns.

Bearish Engulfing: Internal diagnostic score 1.47 — a strong bearish signal with a 36.36% win rate.

RSI Oversold: Internal diagnostic score 6.62 — neutral with a better track record than WR.

In the last five days, the Bearish Engulfing and WR Oversold patterns appeared most frequently. These signals confirm a dominant bearish trend (2 bearish vs 0 bullish indicators). Investors should be cautious about short-term volatility and consider avoiding or hedging long positions until a clearer trend emerges.

""We must acknowledge that the country still doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for building a real aviation industry,"" he emphasized.
The call for an aviation industry blueprint Uong Viet Dung, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, noted that Vietnam now has 14 commercial and specialized airlines operating 254 aircraft.
Vietnam’s low labor costs, ongoing shifts in the global aviation supply chain, and the rise of green aviation technology, sustainable fuels, and workforce training offer strategic advantages.
""Vietnam needs to define its aviation industry and short-term development strategies, while forming aviation and logistics centers,"" he said.","At the roundtable conference “From Aspiration to Opportunity in Developing the Aviation Industry” held last week at the National Exhibition Center, Tran Hai Dang, CEO of Aviation Engineering Services Corporation (AESC), said Vietnam possesses significant advantages - strategic location, skilled technical labor, and an attractive investment climate - that position it well for deeper integration into the global aviation supply chain.

Despite this, Dang admitted Vietnam’s role in the aviation industry remains ""modest and unclear."" While a few domestic companies have started manufacturing airframe components and conducting engine testing, their output is minimal and insufficient to build a complete aviation ecosystem.

Currently, only about five Vietnamese companies are producing limited airframe parts. In engine manufacturing, only an initial testing program exists. And in vital sectors such as aviation electronics, materials, rubber, or specialized coatings, Vietnamese firms are nearly absent.

More critically, Dang pointed out that Vietnam lacks a unified national program for aircraft development. Only scattered initiatives exist, without a cohesive strategy. ""We must acknowledge that the country still doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for building a real aviation industry,"" he emphasized.

Lagging in MRO and infrastructure

In aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), Vietnam has only two key facilities - Vietnam Airlines and AESC. Other players remain small-scale, operating without the infrastructure or credentials required for true MRO status. These were market-driven developments rather than the result of national planning.

Dang noted that Vietnam's industry continues to focus heavily on basic manufacturing, neglecting infrastructure and technology investment. Without change, Vietnam will remain stuck in low-value segments and be unable to join the global supply chain.

One stark example: Vietnam cannot yet produce a bolt worth $100 used on commercial aircraft wheels - a component that could feasibly be manufactured with a $3–4 million USD investment in facilities. “It’s not about capability - it’s about commitment,” Dang said.

Certification remains a major barrier

To participate meaningfully in global aviation, Vietnamese companies need certification from major regulatory bodies, including IATA, FAA (US), EASA (Europe), and AS9100. However, Dang cautioned that securing such credentials is costly, time-consuming, and offers uncertain returns on investment.

He proposed a collaborative ecosystem, where domestic aviation businesses pool resources, share certifications, and avoid redundant competition. ""We need a national aircraft development program with a core nucleus and a satellite network of supporting enterprises,"" he urged.

The call for an aviation industry blueprint

Uong Viet Dung, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, noted that Vietnam now has 14 commercial and specialized airlines operating 254 aircraft. This figure is projected to reach 400 modern planes by 2030. Vietnam’s aviation network includes 52 domestic routes and 211 international routes, fueling robust demand and creating opportunities for local manufacturing and supply.

Vietnam’s low labor costs, ongoing shifts in the global aviation supply chain, and the rise of green aviation technology, sustainable fuels, and workforce training offer strategic advantages. According to Dung, these can support Vietnam in becoming a major aviation hub in the region.

""Vietnam needs to define its aviation industry and short-term development strategies, while forming aviation and logistics centers,"" he said. ""We should aim to integrate into global OEMs like Boeing and Airbus, and one day, realize the dream of a 'Made-in-Vietnam' aircraft.""

National innovation agency calls for coordinated action

A representative from the National Innovation Center (NIC) emphasized the need for a comprehensive aerospace industry strategy, including improved coordination between government agencies and businesses, and greater investment in R&D and infrastructure.

Other proposals included:

Developing incentive policies to attract investment

The new guidelines will also help member states implement the Critical Entities Resilience Directive designed to develop national strategies, conduct regular risk assessments, and identify critical entities. These critical entities must then take technical, security and organisational measures to assure their resilience.

Threats to critical infrastructure, including hybrid threats like sabotage and malicious cyber activity, are a major concern in the EU, notably for the infrastructure that connects Member States. As highlighted in the European Internal Security Strategy, ProtectEU, it is essential for all Member States to promptly and correctly implement the Critical Entities Resilience Directive. This will help ensure that essential services, key to societal welfare and economic activities, are well protected from external threats such as natural hazards, terrorist attacks, and public health emergencies.

Member states can receive funding for the protection of critical infrastructure under the EU's €1.93 billion Internal Security fund (2021-2027). More than €2.7 million has also been made available to member states to support the investigations of incidents as emergency funding under ISF. The Commission has also proposed to triple funds for internal security in the EU 2028-2034 budget.

The Commission continues to support the security and preparedness of member states, including through enhanced information exchange, new detection technologies, repair capabilities, international cooperation, and funding under the Internal Security Fund.

More information on the guidelines is available online.

Deloitte Nederland heeft over het boekjaar 2024/2025 een omzet gerealiseerd van € 1,41 miljard, een groei van 1,2 procent ten opzichte van het voorgaande boekjaar. Door strikter kostenbeheer en operationele efficiëntie kwam het operationeel resultaat ruim 15 procent hoger uit op € 202,1 miljoen, tegenover € 175,3 miljoen in 2023/2024. Het aantal medewerkers daalde tegelijk van 8.200 naar 7.700.

Dat blijkt uit het Integrated Annual Report van Deloitte Nederland. Volgens ceo Hans Honig is ervoor gekozen om ""strikt op kostenreductie te sturen"" en tegelijk te investeren in innovatie, technologie en talent. ""Zo breidden we het gebruik van ons mondiale technologie platformen voor al onze business lines uit en zetten we vol door in gebruik van AI oplossingen in onze dienstverlening."" Deloitte ziet klantvragen steeds meer verschuiven naar ""complete technologisch gedreven business transformaties"".

Examenfraude

Het interne onderzoek naar examenfraude, door Deloitte omschreven als ""het delen van antwoorden voor verplichte leeractiviteiten en de leercultuur"", is afgelopen boekjaar afgesloten met een schikking bij de PCAOB. In juni jl. werd bekend dat Deloitte de Amerikaanse toezichthouder een bedrag heeft betaald van drie miljoen dollar.

""De uitkomsten van het onderzoek naar onze leercultuur waren teleurstellend en weerspiegelen niet wie wij zijn als organisatie en de waarden die wij nastreven."" aldus Honig. ""Met het afronden van het onderzoek en de schikking kunnen we onze aandacht richten op verdere verbeteringen, het onderstreept onze inzet om het vertrouwen van onze klanten en andere stakeholders te versterken.""

Voetafdruk

Deloitte Nederland verkleinde naar eigen zeggen haar CO₂-voetafdruk met 13 procent (marktgebaseerd). Doel is om eind 2025 een volledig electrisch leasewagenpark te hebben.

Via de Deloitte Impact Foundation droegen ruim 1.100 medewerkers in totaal 31.158 pro bono uren bij aan projecten op het gebied van financiële gezondheid, onderwijs en inclusie; onder meer via de Nationale Money Exam, de Nationale Coalitie Financiële Gezondheid, Sustainable Aviation Fuel–Roadmap en lokale samenwerkingen met Nibud en Tilburg University.

Minder medewerkers

Het aantal medewerkers van Deloitte Nederland is met circa 6 procent gedaald, van zo'n 8.200 naar ongeveer 7.700 mensen. Dat is volgens Deloitte een gevolg van veranderende klantvraag, automatisering, internationalisering en natuurlijk verloop. Wel zijn ongeveer duizend medewerkers aangenomen om de ""groei en innovatie te blijven ondersteunen"".

Topic: Interior of the earth

Q1. Plate boundaries are theatres of both catastrophe and creation. How do they simultaneously account for the destructive forces of earthquakes and the constructive potential of volcanic landscapes? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: InsightsIAS

Why the question

To test conceptual clarity on plate tectonics, their paradoxical role in shaping the earth’s surface, and the ability to link hazards like earthquakes with constructive features like fertile soils and volcanic landforms.

Key Demand of the question

The answer must evaluate how plate boundaries embody both destruction and creation, and explain with examples how they account for the dual realities of earthquakes and volcanic landscapes.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Define plate boundaries as dynamic zones of tectonic activity that represent both risk and renewal.

Body

Plate boundaries as paradoxical theatres – explain their dual role with geological processes and settlement patterns.

Destructive forces of earthquakes – highlight mechanisms, impacts, and examples of boundary-linked seismicity.

Constructive potential of volcanic landscapes – show fertility, resources, energy, and socio-economic benefits linked to volcanism.

Conclusion

End with the duality of plate boundaries as both threats and opportunities, stressing disaster resilience and sustainable use.

Introduction

Plate boundaries are the most active zones of lithospheric interaction, where immense tectonic forces unleash catastrophic disasters yet simultaneously build fertile and resource-rich landscapes. They reveal the paradox of nature as both a destroyer and a creator of human opportunities.

Body

Plate boundaries as theatres of both catastrophe and creation

Dynamic tectonic activity: Boundaries are hotspots for mountain building, ocean trench formation, volcanism, and seismicity, combining destructive and creative processes in the same space.

Eg: The Himalayas, created by the collision of Indian and Eurasian plates, exemplify majestic uplift but also host devastating quakes like Nepal 2015.

Redistribution of resources and hazards: Magmatic activity enriches land with minerals, soils, and geothermal energy, even as seismic instability threatens long-term human settlements.

Eg: Pacific Ring of Fire, with its vast gold–copper deposits, is simultaneously the site of 90% of global earthquakes.

Continuous reshaping of landscapes: Divergent and convergent boundaries constantly create new islands, rift valleys, and trenches, but such changes often come with destructive hazards.

Eg: East African Rift Valley is splitting Africa and forming a proto-ocean, yet recurrent tremors displace local communities.

Human–environment paradox: Rich resources and fertile soils attract dense populations to these boundaries despite recurrent natural calamities.

Eg: Java island, Indonesia, sustains over 140 million people due to fertile volcanic soils but also faces eruptions like Mount Merapi in 2010.

Destructive forces of earthquakes

Sudden crustal rupture: Stress accumulation along convergent and transform boundaries results in massive quakes that cause widespread casualties and destruction.

Eg: 2015 Nepal earthquake (M 7.8) killed over 8,000 people and destroyed heritage structures like Kathmandu Durbar Square.

Megathrust subduction events: Oceanic plates diving beneath continental margins generate tsunamigenic earthquakes of unprecedented scale.

Eg: 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake (M 9.1) triggered the Indian Ocean tsunami, killing 230,000 across 14 countries.

Urban vulnerability and poor preparedness: High population density and weak construction norms at plate boundaries magnify disaster impacts.

Eg: 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake caused more than 50,000 deaths largely due to collapsed buildings in urban centres.

Cascading multi-hazards: Earthquakes often trigger landslides, liquefaction, and technological disasters, compounding the destruction.

Eg: 2011 Tōhoku earthquake (M 9.0) not only caused a tsunami but also led to the Fukushima nuclear accident.

Constructive potential of volcanic landscapes

Fertile agricultural soils: Weathering of volcanic rocks releases minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iron, supporting intensive agriculture for centuries.

Eg: Deccan Plateau black soils continue to sustain cotton and soybean cultivation, contributing significantly to India’s farm economy.

Renewable geothermal energy: Heat from magma chambers beneath volcanic zones is harnessed to produce reliable, clean, and low-carbon electricity.

Eg: Iceland generates around 25% of its power from geothermal resources, reducing fossil fuel dependence.

Mineral and ore wealth: Volcanic processes bring up valuable metals and rare earths essential for modern industries and global supply chains.

Eg: Chile’s Andean volcanic belt accounts for nearly 28% of the world’s copper production, vital for renewable technologies.

Tourism and cultural heritage: Volcanic landscapes create iconic sites that draw tourism, sustain economies, and inspire cultural identity.

Eg: Mount Fuji, Japan, a UNESCO World Heritage site, generates billions annually through religious tourism and eco-tourism.

Conclusion

Plate boundaries embody the creative–destructive duality of Earth’s geology: they devastate societies through quakes yet enrich them through fertile soils, minerals, and energy. With disaster-resilient planning and sustainable resource use, humanity can convert these risky frontiers into engines of long-term prosperity.

Topic: Geomorphic Processes

Q2. Differentiate between endogenic and exogenic processes. Illustrate their combined impact in shaping Himalayan landforms. Analyse how climate change is altering these geomorphic processes today. (15 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: InsightsIAS

Why the question

Himalayan events such as the Joshimath subsidence and South Lhonak GLOF show how internal tectonics, external erosional forces, and climate change combine to shape fragile mountain landscapes.

Key demand of the question

The question asks to differentiate between endogenic and exogenic processes, illustrate their combined role in Himalayan landform development, and analyse the impact of climate change on these geomorphic processes.

Structure of the Answer

Introduction

Start with a brief line on the Himalayas being the youngest fold mountains formed by tectonics, yet constantly reshaped by external denudational forces, now increasingly altered by climate change.

Body

Define and contrast endogenic and exogenic processes, highlighting their forces, nature, and outcomes with suitable Himalayan examples.

Show how their interaction produces distinct Himalayan landforms such as river terraces, gorges, glacial valleys, and sediment transfer to the plains.

Analyse how climate change is intensifying geomorphic processes through glacial retreat, extreme rainfall, GLOFs, and permafrost thaw, using updated recent events.

Conclusion

Conclude with a crisp futuristic note on integrating geomorphic risk mapping and climate-adaptive planning into Himalayan development policies.

Introduction

The Himalayas stand as the most vivid testimony to the interaction of internal tectonic forces and external denudational forces. This makes them not just the tallest mountains but also the most fragile, where climate change has begun to accelerate geomorphic instability.

Body

Endogenic and exogenic processes

Aspect Endogenic processes Exogenic processes 1. Driving force Operate through internal heat and tectonic dynamics, causing mountain uplift, folding and volcanism.

Eg: The 2015 Nepal earthquake uplifted land surfaces, proving ongoing tectonic collision Operate through external agents like water, wind, and ice, wearing down relief and redistributing sediments.

Eg: The 2022 Alaknanda floods eroded slopes rapidly as reported by IIT Roorkee 2. Key landforms Create large-scale features such as fold mountains, faults, and volcanic arcs, altering earth’s crust.

Eg: USGS (2023) noted Himalayan uplift of 5 mm/yr due to Indian–Eurasian plate convergence Produce erosional and depositional landforms such as gorges, terraces, moraines, dunes.

Eg: The Bhagirathi gorge was carved by river incision over thousands of years 3. Timescale Work on long geological time spans, shaping continents and ocean basins.

Eg: Himalayan orogeny has continued for ~50 million years since the Eocene Function on shorter timescales, even seasonal, reshaping landforms more visibly.

Eg: Cloudburst-induced landslides in Himachal Pradesh in 2023 reshaped valleys overnight 4. Nature of impact Primarily constructive, adding elevation, creating relief, and forming new crust.

Eg: Ongoing crustal thickening beneath Nepal Himalaya adds height Primarily destructive, wearing down elevated surfaces and transporting debris.

Eg: Brahmaputra river floods erode banks and shift channels annually (CWC 2021) 5. Methods of study Studied via seismology, geodesy, paleomagnetism, and mantle modelling.

Eg: GPS monitoring in Uttarakhand (WIHG 2022) mapped tectonic strain zones Studied via hydrology, geomorphology, satellite imagery, and climate data.

Eg: ISRO (2021) tracked Himalayan glacier retreat using remote sensing

Combined impact in shaping Himalayan landforms

Steep slopes and slope failure: Continuous tectonic uplift combined with intense erosion produces fragile, over-steepened slopes highly prone to mass wasting.

Eg: Joshimath land subsidence in 2023 demonstrated how uplift plus unregulated drainage destabilised hill slopes.

River terraces and valley incision: Uplifted blocks are cut by Himalayan rivers into stepped terraces, marking interaction of endogenics and fluvial incision.

Eg: Teesta valley terraces in Sikkim show alternating phases of uplift and incision.

Glacio-fluvial landscapes: Endogenic elevation sustains high snowlines while glaciers and rivers carve cirques, moraines, and outwash plains.

Eg: Retreating Gangotri glacier has left morainic ridges and expanding pro-glacial lakes.

Sediment flux to plains: High uplift accelerates erosion, delivering enormous sediment to the Indo-Gangetic plain, enriching soils but also causing instability.

Eg: Brahmaputra’s sediment load ~735 million tonnes annually (CWC 2021) sustains fertile Assam plains but raises flood risks.

Drainage anomalies: Structural control due to uplift forces rivers to cut through ranges, while exogenics modify flow regimes.

Eg: Indus river cutting gorges across Ladakh ranges reflects tectonic uplift modified by glacial-melt erosion.

Impact of climate change on geomorphic processes

Accelerated glacier retreat: Warming reduces glacier mass balance, enhancing moraine collapse and destabilising slopes.

Eg: IPCC AR6 (2021) warned Himalayan glaciers could lose up to 80% volume by 2100, amplifying hazards.

Extreme monsoon erosion: Intensified rainfall increases soil stripping, landslides, and river channel migration.

Eg: 2023 Himachal floods triggered hundreds of landslides, destroying roads and altering river courses.

Permafrost degradation: High-altitude warming thaws frozen ground, releasing rock and debris flows.

Eg: WIHG 2022 study linked Karakoram slope failures to permafrost thawing.

Glacial lake outburst floods: Retreating glaciers create unstable moraine-dammed lakes prone to catastrophic bursts.

Eg: South Lhonak lake GLOF in Sikkim (2023) devastated Teesta valley infrastructure.

Human-climate interaction: Infrastructure projects in fragile terrain amplify climate impacts on geomorphic stability.

Eg: Char Dham highway expansion deepened cracks and landslides during the 2021–22 monsoon season in Uttarakhand.

Conclusion

The Himalayas are shaped by the push of tectonics, the pull of erosion, and the pressure of climate change. A sustainable way forward lies in geomorphic risk mapping, climate-adaptive planning, and resilient infrastructure, balancing development with mountain stability.

Topic: Issues and challenges pertaining to the federal structure, devolution of powers

Q3. “Extending Sixth Schedule to Ladakh may set a precedent for other regions demanding special autonomy”. Do you agree? Substantiate with examples from other tribal autonomy experiments in India. (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: NIE

Why the question

The issue of Ladakh’s demand for Sixth Schedule status has revived debates on asymmetric federalism and its ripple effect on other regions. It links to ongoing questions of tribal autonomy, constitutional design, and Centre–State dynamics.

Key Demand of the question

The question asks you to critically analyse whether granting Sixth Schedule status to Ladakh could become a precedent for other regions, and to substantiate both sides using examples from other tribal autonomy experiments in India.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Start with the idea of India’s asymmetric federalism and how Sixth Schedule was crafted to protect tribal autonomy in the North-East. Mention its relevance to Ladakh.

Body

Arguments why Ladakh extension may set precedent – reference to doctrinal spillover, political bargaining, and examples from Bodoland, Tripura, Meghalaya.

Counter-arguments why precedent fears are overstated – uniqueness of Sixth Schedule, availability of alternatives like PESA/Article 371, and case studies such as Darjeeling Bill withdrawal.

Conclusion

End with a balanced note: while it may become a political reference point, extension will remain selective, contextual, and criteria-based to preserve unity in diversity.

Introduction

India’s federal system embodies asymmetrical arrangements to accommodate diversity, from the Sixth Schedule for the North-East to Article 371 special provisions for frontier states. Any extension of such status to Ladakh is bound to influence debates on autonomy in other regions.

Body

Why it may set a precedent

Doctrinal spillover under Article 244(2): Extending the Sixth Schedule to Ladakh could legitimise demands by other regions seeking legislative and judicial autonomy through Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).

Eg: The Bodoland Territorial Region (2020 Accord) expanded Sixth Schedule powers, setting a precedent for other tribal belts.

Frontier governance template: Success in Ladakh may push other sensitive border regions to claim similar cultural-ecological autonomy.

Eg: Khasi, Garo and Jaintia ADCs (Meghalaya) protect land and forests; tribal groups in Himachal and Uttarakhand may cite this precedent.

Electoral bargaining benchmark: Political parties may cite Ladakh as proof that persistent agitation yields autonomy gains, fuelling fresh movements.

Eg: Tripura’s TTAADC elections repeatedly invoke the powers enjoyed by BTC/BTR to demand enhanced status.

Judicial reinforcement of tribal rights: Supreme Court rulings have favoured stronger protection for tribal land and culture, making Sixth Schedule extension attractive elsewhere.

Eg: Samatha case (1997) and Niyamgiri judgment (2013) upheld tribal land rights and Gram Sabha consent, emboldening autonomy demands.

Financial empowerment of ADCs: Sixth Schedule recognition ensures Finance Commission grants and special Union transfers, incentivising replication.

Eg: 15th Finance Commission allocated funds directly to ADCs in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura.

Why precedent fears are overstated

Sixth Schedule’s unique design: It was crafted specifically for North-Eastern tribes with codified customary laws, not easily replicable elsewhere.

Eg: Mizoram’s Lai, Mara, Chakma ADCs evolved from entrenched tribal institutions; most other regions lack such traditions.

Alternative autonomy mechanisms: Fifth Schedule, PESA 1996, and Article 371 provisions offer tailored protections without invoking the Sixth Schedule.

Eg: Gorkhaland GTA (West Bengal) and Manipur Hill Areas Committee function outside Sixth Schedule.

Parliamentary and political gatekeeping: Any extension requires constitutional amendment and consensus, preventing mechanical replication.

Eg: The 2007 Darjeeling Sixth Schedule Bill was withdrawn due to stakeholder opposition.

Judicial scrutiny of proportionality: Courts ensure autonomy does not dilute the basic structure of federalism, limiting overextension.

Eg: S.R. Bommai (1994) upheld balanced federalism, warning against structural overreach.

Security–governance calibration: The Union tailors autonomy to specific contexts like insurgency, demography, or ecology.

Eg: Nagaland (Art 371A) and Mizoram (Art 371G) safeguard tribal customs without Sixth Schedule expansion.

Conclusion

While Ladakh’s inclusion could serve as a political precedent, constitutional design, parliamentary scrutiny, and available graded alternatives ensure that diffusion remains selective, contextual, and criteria-driven. The challenge is to balance autonomy with national cohesion, ensuring asymmetry strengthens, not fragments, Indian federalism.

Body

India–EU FTA as a test of strategic alignment

Strategic trust-building: A successful FTA signals mutual trust in sensitive areas like data flows and IP protection.

Eg: EU GDPR compliance negotiations have been linked to India’s IT sector exports.

Political signalling: Aligning with the EU showcases India’s willingness to work with liberal democracies amid global polarisation.

Eg: EU Parliament’s support for India–EU ties post-G20 Delhi Summit 2023 demonstrated political convergence.

Balancing China: The FTA offers India an alternative to China-dominated supply chains, enhancing strategic positioning.

Eg: EU shifted textile and pharma sourcing towards India after supply chain shocks during COVID-19.

Security linkages: Trade integration strengthens broader cooperation in defence, counter-terrorism, and maritime security.

Eg: India–Italy Defence Roadmap 2024–28 includes joint naval exercises in the Indo-Pacific.

Climate and sustainability convergence: EU’s emphasis on green economy standards aligns with India’s renewable and net-zero goals.

Eg: EU Green Deal and India’s National Hydrogen Mission (2021) found common ground in clean tech.

Broader implications for India’s global trade strategy

Market diversification: Expands access to high-value EU markets, reducing India’s reliance on the US and Asian partners.

Eg: EU accounted for €120 billion trade with India in 2024, growing at 15% YoY.

Standards leadership: Forces India to align with stringent EU norms in digital, environmental, and labour domains, giving global competitiveness.

Eg: Compliance with EU CBAM (2026) will reshape India’s steel and aluminium exports.

Investment boost: EU FDI can fuel India’s advanced sectors such as EVs, AI, biotech, and defence manufacturing.

Eg: Italy’s Leonardo group announced aerospace investment in India.

Rule-shaping capacity: Positions India as a rule-maker in WTO 2.0 debates on e-commerce and sustainability.

Eg: India and EU jointly submitted proposals in WTO 13th Ministerial.

Strategic autonomy reinforcement: Enhances India’s space to balance relations with US, Russia, and Global South by securing a strong European pillar.

Eg: India’s Voice of Global South Summit (2023) showcased neutrality while EU ties deepened.

Conclusion

The India–EU FTA is both a litmus test of trust with Europe and a gateway for India to shape global trade rules. Its success could redefine India’s journey from being a reactive trading nation to a proactive strategic economic power.

Topic: Upstream and downstream requirements, supply chain management.

Q5. “Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms.” Examine the challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system. Discuss how farmer cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) can strengthen the value chain. (15 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: TH

Why the question

Horticulture now surpasses food grain production in India, yet post-harvest losses and weak marketing reduce farmer gains. Current policy shifts emphasise value chain development, making marketing reforms.

Key Demand of the question

The question requires you to establish the importance of marketing reforms vis-à-vis production, identify the challenges in horticultural marketing, and then highlight how farmer cooperatives and FPOs can provide systemic solutions.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Begin with India’s horticultural achievements and the paradox of high output but low farmer income due to marketing inefficiencies.

Body –

Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms: Link to farmer income stability, price discovery, and global competitiveness.

Challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system: Infrastructure gaps, fragmented value chains, regulatory hurdles, grading/quality issues, and financial constraints.

Role of cooperatives and FPOs: Aggregation for bargaining power, collective infrastructure management, direct linkages to markets and exports, branding, and access to institutional finance.

Conclusion

End with the need for a holistic horticulture policy where production, post-harvest management, and marketing move in tandem to ensure inclusive farmer prosperity.

Introduction

India is the world’s second-largest producer of fruits and vegetables, yet post-harvest losses are estimated at ₹50,000 crore annually (NITI Aayog 2023) due to weak marketing and storage. Without robust marketing reforms, production growth cannot translate into farmer income security or consumer affordability.

Body

Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms

Linking surplus to demand: Production gains are futile without channels to reach markets efficiently.

Eg: National Horticulture Board data (2023) shows 25–30% losses in perishables due to marketing bottlenecks.

Price discovery and fair returns: Marketing reforms ensure transparent markets through digital platforms, reducing distress sales.

Eg: e-NAM (2016) integrated over 1,300 mandis for horticultural produce.

Stability against volatility: Reforms like contract farming and futures trading help hedge risks in price-sensitive horticultural crops.

Eg: Model APMC Act (2017) recommended direct marketing and electronic trading.

Export competitiveness: Global markets demand quality and supply consistency, which requires integrated logistics and certification systems.

Eg: India’s mango exports rose after adoption of irradiation and cold-chain compliance (APEDA report, 2022).

Reducing middlemen exploitation: Strengthening marketing reforms reduces farmer dependence on commission agents.

Eg: Swaminathan Commission (2006) emphasised linking farmers directly to consumers.

Challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system

Infrastructure deficit: Lack of packhouses, cold chains, and reefer vans increases wastage and reduces quality.

Eg: ICAR (2022) notes only 10% of perishables use cold chain facilities.

Fragmented value chains: Smallholders face high transaction costs and weak bargaining power.

Eg: Dalwai Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (2018) flagged market fragmentation as a key hurdle.

APMC restrictions: State-level regulations often limit farmers’ ability to sell directly outside mandis.

Eg: Punjab’s horticulture farmers face restrictions in accessing markets beyond APMC yards.

Quality and grading gaps: Lack of standardisation reduces competitiveness in both domestic and export markets.

Eg: FAO (2021) highlighted poor adoption of AGMARK standards in fruits and vegetables.

Limited access to credit and insurance: Marketing investments require credit support, which many farmers lack.

Eg: RBI Report (2023) shows only 16% of horticulture farmers accessed formal credit for marketing infrastructure.

Role of farmer cooperatives and FPOs in strengthening the value chain

Collective bargaining power: Aggregation helps farmers negotiate better prices and reduce exploitation by intermediaries.

Eg: AMUL dairy cooperative model shows how aggregation can transform farmer incomes.

Efficient post-harvest management: FPOs can manage packhouses, grading, cold storage, and logistics collectively.

Eg: Sahyadri FPC in Maharashtra runs India’s largest farmer-led grape export operation.

Market linkages and branding: Cooperatives can establish direct retail chains and export contracts.

Eg: HOPCOMS in Karnataka supplies fresh produce directly to consumers in urban areas.

Capacity building and training: FPOs provide extension services and training in quality, grading, and packaging.

Eg: SFAC-supported FPOs have trained farmers in residue-free vegetable cultivation.

Financial inclusion and investment mobilisation: Cooperatives and FPOs enable access to institutional credit and attract private partnerships.

Eg: 10,000 FPO Scheme (2020) launched by GoI to provide equity grants and credit guarantee.

Conclusion

Without marketing reforms, horticultural growth risks being a surplus trap rather than a prosperity engine. Empowered cooperatives and FPOs can bridge the missing link by integrating farmers into value chains, reducing losses, and enhancing global competitiveness, making Indian horticulture both profitable and sustainable.

Topic: Conservation, environmental pollution

Q6. What are the pollution challenges associated with India’s expanding aviation sector? How effective can sustainable aviation fuel policy be in addressing them? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: DTE

Why the question

Aviation emissions are rising sharply in India, and a national SAF policy is being framed to address both climate and pollution concerns.

Key demand of the question

The candidate must identify the pollution challenges of the aviation sector and then critically evaluate the effectiveness of SAF policy in addressing them.

Structure of the Answer

Introduction

Give a brief context on India’s aviation growth and its link to rising emissions, with reference to Net Zero 2070.

Body

Pollution challenges: Mention carbon emissions, non-CO₂ pollutants, contrails, local air quality concerns, and health impacts.

Effectiveness of SAF policy: Highlight its emission reduction potential, alignment with CORSIA, energy diversification, policy synergies, and trade/export prospects.

Conclusion

Close with a forward-looking line on SAF being a transitional but crucial pathway to green aviation leadership for India.

Introduction

Aviation, though a fast-growing sector in India, contributes disproportionately to GHG emissions and local air pollution, making it a critical area for climate policy intervention.

Body

Pollution challenges of aviation sector

Carbon emissions: Aviation is responsible for around 2-3% of India’s total CO₂ emissions and growing rapidly with passenger demand.

Eg: DGCA report 2023 shows India’s aviation emissions grew by nearly 30% over five years.

Non-CO₂ pollutants: Aircraft release NOx, SOx, and particulate matter, worsening air quality around airports.

Eg: IIT Kanpur 2022 study found elevated PM2.5 levels around Delhi airport due to aviation activity.

High climate forcing: Contrails and water vapour increase radiative forcing, amplifying aviation’s climate impact beyond CO₂.

Eg: IPCC AR6 (2021) highlights non-CO₂ impacts as nearly double the warming effect of CO₂ alone.

Rising fuel dependence: Heavy reliance on fossil-based ATF aggravates energy insecurity and locks in polluting infrastructure.

Eg: India imported 85% of crude oil in 2024 (MoPNG data).

Urban health risks: Expansion of aviation hubs adds to urban air pollution load, increasing health risks for local populations.

Eg: WHO 2023 report flagged higher respiratory illness among communities near large airports globally.

Effectiveness of sustainable aviation fuel policy

Emission reduction potential: SAF can cut 65–80% lifecycle CO₂ emissions compared to ATF if sustainably sourced.

Eg: Deloitte India 2024 report estimated 20–25 MT CO₂ reduction annually by FY40 with SAF.

Compliance with global standards: Supports India’s obligations under CORSIA (mandatory after 2027) and enhances global aviation competitiveness.

Eg: ICAO CORSIA framework requires carbon-neutral growth from 2027.

Energy diversification: SAF reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels and supports domestic ethanol and biomass value chains.

Eg: India’s 18.25 billion litre ethanol capacity (Food Ministry 2025) can partly support SAF blending.

Policy synergy: Alignment with National Biofuel Policy 2018 and incentives under schemes like Gobardhan can boost investment.

Eg: NITI Aayog 2025 consultations proposed SAF reclassification under bioenergy to access subsidies.

Export and trade potential: SAF adoption positions India as a supplier in global markets, aiding energy diplomacy and green trade.

Eg: Brazil and US already benchmarked sugarcane/corn-based SAF under CORSIA, India’s LCA study (TERI 2025) is in progress.

Conclusion

India’s aviation sector risks becoming a significant pollution hotspot, but a comprehensive SAF policy backed by strong incentives and global alignment can transform this challenge into an opportunity for green leadership by 2030.

Q7. Public life demands a higher threshold of accountability than private life. In light of criminal charges against elected representatives, critically examine this statement. How should democratic institutions uphold ethical conduct in politics? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: TH

Why the question

The case of criminal charges against elected representatives raises the issue of higher ethical accountability in politics and the role of institutions in safeguarding democratic values.

Key Demand of the question

The question asks you to critically examine why public life requires greater ethical accountability compared to private life, and to suggest how democratic institutions can uphold ethical conduct in politics.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Briefly highlight why public office carries greater moral responsibility, linking it with trust and legitimacy.

Body –

Explain why public life demands higher ethical standards using ethics frameworks (duty, virtue, social contract, public trust).

Suggest how institutions like judiciary, ECI, political parties, and citizens can strengthen ethical conduct in politics through reforms and transparency.

Conclusion

End with a futuristic note on transforming democracy from legal compliance to moral governance.

Introduction

When entrusted with public office, individuals are not only decision-makers but also moral exemplars. The ethical threshold is higher in public life because lapses here affect not just personal reputation but the collective conscience and democratic trust of society.

Body

Higher threshold of accountability in public life

Deontological ethics: Leaders have a duty-bound responsibility to act rightly irrespective of consequences, as per Kantian principles.

Eg: Mahatma Gandhi’s insistence on moral leadership highlighted politics as an extension of ethics.

Virtue ethics: Citizens expect qualities like integrity, courage, and prudence in their representatives, making private–public standards inherently different.

Eg: Plato’s philosopher-king ideal illustrates that rulers must embody higher virtues.

Public trust doctrine: Holding office creates a fiduciary obligation; betrayal through criminal conduct amounts to moral harm to citizens.

Eg: Justice Krishna Iyer often stressed that public life is a “sacred trust.”

Consequentialist reasoning: The ripple effect of unethical acts in public life is far greater, influencing governance quality and societal morality.

Eg: Nirbhaya case protests (2012) showed how failures of political leadership erode faith in justice.

Social contract ethics: By entering politics, individuals tacitly agree to uphold higher standards as part of the social contract with citizens.

Eg: Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s contract theory highlights that authority rests on moral legitimacy.

Upholding ethical conduct through institutions

Institutional integrity: Election Commission, judiciary, and Parliament must operate with impartiality to safeguard probity in politics.

Eg: SC in Public Interest Foundation (2018) pressed parties to disclose candidates’ criminal backgrounds.

Ethical codes and training: Developing codes of conduct and value-based training for legislators rooted in ethics, not just legal compliance.

Eg: Nolan Committee (UK, 1995) articulated “Seven Principles of Public Life” (integrity, accountability, selflessness).

Transparency and openness: Embedding accountability through RTI and citizen charters aligns with ethical governance values like honesty and openness.

Eg: RTI exposures of MPLADS misuse (2021) demonstrated citizen-driven ethical oversight.

Role of civic virtue: Citizens and civil society must demand ethical politics to create bottom-up pressure on parties and institutions.

Eg: ADR’s electoral awareness campaigns empower voters to reject tainted candidates.

Restorative justice approaches: Ethics in politics must also encourage atonement, remorse, and correction, not only punitive justice.

Eg: Practices like truth and reconciliation commissions globally highlight ethical accountability alongside legal measures.

Conclusion

Ethics in public life is not about avoiding crime but embodying values of integrity, fairness, and justice. Only when institutions and citizens demand higher ethical standards will democracy progress from legal compliance to moral governance.

„Tai svarbus žingsnis aviacijos sektoriaus dekarbonizacijos link. Įtraukdami SAF į komercinį pasiūlymą, suteikiame oro bendrovėms ir keleiviams galimybę rinktis tvaresnes keliones bei kartu prisidėti prie Europos Sąjungos klimato tikslų įgyvendinimo. Tai reiškia, kad nuo rugsėjo vidurio iš Baltijos šalių oro uostų pakilę orlaiviai bus varomi degalais su tvarios kilmės komponentu“, – sako „ORLEN Lietuva“ Vidaus didmeninės prekybos direktorius Tomas Abromavičius.

SAF gaminamas iš atsinaujinančių ar atliekinių žaliavų, tokių kaip naudotas kepimo aliejus, pramonės bei žemės ūkio atliekos. Maišomas su tradiciniais reaktyviniais degalais, jis yra visiškai suderinamas su esamais orlaivių varikliais, todėl oro bendrovės gali jį naudoti iš karto, be papildomų technologinių pokyčių. Naudojant SAF, per visą gyvavimo ciklą CO₂ emisijas galima sumažinti iki 94 proc., palyginti su įprastais aviaciniais degalais.

Šiuo metu ORLEN importuoja SAF komponentus – dalis jų pagaminta Roterdame (Nyderlanduose), kita dalis – Singapūre. 2025 m. yra pirmieji metai, kai SAF Europoje plačiai naudojamas komerciniais tikslais, nebe vien eksperimentinėse programose. Degalais galės naudotis visos oro bendrovės, skraidančios iš Vilniaus, Rygos ir Talino oro uostų.

Pradėjusi tiekti SAF, ORLEN taip pat įgyvendina ES reglamento „ReFuelEU Aviation“ reikalavimus. Pagal jį nuo 2025 m. tvarūs aviaciniai degalai turi sudaryti mažiausiai 2 proc. visų parduodamų aviacinių degalų. Reglamentas taikomas tiems Europos Sąjungos oro uostams, kurie per ankstesnius metus aptarnavo daugiau kaip 800 tūkst. keleivių arba 100 tūkst. tonų krovinių. Ši iniciatyva padeda ruoštis ir tolesniems tikslams – iki 2030 m. SAF dalis turi siekti 6 proc., o iki 2050 m. – net 70 proc.

ORLEN grupė SAF tiekimą pradėjo dar šių metų liepą Varšuvos, Krokuvos ir Katovicų oro uostuose. Tuo pat metu grupė plečia gamybos pajėgumus – Plocko gamykloje, Lenkijoje, statomas hidrintų augalinių aliejų (HVO) įrenginys.

SAF tiekimas yra tik viena iš iniciatyvų, kuriomis ORLEN siekia mažinti aviacijos sektoriaus poveikį aplinkai. Įgyvendindama projektą „HySPARK“ (Hydrogen Solutions for euroPean Airports & Regional Kinetics), bendrovė taip pat planuoja įrengti vandenilio degalinę Varšuvos Šopeno oro uoste. Ji aprūpins vandeniliu nulinių emisijų antžemines transporto priemones, kurios šiame oro uoste bus naudojamos kaip „HySPARK“ projekto dalis.

„ORLEN Lietuva“ jau daugelį metų išlieka didžiausia mokesčių mokėtoja šalyje ir svarbi Lietuvos ekonomikos dalyvė. Nuo 2006 m. ORLEN į Mažeikių gamyklos įsigijimą ir modernizavimą investavo beveik 4,5 mlrd. eurų. Be to, bendrovė valdo svarbiausią žaliavų tiekimo uostą – Būtingės terminalą – bei Mockavos geležinkelio terminalą, užtikrinantį sklandų naftos produktų eksportą.

ORLEN grupė – tai integruota, diversifikuota energetikos bendrovė, įtraukta į prestižinius „Fortune Global 500“ ir „Platts TOP250“ sąrašus. Tai pirmoji bendrovė regione, paskelbusi apie tikslą iki 2050 metų pasiekti klimato neutralumą.

Intimiti Australia, developer of Celys—the world's first certified compostable polyester—has won the Innovate P2X 2025 grant from NSW's Decarbonisation Hub. In partnership with Macquarie University, it will transform end-of-life clothing into Sustainable Aviation Fuel, tackling Australia's low 2 per cent textile recycling rate and advancing circularity in textiles and clean energy.

Australia’s textile footprint highlights the urgency of intervention: 373,000 tonnes of new clothes are imported annually, while 200,000 tonnes of clothing still end up in landfill every year. Despite well-meaning donations, 210,000 tonnes of garments sent to charities or bins often cannot be resold or recycled, leaving the nation with a recycling rate of just 2 percent.

Through Innovate P2X funding and in collaboration with Macquarie University, Intimiti will help reshape the textile value chain by proving that end of life clothing can be reengineered into high value energy solutions. By bridging material innovation with clean energy, the company seeks to demonstrate a scalable model for true circularity where fashion waste is transformed into fuel for a decarbonised future. This breakthrough not only diverts valuable fibres from landfill and reduces microplastic pollution, but also delivers renewable fuel to the aviation sector, one of the hardest industries to decarbonise.

“This initiative is more than innovation, it’s reimagining waste as opportunity,” says Jason, Project Lead at Intimiti Australia. “By valorising waste streams, we’re creating high-impact circularity in textiles and energy industries.”

With Innovate P2X support, Intimiti aims to show that fashion waste can find a second life as clean energy, helping both people and the planet move toward a sustainable future.

Tidak banyak orang yang menduga bahwa minyak jelantah, sisa gorengan dari dapur rumah tangga yang selama ini dianggap limbah, suatu hari bisa mengangkat pesawat komersial melintas langit Nusantara.

ADVERTISEMENT

Pada 20 Agustus 2025, penerbangan rute Jakarta–Bali mencatat sejarah untuk pertama kalinya di Asia Tenggara, pesawat komersial mengudara menggunakan campuran bahan bakar avtur terbarukan berbasis minyak jelantah, atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), yang diproduksi di kilang Pertamina Cilacap.

Pencapaian ini tentu patut diapresiasi karena menunjukkan bahwa inovasi teknologi energi terbarukan telah sampai pada tahap nyata, bukan sekadar wacana di atas kertas atau slogan kampanye hijau.

Namun, di balik euforia keberhasilan itu, ada pertanyaan yang jauh lebih besar dan mendesak untuk dijawab bersama: apakah minyak jelantah benar-benar akan menjadi energi rakyat yang inklusif, atau justru berubah menjadi bisnis eksklusif yang hanya menguntungkan segelintir elite migas?

Salah satu daya tarik utama dari kisah penerbangan perdana dengan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah adalah kesederhanaan simbol yang terkandung di dalamnya.

ADVERTISEMENT

Minyak jelantah, yang sehari-hari hanya kita kenal sebagai sisa penggorengan yang berbau tengik kerap dibuang begitu saja ke selokan atau dijual murah ke pengepul ternyata dapat menjelma menjadi energi bersih yang mendorong mesin jet melintasi udara.

Simbol ini penting karena menunjukkan bahwa transisi energi bukan hanya soal teknologi canggih yang jauh dari keseharian, melainkan dapat berangkat dari ruang-ruang sederhana yang akrab dengan masyarakat kecil yang ada di dapur rumah tangga dan usaha mikro.

Dengan demikian, keberhasilan penerbangan ini sebenarnya lebih dari sekadar tonggak teknologi, ia juga sebuah ajakan untuk melihat kembali nilai strategis dari limbah yang selama ini terabaikan.

Secara teknis, keunggulan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah memang sulit dibantah. Berbagai penelitian internasional membuktikan bahwa bahan bakar ini mampu menurunkan emisi gas rumah kaca hingga 60–80 persen dibandingkan avtur fosil, dan yang lebih penting, ia dapat digunakan langsung tanpa perlu memodifikasi mesin pesawat atau infrastruktur penerbangan yang sudah ada.

ADVERTISEMENT

Artinya, teknologi sudah siap untuk dipakai, tidak perlu menunggu terobosan baru yang mahal dan memakan waktu lama. Namun, dibalik kesiapan teknologi, pertanyaan fundamental tetap mengemuka di benak penulis siapa yang benar-benar akan menikmati manfaat dari energi baru ini? Apakah rakyat yang dapurnya menyumbangkan jelantah atau justru korporasi besar yang menguasai rantai pasok, kilang, dan pasar penerbangan?

Data Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan (KLHK) pada 2023 menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia menghasilkan lebih dari 3 juta kiloliter minyak jelantah per tahun. Angka ini menunjukkan potensi luar biasa untuk dijadikan bahan baku energi terbarukan. Tetapi kenyataannya, mayoritas minyak jelantah itu tidak masuk dalam rantai pasok resmi, melainkan bocor ke pasar gelap atau bahkan diekspor secara ilegal.

ADVERTISEMENT

Di sinilah persoalan mendasar dapat dilihat bersama, tanpa tata kelola yang transparan dan insentif yang adil, minyak jelantah berisiko besar hanya menjadi komoditas baru yang diperebutkan kelompok-kelompok pebisnis rente, sementara rakyat sebagai penghasil limbah tetap berada di pinggir cerita. Padahal, jika dikelola dengan baik, potensi ini bisa menjadi fondasi energi rakyat yang menghubungkan transisi energi dengan keadilan sosial.

Bayangkan dengan menggunakan sebuah skema sederhana, apabila setiap tetes minyak jelantah yang disetor oleh ibu rumah tangga atau pedagang gorengan ke rantai pasok resmi akan mendapatkan poin digital atau kupon yang bisa ditukar dengan akses makanan bergizi di dapur komunitas.

Dengan demikian, pengumpulan jelantah tidak hanya menghasilkan energi bersih yang mengangkat pesawat, tetapi juga memperkuat hak atas pangan rakyat kecil. Transisi energi pun tidak lagi menjadi isu teknokratis, melainkan hadir sebagai praktik keadilan sosial yang nyata di tingkat akar rumput.

Dari Pasar Gelap hingga Risiko Greenwashing

Walaupun terlihat sederhana, perjalanan mewujudkan rantai pasok minyak jelantah yang sehat penuh tantangan. Di atas kertas, jumlah jelantah memang melimpah. Namun dalam praktik, rantai pasoknya bisa dikatakan sangat berantakan.

Minyak bekas dapur rumah tangga tersebar dalam volume kecil, cenderung sulit dikumpulkan dan lebih mudah dijual murah kepada pengepul ilegal yang kemudian mengalirkannya ke pasar gelap atau mengekspornya keluar negeri.

Pemerintah memang sudah melarang ekspor minyak jelantah sejak awal 2025, tetapi larangan semata tanpa skema insentif bagi rakyat hanya akan menciptakan pasar gelap baru yang lebih berisiko. Dengan kata lain, kebijakan yang hanya bersifat membatasi tanpa memberikan keuntungan nyata bagi masyarakat berpotensi gagal sejak awal.

ADVERTISEMENT

Di sinilah pentingnya menetapkan harga acuan nasional serta menciptakan insentif langsung bagi rumah tangga dan UMKM. Rakyat harus mendapatkan manfaat ekonomi yang jelas dari menyerahkan minyak jelantah ke rantai pasok resmi. Jika tidak, maka tidak ada alasan rasional bagi masyarakat kecil untuk berpartisipasi, dan rantai pasok SAF akan selalu kalah dari mekanisme pasar gelap.

Selain persoalan bahan baku, ada pula tantangan biaya produksi. Fakta di lapangan menunjukkan bahwa harga SAF saat ini masih dua hingga tiga kali lipat lebih mahal dibandingkan avtur fosil. Tanpa dukungan fiskal berupa pembebasan pajak, subsidi silang hingga integrasi dengan pasar karbon, maskapai penerbangan tentu tidak akan sanggup menanggung beban biaya tersebut.

ADVERTISEMENT

Pertanyaannya kemudian kepada siapa yang akan diuntungkan dari mekanisme insentif ini? Apakah masyarakat kecil sebagai penyetor jelantah akan ikut merasakan manfaat atau insentif hanya akan berputar di lingkaran bisnis besar migas dan maskapai? Pengalaman program biodiesel B30 memberi pelajaran penting bahwa tanpa tata kelola yang ketat, program energi terbarukan bisa dengan mudah tersandera oleh kepentingan korporasi.

Tantangan lain yang tidak kalah penting adalah risiko greenwashing. Transisi energi tidak boleh berhenti pada label “hijau” semata. Ada risiko serius jika bahan baku SAF bergeser dari limbah menuju minyak primer misalnya crude palm oil yang dalam praktiknya bisa memicu deforestasi dan konflik lahan.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lebih jauh lagi, sistem pelacakan digital yang transparan harus dibangun agar setiap tetes jelantah bisa ditelusuri asal-usulnya. Tanpa mekanisme itu, SAF akan rentan disalahgunakan sebagai alat legitimasi hijau yang sesungguhnya abu-abu.

Regulasi, Partisipasi, dan Keberanian Politik

Jika melihat praktik terbaik negara lain, kita bisa menemukan pelajaran berharga. Belanda, misalnya, melalui Bandara Schiphol, mewajibkan pencampuran SAF pada penerbangan internasional sambil memberi insentif pajak untuk produsen.

ADVERTISEMENT

Amerika Serikat bahkan lebih jauh, meluncurkan program Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge dengan target 11 miliar liter SAF pada 2030 lengkap dengan kredit pajak per galon.

Kedua contoh ini menunjukkan hal yang sama yakni keberhasilan tidak hanya bergantung pada kesiapan teknologi, tetapi juga pada konsistensi regulasi, mandat pasar yang jelas dan insentif yang tepat sasaran.

Indonesia bisa mengambil inspirasi dari sana, tetapi yang lebih penting adalah menyesuaikannya dengan konteks kearifan lokal memastikan bahwa manfaat minyak jelantah benar-benar kembali kepada rakyat, bukan hanya ke perusahaan besar yang sudah mapan.

Jika dikelola dengan berani, SAF berbasis minyak jelantah bisa menjadi lebih dari sekadar bahan bakar pesawat. Proses pengolahannya juga menghasilkan diesel terbarukan yang dapat digunakan untuk bus kota, kapal penyeberangan, dan truk logistik.

ADVERTISEMENT

Dengan demikian, minyak jelantah sebenarnya punya potensi untuk menggerakkan seluruh moda transportasi darat, laut, dan udara sekaligus membangun ekonomi sirkular yang sehat. Namun semua itu hanya mungkin jika ada partisipasi kolektif.

Tanpa rakyat sebagai aktor utama, SAF hanya akan berhenti sebagai seremoni elite: sekali terbang untuk kepentingan liputan, lalu menguap tanpa jejak dalam kehidupan sehari-hari.

Penerbangan perdana SAF dari minyak jelantah seharusnya dipahami bukan sekadar sebagai demonstrasi teknologi, melainkan sebagai ujian serius bagi tata kelola energi Indonesia.

Pertanyaannya apakah minyak jelantah akan benar-benar menjadi energi rakyat yang menyehatkan dapur dan menggerakkan transportasi rendah karbon atau ia hanya akan berubah menjadi bisnis elite yang dibungkus jargon hijau? Jawaban dari pertanyaan itu sangat bergantung pada keberanian politik kita.

ADVERTISEMENT

Apakah kita berani menata regulasi secara tegas, memberi insentif langsung kepada rakyat dan memastikan setiap tetes jelantah yang dihasilkan dapur rumah tangga kembali sebagai energi berkeadilan?

Pada akhirnya, transisi energi bukanlah soal teknologi tinggi semata, melainkan soal keberanian untuk menempatkan rakyat sebagai pemilik utama masa depan energi.","https://blue.kumparan.com/image/upload/fl_progressive,fl_lossy,f_jpg,q_auto,w_600,h_315,c_lpad,b_white/g_south,l_og_user_zprw89/co_rgb:ffffff,g_south_west,l_text:Heebo_20_bold:Konten%20dari%20Pengguna%0DRifqi%20Nuril%20Huda,x_140,y_26/01hdb519fsh4acw1j6y4qg6nq1.jpg",N,,2025-09-15 05:58:29.157012

Indonesia dengan kekayaan sumber daya nabati memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) atau bioavtur. Beberapa bahan baku (feedstock) yang potensial untuk produksi SAF seperti minyak sawit, PFAD, POME, minyak jelantah, hingga tandan kosong kelapa sawit.

PASPI Monitor (2025) dalam jurnal berjudul Pengembangan SAF Sawit untuk Langit yang Lebih Hijau mengatakan bahwa Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tetapi juga berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional dengan memanfaatkan keberlimpahan sumber daya lokal. Salah satunya adalah kelapa sawit, termasuk minyak, produk samping (by-product), dan limbah. Berikut ini ulasan mengenai potensi bahan baku SAF yang tersedia di Indonesia.

Minyak Sawit. Minyak sawit menjadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF. Secara kimiawi, asam lemak dari minyak sawit sangat mirip dengan susunan hidrokarbon pada bahan bakar fosil. Asam laurat pada minyak inti sawit dapat diubah menjadi undekana atau bioavtur (PASPI Monitor, 2020; 2025a). Dengan menggunakan teknologi hydro-processed esters and fatty acid (HEFA), asam lemak pada minyak inti sawit dapat diolah menjadi SAF.

Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan (BPDP) melalui program Grant Riset Sawit (GRS) telah memfasilitasi riset inovasi pengembangan bioavtur berbasis minyak sawit (PASPI Monitor, 2025a). Salah satunya riset Reksowardojo et.al. (2022) yang menghasilkan bioavtur sawit dengan blending rate sebesar 2,4 persen (J2.4) yang dapat digunakan untuk bahan bakar pesawat.

Australia’s domestic hydrogen market sits at 500,000 tonnes annually, valued at around $5 billion

Innovators are advancing tech to cut electricity use, removing one of the key barriers for green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel alternatives

Green hydrogen plays have dropped off investors’ ‘what’s hot’ lists this year, but the global demand for hydrogen still holds tonne-loads of potential. A market worth more than US$200 billion exists in heavy but hard to abate industries – and Australian innovators are finding new ways to make the numbers work.

Under the radar of many investors is an existing hydrogen market worth at least US$200 (A$306) billion globally. Most of the demand for the ~100 million tonnes consumed annually comes from essential but infamously hard to abate industries.

Australia has a 500,000-tonne-a-year hydrogen market - worth up to approximately $5 billion - which fuels the key sectors of steelmaking, fertiliser and chemical production, and refining.

While a lot of people think of all hydrogen as clean and green, the vast majority used by industry is grey or black – produced from gas or coal – and those varieties release millions of tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere each year.

Replacing fossil-fuel hydrogen with zero-emissions green hydrogen - produced using wind or solar power - could deliver some of the most immediate and bankable emissions cuts for corporations and governments scrambling to reach emissions targets.

Bankable market

For investors, the real hydrogen play is not just about futuristic cars or headline-grabbing export projects, it’s the massive and stable market for clean industrial feedstock.

More than 60 governments worldwide have adopted hydrogen strategies, and the focus, especially in Europe and Asia, is on low-emissions hydrogen. Billions of euros, yen and Korean won are being invested in R&D, subsidy programs and demonstration plants.

The climate solution green hydrogen offers may be clear, but its cost has been a major challenge. That’s because producing green hydrogen via the standard electrolysis method still requires substantial amounts of clean electricity.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that low-emissions hydrogen currently plays only a marginal role, with production of less than 1 million tonnes per annum - or one per cent of the global market. But, unlocking more cost-effective green hydrogen would lead to an exponential increase in its use.

Australian innovation can shift balance

Eyeing the huge opportunities for game-changing technology, Australian innovators are advancing projects across key sectors including alumina refining and steel production; shipping, aviation and other fuels; and fertiliser production via green ammonia.

Made by combining green hydrogen with nitrogen, green ammonia offers an immediate and high-impact opportunity to decarbonise the fertiliser industry. Additionally, green ammonia can be used as a zero-carbon fuel in the shipping industry - with potential uses as an export fuel.

The green ammonia market is projected to grow from US$407 million in 2024 to US$44,299 million by 2032, an eye-popping compound average growth rate of almost 80 per cent. Australia’s neighbours and close trading partners in Asia and the Pacific dominate the global market with a share of almost 66 per cent, according to Fortune Business Insights.

Green hydrogen projects in Australia are targeting our key sectors including fertiliser production for agriculture, plus steel and fuel.

One company that’s a frontrunner in cracking this industrial-scale market is Hadean Energy, a start-up spun out of CSIRO research. Its tubular Solid Oxide Electrolyser (tSOE) technology uses up to 30 per cent less electricity than conventional proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers.

This efficiency edge, combined with the use of industrial waste heat and avoidance of rare and expensive metals, means Hadean’s system can produce hydrogen – and syngas for e-fuels – at significantly lower costs than incumbent green hydrogen technologies.

Additionally, amid the well-publicised gas price rises, grey hydrogen is becoming more expensive, shifting the viability dial towards the green alternative.

Adding to the benefits of its transformative tech, Hadean’s modular units can be made ready for easy integration at industrial sites.

The company has already successfully completed a 1,000-hour industrial trial at BlueScope Steel’s Port Kembla plant, demonstrating it can take the heat of real-world applications.

It’s also earned a spot as a Shell-backed New Energy Challenge 2025 finalist, which puts it on the radar of major energy players.

Another boost for Hadean is its support from advisory firm RFC Ambrian, which has previously helped guide Chrysos (ASX:C79) and FPR Energy from R&D projects to commercialisation.

Looking to leverage overseas interest, Hadean is collaborating with startup NGV Earth on a pilot-scale plant advancing technology to deliver sustainable aviation fuel that doesn't have the environmental baggage of what’s used today.

Further positioning Hadean’s technology for domestic and international impact, the company will soon deploy a multi-kilowatt demonstration unit as part of the Australia-UK Renewable Hydrogen Innovation Partnerships program.

This program, with high-level government support in both countries, is sharply focused on the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries.

It’s these existing high-emissions yet essential for modern life industries - not the cool cars and shiny new projects - that will propel us towards a decarbonised future.

At the event, he said, ""It will be tough for the farmers to survive only by cultivating pulses or grains.
Nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced liquidation had there been no ethanol, he said.
The production cost of sugar in Brazil is around Rs27 per kg, while the same in Maharashtra is around Rs32-33.
Use of corn for ethanol production, according to him, has helped give a better price to corn — up from Rs1,200 per quintal to Rs2,800 per quintal.","Pune: Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said ethanol has ""saved sugarcane farmers and sugar factories in the state"". Gadkari was speaking at the tenth anniversary of Naam Foundation, an organisation started by actors Makarand Anaspure and Nana Patekar for watershed management and drought mitigation. At the event, he said, ""It will be tough for the farmers to survive only by cultivating pulses or grains. The sugar industry could survive because of ethanol. Now, an alternative to diesel called isobutanol will be produced. We are also planning to develop sustainable aviation fuel using biogas."" The minister also said that sugar is in surplus in the country. Nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced liquidation had there been no ethanol, he said. The production cost of sugar in Brazil is around Rs27 per kg, while the same in Maharashtra is around Rs32-33. Brazil introduces sugar at around Rs30 per kg in the international market, making it more difficult for us to sell our stock, incurring a loss of Rs2-3 per kg. ""So, farmers will have to ensure that they become producers of not only food but also fuel, electricity, aviation, bitumen, and hydrogen. That will make villages rich,"" said Gadkari. Use of corn for ethanol production, according to him, has helped give a better price to corn — up from Rs1,200 per quintal to Rs2,800 per quintal. Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra have benefited from the increased production, said the minister, adding that production has also gone up by three times. This yield is taken thrice a year. Commenting on other issues, Gadkari said, better water supply management is needed in the country to improve the agricultural sector and lives of farmers. ""Politics over usage of river water and river water distribution has created complications. There were around 23 disputes between states about river water distribution. The majority have been resolved,"" he assured. Gadkari also said that if Maharashtra's milk production goes up and irrigation increases by 65%, many agricultural issues will be resolved. In another programme on the same day, Gadkari was awarded by the Geeta Dharma Mandal organisation. While speaking here, he said new-age methods like videos or reels should be used to spread the message of life given by the Bhagavad Geeta. ""It will help youngsters define the real meaning of life as well as politics and its purpose. We need to redefine politics. Instead of the politics of power, it should be more centred around social reforms. The issue in today's political circles is not the difference of opinions, but the lack of opinions,"" he said.

Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.
Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.
""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said.
The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.","Canola producers are entering harvest season with significant uncertainty in the wake of China's latest tariff on Canadian canola.

China, which slapped a 75.8 per cent duty on Canadian canola seed last month, is Canada's largest canola seed importer, with seed exports making up the vast majority — $4 billion — of Canada's $4.9 billion in canola product exports to China in 2024.

This tariff on canola seed, coupled with 100 per cent tariffs on Canadian canola oil and canola meal imposed by China in March, is the cause of much concern among producers across Western Canada.

According to the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, the province is home to 14,000 canola farmers who grow the oilseed crop over 6.6 million acres of farmland, creating a lucrative industry that employs over 40,000 Albertans.

Canola market 'spiraling down'

Alberta Canola director and farmer Christine McKee said she's feeling ""a little bit of panic"" and ""a lot of frustration"" due to the new tariff.

""Just so much uncertainty,"" said McKee. ""Exporting to China is essential to the canola industry in Canada.""

""There isn't a lot farmers can do. Plans are usually set by now for what we're doing next year. We grow our crops on a rotation basis, and it's not easy to make changes.""

Part of the problem is that uncertainty around the trade situation with China has left producers worried about what they are going to grow for next year, and who they are going to sell it to.

""We need a verbal commitment of financial support in response to these politically-based tariffs,"" McKee said.

Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.

""We're not in a good situation right now,"" he said. ""We've taken a huge hit already, but we don't know how big that hit is going to be.""

Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.

""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said. ""We have a good crop coming, but at the same time … we do depend on these export sales, for places to move it to.""

With approximately 40,000 canola farms nationwide, canola is a major driver of the Canadian economy. The industry contributes an average of $43.7 billion to the national economy annually, and supports over 200,000 jobs across the country, according to the Canola Council of Canada.

The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.

""We have a significant amount of canola supply chain, value chain activity that happens in the Lethbridge region,"" said Trevor Lewington, CEO of Economic Development Lethbridge. ""Those tariffs are likely to slow down access to [the Chinese] market and will force us to think about either new markets, who else can we sell to, or what else can we do.""

Diversifying the market

One possible solution could be to look to the sky to diversify, said Lewington.

""There's growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel,"" he said. ""And so that's something that might not have been considered before, because of course, the focus should be growing food and supplying food to a hungry world.""

""But if that market is no longer interested in our product for food, then perhaps we can shift it to other uses, like aviation.""

As research continues into the use of canola to fuel planes, Lewington said diversification can also come in the form of increasing trade with other markets.

""China certainly is a big market. It's not the only market. We're not entirely dependent on that,"" said Lewington. ""So there is an opportunity, I think, for the canola commissions to do more marketing, to extend the reach into other markets or grow our share in the existing markets that we have.""

In 2024, Canada's total canola exports were valued at $14.5 billion. The United States is the largest customer of canola as a whole, with exports valued at $7.7 billion, followed by China, which is the largest buyer of raw canola seed.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7633730.1757878423!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/fea-canola-20250718.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-14 17:56:09.965274

“Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe”. Voici le titre d’un texte du scientifique David Ho et l’économiste Gernot Wagner que nous traduisons ici avec leur accord.

Ce texte permet de voir le changement climatique sous un autre angle, une autre perspective.

Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe.

Les événements ponctuels comme Deepwater Horizon laissent une impression durable, mais la combustion normale des énergies fossiles a un impact encore plus grave.

La marée noire provoquée par la plateforme Deepwater Horizon dans le golfe du Mexique il y a une douzaine d’années a été une tragédie humaine et environnementale. Elle a coûté la vie à 11 personnes, déversé des millions de barils de pétrole dans le golfe et coûté à BP Plc plus de 65 milliards de dollars en frais de nettoyage et en indemnités.

Mais si tout ce pétrole avait été vendu et utilisé, il aurait été encore plus mortel et dévastateur pour l’environnement.

C’est ce qu’a récemment affirmé le co-auteur de la newsletter d’aujourd’hui, le climatologue David Ho, dans un tweet qui a été largement partagé :

Parfois, je pense au fait que Deepwater Horizon a été une catastrophe environnementale majeure qui a coûté la vie à 11 personnes et plus de 65 milliards de dollars à BP, mais si ce pétrole avait été récupéré, vendu et utilisé, cela aurait été pire pour l’environnement, aurait tué plus de personnes et BP aurait gagné de l’argent.

— David Ho (@david_ho) 28 janvier 2022

Au début, j’étais sceptique (Gernot). Mais le calcul de base est correct, et c’est même probablement sous-estimé.

La marée noire a provoqué le déversement d’environ 200 millions de gallons de pétrole dans le golfe du Mexique. Brûler autant de gallons de pétrole et de diesel dans des moteurs à combustion aurait émis plus de 1,4 million de tonnes de CO₂, sans compter, par exemple, les émissions liées au raffinage et au transport du pétrole. Traduit en nombre moyen de vies perdues en raison du changement climatique qui en résulte, cela implique environ 325 décès au cours du siècle, liés uniquement à la hausse des températures. Cela n’inclut pas les décès dus aux particules fines générées par la combustion de ce carburant, qui pourraient représenter 350 décès prématurés supplémentaires par an.

Twitter étant Twitter, les réponses ont nécessité une réponse de David : « Je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. » Nous ne devrions pas. Il existe de nombreux autres coûts environnementaux qui ne sont pas pris en compte dans les 11 décès et les 65 milliards de dollars. L’impact dévastateur sur la faune sauvage ne peut être que partiellement reflété dans les chiffres des dommages financiers. Une partie du pétrole déversé a brûlé de manière incontrôlable, libérant à nouveau du CO₂. Le pétrole qui n’est pas brûlé mais qui finit par s’évaporer cause également de nombreux dommages environnementaux.

Hélas, il existe une grande différence entre un calcul statistique basé sur des estimations globales des dégâts et la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès, comme dans le cas de la plate-forme pétrolière Deepwater Horizon. Onze décès constituent une tragédie, tandis que 325 décès estimés statistiquement ne sont que cela, une statistique.

Il existe une autre différence, ce que l’on appelle en termes juridiques la “cause immédiate”. Cary Coglianese, professeur de droit et de sciences politiques à la Carey Law School de l’université de Pennsylvanie, décrit cela comme « une version juridique de la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès ». Tout tribunal raisonnable conviendrait que les 11 décès survenus sur Deepwater Horizon étaient directement liés à l’explosion et à l’incendie de la plate-forme.

Grâce aux progrès rapides réalisés dans le nouveau domaine de la science de l’attribution, les décès liés au climat et autres dommages peuvent désormais être liés plus directement aux tonnes de CO₂ émises. En effet, un nombre croissant de poursuites judiciaires visent à établir un lien de causalité direct entre les dommages climatiques et les décès, mais aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients.

Il existe une autre raison, trop humaine, pour laquelle 11 décès lors d’un événement ponctuel pèsent plus lourd que 325 décès futurs. M. Coglianese, de l’université de Pennsylvanie, compare la différence entre le changement climatique et la marée noire de BP à celle entre la pandémie de Covid-19 et les attentats terroristes du 11 septembre 2001 : « Le 11 septembre a tué environ 3 000 personnes », dit-il. « Nous avons eu environ autant de décès liés au Covid rien qu’hier aux États-Unis. » Plus de 900 000 Américains sont morts du Covid au cours des deux dernières années, et bien plus de 5,5 millions dans le monde, et ce ne sont là que les décès directement attribués à la maladie. « Nous semblons devenir insensibles à cette catastrophe quotidienne », ajoute M. Coglianese.

Nous ne devons bien sûr pas devenir insensibles aux milliers de décès quotidiens liés au Covid, ni aux centaines de décès liés, selon des estimations prudentes, à la quantité de pétrole brûlée, équivalente à celle déversée lors de la marée noire de BP. Les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité.

Compléments d’informations

Vous pourriez être surpris en lisant ce texte. Vous dire “attendez, il dit qu’une marée noire c’est moins pire qu’autre chose ?”. David Ho a été attaqué sur les réseaux sociaux après avoir publié ce texte, et a tout de suite précisé le fond de sa pensée :

“je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. Je souligne simplement l’ironie du fait que la combustion des énergies fossiles nuit beaucoup plus à l’environnement et tue beaucoup plus de personnes, mais comme il s’agit d’émissions de scope 3, les entreprises comme BP ne sont pas tenues responsables et engrangent au contraire des milliards de dollars.”

Il est prévisible que certaines personnes répondent que les énergies fossiles sont géniales. Vous savez ce qui est génial aussi ? Une planète habitable.”

Le coeur du texte est bien dans le titre : il y a des morts quotidiennes du changement climatique dans le monde sans que cela choque outre mesure. C’est un fait : les morts du changement climatique sont des morts silencieuses. Même s’il peut y en avoir 100 fois plus de morts à cause du changement climatique, cela n’aura jamais l’impact médiatique d’un crash d’avion ou d’une marée noire. Dernier exemple en date, la canicule de juin 2025 a fait environ 500 morts en France selon Santé Publique France. Avez-vous vu un seul responsable politique en parler ? Un journaliste interroger un membre du gouvernement ?

Cet article appelle à juste titre à changer d’angle, à aller plus loin dans la réflexion sur le changement climatique. The Onion (une sorte de Gorafi américain) a parfaitement compris l’ironie de la situation avec ce titre : “des millions de barils de pétrole arrivent à bon port malgré une catastrophe environnementale majeure“.

“Ouf”, on a évité la marée noire, qui aurait été une catastrophe. La réalité, c’est qu’on aurait évité une catastrophe si le pétrole avait été remis sous terre, là où il devrait rester.

Autre point important, les progrès réalisés dans le domaine de la science de l’attribution, dont nous avons dédié un article entier sur Bon Pote. Si “aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients”, cela pourrait bientôt ne plus être le cas.

La science a permis de clarifier le lien sans équivoque entre les activités humaines et le réchauffement climatique et c’est désormais un argument clef dans les procès. La Cour Internationale de Justice a par ailleurs récemment publié un avis notamment basé sur le dernier rapport du GIEC. Grâce à cet avis, il est à prévoir que les procès vont se multiplier contre les Etats et les entreprises qui savent que leurs activités tuent et ne font rien ou pas assez pour arrêter ce phénomène.

Comme le rappelle David Ho, “les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité“.",https://bonpote.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deepwater_Horizon_offshore_drilling_unit_on_fire_2010.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 21:56:53.887164

Shubhangi Mathur New Delhi

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India’s largest oil refiner, is working on an expansion plan in line with the country’s growing fuel requirements. In an exclusive interaction with Shubhangi Mathur, Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney talks of the company’s growth plan and also sets the record straight on the E20 controversy. Edited excerpts.

How do you look at the controversy over ethanol-blended petrol? Do you plan to offer consumers the choice of buying non-blended petrol too? And is E20 (20 per cent ethanol blending) as efficient as petrol?

As of now, we do not have any plans to offer non-blended petrol. We will see how it pans out and take a call accordingly. There is no controversy on E20 petrol. All the equipment manufacturers, labs, and agencies have certified that there is no problem with E20. We have a good example of Brazil, where petrol with 27-32 per cent ethanol blending is being sold. The efficiency of E20 is more or less on a par with that of petrol.

India aims to become a refining hub. How would IOC contribute to that?

Given the need for India’s increasing demand for fuel, IOC started expanding brownfield refineries three-four years ago. These projects are set to increase the group’s refining capacity from 80.4 million tonnes to 98 million tonnes per annum. They are scheduled to be commissioned next year. The increased capacity will take care of a large part of the increased demand for petroleum products. In the same timeframe, other refinery projects will also come up, including the expansion of the Rajasthan and Numaligarh (Assam) refineries.

The Indian market is expanding at a moderate pace, with diesel consumption growing at 2–3% and petrol at 5–7%. The industry will also actively pursue exporting surplus petroleum products once production begins following the completion of planned refinery expansions.

Which markets do you plan to target for export?

Petroleum products will go primarily to the African subcontinent and South American continent. Certain refineries are closing in the European Union. They will need products that meet Euro VI standards. Our products meet those quality standards. So, Europe is another geography. For IOC, export accounts for 5-8 per cent of its volumes. This is going to increase.

What are the timelines involved in these expansion projects?

We are aiming to complete the expansion of the Panipat refinery by March. Those in Gujarat and Bihar (Barauni) too will see completion by next year. Much of our refinery expansion will be commissioned by 2026.

Are you planning to set up greenfield refineries?

Not at present. We are focused on executing brownfield expansion while addressing the energy transition. With the rise of electric vehicles, green hydrogen, ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and other alternative fuels, the growth of petroleum products will be moderate. However, as the country’s leading energy provider, we may consider setting up a greenfield refinery, depending on the evolving demand-supply scenario.

Indian Oil has an upcoming greenfield refinery with Chennai Petroleum in Tamil Nadu.

We are working out the configuration, which will be more suitable for petrochemicals and less for refineries. We want to convert it into a petrochemical-oriented project. The detailed feasibility report is being prepared for the project.

Saudi Arabia is looking to increase its share in the global oil market. Are you in talks with the people there?

We are not in any kind of talks. We know some newer (Indian) refineries are in talks but we are keeping our crude oil portfolio in an open manner because we want to process as many type of crude oil as possible. We have flexibility of 10 refineries which can process almost all kinds of crude oil. That is our strength.

On IOC’s green-hydrogen plant in Panipat?

We are putting up India’s largest green hydrogen plant at Panipat, with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum. It will be commissioned by December 2027 and will be utilised for mobility purposes if enough hydrogen-fuelled buses, trucks or cars are available in the market. Otherwise, we will use it in our refineries and replace the conventional grey hydrogen with green hydrogen. The cost of production will be less than $4 per kg.

IOC is also foraying into new energy such as nuclear and critical minerals.

Nuclear energy, critical minerals, and ship building are on our drawing board. It is premature to talk about these things.

What is your outlook on crude oil prices?

Prices now are $66-67 a barrel in spite of all the disturbances happening across the world. My assessment is that if these disturbances ease then prices will further come down by $5-10, reaching $55-60.

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions – nearly a gigaton annually – and is growing faster than rail, road or shipping. This sector represents one of the most challenging to decarbonise.

As the International Energy Agency notes, reaching net-zero will require “revolutionary” designs, including alternative propulsion technologies such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft.

However, battery electric propulsion is currently limited to very small aircraft and short ranges. Using hydrogen poses significant challenges: innovative fuel storage and delivery methods, low-cost lightweight cryogenic tanks, and redesigned airframes to accommodate them. Questions about hydrogen’s impact on contrails remain unanswered, with dedicated studies still underway.

This technological reality makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) critical to decarbonising aviation now. Yet here too, there’s a fundamental constraint that needs to be addressed – and urgently.

SAF from biogenic feedstocks has fundamental limits

While the EU has set ambitious SAF blending targets – 2% this year, rising to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 with a synthetic fuel sub-mandate of 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 – the industry’s current approach relies heavily on biogenic CO2 from crops, agricultural waste and other biological sources. And biogenic feedstocks have inherent limitations that make these targets mathematically impossible.

The EU’s RefuelEU regulation excludes SAFs produced from food and feed crops due to sustainability concerns. While biojet kerosene from animal fat and waste oil feedstocks are included, their growth potential is limited by supply.

More abundant feedstocks could come from agricultural residues, dedicated energy crops and municipal solid waste – but even these face constraints.

First, cultivating crops for fuel creates direct land use competition with food production or requires land conversion. Second, and more critically, biogenic sources are finite.

Meeting the EU’s 2050 SAF targets through biogenic sources alone would require between 7% and 18% of today’s EU agricultural land, depending on the feedstock. It’s both impractical and impossible at the scale needed.

Even if we maximised every available biogenic source globally, we’d fall short of the gigatons of CO2 needed for aviation fuel production by 2050.

This is where atmospheric CO2 becomes essential.

Direct Air Capture: Sustainable aviation fuel from the sky

Direct Air Capture (DAC) allows us to capture CO2 needed to produce e-SAF – synthetic fuels made by combining atmospheric CO2 with green hydrogen produced by electrolysers run on low-emissions electricity through processes like Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-jet conversion.

The key advantage is unlimited feedstock: the atmosphere contains all the CO2 we need. We’re not talking about offsetting here – this is about recycling; creating a circular carbon economy where aviation’s emissions become tomorrow’s fuel.

RefuelEU Aviation regulation already recognises this distinction, segregating between biogenic SAF and e-SAF from direct air capture. This is an acknowledgement that atmospheric carbon represents a fundamentally different resource with fundamentally different potential.

What makes this pathway particularly promising is also infrastructure compatibility. Airports in Rome and Paris are already preparing for e-fuel supply chains. Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives that would require complete infrastructure overhauls, e-SAF uses existing fuel systems.

That’s a massive advantage for an industry that needs solutions now, not in ten years.

Cutting the cost of carbon capture through electrochemical innovation

The cost challenge is real but not insurmountable. Traditional DAC technologies have struggled with high energy requirements – often consuming 2,500 kWh or more per tonne of CO2 captured.

But innovation is rapidly changing this equation. New electrochemical approaches can achieve up to 70% lower energy consumption compared to conventional thermal-based systems.

By eliminating the need for high-temperature processes and chemical solvents, these technologies can reduce both operational costs and capital requirements. When you factor in mass manufacturing potential using standard materials rather than exotic components, the path to cost-competitive atmospheric CO2 becomes clear.

The same innovation curve that brought battery costs down by 90% over the past decade is beginning to transform DAC.

But we need to be honest about the challenge: the entire e-SAF value chain – from DAC to hydrogen production to fuel synthesis – requires substantial energy inputs. Current e-SAF costs five to six times more than conventional jet fuel.

Building a SAF production plant takes 10 to 20 years to reach full operational scale. This is why it’s a day-one challenge. The plants we need operational in 2040 must break ground today.

Aviation’s sustainable future must include atmospheric carbon

The truth is that from a pure energy efficiency standpoint, the numbers might favour simply capturing CO2 and storing it underground.

But Europe – and other countries such as the UK, Brazil and Japan – have chosen a different path, for better or for worse: pushing the industry to innovate beyond the World War II-era Fischer-Tropsch process, to find new pathways that make recycled carbon economically viable.

For this to happen, I believe three critical developments must happen:

First: Reinforce supply-side and demand-side policies to scale up e-SAF production and offtake

Second: Tax aviation fuels according to their climate impact, acknowledging that only a minority of the world flies

Third: Position aviation as a lead market to bring nascent decarbonisation options to commercial scale. Actions from leading airlines and airports that serve as key international and domestic hubs can generate the market pull needed to catalyse the adoption of efficient operations and best-in-class technologies

E-SAF from atmospheric CO2 doesn’t compete with biogenic SAF – we need every sustainable fuel source available, but only atmospheric carbon offers the unlimited scale required for aviation’s future.

It’s time we acknowledge that aviation’s sustainable future depends on turning the sky itself into our fuel source.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jean-Philippe-Hiegel-RepAir-Carbon-opinion-piece.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 11:56:14.083662

During the meeting, Karim Badawi, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, emphasized the role of petrochemicals as a key foundation for maximizing value-added from natural resources and strengthening Egypt’s position as a regional hub for energy and downstream industries.

He pointed out that new ongoing projects will create a qualitative leap in the petrochemicals sector, a feat that will be further supported by an expected increase in the supply of natural gas, which is the primary feedstock for the petrochemical industry.

The government is adopting a multi-track plan to secure the supply of natural gas to meet the increasing summer demand, especially in light of the decline in production in Zohr, Egypt’s largest gas field. The plan includes increasing production through finalizing new exploration deals, providing foreign investors with incentives, on top of which is gradually repaying their arrears, as well as renting and operating three Floating Storage and Regasification Units(FSRU) with the regasified gas being pumped into the national grid.

During the meeting, Mekki reviewed the progress of some petrochemical projects, including the Suez Methanol Derivatives Company (SMD), a three-plant complex stretching over an area of 45,000 square meters; the petrochemicals complex in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, with massive investments and a refining capacity of about 4 mt/y; and the ethane supply chain project to secure feedstock for factories and push exports to $4 billion annually by 2030

He also touched on green projects, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), bioethanol, green ammonia, and medium-density fiberboard (MDF) production from rice straw.
