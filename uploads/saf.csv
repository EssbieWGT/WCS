The question is, are these benefits enough to justify Airbus creating a modern version of the A380, complete with all the efficiency-increasing technological advantages that modern jetliners such as the Airbus A350 benefit from?
Thanks to some news from earlier this year, there may be some hope for Airbus creating the A380neo.
Previously, the last news about the potential for an A380neo hitting the market was in 2018, when there was speculation that Lufthansa would be purchasing 15 A380neo aircraft, adding perceived momentum to the project, but this turned out to be wishful thinking.

As the world's largest passenger airliner, it can potentially transport around 800 passengers in a single configuration over very long routes. To utilize the huge passenger-carrying potential the aircraft has, airports need to specially upgrade their gates and other infrastructure in order to accommodate the A380's massive wingspan and weight. Additionally, airlines have to pay expensive fuel costs due to the A380 being less efficient than smaller planes.

As a trade-off, the A380 is unmatched for dense hub-to-hub passenger routes, and traveling on the plane is regarded by passengers as a unique experience. The question is, are these benefits enough to justify Airbus creating a modern version of the A380, complete with all the efficiency-increasing technological advantages that modern jetliners such as the Airbus A350 benefit from? Thanks to some news from earlier this year, there may be some hope for Airbus creating the A380neo.

Emirates Will Buy The A380neo If It's Built

The news on this subject is that, in January this year, Emirates president Sir Tim Clark communicated his interest in the project, recounting a conversation between himself and Airbus executives about the possibility of the A380neo project being undertaken, according to Executive Traveller. A modern version of the A380 would be able to take advantage of the latest technology, giving the new A380neo a better chance of success than its predecessor. Clark said the following to the publication during a trip to Melbourne on an A380:

“I still have a design in front of Airbus as to how they could build a new one which would be 25% cheaper to run, far more fuel-efficient than this one. They said, ‘Well if you give us €20 billion, we’ll do it for you!’”

Clark recounted his reply that it was up to Airbus to make that large investment, but also committed to buying the aircraft if they do: “but if you build them, we’ll buy them.” Clark’s blueprint for the A380neo would deliver at least a 20-25% reduction in fuel, according to him, and he believes this would make all the difference in making the large, four-engined double-decker jet viable in today's commercial aviation market.

Previously, the last news about the potential for an A380neo hitting the market was in 2018, when there was speculation that Lufthansa would be purchasing 15 A380neo aircraft, adding perceived momentum to the project, but this turned out to be wishful thinking. A couple of years later, COVID and lockdowns caused a contraction of the aviation market, which has since returned to normal. In a struggle to meet quickly rising demand, airlines have had to start looking for solutions.

What Changes Would An A380neo Have?

According to Clark, his plans for the A380neo would include many similarities with the modern long-range aircraft that dominate the medium-to-long-haul market today, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. He specified some of these in the Executive Traveller article:

“We now know a lot more about the A380 than we did when it was built. The (tail) fin is too large, the wings need to be changed… all of this is in the later generation of aircraft.”

The extensive use of carbon fiber composites was also specified, as both the 787 and A350 feature at least 50% composites in the fuselage and wings. Typically, composites have a greater strength-to-weight ratio compared to typical aluminum alloys, significantly improving lightness and fuel-efficiency. Since the A380 has such expansively wide wings, its usability could also be increased by featuring similar folding wingtips to the Boeing 777X, meaning it could utilize normal airport gates, but this was not one of Clark's suggestions as far as is known.

The largest impact in terms of achieving better fuel-efficiency would be through the use of modern high-bypass turbofan engines, and Clark is hopeful that four Rolls-Royce UltraFan engines, which are currently being developed by Rolls-Royce, may fit the bill.

“If it’s ever allowed to get its head above the water level, this is a revolution in power. It’s a much bigger fan requiring less fuel to drive it, with enormous thrust capabilities (so) you’ve got to get something like that on the A380.”

With a fan diameter of 140 inches, the UltraFan is set to be the biggest and most efficient turbofan engine ever. Expected to begin air and ground testing by 2030, the engine will be capable of using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel from day one, and Rolls-Royce is even exploring options for hybrid-electric and hydrogen power solutions.

The A380neo Would Be Well-Loved

Passengers would certainly welcome the return of the A380, which is regarded as being the best for its premium passenger experience, featuring private first-class suites equipped with showers and a cocktail bar at the rear of the upper deck. For airlines, the A380 is desirable for its ability to transport many customers, and as a result, airlines such as Qantas have started bringing their A380's out of retirement, according to AirwaysMag.

The A380 is also famous in Hollywood, having been the inspiration for the fictional double-decker where the 2005 movie, Flightplan, takes place. However, in the film, some of the internal space, such as in avionics, is larger for effect. In a thread, Simple Flying asked whether Airbus should build the A380neo, and received a good number of responses, many making the case for viability in today's market:

""A combination of slot restrictions, population growth and the obvious indicators that some airlines CAN make quad retest work, a VLA will be needed soon. A relaunched NEO A380 with aerodynamic improvements would be very welcome.""

""Yes, for sure. With composites, better and more fuel efficient engines it's therefore a no brainer. The current fact of crowded skies and airports will dictate planes having nowhere to land. Fewer, larger planes are the future.""

There were also people of the opinion that such a large plane in this day and age would be impractical, thanks to only being able to use a limited number of airstrips and gates, favoring aircraft that were able to use more locations instead:

""Put simply, there isn’t enough infrastructure to support a new generation of A380 aircraft. The A380 is already restricted to larger airports, and with more absurdly large aircraft in the ecosystem, there’s just no more room! Don’t get me wrong, the A380 is an incredible feat of human engineering, but it’s replacement by more versatile aircraft like the B787 is inevitable. Air France for example, has retired it’s A380 fleet even though they were only 15 years old.""

Are Smaller Aircraft The Future?

It is a good observation that the commercial aviation market has recently been dominated by much smaller widebody aircraft than the A380. Using the most recent Airbus A350-900ULR variant as an example, the aircraft operates the longest flights in the world, Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24 from Singapore to New York JFK, as of 2022.

Range is the reason why aircraft such as the A350 have dominated, as it gives airlines the freedom to fly just about any route in the world, while still carrying an impressive 315 people in two-class seating per flight, or 440 as a maximum. For most airlines' purposes, this satisfies the passenger demand for a route, thus it ends up being better value to fly several A350's rather than one A380 flight. This also gives the customer more options for connections and destinations.

However, this may not be the case forever, and if demand continues to grow, the viable niche for ultra-jumbo jetliners will only get larger. In fact, Airbus celebrated the A380's birthday in April, as it had been 20 years since its maiden flight. Since its entry into commercial service, the A380 has flown over 800,000 flights and carried more than 300 million passengers, according to Airbus, and the manufacturer intends to continue supporting the model.

The Idea Has Merit Overall

Originally, Airbus had planned to release more variants of the A380 aside from the -800, the base model. A freight version, the A380F, was canceled in favor of focusing on the -800, and a stretched version, the -900, which would have seated about 656 passengers, or up to 960 passengers in an all-economy configuration, was also canceled. As Clark suspects, “at least a 20-25% reduction in fuel” would be a game-changer for a modern version of the A380, offsetting the main downside of the huge type.

The other large downside, the usability of the plane at airports, could also be easily solved by using folding wings. Thanks to procedures that were polished by manufacturing rival, Boeing and its 777X, Airbus has a test case for a folding-wing commercial aircraft, greatly increasing the potential number of airports that an A380neo could utilize.

Though many believe that this project will never get off the ground, there certainly does exist a niche for the huge luxurious double-decker, particularly if modern fuel-saving measures are used in its design. Emirates has not given up funds to get the project off the ground as yet, but a commitment to buy is very valuable for the manufacturer. It will also be interesting to see whether Airbus gets involved with the UltraFan project with a view to developing another huge quad-jet in the future.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/neoupdated.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 12:56:17.729472

Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of Vivergo, confirmed on Friday that the plant will shut its doors within weeks.
Sharon Graham, the general secretary, said: “This is a short-sighted decision that totally disregards the benefits the domestic bioethanol sector will bring to jobs and energy security.
The closure of the Vivergo plant will also represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who supply grain to the site.
The UK imports around 45 per cent of its CO2 and sources have previously warned of a supply crisis without a domestic bioethanol industry if foreign sources were disrupted.","Britain’s largest bioethanol plant will close after Sir Keir Starmer refused to step in and save the industry.

On Friday, the Government announced it would not give any funding to the Vivergo Fuels business in Hull, which is losing £3m a month.

Around 150 workers are expected to lose their jobs at the factory, which is expected to close by Sept 13 and is one of only two domestic bioethanol production sites.

Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of Vivergo, confirmed on Friday that the plant will shut its doors within weeks.

The industry had hoped for a bailout after Sir Keir Starmer’s trade deal with Donald Trump, which will allow the US to supply Britain with 1.4bn litres of duty-free ethanol.

But on Friday afternoon, a government spokesman said: “This Government will always take decisions in the national interest.

“That’s why we negotiated a landmark deal with the US which protected hundreds of thousands of jobs in sectors like auto and aerospace.”

It said it had worked to understand the challenges faced by both Vivergo and the Ensus bioethanol plant in Redcar on Teesside, which has also been refused a bailout.

The spokesman said the Government would not offer any direct funding “as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces”.

They continued: “We recognise this is a difficult time for the workers and their families and we will work with trade unions, local partners and the companies to support them through this process.

“We also continue to work up proposals that ensure the resilience of our CO2 supply in the long term in consultation with the sector.”

Unite, Labour’s biggest trade union backer, heavily criticised the Government for refusing to bail out the bioethanol industry.

Sharon Graham, the general secretary, said: “This is a short-sighted decision that totally disregards the benefits the domestic bioethanol sector will bring to jobs and energy security.

“Once again, the Government’s total lack of a plan to support oil and gas workers as the industry transitions is glaring.”

The union noted that bioethanol was a key component of sustainable aviation fuel, which is expected to be in huge demand in the coming years.

The closure of the Vivergo plant will also represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who supply grain to the site.

A record number of farms are already closing for good after Rachel Reeves’s changes to agricultural property relief made the future of thousands of rural businesses unviable.

As well as the collapse of a major domestic market, the closure will risk pushing previously profitable farms into making a loss.

An ABF spokesman said: “It is deeply regrettable that the Government has chosen not to support a key national asset.

“We have been fighting for months to keep this plant open. We initiated and led talks with the Government in good faith.

“We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the Government’s own green industrial strategy.”

ABF accused the Government of having “thrown away billions in potential growth” and the chance to lead the world in bioethanol.

“The loss of Vivergo will be felt most acutely by our dedicated workforce and their families and by the thousands whose livelihoods depend on our supply chain, from farmers to hauliers and engineers.”

During its talks with Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary, ABF had demanded ministers step in to cover “short-term funding of Vivergo’s losses” as well as striking a longer-term deal to put its plant on a profitable footing again.

Investment from Vivergo is thought to support around 1,220 farming jobs across the north-east of England.

The UK imports around 45 per cent of its CO2 and sources have previously warned of a supply crisis without a domestic bioethanol industry if foreign sources were disrupted.

In June, The Telegraph revealed a leaked memo by industry leaders that said the bioethanol sector was a “critical component” of British food security and energy resilience.

The memo warned: “The closure of Vivergo would damage farm incomes, increase import dependency and undermine the Government’s strategic goals across multiple departments.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/08/15/TELEMMGLPICT000430122367_17552674514250_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOFeYxM9hegFHu6FKJsELIu9hg0Y37QvHYjcZPVg1zsA.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-16 11:56:29.868625

However, with the airline’s business model focusing on a youthful fleet and attempting to renew, there has been much interest in the A380neo.

But, without the model releasing and comments in recent years, does interest in this new engine option exist before this period, and if so, what did it entail?

What Is The A380neo?

Details of a prospective A380neo will always remain scarce, this is driven by the reality that the aircraft has not been launched, and interest in it has always been kept on the down low, primarily only from Emirates.

But as the three letters on the end of the product suggest, neo, this model would incorporate new engines, like what has been seen with the A320 and A330 families in recent times.

Equipping new engines to an existing platform with other aeronautical improvements can represent a more cost-effective upgrade for an existing platform that may at times lack the efficiency customers require.

If executed, fuel efficiency would’ve improved, and operating costs for the superjumbo would’ve lowered. While not reducing to a level that would’ve resulted in mass adoption, it would’ve at least addressed two of the concerns that prevented the jet from thriving.

While new engines would’ve been the selling point, other improvements would’ve been a priority to bring the model up to speed with newer planes and ensure it would fly for some time longer.

A Love For The A380

Emirates remains the largest operator of the A380-800, having ordered well over 100 units and, at its peak, flying over 120 units, far exceeding any other airline’s commitment to the series.

The airline built its brand around this aircraft, leveraging its high capacity and passenger appeal to help grow its network and Dubai, its home, into a powerhouse for transit travel.

As a result, and with so many Airbus A380’s in its fleet, it isn’t hard to see why there has been so much interest in a possible A380neo, for no adequate replacement exists for the Dubai-based carrier.

Emirates has been forced to look elsewhere, away from the A380 for its future fleet. This has included a heavier reliance on twin-engine aircraft such as the 777X moving forward.

Despite the cost advantages these planes will have on their long-haul network, they still will struggle to complete the job of the A380 because of their smaller stature, but with no dedicated replacement, there must be

Emirates’ Interest In The 2010s

Emirates’ interest in a prospective Airbus A380neo, while existing only in the last few years, far predates this timeframe, with interest also emerging in 2014.

The Dubai-based carrier, at the time led by President Tim Clark, spoke with the Financial Times about the proposition of a new A380 model launching sometime in the future.

At this point, it’s key to remember the A380 was still active, the plane was also still being delivered, and the planemaker had yet to see what would unfold with the program that would ultimately lead to its demise.

Emirates, therefore, was one of the only, if not the only, publicly vocal customers expressing interest in the possibility of a new model being launched, being already the largest operator of the A380-800 and at this point having many more on order.

In the interview, Clark reaffirmed his stance in 2014 that they were interested in the launch of an A380neo, and if the project moved forward, they would buy it in numbers, considering acquiring some 60 to 80 units.

Airbus Studied The Launch

In recent years, discussion from all parties surrounding an A380neo has cooled, driven by airlines shifting away from quad-engined jets more than ever.

Additionally, in the last 11 years since the planemaker first saw significant interest emerge from Emirates, much has occurred with the A380 program, the jet seeing its production life come to an end.

The end of the production life of the A380-800 model didn’t come without attempts to push the jet into markets and extend the production life; however, they ultimately failed, and when Emirates slashed its commitments, the decision to end the superjumbo was confirmed.

Despite this, in 2014, the Chief Commercial Officer at the time, John Leahy, told Aviation Week that internal studies were already underway to help determine whether a future existed for a next-generation A380 release.

With much of the interest in the jet centred around the adoption of new engines and other minor improvements, if released, the planemaker needed to determine whether there would be enough demand to warrant the investment, and what the return would look like.

These studies at the time would’ve seen an estimated six-year process before the jet would have formally launched, in time for the commencement of the new decade, and with hindsight, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which ironically spelled the end of the series.

No Release

Despite Airbus moving ahead with internal studies and conducting its due diligence, a decision to proceed with the launch of an A380neo was ultimately not made.

Airbus would reveal the development study of the A380plus towards the backend of the 2010s in the hopes of showing what possible innovation would give to customers, but this failed.

Emirates, the only airline customer expressing interest in a new model, firmly believed the A380neo, a new engine option, would be the answer, not the plus model. Therefore, when the A380plus was revealed, it unsurprisingly showed little to no interest.

Now, even with the airline’s president, Clark, resurfacing discussions around a re-engine every handful of months, production has closed on the A380-800, and priorities lie elsewhere.

Airbus, alongside engine makers, are busy studying the new era of commercial aircraft travel, and a prospective A380neo would further derail plans and fundamentally take away space and resources from these studies, only to please the likely one interested customer.

Ultimately, Emirates’ long-standing interest did prompt some internal studies in the mid-2010s from the planemaker, but with no action and production ending on the A380, the A380neo’s fate had all but been sealed.",https://djsaviation.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Emirates-Airbus-A380-800-parked-1.webp,N,,2025-08-16 11:56:41.297398

Bioethanol, made from crops like wheat, is used to reduce emissions in petrol and as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.","London: Britain’s bioethanol sector is facing collapse after the government ruled out financial aid for producers hit by a trade deal with the United States, reports The Edge Malaysia.

A government spokesperson said on Friday, “We have taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry’s long-term problems.”

Under the agreement signed by former Prime Minister Theresa May, the UK cut its 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol to zero within a quota of 1.4 billion litres — equal to the size of the entire British ethanol market.

The UK has two main bioethanol plants, Associated British Foods’ Vivergo facility and Ensus, owned by Germany’s Südzucker Group, both located in northern England. Together, they make up almost all of the country’s production capacity.

AB Foods warned in June it would shut the Vivergo plant by September without government support. Ensus has also said its plant is at risk of closure.

A spokesperson for AB Foods said it was “deeply regrettable that the government has chosen not to support a key national asset.” Ensus did not immediately comment.

Industry groups say the trade deal, combined with existing rules that give U.S. producers an edge, has made operations unviable. The sector directly supports thousands of jobs in the UK.

Petrolimex Aviation đã đạt ra mục tiêu phủ xanh bầu trời Việt Nam sẽ không chỉ là một khẩu hiệu truyền thông.
Không dừng lại ở việc giảm phát thải, đó còn là khát vọng vươn tầm vị thế Việt Nam trên bản đồ hàng không thế giới.","Chiến lược xanh và cam kết Net Zero 2050

Thực hiện cam kết của Việt Nam tại Hội nghị COP26 về phát thải ròng bằng 0 vào năm 2050, ngành hàng không Việt Nam đã đặt ra yêu cầu phải cắt giảm phát thải carbon và metan của ngành hàng không Việt Nam thông qua việc chuyển đổi năng lượng, đặc biệt là chuyển đổi từ nhiên liệu hoá thạch sang nhiên liệu bền vững Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Việc thực hiện cam kết tại Hội nghị COP26 cũng phù hợp với chiến lược phát triển năng lượng xanh, sạch, thân thiện với môi trường của Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam.

Để thực hiện chủ trương này, SAF được xem là giải pháp khả thi nhất hiện nay khi các công nghệ như máy bay điện, hoặc hydro còn ở giai đoạn thử nghiệm.

Petrolimex Aviation đã triển khai nhập khẩu, kiểm soát chất lượng, lưu trữ và xuất bán SAF theo đúng các quy định tại tiêu chuẩn ASTM D7566, DEF STAN 91-091 và AFQRJOS Checklist phiên bản hiện hành; các tiêu chuẩn của Hiệp hội Vận tải Hàng không Quốc tế (IATA), Tổ chức kiểm tra chung (JIG) và Bộ Giao thông vận tải (nay là Bộ Xây dựng).

Đánh dấu cho chiến lược “xanh hóa” này là sự kiện Petrolimex Aviation thực hiện thành công việc tra nạp nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững - Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) cho 2 chuyến bay số hiệu VJ081 và VJ860 của Hãng hàng không Vietjet (Vietjet Air) xuất phát từ TP Hồ Chí Minh (Việt Nam) đi Melbourne (Australia) và Incheon (Hàn Quốc) ngày 17/10/2024.

Đây là hành động cụ thể, đặt nền móng cho việc hình thành chuỗi cung ứng SAF tại Việt Nam.

Sự kiện này cũng đánh dấu lần đầu tiên SAF được sử dụng cho các chuyến bay khởi hành từ Việt Nam, thể hiện nỗ lực, quyết tâm của Petrolimex Aviation trong việc phát triển sản phẩm xanh - sạch, sẵn sàng cung cấp SAF đáp ứng nhu cầu của các hãng hàng không trong nước và quốc tế.

Không dừng lại ở đó, ngày 15/8, Petrolimex Aviation tiếp tục có bước tiến chiến lược, đó là ký kết thỏa thuận cung cấp 1.200 m³ (1.200.000 lít) SAF đầu tiên được pha trộn tại Việt Nam cho các chuyến bay nội địa của Vietjet, đồng thời hợp tác với AEG FUEL nhằm hỗ trợ thương mại hóa SAF tại Việt Nam cho các hãng hàng không quốc tế trong tương lai.

Đây là dấu mốc mở ra khả năng sản xuất - pha trộn - phân phối SAF ngay trong nước, giảm phụ thuộc nhập khẩu và thúc đẩy ngành hàng không Việt Nam tiến gần hơn đến mục tiêu giảm phát thải ròng.

Nói về ý nghĩa của sự kiện này, ông Uông Việt Dũng - Cục trưởng Cục Hàng không Việt Nam cho biết, việc ra mắt sản phẩm SAF không chỉ có ý nghĩa về mặt thương mại, mà còn mang ý nghĩa chiến lược lâu dài, tạo tiền đề xây dựng chuỗi cung ứng SAF bền vững trong nước; góp phần đáp ứng các yêu cầu bắt buộc của thị trường quốc tế, đặc biệt là RefuelEU Aviation của Liên minh châu Âu và CORSIA của ICAO; khuyến khích hợp tác giữa các hãng hàng không, đơn vị cung cấp nhiên liệu, cơ quan quản lý và các tổ chức tài chính nhằm mở rộng quy mô sử dụng SAF tại Việt Nam.

Còn ông Phạm Văn Thanh - Chủ tịch Hội đồng quản trị Tập đoàn Xăng dầu Việt Nam thì cho rằng, ngoài việc công bố sản phẩm SAF, Công ty CP Nhiên liệu bay Petrolimex Aviation sẽ ký kết các biên bản ghi nhớ hợp tác chiến lược với hai đối tác lớn là Vietjet Air và AEG (Associated Energy Group).

“Những thỏa thuận này khẳng định quyết tâm của Petrolimex trong việc đóng góp thiết thực vào việc giảm phát thải và nâng cao vị thế quốc gia trên bản đồ năng lượng xanh toàn cầu”, ông Thanh nói.

Tổng giám đốc Petrolimex Aviation Nguyễn Văn Học cho biết, trong quá trình triển khai, Petrolimex Aviation đã nhận được sự hỗ trợ quý báu của các cơ quan quản lý nhà nước như: Cục Hàng không Việt Nam, Cục Quản lý và Phát triển Thị trường trong nước - Bộ Công thương, Cục Hải quan trong việc cấp phép, hoàn thiện tiêu chuẩn và chính sách, tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho công tác triển khai sản phẩm SAF.

Nói về sự hợp tác giữa Công ty Petrolimex Aviation (PA) và Công ty cổ phần Hàng không Vietjet (VJC) và Công ty AEG Fuels, Tổng giám đốc Nguyễn Văn Học cho biết, VJC và PA đã cùng đồng hành trong nhiều năm qua, từ giai đoạn hình thành, phát triển cho đến vượt qua thử thách của đại dịch, không chỉ trên phương diện kinh doanh, mà còn ở mục tiêu chung là phát triển bền vững của ngành hàng không Việt Nam.

“Tháng 10/2024, PA và VJC hai bên đã ghi dấu mốc lịch sử khi thực hiện 2 chuyến bay sử dụng SAF đầu tiên tại Việt Nam do PA tra nạp.

Tiếp nối thành công đó, ngày 15/8, Công ty PA và Công ty CP Hàng không Vietjet sẽ triển khai tra nạp toàn bộ 1.200.000 lít SAF đầu tiên được pha trộn tại Việt Nam cho các chuyến bay nội địa của Vietjet - tương đương lượng nhiên liệu tra nạp cho 200 chuyến, sẽ bay từ sân bay Tân Sơn Nhất tới khắp các tỉnh thành Việt Nam, điều này sẽ góp phần “xanh hóa” bầu trời.

Đây là hành động cụ thể biến cam kết thành hiện thực, góp phần chắp cánh cho những chuyến bay xanh, an toàn và bền vững”, ông Học nói.

Với đối với đối tác AEG FUELS, đại diện PA cho biết, đây cũng là đối tác thương mại lâu năm của PA tại thị trường Việt Nam và Quốc tế từ năm 2011 đến này. “Với với kinh nghiệm triển khai SAF và mạng lưới khách hàng là các các hãng hàng không toàn cầu, PA tin tưởng rằng AEG FUELS sẽ giúp kết nối thị trường Việt Nam với xu thế sử dụng SAF của thế giới, mở ra những cơ hội hợp tác sâu rộng trong tương lai”, ông Học chia sẻ.

Có thể nói, hai mốc sự kiện trên là minh chứng rõ ràng cho lộ trình hành động mà Petrolimex Aviation đã và đang triển khai. Phát triển bền vững nhưng dám gánh vác trên vai trách nhiệm quốc gia trước cộng đồng quốc tế.

Khát vọng phủ xanh bầu trời Việt của Petrolimex Aviation

Trong bối cảnh hiện nay, Việt Nam đang khẩn trương xây dựng kế hoạch quốc gia về sản xuất SAF và chuẩn bị tham gia Chương trình bù đắp và giảm thiểu carbon cho hàng không quốc tế (CORSIA) của ICAO.

Phó Thủ tướng Chính phủ Trần Hồng Hà cũng đã chỉ đạo Cục Hàng không Việt Nam chuẩn bị đề xuất chi tiết, đồng thời yêu cầu các nhà sản xuất và lọc dầu trong nước vạch ra kế hoạch cụ thể cho sản xuất SAF.

Bộ Tài chính và Bộ Ngoại giao cũng được giao nhiệm vụ xem xét các lựa chọn áp phí đối với các chuyến bay quốc tế khởi hành từ Việt Nam, cũng như các ưu đãi thuế và hỗ trợ tài chính để thúc đẩy sản xuất SAF trong nước.

Ngay cả các nhà sản xuất máy bay như Airbus cũng cam kết các dòng máy bay của họ, như A330neo và A321neo, hiện có thể vận hành với tối đa 50% SAF, với mục tiêu tăng lên 100% khả năng sử dụng SAF vào năm 2030.

Tuy nhiên, hiện chi phí sản xuất SAF cao hơn nhiên liệu truyền thống và nguồn cung toàn cầu còn hạn chế dù thị trường đang tăng trưởng nhanh.

Theo dự báo của ResourceWise, giá trị thị trường SAF có thể đạt 3,92 tỷ USD vào năm 2028, điều này mở ra cơ hội lớn cho những doanh nghiệp tiên phong. Trong đó có sự góp mặt từ những ngày đầu của Petrolimex Aviation.

Từ nhận thức sâu sắc rằng, mỗi chuyến bay sẽ không chỉ mang sứ mệnh vận chuyển hành khách, hàng hóa..., mà còn mang theo trách nhiệm phủ xanh bầu trời và bảo vệ một tương lai xanh cho các thế hệ mai sau.

Petrolimex Aviation đã đạt ra mục tiêu phủ xanh bầu trời Việt Nam sẽ không chỉ là một khẩu hiệu truyền thông.

Petrolimex Aviation đặt mục tiêu đến năm 2050 sẽ đồng hành cùng ngành hàng không Việt Nam loại bỏ hoàn toàn phát thải ròng CO₂, thông qua việc: Tăng tỷ trọng SAF trong tổng lượng nhiên liệu cung ứng hàng năm, tiến tới thương mại hóa và sử dụng rộng rãi trên cả các đường bay quốc tế và nội địa; Phát triển chuỗi cung ứng SAF nội địa - từ nghiên cứu nguyên liệu tái tạo, hợp tác sản xuất - pha trộn, đến hệ thống phân phối và tra nạp đồng bộ tại các sân bay lớn; Hợp tác toàn cầu với các hãng hàng không, nhà sản xuất và tổ chức quốc tế nhằm cập nhật công nghệ, giảm chi phí sản xuất SAF và mở rộng quy mô ứng dụng.

Không dừng lại ở việc giảm phát thải, đó còn là khát vọng vươn tầm vị thế Việt Nam trên bản đồ hàng không thế giới. Biến Việt Nam thành trung tâm cung cấp nhiên liệu hàng không bền vững trong khu vực, nơi mà mỗi chuyến bay cất cánh từ mảnh đất hình chữ S sẽ mang theo thông điệp mạnh mẽ: “Việt Nam cam kết và hành động vì một hành tinh xanh”.",https://osky.1cdn.vn/thumbs/1200x630/2025/08/16/z6911107863176_073bcff19babefae910720ce952a5e09.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 11:57:03.444121

It’s taken the better part of four decades, but Airbus has finally caught up: The A320 series is poised to overtake its US competitor as the most-delivered commercial airliner in history, according to aviation consultancy Cirium. As of early August, Airbus had winnowed the gap to just 20 units, with 12,155 lifetime A320-family shipments, according to the data. That difference is likely to disappear as soon as next month.

“Did anyone back then expect it could become number one – and on such high production volumes?” Max Kingsley-Jones, head of advisory at Cirium Ascend, wrote of the A320 in a recent social-media post. “I certainly didn’t, and nor probably did Airbus.”

The A320’s success mirrors the European planemaker’s decades-long rise from fledgling planemaker to serious contender, and finally Boeing’s better. By the early 2000s, annual deliveries of the A320 and its derivatives had surpassed the 737 family; total orders eclipsed the Boeing jet in 2019. But the 737 stubbornly remained the most-delivered commercial aircraft of all time.

At the outset, Airbus faced an uphill battle. The European planemaker, an assemblage of aerospace manufacturers formed in 1970 with backing from European governments, didn’t yet offer a full aircraft lineup. Infighting hindered everything from product planning to manufacturing, and leadership decisions had to finely balance French and German commercial and political interests.

Yet it was clear even then that Airbus needed a presence in the narrowbody segment to firmly establish itself as Boeing’s top rival. Those aircraft are by far the most widely flown category in commercial aviation, typically connecting city pairs on shorter routes.

Higher fuel costs and the deregulation of the US aviation industry in the late 1970s had given the European planemaker an opening with American airline executives, who clamored for an all-new single-aisle, according to a history of Airbus written by journalist Nicola Clark.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QBupYqDM3pYWl.BtZ9PuTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_holding_pen_162/374a68d59c5529d1fcddf3836f5d2c86,N,,2025-08-16 11:57:10.259776

This marks DHL’s first direct procurement of SAF for flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport.

Fueling International Flights from Singapore

The SAF, produced at Neste’s refinery in Singapore, will be used to power about 35 to 40% of the overall fuel needs for DHL Express’ five Boeing 777 freighters. These aircraft are based at the South Asia Hub at Singapore Changi Airport and operate 12 intercontinental flights per week, connecting Singapore to destinations in Asia and the Americas. By using Neste’s SAF, which is blended with conventional jet fuel, DHL aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle.

Commitment to Sustainable Logistics

Christopher Ong, Managing Director for DHL Express Singapore, called the partnership a significant milestone for the company’s emission reduction efforts and a way to provide more sustainable shipping options to customers. The agreement will also contribute to Singapore’s national target of 1% SAF usage for all passenger and cargo flights from 2026 onwards.

As a major global user of SAF, DHL Express has been a leader in driving voluntary demand for the fuel. The company’s GoGreen Plus service allows customers to reduce their carbon emissions through the use of SAF, with the environmental benefits being allocated through a ‘book & claim’ approach.",https://airfreight-logistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sg-core-pr-07152025.jpeg,N,,2025-08-16 08:56:20.129987

India marked its 79th Independence Day with tricolours flying high, patriotic songs, and the national anthem echoing across the country. But beneath the celebrations lies a bitter truth — while the government basks in the glory of freedom, workers, farmers, and their unions are still forced to fight for their basic rights.

Just a month ago, on July 9, lakhs of workers participated in a one-day nationwide general strike. The question is unavoidable: why, after nearly eight decades of independence, do we still have to take to the streets for justice?

Let history not be forgotten. During the freedom struggle, it was the working class and trade unions — particularly the AITUC — that stood shoulder to shoulder with the national movement, winning landmark rights like the Trade Union Act of 1926 even under colonial rule. After independence, workers were the backbone of nation-building — expanding railways, setting up defence industries, driving irrigation projects, building public sector enterprises, and ensuring the nationalisation of banks and insurance.

But over the last two decades, successive governments have betrayed this legacy. Under the banner of “ease of doing business” and corporate-friendly reforms, permanent jobs have been killed off, replaced with insecure contract and fixed-term work. Public sector jewels are being sold off. Even core sectors — defence, education, healthcare, electricity, banking, insurance — are not spared. Social security is being shredded. In today’s India, job security is a relic, and dignity of labour is under assault.

Unemployment and underemployment plague our youth. In the Central Government alone, over 15 lakh posts lie vacant; in PSUs and banks, another 5–10 lakh. Reservation for marginalised communities exists only in the public sector — and yet, this very sector is being dismantled. Bank employees fight privatisation, insurance workers fight for wage revision, municipal conservancy workers fight for regularisation, ordnance factory employees fight corporatisation, and government staff demand the restoration of the Old Pension Scheme.

Worse still, the government refuses to talk. The Indian Labour Conference — the country’s highest tripartite forum — has not been convened. The Joint Consultative Machinery for government employees is paralysed. This is not governance; this is contempt.

India today is an economic power, but let us be clear: it is the sweat of its workers and farmers that made this possible. A country that ignores them is not on the road to development — it is on the road to injustice. As we approach the 80th year of independence, the government must shed its arrogance, return to dialogue, and respect the principles of socialism and secularism enshrined in our Constitution.

Freedom without justice for workers is not true freedom, he concludes.",https://indianpsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/north-South-Block.jpg,N,,2025-08-16 11:57:23.770517

Experts note that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) shares similar chemical properties with conventional jet fuel (Jet A-1), allowing it to be processed through the same supply chain without the need for changes to existing infrastructure or aircraft engines. The use of SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel, a significant advancement in the effort to decarbonize the aviation sector, which is responsible for nearly 5 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions.

Civil Aviation Minister Samah el-Hefny emphasised Egypt’s support for the new strategic plan of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

The minister also asserted that the Ministry places the improvement of personnel and the modernisation of technical infrastructure at the top of its priorities, in alignment with the highest international standards.

This came during el-Hefny’s participation in the 13th Meeting of Civil Aviation Authority Officials for the North America, Central America and Caribbean Region (NACC/DCA/13), organised by the ICAO in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic.

The event witnessed broad participation from chairpersons and representatives of civil aviation authorities in the Member States, as well as heads of relevant regional and international organisations.

El-Hefny emphasised that the participation of the Ministry of Civil Aviation reflects its continuous commitment to enhancing co-operation with ICAO and the Member States.

He also highlighted the importance of such meetings for exchanging expertise and coordinating policies to address the sector’s challenges.

The minister stated that Egypt pays great attention to regional integration and mutual technical co-operation, as well as aligning its national legislation with international requirements.

This is within the framework of balancing market liberalisation with the protection of developing countries’ interests.

The meeting addressed the main pillars of ICAO’s new strategic plan (2026–2050), most notably the modernisation of the air navigation system, economic regulation, and human resource development.

The attendees also discussed developments in air transport and regional connectivity, reviewed the outcomes of the World Air Cargo Summit, and considered the recommendations of the ICAO Air Services Negotiation Events (ICAN).

On the sidelines of the meeting, Minister el-Hefny participated in the 12th Session of the Steering Committee of the Multiregional Assistance Programme (MCAAP – RLA/09/801 PSC/12), which addressed ways to enhance the capabilities of civil aviation authorities in the fields of safety and security, as well as in training, air transport, and compliance with international standards.

Nebraska's corn industry could find new market in sustainable aviation fuel

Rep. Mike Flood convened a conference at the museum on Friday. The goal, he said, was to help Nebraska farmers learn about potential opportunities with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""We woke up on third base on the sustainable aviation issue. There are states that aren't to first base,"" Flood said. ""God made Nebraska for corn.""

Sustainable aviation fuel is essentially ethanol for aviation. To meet environmental standards, carbon dioxide, a byproduct of ethanol production, has to be captured and buried underground. Nebraska has a more developed infrastructure for this process compared to neighboring states like Iowa and South Dakota.

While some see opportunities to make money, not everyone in agriculture agrees that sustainable aviation fuel is beneficial.

""What they're talking about, in terms of sustainable aviation fuel, is a fairy tale,"" said Trent Loos, rancher and political activist.

Loos also objects to tax credits for the industry.

""They say that it costs too much to be competitive. In what industry do we try to prop something up to be competitive when it's not competitive?"" he said.

CO2 pipeline opponents often raise concerns about safety.

""You know, for years and years and years, we've had these debates about underground pipelines. They are the safest,"" Flood said.

Michael Gibbern, president of the Nebraska Corn Growers Association, believes SAF would boost the agricultural economy, especially with current low corn prices.

""Economically, for sustainable aviation fuel to be a viable option and to get it off the ground, no pun intended, it's gonna take some government help. Some tax credits,"" Gibbern said.

Flood compared SAF to the rise in ethanol production a generation ago.

""Well, look at what Nebraska and the Feds did in the early part of the 2000s where we had the EPIC program that jump-started ethanol plant production in Nebraska,"" Flood said.

Unlike Iowa, the potential use of eminent domain for CO2 pipelines hasn't been a major issue in Nebraska.

The stock’s performance coincided with the airline’s decision to divest its renewable fuels unit, Saffire Renewables, to Conestoga Energy. The sale includes intellectual property, leadership, and a planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pilot facility in Kansas. This move reflects a strategic retreat from climate-focused initiatives, including layoffs of staff dedicated to reducing emissions and expanding SAF use.

The transaction underscores broader challenges in the aviation sector’s progress toward climate goals, such as achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050. Growth in cleaner jet fuels has lagged industry projections, and reduced government incentives for SAF production—like a trimmed Trump-era credit—have heightened financial pressures for producers. Southwest’s shift follows a pattern of scaling back sustainability efforts, despite earlier investments in Saffire and the creation of a dedicated renewable ventures unit in 2024.

Conestoga, a leading biofuel provider, emphasized Saffire’s ethanol-to-SAF technology as a scalable solution for low-carbon fuel production. The acquisition aligns with Conestoga’s existing ethanol operations and carbon capture capabilities. CEO Tom Willis highlighted the potential for Saffire’s technology to expand beyond aviation fuel, though he acknowledged the need for sustained demand in low-carbon markets. Southwest stated its support for the technology’s commercialization but did not disclose the sale price.

Jet fuel made from biomass could be the answer they are looking for.

At Friday’s Sustainable Aviation Fuels Conference in Ashland, political and business leaders alike said the state is well-positioned to become a major player in the burgeoning industry. Jacki Fee, a biofuels specialist with Cargill, explained why.

“Nebraska is uniquely advantaged, not only with the rail infrastructure, but also we have blending terminals, and we have pipelines, and we have just infrastructure in general that is going to be very supportive of having a new fuel market come into the state,” she said.

Jan tenBensel, who chairs the Nebraska Ethanol Board, said he’s working to market the state’s biofuels potential to the aviation industry.

“The the biggest message that I'd want to get out there is we have this low carbon product right now called corn ethanol, and it is here, and it's available today in mass quantities, and we can make more quickly in 18 months,” he said.

He also stressed that Nebraska’s ethanol production in recent years has not taken away from other uses. Instead, higher yields due to technological advances have allowed the state to produce more corn and soybeans than ever before.

“Since ethanol has come onto the stage, every kernel of corn used for ethanol is new production produced with essentially the same amount of fertilizer we were using 40 years ago,” tenBensel said.

• Alistair Osborne: Unexpected extras in US trade deal The trade deal prompted months of negotiations over a potential bailout but Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has now decided that he cannot justify propping up the sector with taxpayer subsidies.
Paul Kenward, chief executive of ABF Sugar, has long said, even before the trade deal, that the sector’s difficulties have been caused by government regulation that favoured US exporters.
Green industrial revolution opportunities will now go overseas The closure of Vivergo Fuels in Hull is more than the loss of a plant (Paul Kenward writes).
Vivergo’s closure should not close the conversation, but unless the government acts now, the UK’s green industrial future will be built abroad.","The fate of a second bioethanol factory, Ensus UK, which operates at the Wilton International site near Redcar and is owned by Germany’s CropEnergies, is also hanging in the balance. However, it remains in talks with the government over whether the plant, which employs about 100 workers, can continue as the UK’s maker of CO₂ — a byproduct of bioethanol production that is used in everything from fizzy drinks to NHS operating theatres.

Both companies have been warning of the risk of closure since Sir Keir Starmer’s trade deal with President Trump in May cut to zero the UK’s 19 per cent tariff on up to 1.4 billion litres of US bioethanol imports a year. That is roughly equivalent to the UK’s entire annual consumption.

On the insistence of the US president, who is keen to preserve American farming jobs, the prime minister agreed to a last-minute concession, blindsiding the two companies that make up Britain’s bioethanol industry. They produce green fuel from non-food grade wheat that is used in E10 petrol — which is fossil-fuel petrol containing up to 10 per cent renewable ethanol, to lower its emissions. The companies also make animal feed.

• Alistair Osborne: Unexpected extras in US trade deal

The trade deal prompted months of negotiations over a potential bailout but Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has now decided that he cannot justify propping up the sector with taxpayer subsidies. The news was broken to the companies in a meeting with Sarah Jones, the minister for industry.

In a statement, the government said that it always took decisions in the national interest: “That’s why we negotiated a landmark deal with the US which protected hundreds of thousands of jobs in sectors like auto and aerospace.”

It said it had “worked closely” with the two companies since June “to understand the financial challenges they have faced over the past decade, and have taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces”.

Paul Kenward, chief executive of ABF Sugar, has long said, even before the trade deal, that the sector’s difficulties have been caused by government regulation that favoured US exporters.

A spokesman for ABF said: “We presented a clear plan to restore Vivergo to profitability within two years under policy levers already aligned with the government’s own green industrial strategy. The government has thrown away billions in potential growth in the Humber and a sovereign capability in clean fuels that had the chance to lead the world. Jobs in clean energy will now move overseas.”

• Tariffs blamed as Britain’s exports to US drop to lowest since 2022

ABF, which has invested more than £700 million in Vivergo over the past decade, added: “This plant should always have been profitable under the right regulatory environment, as similar plants in western Europe demonstrate.”

The company, which said that its supply chain supports “4,000 livelihoods”, was also “hugely disappointed” that “the press was informed of this decision before we were told — and before we had a chance to communicate to our staff”.

Supporters of the government’s decision pointed out that ABF, which also owns the retailer Primark, is controlled by the billionaire Weston family, who could have put in more funds.

The government offered a possible reprieve to Ensus, which is ahead of Vivergo when it comes to CO₂ production, saying: “We also continue to work up proposals that ensure the resilience of our CO₂ supply in the long term, in consultation with the sector.”

Grant Pearson, chairman of Ensus UK, said that at the meeting with Jones, she confirmed that the government values “our production of biogenic CO₂ which is a product of critical national importance. They are therefore looking at options to secure an ongoing supply of CO₂ from the Ensus facility.” He said, however, that it will “take time” to agree “an acceptable long-term arrangement”.

Green industrial revolution opportunities will now go overseas

The closure of Vivergo Fuels in Hull is more than the loss of a plant (Paul Kenward writes). It is a warning about how Britain risks closing itself off from the future fuels revolution, and how, in the process, UK PLC risks squandering a real opportunity to create high-quality green industrial jobs.

For Hull, bioethanol should have been the start of a green industrial revolution: a hub for low-carbon fuels serving UK transport, shipping and aviation, with skilled employment, investment in infrastructure and growth for the region’s farmers and suppliers. Instead, that future will now happen overseas — in countries with which Britain competes for increasingly scarce investment and growth.

I am, of course, deeply saddened for our 160 colleagues who are losing their jobs, and for the thousands more across the supply chain — from the farmers at the 12,500 farms supplying our wheat to the hauliers, engineers and contractors whose livelihoods depend on the plant. They will no doubt be deeply frustrated, as I am, at the ministerial inaction that has led us to this point.

• Sharon Graham: Path to green energy should not be littered with job losses

Over the past decade ABF has invested more than £700 million in Vivergo, sustaining it through extended losses caused by policy distortions unique to the UK. Under competitive and stable market conditions, bioethanol could and should be a hugely profitable sector. All we needed from the government, since the shock of the trade deal that gave away the entire market to subsidised US competitors, was time-limited support to bridge the period until regulatory changes, already in line with the government’s stated direction, were in place.

For several years a UK-only regulatory loophole gave foreign producers an artificial price advantage in our own market. No other country applies such a rule to its domestic producers. Then, in May, the surprise removal of the 19 per cent tariff on US ethanol imports as part of the trade deal, done with no notice and no transition plan, made it impossible for UK plants to compete in their own market. If Vivergo had been in Rotterdam, where these distortions do not exist, it would be successful.

The result of the refusal to support Vivergo is a message to investors that the UK is willing to cede sovereign fuel capabilities to overseas competitors, even in sectors directly aligned with its growth and net-zero priorities. The cost of doing business in UK regulated sectors is becoming too high, not because the industries lack potential but because unpredictable policy shifts and regulatory inconsistency make it too risky to commit long-term capital.

This is about more than one plant. Future fuels, from sustainable aviation fuel to advanced biofuels, are a huge global growth opportunity. Other countries are locking in their share. In the US, a clear policy framework has driven record bioethanol output and exports, underpinned rural economies and attracted billions in private investment. Across the EU bioethanol production is growing.

• Taxpayer will subsidise industry energy bills to help firms compete

The UK could have been part of this story. Saltend Chemicals Park, where Vivergo is based, has the potential to generate £24.2 billion in GVA (gross value added) by 2050, rising to £50 billion with planned investments. That included a signed memorandum of understanding with Meld Energy for a £1.25 billion sustainable aviation fuel facility, projected to add £7.3 billion to the economy over its lifetime. But with Vivergo gone, the domestic ethanol supply this project depended on will no longer exist. That means the investment may now go abroad, along with the jobs, skills and growth it would have brought to the UK.

The government had a clear window to safeguard a strategic industry and chose not to take it. Failing to act now sends the wrong message: that Britain is content to become an import-only market for the very fuels and technologies it will depend on to hit net zero. It signals to investors that they must factor in the risk that future policy changes or trade deals could abruptly undermine entire sectors — making every emerging clean energy industry, from sustainable aviation fuel to hydrogen, a more uncertain and risky investment.

Vivergo’s closure should not close the conversation, but unless the government acts now, the UK’s green industrial future will be built abroad. The investment, jobs and skills that could have been anchored in places like Hull will instead flow to countries with clearer, more consistent regulatory regimes. Britain will end up importing fuels and technologies it could have produced at home, paying a premium for the privilege, and watching the economic opportunity of a generation slip through its fingers.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fc9b8562f-3be6-4fc8-8237-a4668697fa20.jpg?crop=1200%2C675%2C0%2C88&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-15 18:56:25.368755

BioMADE will operate the facility in coordination with ISU Research Park.
To address this gap, BioMADE worked with partners at the U.S. Department of Defense, the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa State University and the Iowa State University Research Park to establish this facility and continue the growth of its national Pilot Plant Network.
“Collaborations like the one with BioMADE, IEDA, ISU Research Park and Iowa State exemplify how these entities can come together to accelerate breakthroughs that will shape the next generation of sustainable, resilient ag technologies,” said Rick Sanders, president, ISU Research Park.","BioMADE, a Department of Defense Manufacturing Innovation Institute, has selected Iowa to establish a bioindustrial manufacturing scale-up facility at Iowa State University’s (ISU) BioCentury Research Farm in Boone.

The 15,000-square-foot facility will include 5,000-liter and 10,000-liter fermenters and downstream processing equipment, enabling companies to scale up fermentation-based technologies using Iowa’s agricultural feedstocks, with an opening date of early 2028.

At a total project value of $40 million, BioMADE has committed at least $20 million, which will be matched by up to $10 million in cost-share contributions from ISU and $10 million in funding from IEDA’s Strategic Infrastructure Program over two fiscal years.

BioMADE will operate the facility in coordination with ISU Research Park. The announcement was made at the Iowa Economic Development Authority board meeting today. This is the third major site for BioMADE. Others are in California and Minnesota.

BioMADE’s facility will be designed to complement other Iowa-based facilities, like ISU’s Center for Crops Utilization Research, to increase the speed at which companies can move through technological development and scale-up processes.

According to project officials, the bioindustrial manufacturing industry in the U.S. currently faces a scale-up challenge due to a critical lack of pilot- to demonstration-scale infrastructure. As a result, American companies often have to seek relevant facilities overseas, taking American innovation with them and risking IP loss. To address this gap, BioMADE worked with partners at the U.S. Department of Defense, the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa State University and the Iowa State University Research Park to establish this facility and continue the growth of its national Pilot Plant Network.

The announcement comes on the heels of U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s visit to the Ames National Laboratory on Thursday, where he discussed the importance of research in becoming energy independent

“Iowa is proud to partner with the U.S. Department of Defense and BioMADE to build the infrastructure needed to lead in the next generation of biomanufacturing,” Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a news release. “This facility will unleash new value from our agricultural resources, create high-quality jobs, and ensure Iowa remains at the forefront of bioscience innovation and global competitiveness.”

The project will support workforce development, startup growth, and technology commercialization, according to IEDA. The goal is to help Iowa diversify beyond traditional biofuels and attract early-stage companies to establish permanent operations in the state.

“Iowa’s longstanding leadership in bioindustrial manufacturing makes it an ideal site for scale-up capacity,” said Douglas Friedman, BioMADE’s CEO, in a news release. “We’re excited to work with our partners at Iowa State University to establish this site, which will secure domestic supply chains for critical consumer and defense products – while also creating new markets for American-grown crops, re-shoring manufacturing jobs, and expanding rural development.”

One of 95 active BioMADE projects nationally is the jet fuel program at ISU. This project is developing methods to scale up the conversion and recovery of fatty acids precursors for sustainable aviation fuel.

“Collaborations like the one with BioMADE, IEDA, ISU Research Park and Iowa State exemplify how these entities can come together to accelerate breakthroughs that will shape the next generation of sustainable, resilient ag technologies,” said Rick Sanders, president, ISU Research Park. “We’re proud to be part of a movement that has the potential to secure additional value and products from crops produced right here in Iowa and in turn, strengthen the bioeconomy.”",https://www.businessrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BioMADE-logo.jpeg,N,,2025-08-15 17:56:25.128155

The deal includes all intellectual property, technology, and leadership tied to a planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pilot plant. Financial terms remain undisclosed.

The sale follows layoffs affecting seven of Southwest’s ten sustainability staff, signaling a shift in focus just as the aviation sector faces mounting pressure to meet net-zero goals by 2050. Southwest says it still intends to cut single-use plastics by 50% by 2025 and reduce carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030, alongside replacing 10% of its jet fuel with SAF. Whether that last target is achievable without Saffire is now uncertain.

Industry-wide, SAF adoption remains slow due to high costs, supply constraints, and questionable lifecycle emissions benefits.

How to reset things with Mexico

By Jordan Brennan, RBC’s Head of Thought Leadership

Six months into President Trump’s trade war, with no deal in sight, Canada has good reason to deepen its partnership with Mexico. (And, based on a couple of recent trips south, the federal and Alberta governments agree).

Despite being Canada’s third largest trading partner, Mexico accounts for less than 4% of Canada’s global merchandise trade, the bulk of which is imports. In 2024, Canada shipped just $9 billion of goods to Mexico while importing $47 billion of Mexican goods.

Make no mistake, no country can displace the U.S. when it comes to trading significance for Canada. But we see three broad areas where Canada and Mexico can deepen ties.

Build Bridges & Infrastructure. Canada’s ‘Maple Eight’ pension funds, with north of $2 trillion in assets, are among the largest in the world and possess expertise in major infrastructure projects like pipelines, rail and port capacity. That’s what Mexico needs: patient capital with financing expertise. Canadian capital is a source of financial influence that could be leveraged to advance geopolitical and trade interests, and enhance commercial ties. Canadian Pacific Kansas City Rail’s investment in the Patrick J. Ottensmeyer International Railway Bridge—a $100M project launched earlier this year that deployed innovative technology to improve continental cargo mobility on the U.S.-Mexico border—is a case in point.

Boost Bilateral Trade. Many of Canada’s export industries—from energy to steel and aluminum, copper, agri-food, softwood lumber, pulp and paper, and plastics—are products the 130-million strong nation imports. Enhanced trade flows, underwritten by the current CUSMA, could help several of our stressed industries find relief.

Unite On CUSMA. While the U.S. will remain the cornerstone of North American trade, both Canada and Mexico must prepare for the joint review of the CUSMA, which is officially scheduled for 2026 but may come sooner. Rather than being played against one another, which Trump has successfully orchestrated until now, diplomatic coordination between Canada and Mexico could affirm treaty mechanisms, ensuring duty-free access for CUSMA-compliant goods. Trade irritants in specific industries (think supply management) and trans-shipment for Chinese goods must be managed. With trade nested in a broader framework that includes border security, defence, infrastructure, and supply chain integrity, all three countries can be made better off by deepening their cooperation, ensuring balanced and mutually beneficial trade across the bloc.

Canola in the crossfire

By Yadullah Hussain, Managing Editor, RBC Thought Leadership

Canada’s canola crisis has deepened. Beijing’s 75.8% duty on Canada’s most valuable crop comes after its preliminary investigation found Ottawa provided subsidies and preferential treatment to its farmers.

The levy on canola seeds adds to Beijing’s 100% tariffs already in effect on Canada’s canola oil and meals. Back in April, the Canadian Canola Growers Association (CCGA) told us that farmers were freezing investments over fears that a tariff on canola seeds was the “big shoe to drop.” Chris Davison, President and CEO of the Canola Council of Canada, now believes the Chinese market is “effectively closed” to Canadian canola producers.

That’s another $4.5 billion of commodity trade disrupted and now in search of new, tariff-free markets, joining lumber, aluminum and steel.

Here’s how Canada’s canola crisis is playing out:

Squeezed by two economic giants: Could Beijing be trying to get Ottawa to remove the 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, and 25% on Chinese steel and aluminum? Beijing will make a final call on canola seed duties in September. But Ottawa is in a bind as it had raised tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to appease Washington’s concern that countries, including China, were Canada as a backdoor to the U.S. market.

Meal plan goes awry: China’s canola meal imports from Canada whittled down to 32,506 tonnes in June—from 141,938 tonnes in June 2024—Statistics Canada data shows.

Oil turmoil: Canada’s canola oil exportsto China amounted to a big fat zero from China in June, industry data shows.

Seed money: Canada’s canola seed shipment to China had fallen to 237,897 tonnes by June 2025, compared to 651,080 tonnes during the same period last year.

Farmers want a cash injection: Farmers should not be asked to borrow their way through a crisis that’s not of their making, the CCGA states. Although that would only exacerbate Beijing’s concerns of Ottawa subsidizing the industry.

Beijing’s concerns of Ottawa subsidizing the industry.

Ease the pain: Boosting domestic demand and processing capacity of biofuels like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) presents one opportunity to diversify canola demand as a biofuel feedstock. According to Lisa Ashton, our Agriculture Policy Lead: “Canada should consider looking at other countries’ playbooks for expanding domestic biofuel markets and agriculture’s role in its growth.” Brazil, Japan, and Malaysia are all expanding processing capacity for biofuels including SAF and increasing required biodiesel and ethanol blends in convention fuels.

“Our limitation is not policy, but infrastructure”

Q: What can the federal government do to lessen our dependence on the U.S.?

A: We face significant constraints. Canada’s ability to expand trade with other countries through trade agreements is largely exhausted. India and China, for geopolitical reasons, are unlikely prospects in the near term. Our limitation is not policy, but infrastructure. Geography remains a stubborn fact that requires substantial infrastructure investment. Expanding upon our rail and port infrastructure is a renewed priority federally but will take many years to move the needle.

Q: What do you see as the long-term impact of Trump’s tariff wars globally?

A: The uncertainty from tariff threats alone dampens investment. That itself may lead to a permanent reduction in Canadian productivity if investors perceive a higher level of risk in Canada due to uncertain market access in the U.S. Globally, if there’s one lesson from the 1930s, it’s that protectionist spirals deepen economic pain for all participants. While tariffs might temporarily boost some U.S. industries, the costs to global efficiency and consumer welfare would be substantial.

Q: Are there any new insights that challenge the prevailing wisdom about the broad-based benefits of free trade?

A: The fundamental case for liberalized trade remains strong. But it requires resources, production, and employment to shift across sectors and regions. Some of my work suggests between 1-2% of Canada’s workforce could migrate across provinces in response to eliminating internal trade costs. While these moves are productivity-enhancing for the overall economy in the long run, there are adjustment costs for individuals and some affected businesses impose significant short-term costs on those individuals.

“I say hogwash.” Both men agreed that increasing demand is the fastest way to boost prices, though high input costs remain a problem.","KEARNEY, Neb. – “We have the potential to lose an entire generation of farmers in the next couple years,” said Jan tenBensel, a Cambridge farmer and chair of the Nebraska Ethanol Board.

TenBensel’s warning comes as Nebraska braces for what could be a record corn crop — a bounty that’s creating challenges in marketing grain at a profitable price.

Governor Jim Pillen, a hog farmer turned politician, continues to frame agriculture as the centerpiece of his plan to grow the state.

“We have an extraordinary economy in this state. Agriculture’s a key piece, manufacturing too. We make things nowhere else in the world can be made. We need to brag, and appreciate it more,” Pillen said at the Governor’s Summit in Kearney.

Pillen says Nebraska must move away from selling raw commodities and toward value-added agriculture.

“We are tired of putting corn and soybeans on barges and shipping them around the world. We’re giving the topsoil away. We’re getting out of the commodity business and creating more value,” he told the Rural Radio Network.

That includes carbon capture projects aimed at producing low-carbon fuel for cars and airplanes.

“The extraordinary bioeconomy includes sustainable aviation fuel. We’ve spearheaded that. A lot of states haven’t been able to go there because of politics. We don’t play politics,” Pillen said.

USDA Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden echoed the call, saying that when people pass Nebraska’s cornfields, they should think “fuel” as much as “food.”

“Nebraska’s leading the charge with biofuels but we need a permanent E15 solution from Congress so businesses can invest with certainty,” Vaden said.

TenBensel argues that year-round E15 could be a lifeline for farmers.

“For each percent of national ethanol we increase, it’s about a half-billion bushels of corn… This is a lot of corn, a low price, well below the price of production. We have to use more of our corn here at home,” he said.

Trade was another hot topic at the summit. Vaden noted that U.S. agricultural exports have slipped from surplus into deficit. While tariffs draw headlines, he said other barriers are just as damaging.

“Many of the barriers producers face aren’t just tariffs… they’re false claims about health or pest risks… and that’s bunk,” Vaden said.

“You used the word bunk,” Pillen interjected. “I say hogwash.”

Both men agreed that increasing demand is the fastest way to boost prices, though high input costs remain a problem.

TenBensel closed his remarks with optimism about corn’s potential beyond fuel.

AI growth is driving an urgent need for around-the-clock power that intermittent renewables cannot deliver. Nuclear is stepping into that gap, offering unmatched reliability, zero emissions and multi-decade operating lives.

Figure 1 shows which operators have new build and repower potential across their nuclear fleets, divided into tiers of progress. Projects in Tier 1 provide the biggest opportunities for quick-turn partnerships, a perfect example being Holtec’s ongoing repower of its Palisades Nuclear Generation Station. Federal tax credit extensions, bonus depreciation and incentives for nuclear energy communities are adding further tailwinds, making new investments and long-term contracts even more attractive. This policy backdrop is also spurring new investment in small modular reactors, with operators like VST, TLN and CEG exploring projects that could add flexible, carbon-free capacity in new locations and on faster timelines.

For plant owners, the pitch is straightforward: data centers will pay a premium for guaranteed megawatts, evidenced by NRG announcing the signing of a 10-year contract at $70-$90 per megawatt hour in its Q2 earnings call last week. For investors, these agreements can revalue projects overnight, and analysts are keeping a close eye on every hint of a new deal. If you are sitting on spare nuclear capacity, the market is sending clear signals – buyers and capital are here and deals are getting done.

The deployment is part of a wider carbon removal project under development by Deep Sky, a Canadian DAC start-up with backers that include Bill Gates.
Capable of recovering 50 tonnes of CO2 per year, its captured carbon is used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
According to MZT, this latest Canadian deployment marks not only a fivefold increase in scale of capture from that first platform, but also a 60 per cent reduction in cost.
“Mission Zero’s strategy has always centred around commercial viability - meaning we make smaller DAC systems out of ‘off-the-shelf’ parts, serving established supply chains.","Powered by solar energy, Mission Zero Technologies’ (MZT) containerised electrochemical DAC system will suck up to 250 tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere per year from a site in Alberta, Canada. Unlike MZT’s previous projects, the CO2 recovered will be permanently sequestered, injected 2km underground.

The deployment is part of a wider carbon removal project under development by Deep Sky, a Canadian DAC start-up with backers that include Bill Gates. Deep Sky’s flagship Alpha project in Alberta is a ‘tech-agnostic’ hub where multiple DAC platforms are being tested, with the sequestered CO2 used to generate carbon credits.

MZT launched its first plant in 2023, developed in partnership with Sheffield University. Capable of recovering 50 tonnes of CO2 per year, its captured carbon is used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). According to MZT, this latest Canadian deployment marks not only a fivefold increase in scale of capture from that first platform, but also a 60 per cent reduction in cost.

“This electrochemical air capture recovers five times more carbon and is 60 per cent cheaper than our first deployment in 2023 in Sheffield - a remarkable improvement by any measure,” said Dr Nicholas Chadwick, MZT co-founder and CEO.

“Mission Zero’s strategy has always centred around commercial viability - meaning we make smaller DAC systems out of ‘off-the-shelf’ parts, serving established supply chains. This approach has been a big factor in our ability to progress beyond the lab more quickly than other DAC providers, turning theoretical solutions into proven, practical ones.

“By deploying more quickly, our DAC solutions are able to gather the data investors and future customers need to see and give our team a head start on optimising our systems.”

MZT’s second deployment, also capable of capturing 250 tonnes of CO2, is exploring a different strand of utilisation.

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong.
For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network.
The Cathay Group also includes cargo division Cathay Cargo, low-cost carrier HK Express and various other subsidiaries.","DHL Express purchases 2,400 tonnes of SAF from Cathay Group to be used on flights operated by Air Hong Kong, an express all-cargo carrier and wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay.

The SAF will be used on Air Hong Kong flights departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita and Singapore Changi airports.

The new agreement underscores both parties' commitment to lower-carbon air logistics and driving the production and use of SAF for the air cargo sector.

Wednesday 13 August 2025 DHL Express and the Cathay Group have entered into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership that reinforces their shared commitment to reducing carbon emissions in the air cargo industry. Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights departing from three airports in Asia namely Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express. ?

Continuing through 2025, the partnership is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 tonnes - equivalent to the emissions of over 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore with an Airbus 330 freighter. ? ?

DHL Express Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation - Asia Pacific Peter Bardens said: 'Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand.

'DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group's Strategy 2030, which recognises 'green logistics of choice' as one of the four bottom lines.' ?

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

Cathay Director Cargo Tom Owen said: 'This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia.'

This collaboration makes DHL Express the latest strategic partner of Cathay's Corporate SAF Programme, an initiative launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight through the use of SAF. In 2024, the Corporate SAF Programme enabled the use of over 6,000 tonnes of SAF, with a record 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA and Standard Chartered. ?

Cathay has been steadily expanding its SAF efforts across the region. Earlier in 2025, the Group entered into an agreement with Sinopec to uplift SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland at Hong Kong International Airport, marking the first such export by Sinopec to Hong Kong. Additionally, Cathay has partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027. Apart from working closely with suppliers, the Group also co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) to collectively drive policy development and adoption of SAF locally. These initiatives reflect Cathay's mission to expand the use of SAF within its network and foster a regional SAF ecosystem.

Investments in SAF are therefore critical to ensuring its availability on a long-term and predictable basis. DHL Express has also been a frontrunner in scaling SAF uptake globally, securing long-term SAF agreements with multiple partners, including Neste, bp, and World Energy. Earlier this year, DHL Express also partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use SAF produced in Japan for flights departing the country. Most recently, DHL Express completed an agreement with Neste that comprises 7,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport, further demonstrating the company's proactive approach to driving SAF demand and supply across the region. ?

These efforts will also enhance DHL's understanding of how to transport these alternative fuels, as it is a segment under its Strategy 2030's key growth sector, 'New Energy.' DHL Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage systems, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen. ?

In 2024, the profit was 905 million euros. This is the first time since the pandemic that the company made a profit in its quarter earnings.

IAG’s financial performance

In terms of revenue, there was an 8% improvement from 14.724 billion euros in the first half of last year to 15.906 billion euros in the first half of 2025. This shows that IAG’s airlines are becoming more popular with customers. In addition, the fact that revenue has increased but profit has increased to a greater extent indicates that cost control has also improved.

The situation has not always been so easy for the company. During the pandemic, IAG’s financial performance, like many, was severely affected due to governments restricting international travel. In the aftermath, the subsequent surge in demand and resulting staff shortages (as many had been laid off during the pandemic when demand was less) meant that the recovery took time, as airports had to restrict flight numbers to reduce congestion. British Airways, one of IAG’s subsidiaries, was credited for taking the initiative to voluntarily reduce flight numbers before mandatory restrictions came in.

Further Investments

Now that IAG is well and truly back in the black, there are ambitious plans for IAG’s investments. In Latin America (which includes Mexico and Central American countries), IAG’s growth in 2024 resulted in a 16% increase in seat capacity (number of seats available). In the first half of 2025, there has already been a 7% increase in seat capacity. There is also expansion taking place in North America, with growth in seat capacity of 1.1%. In Europe, IAG’s growth was overall 2.8% in terms of seat capacity for flights within Europe in general and 3.5% for flights domestically within Spain.

IAG is also strengthening its airline value by investing in improving its customer experience. British Airways, for example, has refreshed lounges in Lagos, Seattle, Singapore and Washington Dulles airport in the first half of 2025. It has plans to refit its Dubai and Miami lounges in the second half of the year. Aer Lingus, another IAG subsidiary, is introducing artificial intelligence (which is essentially technology-assisted customer service) to provide customers with a quicker service. In addition, the airline is also introducing a self-service tool for hotel accommodation to use in the event of disruption. Iberia, the Spanish flagship carrier and another subsidiary of IAG, is rolling out free Wi-Fi to its club members. Finally, Vueling, another Spanish subsidiary, is rolling out onboard Wi-Fi.

IAG’s airlines are also investing in improving their operational performance, with British Airways and Aer Lingus having both improved in their punctuality. Iberia and Vueling also remain among the most punctual airlines in the world. IAG is also investing in modernising its fleet to reduce fuel consumption, providing more up-to-date cabins for customers and reducing carbon emissions.

Reducing Carbon Emissions

In addition to modernising its fleet, IAG is also taking other steps to reduce carbon emissions. IAG reports that it is progressing towards its aim to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This means that on balance, it is on track to have no carbon emissions by this time. In the first half of 2025, the company secured 200,000 tonnes of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which was a 25 % increase year-on-year. Sustainable aviation fuel is made from ethanol and other plant extracts and has a lower carbon footprint when compared to traditional jet fuel.

As one can see, this is a positive story for IAG’s financial performance. IAG is no longer well and truly in the black in terms of its financial bottom line. It is also making further investments to improve the customer experience and expand its reach. We have to wait to see how this progresses.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/aerlingus3.jpg,N,,2025-08-15 12:57:31.132160

Gevo North Dakota offers large volumes of third-party-certified BECCS credits with guaranteed delivery.

Our high-integrity durable carbon removal credits are generated from a process called Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), providing quantifiable, certified-permanent carbon removals to help companies to mitigate their carbon footprint. These credits are generated from our operational project and ready to retire immediately.

Here’s How Carbon Dioxide Removal Works

Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) removes carbon from the atmosphere by capturing CO2 generated by the fermentation process during ethanol production. The resulting biogenic CO2 stream (as a result of fermentation) is cleaned using a water scrubber, which separates any remaining ethanol and other impurities to produce a pure stream of CO2. From the scrubber, the captured, biogenic CO2 is sent to compressors. Upon compression, the CO2 is dehydrated to remove any remaining water and is then sent to a refrigeration unit where it is subcooled to a liquid. The condensed CO2 is then lightly distilled and pumped through a flowline to a Class VI injection well onsite, where it is sequestered permanently in the Broom Creek formation.

BECCS at Gevo North Dakota: Onsite Class VI well and no transportation needed

The entire carbon capture and sequestration process occurs at the Gevo North Dakota site and no offsite transportation of CO2 is needed. The facility site (both for the ethanol and co-products production, carbon capture equipment and the Class VI well) is approximately 150 acres in Richardton, North Dakota. The Gevo North Dakota property is ideally situated above the Broom Creek geological formation and can expand its annual CCS volumes from 180,000 tCO2 per year today to 1 million tCO2 each year.

The Class VI well permit and sequestered volumes are available on the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources website.

Process efficiency is crucial in a biofuels plant because it directly impacts the overall sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benefits of biofuel production.
Waste management regulations: Biofuel production can generate by products and wastes, including spent biomass, ash, and chemical residues.","With ambitious targets set under the Climate Change Act, the UK aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Biofuels, particularly second-generation biofuels made from waste or non-food biomass, have gained prominence as part of this solution. They offer a renewable alternative to traditional fuels and can be integrated into existing energy infrastructures with relatively minor adjustments.

A significant development in the biofuel sector is the introduction of mandates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The UK’s SAF mandate, driven by the need to decarbonise the aviation industry, requires airlines to increase the proportion of SAF in their fuel mix over the coming years (2% of the total aviation fuel mix must be SAF in 2025, rising to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040). This target increases annually to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040[1].

This regulatory shift has created a surge in demand for biofuel production facilities that can supply SAF, sparking a wave of investment and innovation. For biofuel producers, this presents both an opportunity, whilst also bringing in further challenges, such as scaling up production while meeting stringent quality and sustainability standards, more competition for feedstocks, and greater pressure on cost and carbon efficiency requirements.

In addition, the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) is a significant initiative aimed at accelerating the development and commercial deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production technologies. With an allocation of over £135 million, the AFF supports innovative projects that convert waste materials and by-products, such as household waste and industrial gases, into low-carbon fuels.

This initiative is part of the government’s broader strategy to achieve net zero emissions and enhance the UK’s position as a leader in the SAF industry. The fund is expected to create up to 10,000 green jobs by 2035 and contribute approximately £1.8 billion annually to the UK economy[2].

In this dynamic and rapidly evolving biofuel production sector, staying ahead of regulatory requirements and sound engineering practice is more crucial than ever. Successfully developing, constructing, and operating a biofuel production plant involves navigating complex engineering, planning, and permitting processes - requiring careful consideration to ensure both regulatory compliance and overall project success.

Engineering

The engineering of biofuel production facilities involves designing efficient and sustainable systems to maximise yield and minimise environmental impact.

Key considerations:

Feedstock selection and handling: Different feedstocks, such as agricultural residues, waste oils, or purpose-grown crops, require specific processing methods and storage systems. Proper engineering ensures that feedstock is handled and processed in a way that optimises production while minimising emissions and waste.

Process technology: Biofuel production can involve biochemical processes (like fermentation and anaerobic digestion) or thermochemical methods (such as pyrolysis and gasification). Selecting the appropriate technology based on feedstock availability and end-product requirements is crucial. Engineering teams must also design systems for efficient energy and resource use, integrating heat recovery and emissions control measures.

Process efficiency is crucial in a biofuels plant because it directly impacts the overall sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental benefits of biofuel production. Efficient processes ensure that the maximum amount of biofuel is produced from the available feedstock, minimising waste and reducing the consumption of resources such as water and energy.

Waste and by-product management: Biofuel processes generate by-products like CO2, solid residues, or wastewater. Engineering solutions should address efficient by-product utilisation or safe disposal. Innovations like biogas capture for energy recovery or nutrient recycling in agriculture can add value and improve sustainability.

Safety and risk management: Handling flammable or corrosive materials requires robust safety measures, including fire suppression systems, chemical containment, and proper ventilation. A well-engineered facility minimises risks to both human health and the environment.

Planning

Key considerations:

The planning system must support innovation while balancing environmental, social and economic impacts. Some key elements that must be considered when planning for biofuel facilities:

Site selection and community involvement: Biofuels can be highly localised, meaning site selection plays a critical role in minimising transport emissions and logistical costs. Engaging local communities in the planning process ensures buy-in and mitigates potential objections related to noise, odour, and traffic.

Integration with existing infrastructure: Many biofuel projects can be co-located with existing agricultural, industrial, or waste-processing facilities. This can streamline the planning approval process while reducing land-use conflicts.

Planning policy: Biofuel projects must accord with both local development plans and national policies, such as the UK's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), to ensure compliance and long-term viability. Planning professionals must work closely with policy experts to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.

Environmental impact assessments (EIA): Ensuring that biofuel production facilities do not adversely affect biodiversity, local ecosystems, water resources or local amenities. Proper waste management and emission control are crucial to avoid new environmental challenges.

As biofuel technology advances and the demand for renewable energy sources grows, the UK planning system will need to adapt to facilitate these projects while addressing concerns over land use, environmental impact, and community well-being. A proactive approach that fosters collaboration between developers, planners, and local stakeholders is essential for building a sustainable future.

Biofuels are not just a part of the renewable energy puzzle; they offer a way to harness the UK's agricultural potential and waste streams in the journey towards a greener, more resilient energy landscape.

Environmental permitting regulations

As biofuel production facilities become integral to this energy transition, navigating the complex landscape of environmental regulations is essential. Environmental permits serve as a safeguard, ensuring that operations meet the required standards for air, water, and soil quality. However, the process of obtaining these permits is intricate, requiring detailed documentation, technical expertise, and a thorough understanding of the regulatory environment.

The Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR) 2016 (as amended) and similar devolved regulations require operators of specified activities to obtain and comply with the conditions of an environmental permit.

Once obtained, the environmental permit will contain conditions on management, operations, emissions & monitoring and record keeping/reporting. Monitoring of emissions, effluents, and other environmental parameters is often required to ensure ongoing compliance with permit conditions. This includes submitting regular reports to the relevant regulatory agencies and maintaining accurate records.

Key considerations:

Air pollution

Odour emissions: Biofuel facilities often handle odorous materials such as feedstock and run-off lagoons. If these sources are not adequately enclosed or treated, they can release unpleasant odours into the atmosphere, affecting local air quality and community well-being. Effective odour management strategies, including proper enclosure and treatment systems, are essential to mitigate this risk.

NOx and SOx emissions: The combustion of biogas in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants or other combustion sources can release nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx). These emissions contribute to air pollution, leading to respiratory issues and environmental degradation. Implementing advanced combustion technologies and emission control systems can help reduce these pollutants.

Ammonia emissions: Depending on the type of fuel and combustion efficiency, biofuel production can result in ammonia (NH3) emissions. Ammonia contributes to nitrogen deposition and acidification of ecosystems, which can harm plant and animal life. Monitoring and optimising combustion processes are crucial to minimise ammonia emissions.

Dust and particulate matter (PM): Dust can be generated from various stages of biofuel production, including feedstock handling, vehicle movement, and processing. The nature of the material and its moisture content can influence dust levels. Dust control measures, such as water sprays and dust suppressants, are necessary to prevent airborne particulate matter from affecting air quality and human health.

Bioaerosols: Bioaerosols are airborne particles that contain biological material, such as bacteria and fungi. These can be released during feedstock handling, especially when open sources are present, and from vented emissions. Inadequate abatement systems can exacerbate this risk. Proper ventilation and filtration systems are essential to control bioaerosol emissions.

Land pollution

Spills and leaks: The storage of raw materials, fuels, and processed biofuels poses a risk of spills and leaks. These incidents can contaminate the surrounding land, leading to soil degradation and potential harm to local ecosystems. To mitigate this risk, facilities must use bunded tanks that can contain 110% of the maximum capacity of the largest tank within the bund. Regular inspections and maintenance of storage infrastructure are also critical.

Hazardous by-products: The biofuel production process can generate hazardous by-products, including wastewater that may contain harmful substances. Proper treatment of process effluent on-site before discharge is necessary to prevent land contamination. Facilities must adhere to strict waste management protocols to handle and dispose of hazardous materials safely.

Water pollution

Run-off and effluent: Run-off from biofuel production sites can carry pollutants into nearby water bodies, affecting water quality and aquatic life. This includes run-off from feedstock storage areas and processing sites. Implementing effective run-off management practices, such as containment systems and treatment facilities, is essential to prevent water pollution.

Wastewater treatment: The production process generates wastewater that may contain organic and inorganic pollutants. This wastewater requires treatment before it can be safely discharged into sewers or surface water bodies. Advanced wastewater treatment systems are necessary to remove contaminants and ensure compliance with discharge regulations.

Operational noise: The equipment and processes used in biofuel production can generate significant noise, which could be disruptive to local communities. Permit applications may involve producing a Noise Impact Assessment and Noise Management Plan, as well as implementing noise reduction measures, such as soundproofing, operational limits, or buffer zones.

Waste management regulations: Biofuel production can generate by products and wastes, including spent biomass, ash, and chemical residues. Regulators will enforce compliance to ensure that by-products and wastes are properly classified, stored, and disposed of correctly.

Energy consumption: Biofuel production can be energy-intensive. BAT requirements may mean that facilities are required to implement an energy efficiency savings plan.

The government decided not to provide direct financial support, leaving 160 workers at Vivergo's Saltend-based plant facing redundancy, with layoffs set to begin on Monday. Ensus' plant in Redcar is also at risk of closure.

In a statement, a government spokesperson said: “We have worked closely with the companies since June to understand the financial challenges they have faced over the past decade, and have taken the difficult decision not to offer direct funding as it would not provide value for the taxpayer or solve the long-term problems the industry faces.”

Vivergo’s future was thrown into doubt after the U.K.-U.S. trade deal, announced in May, opened the door to 1.4 billion liters of tariff-free American ethanol — almost equivalent to the size of the entire domestic market.

The decision has wider implications for other industries and investment into Britain. Vivergo had been lined up to supply feedstock for a £1.25 billion sustainable aviation fuel facility backed by Meld Energy — a project now on hold. Over 12,000 U.K. wheat farmers supply Vivergo's plant, which also produces high-protein animal feed.

Meanwhile, Ensus, one of the U.K.’s only other bioethanol producers, supplies around 30 percent of the country’s commercial carbon dioxide — needed for soft drinks and medical use.

“We recognize this is a difficult time for the workers and their families and we will work with trade unions, local partners and the companies to support them through this process,” said the government spokesperson. “We also continue to work up proposals that ensure the resilience of our CO2 supply in the long-term in consultation with the sector.”

The decision will also prove unpopular with voters in Hull, with the Saltend chemical park just a 10-minute drive away.

Reform UK's Luke Campbell, who recently swept into office as Hull an East Yorkshire mayor with nearly 50,000 votes, told POLITICO: “Labour’s decision not to provide support, and not to change the clause in their U.S.-U.K. Trade deal is incredibly disappointing. It means job losses and closures for hard working people.”","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/15/3372748-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-08-15 11:57:03.467693

As airlines grapple with the dual pressures of safety mandates and profitability, investors must discern which carriers and adjacent sectors are best positioned to thrive in this transformed landscape. Recent policy shifts—such as Emirates' power bank ban and the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) accessibility reforms—underscore a broader industry pivot toward risk mitigation and operational resilience. This article examines the financial implications of these changes for major carriers and identifies undervalued aviation-related stocks poised to capitalize on the new normal.

Regulatory Evolution: Safety as a Strategic Imperative

The past two years have seen a surge in safety-focused regulations, reflecting a global prioritization of passenger welfare and risk reduction. Emirates' 2025 power bank ban, for instance, is emblematic of a sector-wide response to lithium-ion battery risks. By prohibiting in-flight charging and restricting storage to accessible locations, Emirates aims to minimize thermal runaway incidents—a growing concern as portable electronics proliferate. This policy aligns with similar measures by Asian carriers and the UK Civil Aviation Authority, signaling a coordinated effort to address a systemic hazard.

Meanwhile, the U.S. DOT has intensified its focus on disability accommodations, enforcing the Final Rule on Ensuring Safe Accommodations for Air Travelers with Disabilities Using Wheelchairs. This regulation, which mandates improved training and infrastructure for wheelchair handling, has already triggered significant penalties for non-compliant carriers. American Airlines, for example, faced a $50 million fine for mishandling wheelchairs, while Lufthansa was penalized $4 million for discriminatory practices. These enforcement actions highlight the operational and reputational costs of regulatory missteps, compelling airlines to invest in compliance infrastructure.

Financial Implications: Compliance Costs and Margin Compression

The financial burden of these regulations is substantial. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) compliance costs will reach $1 billion in 2025, while Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) expenses are projected to add $4.8 billion to industry costs. SAF, which remains 4.2 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, is a particular strain on carriers in Europe and Asia, where mandates like the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation policy demand aggressive blending targets.

These costs are eroding profit margins, which are expected to hover at 3.7% in 2025—up marginally from 3.4% in 2024 but still below the global industrial average. Airlines are passing these expenses to consumers through higher ticket prices, but this strategy risks further demand suppression in a market still recovering from pandemic-induced volatility. For instance, Spirit Airlines' recent Chapter 11 emergence and “going concern” warning illustrate the fragility of carriers unable to balance compliance costs with revenue growth.

Undervalued Opportunities: Beyond the Traditional Carrier Model

As traditional airlines struggle with regulatory and environmental headwinds, investors are increasingly turning to sectors with inherent resilience: digital rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms. These industries are not only adapting to regulatory pressures but also leveraging technology to redefine mobility and supply chain efficiency.

Digital Rail: A Sustainable Alternative to Air Travel

The global digital railway market, projected to grow from $83.74 billion in 2024 to $230.60 billion by 2034, is a prime example of this shift. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP), a leader in North American freight rail, has demonstrated robust operational resilience, with a 100-basis-point improvement in its operating ratio to 59.0% in Q2 2025. Its integration of AI and IoT for route optimization and predictive maintenance positions it as a key beneficiary of the post-pandemic shift toward sustainable infrastructure.

Regional Logistics: Powering E-Commerce Growth

The regional logistics sector, driven by e-commerce and urbanization, is another high-conviction area. FedEx (NYSE: FDX), for instance, has a Valuation Rating of B and a Due Diligence Score of 46—well above the logistics industry average. Its investments in electric delivery vehicles and AI-powered route planning have enhanced efficiency, with analysts projecting an 18.91% upside in its stock price. Similarly, ZTO Express (NYSE: ZTO), a dominant player in China's express delivery market, has leveraged automation and drone technology to expand its market share, achieving a 1.21% gain in 2025 despite sector-wide challenges.

Digital Travel Platforms: Integrating Mobility Solutions

Digital travel platforms are redefining consumer expectations by offering seamless, multimodal travel experiences. These platforms, which combine rail, regional air, and digital booking systems, are projected to capture 30% of the global travel market by 2030. Companies that integrate AI for real-time route optimization and dynamic pricing are particularly well-positioned to outperform traditional airlines, which face fare volatility and operational inefficiencies.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Risk and Resilience

For investors, the key lies in identifying assets that align with the long-term trajectory of the aviation ecosystem. While major carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) have shown valuation rebounds, their high uncertainty ratings and thin margins make them speculative plays. Conversely, undervalued stocks in rail and logistics—such as FedEx, ZTO Express, and Union Pacific—offer a more stable path to growth, supported by structural trends like decarbonization, urbanization, and digital transformation.

Conclusion: A New Paradigm for Aviation Investing

The post-pandemic aviation landscape is defined by regulatory scrutiny, environmental imperatives, and technological disruption. While traditional carriers face margin compression and compliance challenges, adjacent sectors are emerging as beacons of resilience. By prioritizing investments in digital rail, regional logistics, and integrated travel platforms, investors can hedge against the volatility of the airline sector while capitalizing on the next wave of innovation in global mobility. In this new paradigm, operational resilience—rather than mere cost-cutting—will be the cornerstone of sustainable value creation.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-15 12:57:39.102432

At 90 years old, Newcastle International Airport stands not at the end of an era, but at the beginning of its most exciting chapter yet.","Over the decades, Newcastle Airport has become far more than a place to catch a flight. It is a civic symbol, an economic powerhouse, and a deeply personal landmark for generations of people in the North East.

During my time as a board member, I was proud to help shape a vision that looked beyond the airport’s role as a transport hub. I believed then, and believe now, that Newcastle International should be seen as a civic anchor and a catalyst for the future; a place that doesn’t just move people, but drives progress.

It is, above all, a window to the world. From family holidays and new business ventures to academic journeys and emotional reunions, it is a place tied to countless moments that matter.

It is a window to the world. For so many people in the North East, it is the place where journeys begin and end. It is where first holidays took off, where businesses shook hands with global markets, where students left for the unknown and returned wiser, and where families embraced with relief, excitement, or longing. It is a place woven into the emotional map of millions of lives.

How many stories could be told by those who passed through this airport over the past 90 years? How many lives changed by a single journey? How many relationships, careers, or ideas were born from its departure lounge? This airport is part of our region’s story – but it also holds the stories of the people who make this region what it is.

Every gate and departure board holds a million stories.

Today, the airport connects us to over 80 destinations through 16 airline partners, with onward links to more than 325 cities worldwide. It handled more than 5.1 million passengers in 2024, making it the 11th busiest airport in the UK. It’s consistently among the most efficient too – 98% of travellers clear security in under ten minutes.

Importantly, and a clear indication of the calibre of the team running the airport, it has also become a recognised leader in the aviation world. In 2024, Newcastle International was named Overall Winner at the Routes World Awards in Bahrain – the first UK airport ever to receive that honour – and also won UK & Ireland Airport of the Year from the Travel Trade Gazette. These aren’t just awards – they’re proof that a regional airport, owned by and for its region, can lead with pride on the global stage.

More than £20 million has been invested into terminal upgrades, including a fully refurbished departure lounge, next-generation security systems, and the world’s first three-tier Aspire Lounge. But what’s most important is what this investment represents: confidence – in the airport, in the region, and in the people it serves.

And yet, the most exciting part of Newcastle International’s story is not what it has achieved, but what lies ahead.

Newcastle airport: a low-carbon future

The airport is now a central partner in developing the North East Green Superport; what could be a transformational project to integrate air, sea, rail, and road to create a low-carbon logistics and freight network. This isn’t just a port strategy – it’s a new model for regional economic development, rooted in sustainability, innovation, and inclusion. The airport’s role within this network will go far beyond passengers. It will serve as a strategic export hub, connecting regional manufacturing, green energy, and innovation sectors to global markets.

This vision also aligns with the airport’s firm commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2035. This is a target underpinned by serious action: electrifying ground operations, investing in sustainable aviation fuel, and collaborating with universities and tech partners on aviation decarbonisation. Aviation must be part of the climate solution, and Newcastle is stepping forward to prove that it can be.

Newcastle airport: a public asset

What makes Newcastle International so exceptional is that it is owned by us – by the people of this region. Through our local authorities, we have a stake in its success. That means its profits, priorities, and plans are not dictated from afar but shaped by local needs and local people.

It is rooted in public purpose. Its profits are reinvested. Its priorities reflect regional needs. It is accountable not only to passengers, but to the communities of Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, Durham, Northumberland, and South Tyneside.

Looking ahead, I’m sure the airport will continue to play a leading role – not just in infrastructure or transport, but in telling the story of the North East to the world. Championing cultural exports, opening new trade routes, supporting creative industries, attracting inward investment, and inspiring the next generation to see the world as theirs to shape.

It means being bolder than ever: investing in green aviation innovation, becoming a testbed for regional skills and careers, supporting inclusive growth, and ensuring that the people who live near the airport also benefit from its success – in jobs, education, and opportunity.

At 90 years old, Newcastle International Airport stands not at the end of an era, but at the beginning of its most exciting chapter yet. It is no longer simply a place of departures and arrivals; it is a launchpad for ideas, innovation, and ambition. A civic asset with global reach. A regional institution with a world-class future.

It has helped generations of North Easterners see the world, and now it’s helping the world see us – not as a peripheral region, but as a centre of climate leadership, industry, creativity, and possibility.

So, here’s to the past 90 years of flight, of stories, and of connection. And here’s to what comes next:",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSNCRcNFBlA4Mnts/56f1d70f7173789e58e29ee5421e5fd88c3085512bbaab99b01150f977786f82/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=basic-6&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2023%252F10%252Fnwb0.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F08%252FIMG_2276.jpeg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22From%2520Woolsington%2520to%2520the%2520world%253A%2520celebrating%252090%2520years%2520of%2520Newcastle%2520Airport%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fnortheastbylines.co.uk%2Fregion%2Fnorth-east%2Ffrom-woolsington-to-the-world-celebrating-90-years-of-newcastle-airport,N,,2025-08-15 11:57:16.690232

African Gen Z isn’t just laughing.","If you’re African and online, chances are your first taste of politics came not from a news broadcast, but from a meme.

A screenshot. A freeze-frame. A line of text in Impact font. Maybe it made you laugh, then made you think. Maybe it made you mad enough to post, to protest, to speak. Across the continent, memes have emerged as one of Gen Z’s sharpest weapons against injustice, a digital dialect of rebellion where punchlines deliver punches to power.

Say goodbye to long speeches and manifestoes. Welcome to Africa’s meme wars, where humor is resistance, virality is visibility, and Gen Z doesn’t just witness history, they remix it. Memes, once considered funny internet detritus, have become tools of socio-political commentary in African digital life.

During the 2020 Nigeria #EndSARS protests against police brutality, memes took the place of protest banners. Stringing together viral images of a cartoon SpongeBob designed as a Nigerian protester, phrases like ‘Soro Soke’ (‘speak up’ in Yoruba) became a meme, a slogan, but overall a movement. The digital rebellion moved into the streets and, in time, government crosshairs.

In Sudan, as young people protested the military’s grip on power, memes comparing the generals to outdated phone apps or expired milk flooded WhatsApp groups. The goal? To ridicule the regime and rally the masses without triggering heavy-handed crackdowns.

In Kenya, Gen Z memes recently took on a historic role during the 2024 Finance Bill protests. A widely shared meme showed a stock photo of a lion captioned: ‘When the government realizes Gen Zs read more PDFs than they thought.’ Another showed a politician trying to ‘block’ a protester, only to be digitally photoshopped out by a cartoon eraser.

Meme Activism across the continent

Let’s take a minute to take stock of just how Gen Z is mobilizing for justice through memes. When it came to the 2021 elections, social media was flooded with memes satirizing President Yoweri Museveni’s long rule. One viral image showed Museveni as the ‘admin’ of an old, dusty WhatsApp group titled ‘Presidents Since 1986.’

During 2021’s July unrest, memes emerged both to criticize looting and highlight racial inequality. One depicted a white-owned mall labeled ‘protected’ and a township with ‘forgotten’ pasted over it.

In the wake of Egypt’s Arab Spring fallout, memes have quietly persisted. Satirical pages like El Koshary Today use humor to critique the military regime without triggering arrests, walking a dangerous line.

Gen Zs aren’t waiting for mainstream media to report the story. They become the media. A meme produced in Nairobi is now reposted in Accra, reshared in Kigali, and moments later creates a protest in Kinshasa.

Most meme-makers occupy anonymity. They are operating behind burner accounts and encrypted apps. This is digital guerilla warfare, creative, chaotic, and deeply political. And while some elders scoff at memes as ‘childish,’ these same graphics are turning into flashpoints for reform.

Just ask President Ruto from Kenya who was the target of thousands of meme-based critiques during the 2024 tax protests. The memes became so popular that mainstream media started airing and referencing them in their coverage, forcing policy exemplars to include them in their discussions.

Meme activism in Africa isn’t all fun and punchlines and meme pages have been linked to arrests. In Nigeria, authorities monitor social media for ‘cybercrime’ under vague laws. Several meme creators have faced threats, digital surveillance, or doxxing.

And with the rise of AI-generated memes, governments are tightening their grip on misinformation laws, sometimes using that as an excuse to suppress dissent. The meme wars may be hilarious, but they are fought under real risk.

In a continent where democratic backsliding and youth suppression are rampant, memes are offering a lifeline to resistance, a bridge between information and emotion, between power and the powerless. African Gen Z isn’t just laughing. They’re organizing. They’re calling out hypocrisy while expressing it in the language they are fluent in, the language of memes.",https://thred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFRICA-MEMES.png,N,,2025-08-15 11:57:55.109531

Post-pandemic trade patterns, coupled with stricter emission regulations, are forcing cargo operators, airlines, and logistics companies to innovate faster than ever before.

Innovation Takes Flight

Modern air cargo hubs are embracing automation, artificial intelligence, and blockchain to streamline operations. AI algorithms now optimise cargo space, predict demand surges, and track shipments in real time, reducing delays and costs.

Blockchain-enabled platforms ensure transparency in the supply chain, making it harder for counterfeit goods to slip through.

Air freight Rates Hold Steady As They Go Through Turbulence

Meanwhile, drones and autonomous aircraft are becoming viable for short-haul and last-mile cargo delivery. These innovations are particularly valuable for urgent medical supplies, high-value electronics, and critical parts in remote locations.

Sustainability Becomes a Business Imperative

The environmental footprint of air cargo has long been under scrutiny. With aviation contributing nearly 2% of global CO₂ emissions, the sector is now under pressure to decarbonise. Airlines and cargo operators are investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80%.

Companies like DHL, FedEx, and Emirates SkyCargo are experimenting with electric and hybrid aircraft, while others are testing lightweight packaging and optimised flight paths to reduce fuel burn.

Governments and industry bodies, including IATA, have set ambitious goals to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, pushing carriers to accelerate their green transitions.

Technology Meets Regulation

Regulatory frameworks are evolving to encourage greener operations. Carbon offset schemes, tax incentives for SAF adoption, and stricter emissions reporting are becoming standard.

In parallel, digital customs clearance systems are reducing paperwork and expediting cross-border trade, improving efficiency and cutting idle times at airports—a subtle but significant sustainability gain.

The Road (and Sky) Ahead

The next decade will likely see a blending of sustainability and technology as the industry’s competitive edge. Electric cargo planes could dominate regional routes, while AI-driven predictive maintenance will make fleets more reliable and energy-efficient.

For cargo operators, staying relevant will mean investing in greener fleets, smarter logistics, and transparent operations.

Together, we explored evolving market trends, global risks, and long‑term strategic opportunities.

Senior leadership from RGE shared how the group is expanding its global footprint, diversifying across regions and sectors, and expanding into adjacent growth areas to drive sustainable, profitable growth. These efforts are guided by disciplined execution and a long‑term mindset.

Global Leadership across Core Segments

Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) is a leader in bio‑based resources and energy, operating across more than 100 markets worldwide. It is the world’s largest producer of dissolving pulp, viscose, and lyocell, and consistently ranks among the top three global producers of paperboard, printing and writing paper, and market pulp. RGE also ranks second globally in palm oil refining. These positions stem from disciplined vertical integration and strategic investments, including the acquisitions of Vinda in China and Origami in India, making RGE a leading consumer tissue producer in both markets.

Since the inaugural Bankers’ Forum in 2019, RGE’s assets have more than doubled, successfully delivering large‑scale international projects. Notably, we are developing the world’s first net‑zero LNG export facility in Canada and Southern Europe’s largest second-generation biofuels plant in Spain.

Integrated, Diversified Portfolio and Future Preparedness

RGE’s five core verticals – pulp and paper; dissolving and specialty pulp; textile fibres; palm oil; and energy – cover upstream assets like plantations and gas fields through to downstream products such as tissue, garments, biodiesel, and electricity. This integrated value chain ensures quality control, cost competitiveness, and environmental governance. Strategic diversification into adjacent growth areas including solar energy, sustainable aviation fuel, and B2C consumer products provides additional synergy and growth pathways.

With recent major projects nearing completion, RGE is well-positioned for continued growth despite global uncertainties, including volatility from US tariffs and shifting supply chain dynamics. We remain committed to disciplined execution, agility, and preserving margins through brand strength.

Strategic Vision for the New Global Environment

RGE President Tey Wei Lin shared insights on the importance of supply chain diversification, flexible business models, and scenario planning to navigate geopolitics and trade protectionism. He underscored that strong future leadership requires balancing long‑term vision with agile near‑term execution – “think harder, react faster”.

Wei Lin summarised RGE’s future growth directions:

Strengthen leadership in core upstream sectors and expand selectively downstream.

Grow B2C tissue and personal care business by leveraging our leading brands.

Pivot to green energy, including sustainable aviation fuel and solar, leveraging our competitive advantages and strong partnerships.

As Managing Director Belinda Tanoto emphasised in her closing remarks, we are guided by our 5Cs operating philosophy – that what we do must be good for the Community, Country, Climate, Customer and only then will it be good for the Company. RGE’s global ambitions are anchored in partnerships – particularly with our banking and financial community – as we aim to deliver profitable growth with sustainability at its core.",https://www.inside-rge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bankers-forum_3.png,N,,2025-08-15 04:56:08.700906

The organization contrasts the nine operating plants with what it calls “a flurry of ambitious announcements” about plastics recycling facilities that will deploy processes including pyrolysis, gasification, solvolysis and solvent-based purification collectively known as chemical recycling or advanced recycling.

A list posted within the article lists three plants under construction and another 19 that have been proposed. A separate map, also included on the article page, displays about three dozen facilities, including some of the under construction and proposed ones. Nine others are identified as operating and 10 others described as “canceled [or] shut down.”

The text of the Oil & Gas Watch article focuses on idled facilities, including the Regenyx facility in Tigard, Oregon, described as having reached just 40 percent of its designed capacity and has having “sustained operating losses of $22.4 million in 2020 and 2021.”

The organization also describes the Fulcrum BioEnergy waste-to-jet fuel plant in Nevada as having “struggled to keep operations running consistently” the company as having failed to repay government bonds. “It was shut down in May 2024 after operating for only two years [and] Fulcrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September of last year, canceling projects it planned to develop in Indiana and Texas,” writes Alexandra Shaykevich of Oil & Gas Watch.

Also drawing skepticism is the Brightmark Plastics plant in Ashley, Indiana. “The company never managed to get the plant up and running at commercial scale and filed for bankruptcy in March,” notes the advocacy group.

The Environmental Integrity Project, citing Plastics News, says the bankruptcy filing showed the Ashley plant was only operating at 5 percent capacity and, as of 2023, had processed around 2,000 tons of plastic scrap in total. “In May, the company bought itself back at auction with the hope of keeping the facility operational,” adds the organization.

RI Challenged To Scientifically Prove Biodiesel As Clean Energy.","JAKARTA – Indonesia is facing a big challenge to prove that palm oil-based biodiesel is not just a slogan of reducing carbon emissions, but it is truly a sustainable energy solution that can be objectively and scientifically measured.

Edi Wibowo, Director of Bioenergy at the ministry of energy and mineral resources (KESDM) said the credibility of Indonesian biodiesel depends on the capacity to show real and measurable impacts to the reduction of carbon emissions.

“Now, it’s not the time to talk about claims that biodiesel is ecofriendly. We have to prove it scientifically that our palm-based biodiesel is truly sustainable and can compete globally,” Edi told participants of the 10th international conference of Biomass and Bioenergy (ICBB) in Bogor, West Java, on Monday (04/08/2025).

Indonesia’s mandatory program of biodiesel has been claimed to have reduced carbon emissions. The biodiesel 35 percent (B35) program alone is claimed to have reduced emissions up to 34 million tons of CO₂ equivalent per year. “But amid the global pressures on environment and deforestation, such claim needs to be supported by field data, transparancy of supply chain, and recognition from international institutions,” he said.

The Head of Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Center (SBRC), Meika Syahbana RuslI emphasized the importance of synergy between scientists, industrial players, and regulators. “Without collaborations, the green energy transition cannot be achieved and it will be just rethoric,” said Meika.

During the conference, the issue of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) or bioavtur for airplanes was also discussed by speakers and participants.

Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has given a positive sign of support for the production of SAF based on palm oil and the used cooking oil (UCO), the production of SAF is still facing big challenges in terms of technical aspects, investments, and market acceptability.

Indonesia has abundant source of wastes and palm oil derivative products that can be used as raw material for production of SAF. But such big potential can be just dormant without the support of research activities, funding and adaptive policies from the government.

The Head of Services Division at the Oil Palm Plantation Fund Management Board (BPDPKS), Arfie Thahar, said that his institution is now accelerating the integration of technological research, public policies, and global access.

“If we want our biodiesel and bio-avtur products accepted at the global market, we have to implement a thorough improvement from the level of farmers to the tanks of vehicles. We cannot just rely on the green narrative alone,” said Arfie.

Amid the global pressures on environment and domestic need for clean energy, Indonesia is now entering a crucial point to prove that palm oil-based biodiesel can really become a clean energy product of the future, and not just a biofuel with full of controversy. (*)

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is essential for decarbonizing the aviation sector in the short and mid-term as well as maintaining the global competitiveness of U.S. airlines, supporting job creation, and ensuring U.S. energy independence. The near-term U.S. SAF target, set by the SAF Grand Challenge, is 11.4 billion liters (3 billion gallons) of domestic SAF production by 2030, with a minimum 50% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. In 2024 U.S. SAF production was less than 2% of the stated goal, demonstrating that the remaining production growth is significant. Barriers to scale-up include technological readiness, feedstock availability, and delays in facility development. This study uses a database of U.S. SAF production announcements to assess the feasibility of attaining the 2030 targets by analyzing production potential, construction paradigms, feedstock availability, and CO2 abatement cost. Our analysis indicates that the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway will dominate U.S. SAF production through 2030, with notable contributions from alcohol to jet and co-processing. However, probable U.S. production of SAF is predicted to fall short of the current goal by 3.6-billion liters although there are scenarios that meet the goal. Existing U.S. policies favor on-road transportation fuels and are insufficient to drive necessary SAF production scale-up. Additional measures, such as non-government scope 3 emission purchases, long-term incentives, a national low-carbon fuel standard, or volume mandates, are options to close the gap. These measures are needed to ensure the profitability of SAF production and competitiveness with renewable diesel.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-08-15 02:56:13.135075

Israeli extremists are carrying out one of the most violent campaigns against Palestinian villages in the West Bank since 2006, when the United Nations first began keeping record.
According to the UN, at least 964 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since October 2023.

These land grabs, which often violence and arson, continue as Israel’s far-right minister says he will approve more than 3,000 new illegal settlements in the area.

Israeli extremists are carrying out one of the most violent campaigns against Palestinian villages in the West Bank since 2006, when the United Nations first began keeping record.

Records collated by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reveal that more than 750 attacks on Palestinians and their property occurred during the first half of this year, averaging out to about 130 assaults a month.

Though Israel’s military has said it takes measures to prevent such attacks, an investigation by the New York Times found that ‘Israeli authorities have for decades failed to impose meaningful restraints on criminal settlers’.

Surveying security footage from cameras in the West Bank, the Times reports that many Israeli settlers enter Palestinian villages in the day time to carry out land grabs and forced displacement. This often sparks violent confrontation which has, all too often, led to the death of several Palestinians.

According to the UN, at least 964 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since October 2023. At least 2,907 home demolitions were also carried out by Israel during the same period.

A background on illegal settlements

Since 1967, Jewish communities have been slowly building settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. These settlements are considered illegal under international law, however it has not stopped the number of Israelis setting up camp in these areas from reaching around 700,000.

Research by the humanitarian organisation Peace Now shows that settlers are increasing their operations in recent years. Since the beginning of 2023, Israeli settlers have built more than 130 illegal outposts in rural parts of the West Bank – more outposts than were built over the last two decades combined.

The Times reports that settlement leaders acknowledge that ‘their aim is to intimidate Palestinians into leaving strategic tracts of territory’. Individuals leading these settler campaigns have been quoted saying that ‘it’s not the nicest thing to evacuate a population,’ but suggest that in a war over land, ‘this is what is done’.

Though some Israeli settlers choose to handle disputes in the daytime, others attack under the cover of night – spraying graffiti on the exterior of homes and, in some cases committing arson, lighting cars on fire and throwing fireballs through open windows of Palestinian homes.

Such attacks have grown in consequence since October 2023. In videos that have been circulated online, one settler can be seen shooting a Palestinian in the presence of an Israeli soldier. It has been confirmed that the shooter was questioned for only 20 minutes and never arrested.

Israel also launched a substantial military operation called ‘Iron Wall’ in January of this year, which forcibly displaced 40,000 Palestinians in the West Bank.

No signs of slowing

On 14 August, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich delivered a speech outlining his plan to approve thousands of housing units in a controversial and long-delayed illegal settlement project in the occupied West Bank.

In the announcement, Smotrich said the move ‘buries the idea of a Palestinian state’ by building more than 3,000 homes in the E1 area settlement project. He praised the project as ‘Zionism at its best’.

This project, if completed, will connect Jerusalem and the existing illegal Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, which is located several kilometres to the east.

‘This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state, because there is nothing to recognise and no one to recognise.’ Smotrich said. ‘Anyone in the world who tries today to recognise a Palestinian state will receive an answer from us on the ground.’

The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the new settlement plan an extension of crimes of genocide, displacement and annexation, and an echo of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s statements regarding what he called ‘Greater Israel’.

The E1 plan has not yet received final approval, which is expected next week. It’s unclear whether any world power will step in to stop these plans for settlement expansion.",https://thred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/westbank.png,N,,2025-08-15 07:56:42.119239

The event will be hosted by Cathay Pacific and will bring together leading organisations across the aviation, energy, finance, and policy sectors in Hong Kong to progress aviation sustainability.

IATA’s World Sustainability Symposium 2025

This year’s World Sustainability Symposium (WSS) will be held in Hong Kong and hosted by Cathay Pacific. The Symposium is IATA’s flagship event on aviation sustainability, set to welcome over 500 organisations from around the world to advance the industry’s aim of achieving net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. Airlines, fuel producers, investors, policymakers, and innovators will all be in attendance at the WSS, encouraging greater discussion and collaboration between sectors.

Taking place on 21-22 October, the Symposium will follow the 42nd ICAO Assembly, which will call for stronger government policy to support the industry’s transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The WSS also precedes COP30 – the United Nations Climate Change Conference that seeks to boost climate action. Bridging these two significant events, the WSS will focus on removing obstacles to SAF production expansion, attracting financing for decarbonisation costs, integrating emerging technology developments, and increasing collaboration.

Willie Walsh – Director General of IATA – has highlighted the importance of the WSS and what it can do for the future of sustainable aviation:

“We are at a crucial point. Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But we have not seen sufficient, timely action by policymakers, aerospace manufacturers, oil companies, or fuel producers to support this commitment. This event is an essential rallying call for all those who have a stake in air transport’s future to overcome any challenges in the way of accelerating the pace of this crucial energy transition.”

The symposium will feature speeches and conversations from:

Ronald Lam, Chief Executive Officer of the Cathay Group

Aemetis Inc. released second quarter results, reporting increase revenue when compared to the first quarter of the year. During an earnings call, company officials detailed progress with the company’s dairy renewable natural gas (RNG), ethanol, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects.

Todd Waltz, chief financial officer at Aemetis, said the company’s ethanol plant in Keyes, California, operated at a slightly reduced rate of 13.8 million gallons during the quarter to maximize margins.

Aemetis Executive Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee said progress is being made on the mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) project underway at the Keyes plant. Key vendors are fabricating equipment for the system, he said, noting the MVR project is expected to reduce the plant’s natural gas use by 80%. The system is expected to be fully operational next year.

McAfee also noted that ethanol pricing has improved since earlier this year. He cited the U.S. EPA’s emergency waivers for E15 and lower corn prices as factors that have improved margins. While Aemetis decreased ethanol production during the spring to optimize margins, McAfee said the company has recently increased production to support market demand and participate in the higher-margin environment.

According to Waltz, Aemetis’s dairy RNG operations recognized $3.1 million of revenue from 11 operating digesters during the second quarter, suing the California Air Resources Board-approved Low Carbon Fuel Standard pathway for seven of the digesters.

McAfee said the RNG business is steadily scaling up, with a new multi-dairy digester coming online this month that is expected to boost RNG production by 30%. He said the company plans to reach 550,000 MMBtus of RNG production capacity this year, increasing to 1 million MMBtu by the end of next year.

Regarding Aemetis’ Riverbank project, a proposed 90 MMgy SAF and renewable diesel facility, McAfee confirmed the company has received the authority to construct air permits and conditional use permit for the project. He said the company is in active discussions on financing structure and is waiting further clarity on the 45Z production tax credit and Renewable Fuels Standard mandates to support project financing.

Aemetis is also planning to develop a CCS project at the site of the Riverbank facility. McAfee said initial site work is complete on a geologic characterization well. Data obtained from the next phase will support the company’s Class VI permit application with the U.S. EPA. Once permitting, the site is expected to have the capacity to sequester up to 1.4 million metric tons of CO2 annually.

Aemetis also has an India-based biodiesel business. That subsidiary is targeting a public listing in early 2026.

Aemetis reported second quarter revenues of $52.2 million, down from $66.6 million reported for the same period of last year. The dairy RNG segment produced 106,400 MMBtu and reported $3.1 million in revenue. The India biodiesel business recognized $11.9 million in revenue.

Gross loss for the second quarter was $3.4 million, compared to a $1.8 million gross loss reported for the same period of 2024. Operating loss was $10.7 million, compared to an operating loss of $13.6 million. Net loss was $23.4 million, compared to a net loss of $29.2 million.

Deputy President Director Oki Muraza confirmed that approximately 32 kiloliters of SAF produced at the Cilacap refinery will power a Jakarta-to-Denpasar flight operated by Pelita Air, Pertamina's airline subsidiary, scheduled for later this month.

The state-owned energy company plans to deliver 1.7 million liters of this environmentally friendly fuel to Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta as part of its commitment to reducing aviation carbon emissions.

This breakthrough represents Indonesia's pioneering effort in developing circular economy-based sustainable aviation fuel, transforming waste cooking oil into clean energy solutions for the aviation industry.

The Used Cooking Oil to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (USAF) project will expand beyond the Cilacap facility to include Dumai refinery in Riau and Balongan refinery in West Java, demonstrating Pertamina's comprehensive approach to sustainable fuel production nationwide. 🛫

These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.
This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong.
For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network.
DHL Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage systems, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen.","DHL Express and the Cathay Group have entered into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership that reinforces their shared commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the air cargo industry. Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 metric tons of SAF for international flights departing from three airports in Asia namely Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.

Continuing through 2025, the partnership is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 metric tons —equivalent to the emissions of over 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore with an Airbus 330 freighter.

""Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand,"" said Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations and Aviation – Asia Pacific, DHL Express. ""DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group's Strategy 2030, which recognizes 'green logistics of choice' as one of the four bottom lines.""

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

""This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia,"" said Tom Owen, Director Cargo, Cathay.

This collaboration makes DHL Express the latest strategic partner of Cathay's Corporate SAF Program, an initiative launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight through the use of SAF. In 2024, the Corporate SAF Program enabled the use of over 6,000 metric tons of SAF, with a record 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA and Standard Chartered.

Cathay has been steadily expanding its SAF efforts across the region. Earlier in 2025, the Group entered into an agreement with Sinopec to uplift SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland at Hong Kong International Airport, marking the first such export by Sinopec to Hong Kong. Additionally, Cathay has partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027. Apart from working closely with suppliers, the Group also co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) to collectively drive policy development and adoption of SAF locally. These initiatives reflect Cathay's mission to expand the use of SAF within its network and foster a regional SAF ecosystem.

Investments in SAF are therefore critical to ensuring its availability on a long-term and predictable basis. DHL Express has also been a frontrunner in scaling SAF uptake globally, securing long-term SAF agreements with multiple partners, including Neste, bp, and World Energy. Earlier this year, DHL Express also partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use SAF produced in Japan for flights departing the country. Most recently, DHL Express completed an agreement with Neste that comprises 7,400 metric tons of SAF for international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport, further demonstrating the company's proactive approach to driving SAF demand and supply across the region.

These efforts will also enhance DHL's understanding of how to transport these alternative fuels, as it is a segment under its Strategy 2030's key growth sector, ""New Energy."" DHL Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage systems, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen.

Conestoga Energy will operate the unit and supply SAF to Southwest and other airlines.","Southwest Airlines has sold its renewable fuels unit to Conestoga Energy. The airline has stated that it will continue to pursue sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a key part of its decarbonization strategy, with a goal of powering at least 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030. The sale is expected to help Southwest achieve this goal while also generating revenue for the airline. Conestoga Energy will operate the unit and supply SAF to Southwest and other airlines.

Southwest Airlines Co. has sold its renewable fuels unit, Saffire Renewables LLC, to Conestoga Energy. The acquisition, which includes all intellectual property, related technologies, key leadership team members, and a proposed pilot facility in Kansas for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, is part of Southwest's broader strategy to reduce its climate initiatives [1][2].

Conestoga Energy, a leading provider of low-carbon intensity biofuels, announced the purchase on Thursday. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The acquisition aligns with Southwest's goal to power at least 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030, while also generating revenue for the airline [2].

Conestoga Energy will operate the unit and supply SAF to Southwest and other airlines. The sale is part of Southwest's broader pullback from sustainability initiatives, which began earlier this year. This includes laying off seven of 10 employees working to reduce its climate pollution and expand use of SAF [2].

The aviation industry has struggled to make progress on its climate commitments, including hitting zero carbon emissions by 2050. The growth in cleaner jet fuel made from sources like used cooking oil and animal tallow has been slower than expected [2].

The sale also comes after the Trump administration trimmed a credit for producers of greener jet fuel, making it more difficult for producers to cover the costs of making SAF [2].

Conestoga Energy's chief executive officer, Tom Willis, stated that Saffire technology can be used to make ethanol for purposes beyond just jet fuel. Conestoga produces more than 200 million gallons of ethanol per year and has been capturing carbon for over 15 years, which helps it sell to markets that favor low-carbon-intensity fuels [2].

The sale is expected to help Southwest achieve its SAF goals while also generating revenue for the airline. Conestoga Energy's expertise in ethanol production and SAF technology positions it well to support Southwest's decarbonization strategy.

The carbon capture pipelines will allow carbon dioxide produced at ethanol plants to be buried in underground locations where they won’t impact the atmosphere.
“We started a DOGE program at Nebraska before anybody heard about DOGE, and we didn't call it DOGE,” he said.
Pillen’s right-hand man in that effort is Lee Will, the Chief Operating Officer for the State of Nebraska.
“What brings the nation's two top agricultural officials to the state of Nebraska in the same week?” Vaden asked.","Hundreds of Nebraska’s leaders in agriculture and manufacturing gathered in Kearney Thursday for the Governor’s Summit.

The annual event has become an opportunity for Gov. Jim Pillen to highlight what the state is doing to help promote its bioeconomy, which includes ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel and plant-based plastics.

“We've made extraordinary things happen in the last three years by being able to do what no one else in the United States of America has been able to do, capturing carbon from the ethanol plants,” Pillen said.

The carbon capture pipelines will allow carbon dioxide produced at ethanol plants to be buried in underground locations where they won’t impact the atmosphere.

Pillen also highlighted how members of his cabinet are working to cut costs without reducing services.

“We started a DOGE program at Nebraska before anybody heard about DOGE, and we didn't call it DOGE,” he said. “We just simply called it ‘run government like a business,’ a systems approach to running our business.”

Pillen has asked state agencies to identify ways to cut 10% from their budgets in an effort to reduce general fund spending by a historicallysignificant $500 million.

Pillen’s right-hand man in that effort is Lee Will, the Chief Operating Officer for the State of Nebraska.

“When Gov. Pillen came in, agencies were asking for 5, 10, 15% increases of their budget,” he said. “The thing that we quickly were able to identify are, what are those things that we critically need to invest in, and what are those things that are just spending items that aren't going to move the needle for everyday Nebraskans?”

Will said the state’s general fund budget – which doesn’t account for federal dollars spent by the state – increased by 0.4% in the most recent year. Still, the state continued investments in the $600 million Perkins County Canal and a new state prison. A prison bid was recently awarded for $313 million.

Pillen talked about the need for workforce development in rural Nebraska but said government-funded housing projects are not the best way to go about it.

“All you got to do is look back at housing projects that governments funded. They've never worked,” he said. “There's a place for some seed money. I'm all in on that, but it's got to be in a way that a community is going to take that, start it and then really steamroll it to solve the problem.”

Instead, Pillen reemphasized the importance of property tax relief.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden also addressed the summit. The newly appointed secretary is second-in-line at the department. His visit marked the second time in the last week that a USDA secretary has visited Nebraska.

“What brings the nation's two top agricultural officials to the state of Nebraska in the same week?” Vaden asked. “It's simple. Even from Washington D.C., we can see there are a lot of great ideas coming out of Lincoln. And we want to come here to see what you're doing in terms of your agricultural policy.”

Nebraska’s pilot program to exclude soft drinks and energy drinks from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was one of the policies Vaden praised.

(Helsinki Times) UPM, Neste and St1 are advancing plans to produce renewable jet fuel from forest industry residues. The shift aims to meet growing EU requirements for sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF. In Lappeenranta, UPM Biofuels is preparing to start commercial production of SAF by refining its existing renewable diesel product. The facility currently produces renewable diesel from crude tall oil, a by-product of softwood pulp manufacturing.

Petri Rekonen, director of the Lappeenranta biorefinery, said UPM has already tested the fuel in a dual-engine turboprop aircraft. One engine ran on renewable fuel produced at the plant, the other on conventional jet fuel.

“The results show our fuel performs well in aircraft,” Rekonen said.

UPM is waiting for international approval to use tall oil as a SAF feedstock. The approval process through ASTM, a global standard-setting body, takes about two and a half years. Once granted, UPM will decide whether to launch full-scale SAF production.

...

While UPM focuses on tall oil, St1 is exploring other forest-based materials. In cooperation with Swedish forestry company SCA, St1 plans a biorefinery in Östrand, Sweden. The facility would use sawdust, bark and other industrial wood residues to produce SAF and e-fuels.

...

The Östrand refinery would use feedstocks currently used for heat generation. The site would also process logging residues, which are largely unused in Sweden. Half of the refinery’s output would be SAF and the rest e-fuels.

(Olli) Lahdenperä said the investment, estimated in the billions of euros, would only proceed if long-term pricing support is introduced for e-fuels.

“A mechanism is needed to guarantee price stability for at least ten years,” he said. The facility could begin operations in the early 2030s.

Neste is also developing technologies to expand its use of forest waste and lignocellulosic biomass. The company already sources used cooking oil and animal fat for fuel production, but sees limited room for growth in waste-based inputs.

Key leaders, including CTO Marykate O’Brien and Director of Engineering Nitin Kolhapure.

An exclusive license to NREL’s deacetylation and mechanical refining (DMR) pretreatment tech for converting corn stover to ethanol.

Conestoga says the pathway can reach a carbon intensity score below −100 for the ethanol intermediate.

The Kansas Pilot Plant

The pilot plant will sit inside Conestoga’s Arkalon Energy complex. It aims to process corn stover—the leaves, stalks, and cobs left after harvest—into cellulosic ethanol. That ethanol can be upgraded into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using alcohol-to-jet technology at LanzaJet.

U.S. Department of Energy materials note the pilot is designed to handle about 10 tons of corn stover per day and target a lifecycle footprint at least 83% lower than conventional jet fuel, depending on inputs and boundaries. Groundbreaking occurred in 2024.

Conestoga and SAFFiRE plan to use lessons from the pilot to guide designs for future commercial plants. The company says first operations are expected in 2026, subject to execution and permits.

Background and Timeline

Southwest created its Renewable Ventures subsidiary in February 2024 to help secure SAF. A month later, it acquired SAFFiRE. The airline had first invested in SAFFiRE in 2022. Today’s sale passes the technology and pilot plan to a producer that already runs large ethanol sites in Kansas.

Who Is Conestoga Energy?

Conestoga operates two ethanol plants and manages 200+ million gallons per year of production and co-products across Kansas and Texas. Its operations include long-running CO₂ capture and generation of both D6 and D3 RINs. The Arkalon Energy plant in Liberal is a large site, reported at roughly 110–115 million gallons per year capacity.

Why This Deal Matters

Airlines want more SAF to cut carbon. But supply is tight, and prices are high. Conestoga’s CEO said the acquisition helps bridge the supply–demand gap and could create new value for U.S. agriculture. Moving SAFFiRE into an experienced biofuels operator may speed scale-up and de-risk day-to-day operations.

This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.
Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.
And right now, the way that biofuel policies are designed, they treat crop producers supplying crop for a biofuel as all being the same.""","A team of agricultural economists, environmental scientists and policy experts envisions a path toward a carbon-neutral agricultural future by expanding the reach of policies designed to promote low-carbon biofuels for transportation and aviation.

In a paper in the journal Science, the researchers propose policies that would reward farmers for adopting ""climate-smart"" practices when growing biofuel crops and remove the hurdles that currently thwart such efforts.

Climate-smart practices include techniques that build soil carbon, like cover-cropping, not tilling fields after harvest and adding biochar or finely ground silicate rock to soils; and those that reduce the carbon footprint of crop production, like optimizing the timing of fertilizer application, electrifying farm vehicles and improving crop genetics.

Studies show that, if adopted globally, ""climate-smart"" farming practices could reduce carbon emissions by 4-8 billion tons per year, the researchers wrote. To put that in perspective, in 2024, global carbon dioxide emissions reached an all-time high of about 40 billion tons.

""Biofuel markets can be a pathway to decarbonize agriculture as a whole,"" said Madhu Khanna, a professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and lead author of the new report. Khanna is the director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and a researcher in the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation.

""Currently, our biofuel policies don't reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices,"" Khanna said.

""For example, they treat all corn grown for the corn-ethanol market the same, whether or not the farmers adopt those types of practices. By accounting for differences in practices implemented at the farm level and paying a premium for corn grown with climate-smart practices for corn ethanol, biofuel policies can incentivize adoption of these practices.""

Biofuel markets have already established mechanisms for accounting for the carbon-intensity of different feedstock types and have well-developed channels for transferring payments from energy markets to biofuel producers, the researchers report. This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.

""For example, the '40B' Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit of 2023-2024 was designed to differentiate the credit based on the climate-smart practices adopted while producing the crop,"" Khanna said.

""The lower the carbon intensity, the higher the tax credit paid for sustainable aviation fuels and for the crop used to produce it.""

At present, however, the channels for crediting farmers for soil-carbon sequestration or other climate-friendly practices on the farm are segregated from the markets that provide credits for low-carbon biofuels, Khanna said.

To be compensated for their sustainability efforts in growing the crops, farmers must either enroll in a conservation program or sell carbon credits to one of several companies specializing in agricultural carbon offsets. Space is limited in government conservation programs, however, and farmers must prove that they aren't already engaging in climate-smart practices to obtain credits. This requires a lot of extra effort on the farmer's part.

""It also means that early adopters get penalized,"" Khanna said.

Khanna and her colleagues propose an approach for merging the biofuel feedstock market and climate-offset market into a single channel to reward farmers and others in the biofuel supply chain who use practices that lower the carbon-intensity of their operations. This approach could subsequently be broadened to reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices for crops to supply food and feed markets as well.

Like existing policies, any new approach would require verification that farmers are actually implementing the practices they've pledged to follow.

""Emerging digital technologies and modeling advances can document farming practices and accurately calculate their carbon intensity. This can simplify and scale this process,"" said Bruno Basso, a co-author of the study and an expert in modeling and digital agriculture at Michigan State University. Certification programs could allow independent verification that feedstocks were sustainably produced.

Calculating the changes in the amount of carbon sequestered in crop soils precisely each year is a more daunting task, the authors wrote. But ""using multiple process-based ecosystem models can reduce the uncertainty in these estimates and avoid the need for labor-intensive soil sampling procedures,"" Basso added.

Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.

""If they do it one year and not the next, they'll sequester the carbon and then, perhaps, release it back to the atmosphere the following year,"" she said.

""But we can design incentives for longer-term soil-carbon sequestration by having farmers sign longer-term contracts. This would relate the size of the payments to how long the farmer agrees to keep that carbon in the ground.""

Khanna acknowledges that the carbon benefits from existing biofuels are controversial. Some critics argue that devoting farmland to the production of plant-based fuels takes up land that can be used for food crops and can contribute to the conversion of forests to cropland in other parts of the world, erasing its sustainability gains.

But current approaches could be under- or overestimating the carbon benefits of biofuels by disregarding the carbon effects of crop management practices implemented on the farm producing the crop for the biofuel market.

""By developing a market for agricultural products that accounts for all the direct and indirect carbon emission effects from the farm to the consumer, we can better address these concerns,"" she said.

""The main premise of our proposal is that we need to have a full and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from the beginning to the end of any product's life cycle.

Sources: Air Europa, Globalia Media Contact: Stankevicius Group Arabia Vytautas Mickys Release ID: 89167274","-- At a key moment for the aviation industry, Air Europa is accelerating its strategy toward a more sustainable business model. The company has reinforced its environmental policies with the goal of progressively moving toward net-zero emissions, adopting technological, operational, and energy solutions that position it as a benchmark for green aviation in Europe.

Key initiatives include the renewal of its fleet with state-of-the-art aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX, known for their lower fuel consumption and significant reduction in CO₂ emissions. Route optimization and cabin weight reduction also contribute to improved fuel efficiency on every flight.

A strategic legacy with a sustainable vision

The push for a more environmentally conscious model began during Javier Hidalgo’s tenure as CEO, when the airline’s first green transformation efforts were outlined. His vision of modernizing the fleet, digitizing operations, and anticipating international sustainability demands marked a turning point for the company.

Today, that approach has evolved into a structural strategy that spans all operational areas—from maintenance to customer service—embedding environmental criteria into every decision.

Sustainable aviation fuel and operational efficiency

One of Air Europa’s main sustainability pillars is the gradual integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a key alternative to reduce emissions without altering current infrastructure. In collaboration with energy partners and European bodies, the airline participates in initiatives promoting the development and adoption of SAF, aligned with the goals of Agenda 2030 and the European Green Deal.

In addition, Air Europa has launched ground-based energy efficiency programs, including improved cargo processes, reduced plastic usage, onboard recycling systems, and environmental training for its operational staff.

Sustainability as a reputational asset

Sustainability has gone from being a voluntary commitment to becoming a non-negotiable condition for global competitiveness. In this context, Air Europa has intensified its efforts to turn environmental responsibility into both a reputational and operational advantage.

As part of this strategy, it has strengthened its environmental communications, aligning its messaging with tangible actions, transparent data, and measurable commitments.

The airline is also working on voluntary emissions offset programs, offering passengers the option to balance the environmental impact of their trips through certified reforestation or renewable energy projects.

A new direction for European aviation

The path to net-zero emissions is complex, but Air Europa is committed to taking it with determination, technology, and strategic foresight. Its environmental commitment—initiated under executive leadership and now embraced throughout the organization—positions it among the most active airlines driving the green transformation of air transport in Europe.

About Air Europa

Air Europa is Spain’s leading long-haul airline, currently undergoing a major transformation with a renewed focus on fleet modernization and transatlantic route expansion. The airline has added Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 787-9s to improve efficiency and support its environmental goals, aiming to cut emissions by 30% by 2030. With strong financial recovery and growing interest from global partners like Etihad and Lufthansa, Air Europa is positioning itself as a key player in Europe–Americas aviation.

Under the agreement, Cathay will provide DHL with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for use on Air Hong Kong flights the Cathay-owned carrier that operates dedicated express cargo services for DHL. The fuel will be deployed on international routes departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi airports.

The deal, which runs through 2025, is projected to cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by about 7,190 tonnes the equivalent of over 100 Airbus A330 freighter flights between Hong Kong and Singapore.

Addressing carbon emissions

Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation Asia Pacific at DHL Express, said that although SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of global jet fuel consumption, it represents a vital lever for reducing aviation emissions.

“Our decision to expand SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step to drive momentum in SAF production and demand,” Bardens said. “It aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which places ‘green logistics of choice’ among its four core pillars.”

The initiative also marks the first time Air Hong Kong flights will be powered by SAF, which Cathay Cargo Director Tom Owen described as a “key milestone” for the airline group. He emphasised the importance of collaboration in making SAF more accessible and scalable across Asia.

As part of the deal, DHL will join Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme, launched in 2022 to help partners address carbon emissions from business travel and airfreight. In 2024, the programme facilitated the use of more than 6,000 tonnes of SAF with 16 corporate participants, including HSBC, AIA, and Standard Chartered.

Cathay has been actively expanding SAF sourcing, including a recent supply agreement with Sinopec for SAF produced in mainland China the first such export to Hong Kong International Airport and a partnership with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027.

Beyond supply deals, Cathay co-founded the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition to support policy development and encourage industry adoption. DHL Express, which has long invested in SAF globally, holds long-term agreements with Neste, bp, and World Energy. In Japan, it works with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use domestically produced SAF, and earlier this year secured 7,400 tonnes of SAF from Neste for flights from Singapore. The company says such initiatives also help it develop logistics solutions for transporting renewable and alternative fuels, a growth area under its 2030 strategy.",http://www.logisticsbusinessafrica.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Capture-32.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 22:56:10.068134

Southwest Airlines just sold its sustainable fuels unit, Saffire Renewables, to Kansas-based Conestoga Energy—moving away from building its own green aviation tech.

What does this mean?

The deal transfers all of Saffire Renewables’ technology, team, and pilot plant—meant for producing sustainable aviation fuel—to Conestoga Energy, which operates a Kansas ethanol facility. While price tags stayed under wraps, Southwest says Conestoga is well placed to scale the innovation. The sale marks a step back in Southwest’s climate strategy, as high costs and slow adoption continue to challenge sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). With more hurdles than expected, airlines like Southwest are letting established energy players tackle the technical advances, shifting their focus to buying low-carbon fuel rather than developing it themselves.

Why should I care?

For markets: Airlines favor pragmatism over bold green bets.

Southwest’s move fits a larger pattern of airlines rethinking in-house sustainability projects. While demand for sustainable aviation fuel is growing—usage nearly tripled between 2022 and 2024, per the International Air Transport Association—consistent supply and profitability are still out of reach. Investors are keeping an eye on energy firms, now seen as the likely leaders in scaling up clean fuel solutions.

The bigger picture: Green tech shifts to the specialists.

SAFc allows the environmental benefits of SAF to be purchased separately from the physical fuel through a ‘book and claim’ system. The mechanism is increasingly used by companies to offset emissions from business travel and air freight, with the International Air Transport Association estimating SAF can reduce life-cycle CO2 emissions by up to 80%.

In practice, a company can pay for the climate benefits of SAF produced and used elsewhere, without needing to physically take delivery of the fuel itself.

Amsterdam-headquartered STX said its global network enables sourcing of third-party certified SAFc without minimum purchase volumes, providing access for corporates of any size.

“Our long history of trading niche environmental commodity products underlines our role in enhancing liquidity on the new commodity markets. We are therefore well positioned to grow the SAFc industry further, help to scale production and provide access,” said Fabian Roobeek, Managing Partner.

According to the Science Based Targets initiative’s draft net-zero guidance issued in March 2025, SAFc is recognised as a key solution to meet Scope 3 targets for travel and freight emissions. STX said corporate investment in SAFc supports global SAF production scale-up, which in turn helps reduce long-term costs and secures future supply.

The move to expand SAFc comes less than a month after the European Commission approved a €36m Danish measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the domestic aviation sector.

The scheme, which will be in place until 31 December 2027, is designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes.

In 2020, SAF accounted for less than 0.05% of total jet fuel demand in the EU. Under ReFuelEU mandates, jet fuel demand at EU airports could reach around 46 million tonnes by 2030, requiring about 2.3 million tonnes of SAF at a 5% blending rate. Current EU production capacity is estimated at just 0.24 million tonnes, around 10% of the volume needed.

To help close the gap, EU measures include 20 million dedicated SAF allowances under the EU ETS between 2024 and 2030, worth an estimated €1.6bn at current carbon prices. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets a SAF blending requirement starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050, with penalties for non-compliance and revenues directed to further SAF support or R&D.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2325764425.jpg",N,,2025-08-14 12:56:10.323918

The company is responding to the rising demand for high-quality carbon removal credits.","Gevo, Inc., a renewable fuels and carbon solutions company, has reported its first-ever profitable quarter in Q2 2025, marking a major shift in its financial performance. This is all thanks to its carbon credit sales of around $22 million and other low-carbon product sales.

The company posted net income of $2.1 million, a sharp turnaround from previous losses. Adjusted earnings reached $17 million, and earnings per share came in at $0.01. That is well above analyst forecasts of a loss of $0.07.

Revenue for the quarter totaled $43.41 million. This was about $14 million higher than the previous quarter, though slightly below some market expectations. This earnings surprise drove a dramatic reaction in the stock market.

Gevo shares surged 65% in after-hours trading following the announcement. It has continued to climb about 46% in pre-market trading the next day.

This milestone is significant for Gevo. The company has been working to diversify revenue streams and build a sustainable business model that integrates renewable fuel production with carbon reduction initiatives.

Carbon Credits: The Secret Sauce Behind Gevo’s First-Ever Profit

A major factor behind Gevo’s profitability was its revenue from carbon credits. This segment has become an important part of its business model. The company benefits from two main types of credits:

Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs):

These credits contributed roughly $21 million to net income during the first half of 2025. They reward low-carbon fuel producers for displacing fossil fuel use.

Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) credits:

In Q2, Gevo generated over $1 million from selling high-integrity carbon removal credits. The company expects to earn $3–5 million a year from CDR credits soon. In the long run, this could grow to over $30 million each year.

In addition, Gevo completed its first sale of carbon removal credits certified by Puro.earth. It is a leading registry for engineered carbon removal. These credits are backed by carbon capture and storage (CCS) at Gevo’s planned North Dakota ethanol facility. The plant is designed to sequester up to 1 million metric tonnes of CO₂ per year.

By monetizing its carbon abatement efforts, Gevo is tapping into a rapidly growing market. This strategy reduces its reliance on volatile biofuel margins. Also, it positions the company to benefit from both regulatory programs and voluntary corporate climate commitments.

Dr. Patrick Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer, remarked:

“This was a landmark quarter for us…I really like these results regarding carbon sales. It’s outstanding that companies are willing to step up and pay for what they believe in–carbon reduction. It’s a new product; and for us, it’s a co-product. Our fuel manufacturing systems are designed end-to-end to abate carbon. The result is that we can manufacture cost-competitive renewable liquid fuels, while abating carbon.”

Turning CO₂ into Cash: CCS, Carbon Removal, and Net Zero

Gevo’s business is built on producing renewable fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable natural gas (RNG. These are while integrating carbon reduction technologies to maximize climate benefits.

In the first quarter of 2025, the company reported over 100,000 metric tons of carbon abatement. This combines CO₂ captured through CCS and emissions avoided through renewable fuel production.

The company’s CCS operations in North Dakota could play a critical role in scaling these achievements. Once it starts working, the facility can remove and store CO₂. This amount equals the yearly emissions of over 200,000 cars.

These milestones help Gevo reach its goal of providing clean fuels and real carbon reductions. This aligns with the needs of airlines, shipping companies, and other sectors under increasing pressure to cut emissions.

Gevo aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The company’s strategy focuses on producing low-carbon fuels and removing CO₂ from the atmosphere.

Carbon credits are a key part of Gevo’s plan. By selling high-quality credits from CCS and renewable fuel projects, the company earns revenue while helping other businesses offset their emissions. These efforts cut Gevo’s own carbon footprint and support wider climate goals.

Carbon Markets: Opportunities and Challenges

Gevo’s success underscores the growing influence of carbon markets in the clean energy economy. The voluntary carbon market, valued at about $2 billion in 2024, is projected to grow to $50 billion or more by 2030, according to industry forecasts. Demand for high-quality, verifiable credits is rising as corporations seek to meet net-zero targets.

High-integrity carbon removal credits, like those sold by Gevo, are particularly short in supply. This allows sellers to command premium prices. However, the market is also facing scrutiny over credit quality and transparency.

For Gevo, selling credits backed by measurable and permanent CO₂ storage offers a competitive advantage in a market where buyers are increasingly selective.

With the global push for decarbonization growing stronger, companies that blend renewable energy and carbon removal could attract long-term buyers. This is true for both compliance and voluntary markets.

Why Investors Are Suddenly Paying Attention

The market’s strong response to Gevo’s Q2 results reflects investor confidence in the company’s shift toward profitability and diversified revenue sources. The surge in trading volume—over 71 million shares traded on the day of the earnings release. This signals that both institutional and retail investors are paying attention to its growth story.

If Gevo keeps making money from carbon credit sales and grows its clean fuel production, it could attract climate-focused funds and ESG investors with a strong track record. However, market volatility in both fuel prices and carbon credits could still present some challenges.

Scaling the Model: Can Gevo Keep the Momentum?

Gevo will expand its production of sustainable fuels. It also plans to grow its CCS capabilities and carbon credit sales. This strategy aligns with global climate policies that reward low-carbon energy solutions and penalize heavy emitters.

The company is combining renewable fuel production and measurable carbon removal. This strategy places it in a fast-growing area that connects energy and environmental sectors. If it keeps showing strong results and clear credit checks, it could set a standard for blending clean energy and carbon markets.

Gevo’s first profitable quarter shows the financial promise of combining renewable fuel production with carbon credit sales. The company is responding to the rising demand for high-quality carbon removal credits. Their effective operations help them stand out in the new clean energy and carbon economy.

Gevo’s ability to sustain profitability will depend on scaling production, securing long-term credit buyers, and navigating the fast-evolving landscape of carbon markets.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gevo-Stock-Surges-65-as-Carbon-Credits-Bring-in-First-Ever-Profits.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 12:56:46.080466

These volumes are then combined to form a collective demand for zero-emission shipping.","In brief

Before 2023, companies looking to decarbonise their supply chains had no viable access to zero-emission shipping solutions. High costs and uncertain demand gave carriers little incentive to invest in zero-emission fuels, barring individual businesses from shifting the market. The Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) emerged as a collective procurement initiative to aggregate demand and send a clear signal to shipping providers and policymakers for new shipping solutions.

A challenge of scale

Each day, millions of raw materials and products are moved across the ocean. Global seaborne trade, reliant on fleets that run on cheap, carbon-intensive fuels, accounts for nearly 3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, zero-emission alternatives remain commercially out of reach.

Zero-emission fuels (1) are predicted to cost up to five times more than traditional high-emission fuels. Even if freight buyers are willing to pay this premium, an additional hurdle remains – a single freight buyer only controls a fraction of a ship’s containers, which number anywhere between 200 and 25,000, and must spread their total freight across multiple ships, shipping lines, and routes. This fragmentation makes it nearly impossible for suppliers to build a compelling business case for transitioning to the cleanest fuels and technologies.

ZEMBA – collaboration as an unlock

In 2021, the Aspen Institute’s Energy & Environment Program launched the Cargo Owners for Zero-Emission Vessels (coZEV) initiative. In its inaugural ambition statement, coZEV called for the industry to fully decarbonise by 2040, with a dual focus on driving policy change and helping companies build an investment case for reducing emissions.

“

We always wanted to aggregate demand and get money channelled into commercial contracts for longer-term offtake, but companies told us they needed a publicly declared ambition to justify the investment, so that’s where we started.

– Ingrid Irigoyen, CEO of ZEMBA

Carrying the momentum from coZEV, industry leaders including Amazon, Patagonia, and Tchibo joined forces with the Aspen Institute to establish ZEMBA as a nonprofit in 2023. With the Aspen Institute acting as its secretariat, ZEMBA set out to build a buyers alliance that could leverage its members’ purchasing power and commit to accelerating a new market for zero-emission shipping.

Economies of scale right out of the gate

Procurement collaborations between competitors carry legal and reputational risks, such as antitrust violations, contractual inflexibility, and the handling of sensitive commercial data. To navigate this, ZEMBA was set up as a neutral third party, with clear rules, oversight from a legal team, and technical support from the Center for Green Market Activation (GMA) and Lloyd’s Register Maritime Decarbonisation Hub.

Each meeting involved professionals from a wide range of disciplines: economists, marine fuel and technology experts, carbon accounting advisors, procurement professionals. At least one lawyer was also present, to balance speed with the reassurance from all the participating companies that they would adhere to technical guardrails.

“

It was a very collaborative and interdisciplinary co-creation process, but it was also fast! Just one year after establishing ZEMBA, we announced the results of our first collective request for proposal.

– Ingrid Irigoyen, CEO of ZEMBA

This robust legal and technical foundation enables ZEMBA’s tender process. Members, often from sustainability or procurement teams, first nominate the volume of freight they intend to decarbonise. These volumes are then combined to form a collective demand for zero-emission shipping. With input from industry experts – who assess the technical readiness and commercial viability of fuel options – ZEMBA issues competitive requests for proposals to shipping carriers, under clearly defined rules that ensure fair competition. After the neutral panel of experts selects a winning bid, ZEMBA members can choose to sign bilateral contracts and claim the associated emissions reductions once the zero-emission fuel or technology has been deployed and verified.

Because companies rarely control when or where zero-emission shipping is available, ZEMBA uses Katalist, the first nonprofit maritime book and claim system, which separates physical freight movement from emissions accounting. This means members can fund and claim the reductions even when their cargo isn’t on a zero-emission ship. Unlike traditional offsetting, this is an in-sector investment in clean shipping deployment.

In its first tender, ZEMBA secured 17 bilateral contracts and avoided 82,000 tonnes of CO₂e emissions. A second tender is underway to accelerate the availability of e-fuels and expand the number of vessels equipped to use them – a leap towards transforming the sector.

Financing: ZEMBA does not currently charge membership fees, which lowers the barrier to entry for many prospective companies. Its operations are philanthropically funded, while member companies finance zero-emission shipping directly by paying a premium through the bilateral contracts they sign with selected carriers. ZEMBA’s focus on scalable solutions ensures a return on investment through lower future costs while allowing members to benefit from economies of scale in these premiums.

A blueprint for creating new markets for the circular economy

ZEMBA’s success reflects a broader trend: sectors like trucking and aviation are adopting similar models to aggregate demand and accelerate decarbonisation, while major fashion brands are pooling demand to accelerate next-generation materials. Since 2021, the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, developed by GMA, the Environmental Defense Fund, and Rocky Mountain Institute, has developed a model to catalyse nearly USD 200 million in sustainable aviation fuel investment.

Innovations in technology, services, and materials are integral to achieving a circular economycircular economyA systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution. It is based on three principles, driven by design: eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials (at their highest value), and regenerate nature., but when many reach the “valley of death” between R&D and commercial deployment, they stall. ZEMBA’s model bridges this gap by helping companies aggregate future demand, build the business case for suppliers, and then reduce costs through coordinated procurement. It offers hard-to-decarbonise sectors a replicable pathway to commercial transformation.

Today, ZEMBA’s membership stands at over 40 multinational companies, including IKEA, Pernod Ricard, Phillips, and Reckitt. Through collective action, neutral governance, and a shared commitment, it is overcoming the barriers to market maturity to make zero-emission shipping the new default – and ultimately create a competitive market for zero-emission shipping in which ZEMBA is no longer needed.

According to the report, Southwest Airlines laid off seven of its ten employees who were working on sustainability projects at the company.
Nevertheless, Southwest Airlines continues to pursue several climate-focused efforts to reduce its environmental impact and improve operational efficiency, according to its website.
This long-distance shipping contributes to carbon emissions, with maritime transport accounting for about 2% of global CO2 output.","Southwest Airlines is said to be pulling back on some of its environmental programs. Bloomberg News reports that the airline is selling its renewable fuel subsidiary, Saffire Renewables, to Conestoga Energy, a producer of low-carbon biofuels.

The deal reportedly covers all of Saffire’s intellectual property, associated technologies, core members of its leadership team, and plans for a pilot facility in Kansas aimed at producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.

Southwest Airlines Steps Back From Green Commitments?

Southwest’s decision to sell its renewable fuel unit signals not only a shift in the airline’s focus but also a broader global trend. The sale of Saffire Renewables is just the latest step in this broader pullback. According to the report, Southwest Airlines laid off seven of its ten employees who were working on sustainability projects at the company.

Nevertheless, Southwest Airlines continues to pursue several climate-focused efforts to reduce its environmental impact and improve operational efficiency, according to its website. In 2025, the airline aims to cut single-use plastics in in-flight service by 50% by weight. By 2030, it plans to reduce carbon emissions intensity by 25% and replace 10% of its total jet fuel consumption with SAF.

Whether the SAF goal can still be achieved following the sale of its renewable fuel unit remains uncertain. According to its website, Southwest continues to explore opportunities to procure and support the scaled production of SAF, but supply is subject to legal, regulatory, financial, technical, and commercial risks, and while the airline may enter into agreements for offtake or investment, it cannot guarantee that third parties will deliver sufficient SAF on commercially reasonable terms.

Cutback Targets Already Modest Climate Push

The aviation industry has pledged to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, as per the International Air Transportation Association (IATA). But over the past two years, some airlines have dialed back their climate initiatives, revising their targets to more modest levels.

One of the earliest major announcements came from Air New Zealand in July 2024, when the airline scrapped its 2030 climate target set under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The goal had aimed to cut emissions by 28.9% from a 2019 baseline. The carrier cited factors such as the availability of new aircraft, the affordability and supply of SAF, and a lack of political support.

In May 2025, Air New Zealand decided to change its goals from targeted achievements to a tracking process. According to a LinkedIn post by Kiri Hannifin, Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer for Air New Zealand, and an airline statement, the decision to go from targets to guidance was due to the technological challenges and ""uncertainty"" in meeting the original targets.

Slower Than Expected Progress

SAF has been at the forefront of efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from air travel. According to IATA, achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 will require a combination of eliminating emissions at the source, offsetting, and carbon capture technologies. Of this, 65% would come from replacing conventional jet fuel with SAF, 19% from offsets and carbon capture, 13% from new technologies such as hydrogen or electric aircraft, and 3% from infrastructure and operational efficiencies.

However, the adoption of SAF in global commercial operations has been extremely slow. SAF faces significant hurdles, including high production costs, limited scalability, and concerns about its true environmental impact. In the UK, for instance, SAF is primarily produced from used cooking oil, some of which is imported from Asia. This long-distance shipping contributes to carbon emissions, with maritime transport accounting for about 2% of global CO2 output.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2645810365-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 10:56:34.784347

This was an 18 per cent year-on-year increase from US$42.4 million.

The growth was attributed to increases in gross profit and share of results from associates, the Singapore Exchange-listed group said on Thursday (Aug 14).

Earnings per share jumped 18.1 per cent to US$0.0582 from US$0.0493 previously for the company, which is a key supplier of imported jet fuel to China.

CAO attributed the rise in business volume to higher trading volumes of crude and fuel oils. The increase in jet fuel supply volume and optimisation gains from trading activities thus led to a jump in revenue and gross profit.

Gross profit was US$30.4 million, a 25.7 per cent increase from US$24.2 million recorded in the same period the previous year.

Revenue rose 13.6 per cent to US$8.6 billion, from US$7.5 billion in the first half of 2024, underscored by a “strong uptick” in demand. Total supply and trading volume went up 35.4 per cent to 13.8 million tonnes in H1 FY2025 from 10.2 million tonnes previously.

The share of results from CAO’s associates rose 18.6 per cent to US$27.4 million. This was largely down to higher refuelling volumes from the sole supplier of jet fuel at Shanghai Pudong International Airport (leading to a 13.9 per cent increase in contributions to US$25.5 million), and higher contributions from petroleum complex logistics terminal company Oilhub Korea Yeosu.

The volume of middle distillates for H1 grew 18.7 per cent to 7.4 million tonnes from 6.2 million tonnes, while the trading volume of other oil products rose to 6.4 million tonnes, from 4 million tonnes in the same period the previous year. This was due to higher trading volumes of fuel and crude oils.

CAO also stated that it has zero net-interest-bearing debt.

Outlook

CAO chief executive Lin Yi said his company is “cautiously optimistic” about its medium-term outlook.

The company pointed out the International Air Transport Association forecast that the total operating profits for the global civil aviation industry are set to grow 6.6 per cent to US$66 billion this year.

It added that relaxed visa requirements across countries in the Asia-Pacific mean that the region is expected to account for 52 per cent of the global aviation industry’s revenue passenger kilometre increase.

China is set to be a “significant contributor”, accounting for more than 40 per cent of the region’s aviation traffic, said CAO.

“CAO remains confident about the aviation industry’s trajectory amidst a dynamic global landscape,” said Lin, referring to the geopolitical instability, trade tensions and supply-chain disruptions that were seen in the first half of the year.

He added: “Supported by healthy recovery in the global aviation industry, rising demand across our key markets, and new opportunities posed by the low-carbon business, CAO is well-positioned to benefit from these opportunities.”

CAO executive chairman Shi Yanliang stated that the company is also “committed to” its development goals in the sustainable aviation fuel business, alongside business innovation and strengthened risk management.

At the mid-day break on Thursday, shares of CAO were flat at S$1.23 compared with its closing price the previous day.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/eaef854ca1e15261fdd720902f75b6041901c48e14e562e5e768446963ea7a4e?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-14 07:56:44.341246

ABOUT TIDEWATER RENEWABLES Tidewater Renewables is an energy transition company.
Additional information relating to Tidewater Renewables is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and at www.tidewater-renewables.com.
Forward-Looking Information Certain statements contained in this press release constitute forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively referred to herein as, ""forward-looking statements"") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.","Tidewater Renewables continues to advocate for a fair and competitive regulatory framework that supports the growth of Canada's renewable fuels industry. The Corporation remains highly encouraged by the modifications to the Low Carbon Fuels Act the Government of British Columbia announced on February 27, 2025, which increased the renewable fuel requirement for diesel from 4% to 8% for the 2025 compliance period. Effective April 1, 2025, the modification also mandated that the renewable fuel content be produced within Canada (collectively, the ""Amendments""). These changes are strongly aligned with Tidewater Renewables' strategic vision and reinforce the government's commitment to strengthening Canadian clean fuel production.

Since the introduction of the Amendments, the Corporation has experienced a significant increase in commercial activity, reflecting rising demand for Canadian-produced renewable diesel and improved emissions credit economics. As a result of this favourable regulatory shift and the Corporation's ongoing marketing efforts, Tidewater Renewables has successfully secured contracted offtakes for over 70% of forecasted production for the second half of 2025. The majority of these new offtake agreements are priced based on U.S. import parity benchmarks, aligning contract pricing with prevailing U.S. market values and contributing to enhanced market competitiveness. The remaining production is expected to be sold into the spot market, where pricing remains favourable, providing additional upside potential.

These positive developments validate Tidewater Renewables' commercial strategy and underscore its position as a leading, reliable supplier of renewable diesel in the Canadian market. Management believes the Corporation is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing regulatory tailwinds in the low-carbon fuels sector and remains focused on maximizing value creation for shareholders.

Trade action

On May 5, 2025, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (the ""Tribunal"") issued a decision to terminate its preliminary injury inquiry in respect of the Corporation's countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping duty complaint relating to imports of renewable diesel from the U.S. (the ""Investigation""). The Tribunal subsequently released reasons for its decision on May 23, 2025. The Tribunal's decision ends the Investigation arising from the complaint filed by the Corporation with the Canada Border Services Agency (""CBSA"") on December 30, 2024 and initiated by the CBSA on March 6, 2025.

The Corporation has reviewed the Tribunal's reasons for its decision and is currently evaluating its available options and legal remedies. This includes, but is not limited to, the potential for filing a new complaint with the CBSA or considering other actions to address the impact of these U.S. renewable diesel imports on the Canadian renewable fuels market.

SAF development update

Tidewater Renewables continues to advance the 6,500 bbl/d SAF project in British Columbia, with the front-end engineering design work now complete. As part of this ongoing development, the Corporation is pleased to report that it has received approval from the Government of British Columbia to amend the existing initiative agreement to provide further support in the form of additional BC LCFS credits. These additional credits are specifically intended to fund the further work required to reach a final investment decision for the project, which remains under evaluation and is now targeted for 2026.

While Tidewater Renewables remains optimistic about the project's potential, the decision to proceed with the SAF project is contingent upon the execution of long-term offtake agreements, provincial and federal government support, and obtaining committed financing.

HDRD Complex

During the second quarter of 2025, the renewable diesel & renewable hydrogen complex (the ""HDRD Complex"") achieved an average utilization rate of 2,164 bbl/d, or 72% of design capacity. This compares to 2,925 bbl/d, or 98% of design capacity, during the same period in the prior year. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the HDRD Complex achieved an average utilization rate of 2,201 bbl/d, or 73% of design capacity, compared to 2,520 bbl/d, or 84% of design capacity, in the same period of 2024.

Utilization during the second quarter of 2025 remained relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2025. The decrease during the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same periods in 2024 was primarily attributable to a minor fire incident on April 1, 2025, at the main renewable diesel process unit within the HDRD Complex. The fire was promptly contained, with the affected area safely isolated and stabilized. As a result, operations at the HDRD Complex were temporarily suspended, but successfully resumed on April 14, 2025. Following the restart, utilization rates steadily improved, supported by disciplined ramp-up procedures and robust operational oversight.

Tidewater Renewables continues to expect the HDRD Complex to achieve an average throughput of between 2,200 to 2,400 bbl/d for the full year 2025, inclusive of the planned turnaround activity during the third quarter of 2025, supported by ongoing operational optimizations and improving market conditions.

Capital Program

Tidewater Renewables maintenance capital for the year is estimated to be approximately $8.0 million to $10.0 million, allocated primarily to the planned turnaround activity for the HDRD Complex in the third quarter of 2025. The planned turnaround is expected to last three weeks and have a minimal impact on sales as renewable diesel will continue to be sold from inventory during the turnaround.

ABOUT TIDEWATER RENEWABLES

Tidewater Renewables is an energy transition company. The Corporation is focused on the production of low carbon fuels, primarily renewable diesel. The Corporation was created in response to the growing demand for renewable fuels in North America and to capitalize on its potential to efficiently turn a wide variety of renewable feedstocks (such as tallow, used cooking oil, distillers corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil and other biomasses) into low carbon fuels. Tidewater Renewables' objective is to become a leading Canadian renewable fuel producer. The Corporation is pursuing this objective through the ownership, development, and operation of clean fuels projects and related infrastructure, that utilize existing proven technologies. Additional information relating to Tidewater Renewables is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and at www.tidewater-renewables.com.

NON-GAAP AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES

Throughout this press release and in other materials disclosed by the Corporation, Tidewater Renewables uses a number of non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures when assessing its results and measuring overall performance. The intent of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP ratios is to provide additional useful information to investors and analysts. These non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP ratios do not have standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. As such, these measures should not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise indicated, these non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios will be calculated and disclosed on a consistent basis from period to period. Specific adjusting items may only be relevant in certain periods. For more information with respect to the Corporation's non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures see the ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" section of Tidewater Renewables' MD&A which is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation are Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as income (or loss) before finance costs, taxes, depreciation, share-based compensation, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, transaction costs, and other items considered non-recurring in nature, plus the Corporation's proportionate share of Adjusted EBITDA in its equity investment.

Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to set objectives, make operating and capital investment decisions, monitor debt covenants and assess performance. Tidewater Renewables also believes Adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors, lending institutions and others to evaluate the financial performance of the Corporation. From time to time, the Corporation issues guidance on this key measure. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a relevant measure in this press release and the MD&A to assist analysts and readers in assessing the performance of the Corporation as seen from management's perspective. Investors should be cautioned that Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net (loss) income, net cash provided by operating activities or other measures of financial results determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of the Corporation's performance and may not be comparable to companies with similar calculations.

The following table reconciles net loss, the nearest GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA:

Distributable Cash Flow

Distributable cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital plus transaction costs, non-recurring expenses, and after any expenditures that use cash from operations. Changes in non-cash working capital are excluded from the determination of distributable cash flow because they are primarily the result of seasonal fluctuations or other temporary changes, and are generally funded with short-term debt or cash flows from operating activities. Maintenance capital expenditures, including turnarounds, are deducted from distributable cash flow as they are ongoing recurring expenditures which are funded from operating cash flows. Transaction costs are added back as they vary significantly quarter to quarter based on the Corporation's acquisition and disposition activity. Distributable cash flow also excludes non-recurring transactions that do not reflect Tidewater Renewables' ongoing operations.

Management believes distributable cash flow is a useful metric for investors when assessing the amount of cash flow generated from the Corporation's normal operations. These cash flows are relevant to the Corporation's ability to internally fund growth projects, alter its capital structure, or distribute returns to shareholders.

The following table reconciles net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the nearest GAAP measure, to distributable cash flow:

Non-GAAP Financial Ratios

The Corporation uses the following non-GAAP financial ratios to present aspects of its financial performance or financial position.

Distributable cash flow per common share (basic and diluted)

Distributable cash flow per common share is calculated as distributable cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, over the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

Management believes that distributable cash flow per common share provides investors an indicator of funds generated from the business that could be allocated to each shareholder's equity position.

Capital Management Measures

Net Debt

Net debt is used by the Corporation to monitor its capital structure and financing requirements. It is also used as a measure of the Corporation's overall financial strength. Net debt is defined as amounts owing under the senior credit facility and second lien credit facility, less cash.

Net debt excludes working capital, lease liabilities and derivative contracts as the Corporation monitors its capital structure based on net debt to Adjusted EBITDA.

The following table reconciles net debt:

Supplementary Financial Measures

Growth Capital

Growth capital expenditures are defined as expenditures which are recoverable, incrementally increase cash flow or the earning potential of assets, expand the capacity of current operations, or significantly extend the life of existing assets. This measure can be used by investors to assess the Corporation's discretionary capital spending.

Maintenance Capital

Maintenance capital expenditures are generally defined as expenditures that support and/or maintain the current capacity, cash flow or earning potential of existing assets without the characteristic benefits associated with growth capital expenditures. These expenditures include major inspections and overhaul costs that are required on a periodic basis. This measure can be used by investors to assess the Corporation's non-discretionary capital spending.

His early career was not in aviation but in major multinational companies. From 1997 to 2002, he worked at Procter & Gamble, followed by a marketing position at Coca-Cola.

He later moved into the telecommunications sector, joining Méditel (now Orange Morocco) as Director of the Business Division.

In 2008, Addou became CEO of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT), where he helped design and launch Morocco’s Vision 2020 for tourism, a long-term strategy to make the country one of the top 20 tourist destinations in the world.

Before joining RAM, he also served as CEO of Diana Holding, a large Moroccan agri-food group, and of SAEMOG, a tourism and real estate company.

Leading Royal Air Maroc

When Addou was appointed Chairman and CEO of RAM in February 2016, at the age of 44, it marked a new chapter for the airline. He was seen as a young, energetic leader capable of turning challenges into opportunities.

Under his leadership, RAM has pursued a strong growth strategy. By 2019, the airline was flying to 99 destinations across five continents with a fleet of 52 aircraft.

In 2023, Addou presented a 2023-2037 strategic plan that aims to grow the fleet to 200 aircraft and increase annual passenger numbers to 31.6 million.

And in December that year, RAM operated Africa’s first carbon-neutral flight using sustainable aviation fuel, in partnership with Afriquia SMDC, a first for the continent.

Addou has overseen one of the largest fleet renewal programs in the airline’s history. In 2024, RAM launched a major tender to buy 200 new planes, mainly Boeing models. By June 2025, negotiations were underway for 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, up to 50 Boeing 737s, and a first-ever order for 20 Airbus A220s.

Partnerships have been a core part of Addou’s strategy. In September 2023, RAM signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Air Senegal to expand cooperation in West Africa.

In March 2025, RAM signed an MoU with China Southern Airlines to develop a codeshare agreement with the goal of improving connectivity between Africa and China.

RAM has also celebrated the return of direct flights between Casablanca and Beijing, an important link for both business and tourism.

Competing with low-cost airlines

Addou has openly acknowledged the challenge posed by low-cost carriers, especially in Europe. He has positioned RAM as a service, and quality-focused airline that offers a stronger network to Africa and Europe, while Gulf carriers dominate routes to Asia.

Addou is not only a leader within Morocco but also a respected figure in the international aviation community. He is a member of the Board of Governors of IATA (International Air Transport Association), the Executive Committee of AACO (Arab Air Carriers Organization), the AFRAA (African Airlines Association), and the Oneworld Alliance Governing Board.

He has represented Africa in global aviation discussions, during which he emphasized that RAM’s growth strategy is based on realistic market data rather than overly optimistic projections.

Under Addou’s leadership, Royal Air Maroc has achieved several important milestones. In summer 2025, the airline announced a record-breaking program offering 6.6 million seats across more than 95 destinations worldwide.

In 2023, it made history by operating the first carbon-neutral flight from Africa, using sustainable aviation fuel in partnership with Afriquia SMDC. The airline has also earned international recognition for its quality of service, holding a prestigious 4-Star Skytrax rating and being named “Best Airline in Africa” by Global Traveler for two consecutive years.

To support its long-term growth strategy, RAM is in advanced negotiations to acquire 200 new aircraft, a move that is expected to significantly expand its fleet and global reach.",https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/WhatsApp-Image-2025-08-13-at-15.49.11.jpeg,N,,2025-08-14 07:56:59.810031

The news came from Johor State Executive Council Member Lee Ting Han, who shared the update in a translated Facebook post. Lee called PETRONAS “one of the pride of Malaysia” and noted that Pengerang is already home to the PETRONAS Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project, part of the massive Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC), which is one of the largest energy hubs in the region.

Driving Johor’s green energy push

Lee said that following discussions between state officials and PETRONAS management, it’s clear this new venture will bring both economic and environmental gains. The production of SAF and HVO will help Malaysia progress towards a greener future, while helping maintain Pengerang’s reputation as a hub for sustainability and innovation.

It’s not just about the technology — the project is expected to open up good-quality jobs for locals and give Johor a head start in the fast-growing renewable fuel industry.

What it could mean for Singapore

If you’re a frequent flyer out of Changi or work in Singapore’s aviation sector, this could be closer to home than you think. With Pengerang just across the Causeway, a steady supply of SAF from Johor could help Changi Airport and its airlines meet tough international sustainability targets without paying the high costs of importing from far-off suppliers.

For the everyday traveller, it could mean flying on cleaner, more environmentally friendly planes — without ticket prices soaring from expensive fuel imports.

And it’s not just about the skies. Renewable diesel from the project could find its way into Singapore’s buses, trucks, and even ferries, cutting carbon emissions without replacing existing engines. In other words, cleaner fuel could start powering your daily commute as well as your holiday flights.

Backed by the state

Lee stressed that the Johor State Government will give its full support to ensure the refinery is a success.

“This project will not only drive the country’s green transformation, but will also create quality job opportunities, bring renewable energy technology to Johor, and strengthen Pengerang’s position as a regional energy hub,” he said.

The industry must adopt propulsion technologies that can achieve zero direct emissions in flight to remain aligned with global climate objectives.

Hydrogen-electric propulsion, integrated from the ground up in clean-sheet aircraft, offers the most viable way forward for sustainable aviation.

As aviation’s carbon intensity continues to rise, traditional approaches to propulsion and aircraft architecture are falling short.

Between 2000 and 2019, emissions from aviation increased by 53% and when considering the sector’s full impact on the atmosphere – not just carbon dioxide (CO₂) – it now accounts for about 3.5–4% of total climate change effects.

Accordingly, aviation must adopt propulsion technologies that can achieve zero direct emissions in flight to remain aligned with global climate objectives, without relying on combustion or fuel sources with significant lifecycle trade-offs – such as biofuels derived from palm oil or synthetic fuels produced using fossil-based electricity.

Beyond Aero believes hydrogen-electric propulsion, integrated from the ground up in a clean-sheet aircraft, represents the most technically viable pathway. Here we outline how this architecture can scale from business aviation to regional, and eventually commercial, markets by 2050.

Why hydrogen and not batteries or biofuels?

Jet fuel delivers approximately 12,000 Wh/kg of energy, vastly more than today’s best batteries, which achieve around 250 Wh/kg. This fundamental limitation currently restricts battery-electric aircraft to subregional missions and light payloads.

Hydrogen, however, offers eight-times the energy efficiency over synthetic fuels when deployed in electric systems and a higher specific energy by weight than any battery or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) alternative.

While synthetic fuels such as power-to-liquid SAFs can be used in existing aircraft, their combustion still produces nitrogen oxides (NOx) and contrail-inducing particulates, especially at altitude. These fuels also face severe efficiency and scalability challenges, being roughly 3.5 times less efficient than hydrogen-electric architectures.

Hydrogen fuel cells, on the other hand, convert hydrogen into electricity through electrochemical reactions, producing only heat and water as outputs. No combustion means no soot, no NOx and potentially no contrails – an important consideration as aviation’s non-CO₂ impacts are scrutinized.

Designing a hydrogen-electric aircraft

To fully leverage the potential of hydrogen-electric propulsion, Beyond Aero has adopted a clean-sheet design philosophy – developing its aircraft from the ground up around the unique architecture and requirements of this next-generation power source.

Rather than modifying existing platforms, the company is engineering its first aircraft – the BYA-I light jet – as a purpose-built, hydrogen-electric aircraft optimized for both performance and manufacturability. The first electric aircraft powered by hydrogen propulsion is designed to carry six passengers up to 800 nautical miles (1,500km) – five times farther than similar battery-electric aircraft.

Loading...

Unlike retrofitted jets that suffer performance trade-offs due to additional weight and aerodynamic drag, the BYA-I integrates its fuel cells, hydrogen tanks, electric propulsion and thermal management systems from the outset. This holistic configuration enables improved weight distribution, cooling efficiency and aerodynamics – critical factors for range, safety and certification in aircraft under 8.6 tons.

Modern hydrogen fuel cells are already efficient and lightweight enough to power aircraft under 8.6 tons. As production scales, further improvements in performance and cost are expected.

Embedding digital infrastructure in aviation from the outset

Alongside new propulsion systems, the aircraft architecture must leverage digital systems by design. The digitalization of aviation has typically been layered atop legacy platforms, but clean-sheet electric aircraft enable digital infrastructure to be embedded from inception. This includes:

Sensor-rich health monitoring of powerplant and structural components.

Fly-by-wire avionics to support flight efficiency and manoeuvrability.

Cloud-based machine learning to process fleet-wide data and optimize future flights.

Edge computing onboard to enable real-time diagnostics, routing adjustments and user interface personalization.

For operators, this architecture translates into actionable benefits: automated crew scheduling, predictive maintenance and load balancing across fleets. For pilots, real-time route optimization based on weather and performance data reduces pre-flight prep and in-flight uncertainty. These are not lifestyle enhancements – they are architectural enablers for lower downtime, higher availability and more efficient asset utilization.

When integrated into the aircraft’s native software and hardware environment, digitalization becomes core to flight safety, operational efficiency and fleet adaptability.

Business aviation as a launchpad

Business aviation is the low hanging fruit of the aviation world, and is likely to be the first to see a shift towards hydrogen. Here's why:

Certification advantages: Aircraft classified under CS23/FAR23 (typically under 8.6 tons) benefit from a more streamlined and less costly certification process compared to the more stringent requirements for larger commercial aircraft.

Operational fit: More than 70% of business aviation flights are under 1,000 km and 90% are under 2,000 km – well within hydrogen-electric range capabilities.

Cost efficiency: The OEM fuel cell system eliminates high-temperature cycles and rotating assemblies common in turbines, significantly reducing maintenance requirements. Preliminary data shows over 20% lower operating costs than comparable turboprops or jet models, supported by results from Project Fresson, which demonstrated up to 50% savings in propulsion system maintenance costs, and long-term hydrogen fuel cost forecasts indicating price parity – or advantage – over Jet A-1 by 2030.

Concerns about hydrogen refuelling are increasingly addressable. As of 2023, more than 1,000 refuelling stations exist globally, with a +60% increase from 2021 to 2023.

For aviation, the recently published SAE AIR8466 report, defines best practices and engineering guidelines for setting up hydrogen refuelling systems at airports – ensuring safe handling and compatibility for both gaseous and liquid hydrogen infrastructure.

Initial deployments can be strategically focused: 15% of business airports handle 90% of global business jet traffic. Equipping the top 10 on each continent would enable over 500,000 hydrogen-electric flights annually, according to WingX and EBAA Traffic Tracker.

Roadmap to scaling hydrogen-electric aircraft

Beyond Aero’s roadmap to hydrogen-electric flight is designed to deliver early impact, support infrastructure rollout and scale in alignment with global climate goals.

From 2020 to 2030, the focus lies on foundational steps, or seed phase, including the certification of a first aircraft under CS23/FAR23 regulations – enabling a faster time-to-market through the light aircraft category. Parallel efforts address the deployment of initial airport hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, ensuring early route viability. While hydrogen-electric systems take off, SAF remains a key lever to reduce emissions in legacy fleets.

What is the World Economic Forum doing to reduce aviation's carbon footprint?

As other sectors proceed to decarbonize, the aviation sector could account for a much higher share of global greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century than its 2%-3% share today.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) can reduce the life-cycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80%, but they currently make up less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption. Enabling a shift from fossil fuels to SAFs will require a significant increase in production, which is a costly investment.

The coalition brings together government leaders, climate experts and CEOs from aviation, energy, finance and other sectors who agree on the urgent need to help the aviation industry reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The coalition aims to advance the commercial scale of viable production of sustainable low-carbon aviation fuels (bio and synthetic) for broad adoption in the industry by 2030. Initiatives include a mechanism for aggregating demand for carbon-neutral flying, a co-investment vehicle and geographically specific value-chain industry blueprints.

During the 2030 to 2040 period, the harvest phase begins. This stage is characterized by advances in fuel cell performance and liquid hydrogen storage technologies, paving the way for the development of 70-seat regional aircraft certified under CS25 standards – marking a critical step in validating hydrogen-electric systems on higher-capacity routes and expanding their relevance across regional markets.

By 2040 to 2050, the roadmap enters its consolidation phase, aimed at launching a 150-seat commercial aircraft equipped with scaled hydrogen systems. This will unlock the ability to target high-frequency, short-haul routes that currently account for up to 24% of aviation-related emissions. Addressing these segments positions hydrogen-electric propulsion as a credible, high-impact alternative to conventional jet fuels.

As an aircraft manufacturer, Beyond Aero proposes a technically feasible roadmap – from propulsion architecture and certification to infrastructure rollout – based on real-world constraints and physics. By engineering around the limits of existing energy carriers, it aims to achieve zero direct emissions in flight on missions that represent most of current traffic.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_ddreAxOEFVUlgd3Krd6iBI8efCmswdvlwDch1lAmgb0.jpg,N,,2025-08-14 07:57:35.785212

The SAF Mandate is the UK’s key policy to decarbonise jet fuel and is the UK’s key policy mechanism to secure demand for SAF.
It does this by setting a legal obligation on fossil jet fuel suppliers in the UK to supply an increasing proportion of SAF over time.
The SAF Mandate obligation starts at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand in 2025, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.

The department’s view is that all statistics which are not designated as accredited official statistics are robust and have been produced to a suitable standard.

The SAF Mandate is the UK’s key policy to decarbonise jet fuel and is the UK’s key policy mechanism to secure demand for SAF. It delivers greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings by encouraging the supply of SAF within the aviation industry. It does this by setting a legal obligation on fossil jet fuel suppliers in the UK to supply an increasing proportion of SAF over time. Suppliers will receive certificates for the SAF they supply. The number of certificates they receive will be issued in proportion to the level of GHG emission reductions that fuel delivered.

The SAF Mandate obligation starts at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand in 2025, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040. Suppliers are required to submit reports on the carbon and sustainability standards of the low carbon fuels.

All provisional tables contain fuel volumes which are cross-verified with HMRC data. However, as suppliers can provide their data up to 7 months after the obligation period ends, all data published prior to the final report for each obligation period subject to change.

The final figures for each obligation period are usually published in the subsequent winter of the reporting year.

The event will bring together leaders from aviation, energy, finance, and policy to advance the industry’s commitment to achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

“As the IATA World Sustainability Symposium lands in Asia for the first time, we are honored that Hong Kong has been selected as the location and Cathay Pacific as the host airline. Collaboration across multiple sectors and regulators is essential for aviation to achieve its decarbonization goals, and gatherings like this provide a valuable platform for leading voices to come together to drive meaningful change. Such cooperation is especially important as the industry works to develop the ecosystem of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Hong Kong having the potential to become one of Asia’s major centers for SAF in the future,” said Ronald Lam, Cathay Group’s CEO.

“We are at a crucial point. Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But we have not seen sufficient, timely action by policymakers, aerospace manufacturers, oil companies, or fuel producers to support this commitment. This event is an essential rallying call for all those who have a stake in air transport’s future to overcome any challenges in the way of accelerating the pace of this crucial energy transition,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Symposium is strategically timed. It follows the 42nd ICAO Assembly at which the industry will have advocated for stronger government policies to support aviation’s energy transition to SAF and the integrity of CORSIA. And it precedes COP30 which is focusing on turning pledges into actions. The Symposium will bridge these two global milestones with in-depth explorations of pragmatic measures to accelerate aviation’s decarbonization by:

Removing hurdles standing in the way of expanding SAF production

Attracting financing for the $4.7 trillion cost of decarbonization

Integrating emerging technology developments by existing players and start-ups

Increasing collaboration across the value chain

The Symposium will open with a welcome speech from Ronald Lam, CEO of the Cathay Group and a keynote address from Mable Chan, Secretary of Transport & Logistics for the Hong Kong SAR Government. These will be followed by a leadership conversation between Patrick Healy, Chair of the Cathay Group, and Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, to candidly review progress on decarbonization. The speaker lineup of global experts for the remainder of the symposium includes:

Jun Ma, Chairman & President, Hong Kong Green Finance Association

Fabiano Piccino, Air Logistics Global Head of Sustainability, Kuehne+Nagel

Jouk Boeye, Managing Director Corporate Sourcing, Supply Chain Sustainability & Net Zero Operations, HSBC

Christopher Au, Director Asia Pacific Climate Risk Centre, WTW

Ayesha Choudhury, Chief Commercial Officer, Infinium

“WSS is where airlines and all stakeholders get together to develop the understanding and the policies that are necessary to achieve the financial and environmental sustainability of airlines. It is a platform for radical collaboration, involving all disciplines and sectors, and where efforts can be coordinated to bring practical solutions to the market. Decarbonizing the airline industry is not just an industry issue but part of the global energy-transition that cuts across the whole world economy. If treated as such, adopting a holistic approach encompassing policy, energy and finance to agriculture, technology and more, it will be possible to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions in 2050,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist.

About WSS

The World Sustainability Symposium is IATA’s flagship event on aviation sustainability. It convenes over 500 participants from across the globe, including airlines, fuel producers, investors, policymakers, and innovators. This year’s edition is hosted by Cathay Pacific.

Conclusion: Key Takeaways The business aviation sector is entering a period where sustainability measures will be measured less by intent and more by verifiable outcomes.","The conversation around sustainability in aviation is no longer limited to airline boardrooms or policy summits. Business aviation is facing the same questions: How much fuel is being burned? What alternatives exist? And how quickly can operators adapt?

While private jets account for a small share of total global emissions, the scrutiny is growing. Industry targets call for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to make up around 10 % of total fuel use by 2030, yet current adoption is still under 1 %. Regulatory mandates in Europe, new monitoring requirements, and evolving client expectations are pushing operators to act sooner rather than later.

This article examines the current state of SAF, the regulatory shifts shaping its adoption, and the operational realities for business aviation. It draws on recent data, industry reports, and regulatory updates to present a clear view of where the sector stands and what changes are likely to come.

The Simple Picture

Aviation contributes approximately 2–2.5 % of global CO₂ emissions according to Our World in Data. Within that share, business and private aviation account for 2–4 % of aviation’s emissions, based on International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates.

These numbers may appear small in a global context, but business aviation’s per-passenger emissions are higher than commercial aviation (5 to 14 times higher), making it an outsized target in public and policy discussions. This is shaping regulation, client expectations, and fuel-sourcing strategies.

For business aviation flight departments, the path forward is twofold:

Reduce fuel burn on every flight. This is within operational control now.

Engage with SAF credibly—understanding supply limitations, cost implications, and the need for verifiable documentation.

What Is Actually Happening with SAF

SAF production is growing, but remains far below 2030 targets. IATA projects ~2 million tonnes of SAF in 2025, or about 0.7 % of airlines’ total fuel demand—double the 2024 figure of ~1 million tonnes (0.3 %).

Growth is slowed by:

High production costs relative to Jet A/A-1.

Limited feedstock availability, particularly for HEFA pathways.

Project delays and cancellations, as highlighted in Reuters’ 2025 investigation.

SAF is a drop-in fuel certified under ASTM D7566/D1655, typically capped at 50 % blend depending on production pathway. Certification work is underway for 100 % SAF for certain aircraft/engine combinations, but widespread approval is years away.

Where physical SAF is unavailable, book-and-claim systems allow operators to purchase its environmental attributes from a producer injecting into the fuel network elsewhere. Credibility depends on third-party verification and adherence to IATA’s SAF accounting methodology.

The Rulebook Is Tightening

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates:

2 % SAF blend in 2025.

6 % SAF blend by 2030.

Progressive increases to 70 % by 2050, with sub-mandates for synthetic fuels beginning in 2030.

ICAO’s CORSIA scheme shifts from a voluntary phase (2024–2026) to a mandatory phase in 2027, covering most international routes between participating states.

EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) changes include:

More granular monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for small emitters.

Requirements to track alternative fuel usage.

Greenwashing enforcement is increasing. The EU’s new law restricts marketing terms like “carbon neutral” unless claims are backed by verifiable reductions, not solely offsets. In the United States, the SAF Grand Challenge targets 3 billion gallons annually by 2030.

Clarifying the “1 %” Claim

Some media coverage frames private aviation as “1 % of global emissions.” This is inaccurate. Aviation in total accounts for ~2–2.5 %, and private jets contribute ~2–4 % of that share. Communicating accurate data improves trust with clients, regulators, and the public.

Corporate Client and Board Expectations

Key shifts include:

Evidence over promises. Clients increasingly expect audited SAF certificates or documented operational savings instead of generic offset claims.

Compliance-ready messaging. EU-based customers may reject “carbon neutral” language outright without regulatory-compliant verification.

Structured plans. Decision-makers want clear, staged roadmaps combining operational efficiency, SAF integration, and residual offsets.

Operational Fuel Efficiency—Areas Within Control

1) Accurate Trip Fuel Planning

Use legal minima plus data-driven contingency reserves based on forecast winds, alternates, and anticipated ATC delays. Habitual over-fueling increases takeoff weight and cruise burn.

2) Tankering Discipline

Compare price spreads against burn penalties, emissions costs, and performance impacts. Use flight planning tools to calculate payload-range trade-offs and tankering break-even points.

3) Vertical Profile Optimization

Implement Continuous Climb Operations (CCO) and Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) to reduce level-off segments where fuel burn spikes. Use step climbs on long legs as weight decreases, and apply cost index values aligned with actual schedule constraints.

4) Lateral Efficiency

Request directs when airspace and ATC allow; even small route savings compound over multi-hour flights.

5) Ground Operations

Minimize APU usage—burn rates range from 130–225 kg/hr. Use GPU and pre-conditioned air where practical. Apply single-engine taxi when safe, reducing both fuel burn and emissions.

6) Weather and Routing Adjustments

Re-evaluate cruise altitude and speed for wind and temperature changes enroute; adjust for optimal fuel efficiency.

7) MEL/CDL Impacts

Inoperative items can alter drag or climb capability; integrate penalties into fuel planning rather than compensating with excess fuel uplift.

8) Weight Management

Audit non-essential onboard items and adjust potable water loads to reduce takeoff weight.

SAF Engagement Without Over-Promising

Physical SAF Uplift

Confirm blend percentage, production pathway (e.g., HEFA, FT, ATJ), and keep certificates with trip documentation.

Book-and-Claim Systems

When SAF is unavailable locally, purchase verified certificates through platforms aligned to IATA Accounting. Ensure traceability and maintain audit-ready records.

Offsets

Use offsets only for residual emissions after operational and SAF measures. Avoid “carbon neutral” claims unless compliant with jurisdictional requirements.

Regulatory and Cost Outlook

ReFuelEU mandates will increase fuel prices on EU sectors. CORSIA Phase II from 2027 will require mandatory MRV processes for covered flights. U.S. SAF production will grow with policy support, but volumes remain far below demand forecasts in the short term.

Putting It Into Your SOPs

Fuel Planning SOP – Define contingency tiers by route type; require sign-off for uplifts beyond set thresholds.

Flight Profile SOP – Default to lower cost index; brief CCO/CDO and step climbs; log denied ATC requests.

Ground Operations SOP – GPU/PCA by default; single-engine taxi where safe; APU limited by SOP exceptions.

SAF & Claims SOP – File blend certificates; centralize book-and-claim documentation by tail and flight number; use IATA-aligned language.

Reporting SOP – Monthly review of planned vs. actual fuel, APU usage, efficiency events, and SAF data.

Conclusion: Key Takeaways

The business aviation sector is entering a period where sustainability measures will be measured less by intent and more by verifiable outcomes. SAF will remain a limited but important tool, while operational efficiency will deliver the most immediate and dependable results.

Regulatory frameworks in Europe and internationally are moving quickly, and client expectations are evolving just as fast. Operators that build accurate data practices, apply efficiency measures consistently, and adopt SAF credibly will be best positioned to meet both compliance demands and market pressures.

In a landscape where scrutiny is increasing, credibility and precision will be as important as the fuel in the tanks.

FAQs

Is SAF engine-safe?

Yes. ASTM-approved SAF meets the same specifications as Jet A/A-1.

Can we operate on 100 % SAF?

Not broadly; current approvals cap blends at ~50 %.

What if SAF is unavailable?

Book-and-claim provides a credible, verifiable alternative.

How costly is APU use?

States and international mandates are driving procurement even as federal policy is unsettled.","(U.S.) U.S. sustainable aviation fuel is growing fast in 2025, but it’s doing so under new pressure from Washington. Industry data show SAF production capacity has jumped to about 30,000 barrels per day, up from roughly 2,000 b/d at the start of 2024, even as President Trump’s early‑2025 budget cuts trimmed federal renewable energy programs tied to research and infrastructure grants. State incentives and international rules are now carrying more of the load, keeping airlines and fuel makers moving forward while policy at the federal level remains unsettled.

Policy shifts reshape the 2025 SAF landscape

Federal support is mixed. The Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45Z clean fuel production credit still applies, but its three‑year window has spooked investors who need long horizons for big plants. The credit is being reviewed for possible extension or changes, but no final direction is set.

At the same time, agencies are signaling different priorities. The Environmental Protection Agency is still administering the Renewable Fuel Standard, with final rules expected by late 2025, yet recent proposals have leaned toward conventional biofuels over newer technologies. Official RFS details are available from the EPA: https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program

The White House posture has shifted as well. The current administration has cut discretionary grants and research dollars for advanced renewables, including some SAF projects, reflecting a broader tilt toward fossil fuel development. Still, officials have said they support crop‑based biofuels, and some tax credits and loan guarantees that help those pathways remain in place. That split approach—limits on federal grants alongside continued incentives for bio‑based supply—has become a key theme of 2025.

According to analysis by VisaVerge.com, state measures and international rules are now doing more of the heavy lifting as federal signals change. Producers describe higher compliance demand from airlines and airports that need reliable volumes to meet state and overseas rules.

California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) continues to generate strong credits for SAF, helping offset federal pullbacks. Other states are weighing similar programs. These policies directly reward lower‑carbon fuel used at in‑state airports and have become an important part of project financing stacks.

Abroad, mandates are rising. The EU and UK began 2% SAF blending requirements in 2025, with scheduled increases that march toward 70% by 2050. For U.S. carriers flying transatlantic routes, that means:

Finding more supply

Signing longer offtake deals

Proving lifecycle emissions performance that meets European rules

Global aviation bodies—including ICAO and IATA—continue to push SAF as core to hitting net‑zero aviation goals by 2050. This external pressure matters: even with federal uncertainty, airlines serving Europe must show compliance and are turning to U.S. producers that can certify to ASTM D7566 and deliver consistent quality.

Industry financing follows these mandates. In early 2025, the U.S. government approved a loan guarantee to help Montana Renewables expand to 315 million gallons per year—roughly half of North America’s current SAF capacity. The move underscores how large, bankable plants with secured feedstocks and buyers still find backing, especially when their output helps airlines meet state and international rules.

Market performance in mid‑2025 has been strong. Examples include:

Neste recorded nearly 80% quarter‑over‑quarter growth in SAF sales.

Valero posted record SAF volumes.

These results mirror broader momentum seen in North America and Europe through mid‑2025.

Industry capacity and pressure points

Several numbers capture the sector’s split screen—rapid growth and real constraints:

Metric 2025 figure U.S. SAF production capacity ~30,000 b/d (mid‑2025) U.S. capacity (early 2024) ~2,000 b/d Global SAF output ~2.2 billion liters (2025) Share of U.S. jet fuel Under 2%; total U.S. jet fuel ~1.7 million b/d Global SAF (metric tons) ~2 million metric tons (~0.7% of global jet fuel) Montana Renewables expansion 315 million gallons/year

Despite higher volumes, supply is concentrated. A handful of large plants account for much of the output, with Montana Renewables now a leading producer after its 2025 expansion. That concentration can limit flexibility when feedstocks get tight or when maintenance takes a unit offline.

Federal cuts have also slowed some new R&D and infrastructure projects, particularly those that depended on grant funding. Producers say existing facilities are still supported by tax credits and loan guarantees, but pilot lines and early‑stage technology may wait for clearer federal direction or stronger state incentives before moving ahead.

The Renewable Fuel Standard remains a key framework for advanced fuels, including SAF. But with proposed volumes favoring conventional biofuels, developers of newer pathways—waste‑based, residue‑based, or synthetic—are pushing for stronger signals. Many want multi‑year certainty for Section 45Z beyond its short window, plus alignment between federal lifecycle accounting and state LCFS rules to lower compliance risk across markets.

Typical project development pathway

Producers describe a common build path with sequential steps:

Lock in sustainable feedstocks (waste oils, ag residues, crop oils).

Secure permits and financing tied to LCFS credits, Section 45Z, and sometimes USDA‑linked loan guarantees.

Retrofit or build plants able to meet ASTM D7566 and blend into conventional jet fuel.

Finalize offtake contracts with airlines and organize airport delivery logistics.

Each step is easier when policy is stable and when state and federal rules align on how to count carbon reductions.

Demand, markets, and politics

For airlines, the 2025 story is compliance and availability. Carriers serving the EU and UK must plan for rising blend rates, pushing them to sign long‑term deals now. U.S. airports in states with low‑carbon programs seek assured flows to capture credits.

Key market observations:

SAF remains scarce relative to demand, favoring large buyers willing to commit early.

States and international mandates are driving procurement even as federal policy is unsettled.

Environmental groups press for stronger sustainability filters, urging policy to favor waste‑based and synthetic routes to limit land‑use pressure.

The politics remain fluid. Support increased under President Biden from 2021 to 2024 through the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure funding, but 2025 cuts under President Trump changed the federal balance. While crop‑based biofuels still see support, advanced renewables face a narrower lane at the federal level. States are filling some of the gap, and international mandates are setting a rising floor for demand.

Important: Industry actors consistently cite the need for long‑term federal certainty—multi‑year credits, aligned lifecycle accounting, and harmonized standards—if today’s momentum is to translate into durable, economy‑wide supply.

Analysts forecast cautious growth tied to policy clarity:

5–10% SAF share of U.S. jet fuel by 2030 if supportive policies continue.

~3 billion gallons annually by 2030, with potential to reach 35 billion gallons by 2050 if incentives and standards stay in place and scale‑up costs fall.

DHL’s Wider SAF Commitments DHL Express has been a frontrunner in scaling up SAF use globally.","DHL Express and the Cathay Group have signed a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership aimed at reducing carbon emissions from cargo flights in Asia and boosting the regional supply of the low-carbon fuel.

Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL with 2,400 tonnes of SAF for flights operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned Cathay subsidiary that provides dedicated express cargo services for DHL. The fuel will be used on international flights departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi airports.

According to the companies, the agreement will run through 2025 and is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by about 7,190 tonnes — equivalent to the emissions of more than 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore on an Airbus A330 freighter.

“Important Step” for SAF in Asia

Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation – Asia Pacific at DHL Express, said SAF remains a small part of the global fuel mix but has significant potential to cut aviation emissions.

“Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions,” Bardens said. “Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand.

DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which recognises ‘green logistics of choice’ as one of the four bottom lines.”

The deal builds on a long-standing relationship between DHL and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong, which has supported DHL’s Asia Pacific network for more than two decades.

First SAF Use for Air Hong Kong

Tom Owen, Cathay’s Director Cargo, said the deal represents a milestone for the airline group.

“This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network,” Owen said. “SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia.”

The partnership also makes DHL a strategic partner in Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme. Launched in 2022, the programme helps corporate partners address greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight. In 2024, it enabled the use of more than 6,000 tonnes of SAF, with 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA, and Standard Chartered.

Expanding SAF Supply

Cathay has been increasing SAF sourcing across the region. Earlier in 2025, it signed an agreement with Sinopec to supply SAF produced in mainland China for use at Hong Kong International Airport — the first such export from the Chinese mainland. It has also partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027.

Beyond supply contracts, Cathay co-founded the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition to promote policy development and encourage adoption of SAF locally.

DHL’s Wider SAF Commitments

DHL Express has been a frontrunner in scaling up SAF use globally. It has secured long-term agreements with Neste, bp, and World Energy. In Japan, DHL partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use SAF produced domestically for flights departing the country.

Earlier this year, DHL signed another agreement with Neste for 7,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights from Singapore Changi Airport, further demonstrating its push to build demand and supply across Asia.

The company says these initiatives will also help it better understand the logistics of transporting alternative fuels — an area it identifies as a growth sector under its Strategy 2030, which includes developing end-to-end logistics solutions for renewable energy and alternative fuel markets.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DHL.png,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:11.964289

United’s CEO Scott Kirby hailed the 2019 contract with World Energy as an industry model for emissions reduction.
“Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases overstating their commitment to SAF projects,” said Gene Gebolys, CEO, World Energy.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing 340 airlines worldwide, projects SAF will account for only 0.7% of jet fuel consumption in 2025, up from 0.3% in 2024.","Over the past 12 years, the airline industry has announced 165 projects related to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but only 22%—36 projects—have been realized, according to a Reuters investigation. The remaining 129 initiatives remain pending, delayed, canceled, or lack updates.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and other waste. It is seen as crucial for reducing aviation emissions, a sector under mounting pressure to meet ambitious climate targets.

One notable project was operated by Boston-based World Energy, which began commercial SAF production in 2016 at its Paramount refinery near Los Angeles. The company supplied millions of gallons annually to major carriers such as United Airlines and JetBlue Airways. United’s CEO Scott Kirby hailed the 2019 contract with World Energy as an industry model for emissions reduction. However, the refinery quietly ceased operations in April 2025, and the United partnership ended years earlier without explanation. JetBlue confirmed ongoing collaboration with World Energy since 2020.

“Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases overstating their commitment to SAF projects,” said Gene Gebolys, CEO, World Energy. He did not name specific companies but acknowledged that some carriers have made sincere efforts. Gebolys also stressed the need for stronger government incentives to accelerate progress.

The Reuters review found that nearly all operational SAF projects—36 in total—use the HEFA process (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which converts waste oils and fats into fuel. This method is constrained by limited feedstock, restricting large-scale production.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing 340 airlines worldwide, projects SAF will account for only 0.7% of jet fuel consumption in 2025, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic is expected to rise 6% this year, increasing overall fuel demand. IATA’s net-zero target for 2050 requires SAF usage to reach 118 billion gallons annually—more than 300 times current production.

Reuters estimates that even if all 129 pending SAF projects reach full capacity, they would supply only about 12 billion gallons—roughly 10% of what is needed to achieve net-zero goals. The industry has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database to track SAF progress, leaving regulators and the public with limited insight into aviation’s sustainability trajectory.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-08/Airlines%20Complete%20Just%2022%25%20of%20Announced%20SAF%20Projects.jpg?h=02ae0a6b&itok=8IqbYk2p,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:18.842050

(Aug. 13, 2025) — Today, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation championed by Senate Majority Floor Leader Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) to ensure Michiganders can afford to heat their homes during the state’s colder months. Senate Bill 435 would make time-sensitive updates to how the state Treasury department makes its annual inflation adjustment for the Home Heating Tax Credit — proposing to utilize the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to account for inflation instead. In response to today’s passage, Sen. Singh has issued the following statement:

“As everyday costs continue to rise and Michiganders increasingly feel the stress of trying to make ends meet, we need to make sure our seniors and families around the state have a strong safety net to rely on. For the hundreds of thousands of Michigan households who depend on the Home Heating Credit to keep warm in the wintertime — this legislation is a no-brainer,” said Sen. Singh. “By making this necessary change to account for upward inflation, we can ensure our folks who are facing financial challenges can continue to access the resources they need now and into the future.”

The Michigan Home Heating Credit is an Individual Income Tax Credit that reduces the financial burden for over 250,000 low-income households across the state by allowing them to file for an annual credit that reimburses them for the costs of heating their home. It is implemented by the Michigan Dept. of Treasury and includes an annual inflation adjustment for eligibility purposes. The annual inflation adjustment in Michigan statute, the Detroit CPI for Fuels and Other Utilities, is being discontinued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Senate Bill 435 proposes to replace the outdated inflation adjustment with the U.S. CPI for Household Energy, which would be the closest available index that maintains the intent of current law.

The British aerospace giant reported a 50% profit surge in the first half of 2025, alongside significant strides in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and small modular reactors (SMRs), sparking optimism in the market.

Let's examine how Rolls-Royce's sustainability efforts are fuelling its financial success and investor confidence.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels Market Optimism

Rolls-Royce's commitment to sustainable aviation fuel has positioned it as a leader in decarbonising aviation. In late 2023, the company completed testing of 100% SAF on all its in-production civil aero engines, a milestone that aligns with global net-zero goals.

Simon Burr, Group Director of Engineering, Technology and Safety at Rolls-Royce, stated, 'This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry.'

The successful test underpinned a historic transatlantic flight on 28 November 2023, using 100% SAF on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce engines.

This achievement led to a 1.6% share price increase on the day of the announcement, with shares trading at £235.75 ($315.99).

The company's SAFinity programme, launched in 2025, further supports business aviation customers by combining sustainable aviation fuel investments with verified sustainability projects.

On X @RollsRoyceMENA posted, 'We shared our vision for a net-zero future, committing to eliminating operations facility emissions by 2050 & enhancing engine efficiency.'

This initiative reflects Rolls-Royce's strategy to meet rising demand for green aviation solutions, boosting investor confidence as aviation faces pressure to reduce emissions.

Financial Resilience Bolsters Investor Confidence

Rolls-Royce's financial performance in 2025 has been a key driver of its share price surge.

The company reported an operating profit of £1.73 billion ($2.31 billion) in the first half of 2025, up 50% from £1.15 billion ($1.54 billion) the previous year, with free cash flow reaching £1.6 billion ($2.14 billion).

CEO Tufan Erginbilgic attributed this to 'strong operational and strategic progress', stating, 'Our actions led to strong first half-year results, despite supply chain challenges and tariffs.'

The company raised its full-year operating profit forecast to £3.1 billion–£3.2 billion ($4.15 billion–$4.29 billion), driving shares to a peak of £1,073 ($1,437.82) on 31 July 2025, an 8.6% increase in a single day.

The civil aerospace division, powered by engine maintenance and upgrades, contributed £4.7 billion ($6.30 billion) in revenue, up 17%.

Meanwhile, the power systems segment saw a 20% revenue increase to £2.04 billion ($2.73 billion), driven by demand for data centre backup power.

These results underscore how sustainability-driven innovations are enhancing financial resilience, attracting investors seeking long-term growth.

Small Modular Reactors Expand Green Horizons

Beyond aviation, Rolls-Royce's small modular reactor (SMR) programme is a cornerstone of its sustainability strategy, contributing to its share price rally.

Selected as the sole provider for the UK's Great British Energy – Nuclear programme, Rolls-Royce expects its SMRs to generate positive cash flow by late 2025, with full profitability by 2030.

The £210 million ($281.40 million) investment from ČEZ Group has bolstered the project's credibility, with potential for European expansion.

This aligns with global demand for clean energy, enhancing Rolls-Royce's appeal to environmentally conscious investors.

The company's battery energy storage systems (BESS) also support growth, with orders from Lithuania's Ignitis Group driving a projected 20% annual revenue increase in the power systems division.

These initiatives, combined with a 46% reduction in GHG emissions from operations since 2019, demonstrate Rolls-Royce's commitment to net zero by 2050.
