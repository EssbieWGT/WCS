The MoU will then pave the way for a long-term offtake agreement of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) between Abra and Sumitomo.

Global demand for SAF is expected to reach 400 million tons by 2050, with demand from developed economies with limited feedstock availability, such as Japan, Singapore, and the European Union, placing increasing pressure on the aviation industry to decarbonise.

Brazil is well positioned to become a leading global SAF producer, supported by abundant feedstocks, a longstanding ethanol and biodiesel tradition and a strong commitment to renewable energy.

However, securing financing for SAF projects – and ensuring Brazilians continued access to essential, affordable, aviation – remain key challenges.

Maria Del Mar Whittaker, chief corporate responsibility officer, Abra Group, said: “At a time when financing for SAF projects is particularly challenging due to market uncertainties, demand constraints and evolving regulations, creative solutions that leverage the strengths of different global regions are the best path forward.

“This joint initiative represents an important step towards global climate alignment, connecting Japan’s commitment to decarbonisation with Brazil’s unique capacity for SAF production and its need for affordable aviation connectivity.

Takamasa Ueda, senior director and head of energy innovation initiative, Sumitomo Corporation do Brasil, said: “In order to unlock and accelerate the development of SAF capacity globally, it is essential to take a creative approach to overcome the key challenges facing this emerging industry.

“Sumitomo is actively engaged in SAF market development worldwide, and strongly believes that Brazil, with its abundant feedstock resources, has tremendous potential to become a major SAF supply hub for the global market.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Abra-and-Sumitomo-pic-Biofuel-17-11-29422817-768x768.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:56:21.820783

US West Coast jet fuel production has been curtailed since October, after a fire at Chevron's 285,000 barrel-per-day El Segundo refinery in southern California forced the company to take multiple units offline.

About 60,000 metric tons (472,800 barrels) of the aviation fuel was loaded on Panamax tanker Hafnia Kallang between October 28 and 29 from the Jamnagar port, according to data from Kpler, LSEG and four trade sources.

Castleton Commodities chartered the ship, which is expected to arrive in Los Angeles in the first half of December, multiple shipbrokers said.

All the sources spoke on condition of anonymity. Castleton did not respond to requests for comment.

Chevron declined to comment on commercial matters, saying it expected to complete repairs to the El Segundo jet fuel production unit in early 2026.

US WEST COAST IMPORTS TO REMAIN ELEVATED

US West Coast jet fuel supply could remain tight until the El Segundo repairs are completed, two trade sources said.

""Chevron remains focused on supplying its customers around the world, including those supplied by the El Segundo refinery, and may utilise local or imported product to do so,"" the company said in a statement.

However, traders said it was unlikely that the U.S. West Coast would receive frequent imports from India, as shipments from Northeast Asia are cheaper.

Shipping costs for about 40,000 metric tons of refined fuels from South Korea to the US West Coast have held steady around $40 per ton since October, SSY pricing data showed.

Spot shipping rates between India and the U.S. West Coast are typically not readily available as the route is less common.

Last month, Northeast Asia-origin jet fuel exports to the U.S. West coast were at five-month highs of about 600,000 tons, Kpler shiptracking data showed.

AAPA director general Subhas Menon, who was speaking at the closing of the association’s 69th assembly of presidents, notes that demand remains “very buoyant” in the near term.

Menon says the sector has demonstrated “resilience” amid “persistent” challenges such geopolitics and supply chain issues, with passenger traffic up 10% in the first nine months of the year.

The AAPA says traffic will continue to grow in the new year, supported by “resilient economies and strong passenger and cargo demand”.

Its projections also indicate that in 2026, intra-Asia traffic is expect to see the largest growth, while sectors like North America-Asia are expected to see slower growth.

This is reflective of AAPA’s data comparing traffic growth in August and September, which shows North America-Asia traffic growth slowly down sharply. The “less buoyant” demand “reflects the impact of tariffs and policy changes”, the association notes.

The US-imposed tariffs, which are at risk of being escalated further, “could further exacerbate” supply chain “bottlenecks”, notes Menon.

“Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty,” Menon states.

This year’s assembly of presidents passed four resolutions, covering areas such as sustainability, supply chain and taxation.

It affirmed its “aspirational target” of 5% sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030 – set in 2023 – and called on governments to “establish policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production”.

On supply chain, AAPA member carriers called for “targeted investment incentives” in the MRO and manufacturing sectors.

The assembly also called on regulators to “refrain from imposing taxed or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance”.

Regulators should also “align practices” with global guidelines for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, with Menon noting that the lack of “harmonisation” of standards.

He adds: “Airlines are left to their own devices, and each airline is doing their own thing, which is very confusing for passengers.”

The government is now moving to the next phase of understanding what the impact of a SAF mandate would be on airlines and how additional costs would be passed on to consumers.
Although he stressed the UAE’s cautious approach to SAF, the country “really wants to hit the ground running” when it comes to adopting and producing SAF.
We have the soft power to drive this on a global scale,” Al Olama said.
“We are hoping it's going to be a major success, and if this project does come through, I see it as a blueprint that we can apply immediately in the UAE,” Al Olama said.","DUBAI—The UAE is working toward making the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandatory in the country as a key component of its SAF policy roadmap, says Sharif Al Olama, undersecretary for energy and petroleum affairs at the ministry of energy and infrastructure.

Today, the “soft requirement” is for carriers to uplift 1% SAF on a voluntary basis by 2031, but the government is working with Gulf carriers and other stakeholders to bring in a SAF mandate making it compulsory, Al Olama told Aviation Week prior to a meeting of the UAE government’s SAF & LCAF (Low Carbon Aviation Fuel) Executive Committee hosted by Airbus on Nov. 17 here at the Dubai Airshow.

“When we launched the [voluntary] policy, we wanted to test the water with our national airlines and test the environment to see the acceptance of utilizing SAF,” Al Olama said.

The government is now moving to the next phase of understanding what the impact of a SAF mandate would be on airlines and how additional costs would be passed on to consumers.

“We are very cautious when it comes to getting new policies or new mandatory requirements on board because we are aware that there can be some impact on the operations of our national airlines, so we really need to strike that balance,” Al Olama said.

Although he stressed the UAE’s cautious approach to SAF, the country “really wants to hit the ground running” when it comes to adopting and producing SAF. “Whenever we see there is a global need, the UAE takes the lead. We have the soft power to drive this on a global scale,” Al Olama said.

One initiative the UAE government is pursuing is a bid, alongside UK-based Chinook Hydrogen, to develop a SAF production plant at Hong Kong International Airport, he said.

“We are hoping it's going to be a major success, and if this project does come through, I see it as a blueprint that we can apply immediately in the UAE,” Al Olama said.

The UAE is “very pragmatic” when it comes to sustainability policy and planning, said Gabriel Sémelas, president for Africa and Middle East at Airbus.

“There is a great alignment between the government, the regulators, the local entities, all the technicians doing all the work required and industry,” Sémelas added. “I think this is unique.

This goal requires significant investment, government support, and collaboration across the industry, as the current pace of change, especially with SAF, is insufficient to meet the target on its own.

The future of aviation net zero by 2050 relies on a multi-pronged approach, with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) setting the goal, but progress is slow. Key strategies include increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), developing new technologies like electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft, improving operational efficiencies, and using carbon offsets for remaining emissions. Challenges include limited SAF production, high costs, and the need for significant government support and industry-wide cooperation.

Replacing conventional jet fuel with SAFs is seen as a critical solution, with a goal of SAFs accounting for about 65% of total emissions reductions by 2050. It is also viable for the development and use of hydrogen-powered and electric aircraft for zero-emission flights. Improving flight paths, air traffic management, and airport operations are also solutions to reduce fuel burn and emissions. There is scope for utilizing credible offsetting schemes and carbon capture technologies to neutralize any remaining emissions that cannot be eliminated at the source.

The development and deployment of solutions like SAFs are not happening fast enough to meet the 2050 target, reports Indian Aerospace and Defence Bulletin and the IEA. The transition requires significant investment and government policy support, which are not yet happening at the anticipated pace and scale, notes the IATA. The climate impact of non-CO2 emissions from aviation also needs to be addressed, which adds another layer of complexity to the problem.

The global air transport sector is working towards achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Yes, decarbonizing a sector so heavily reliant on fossil fuels is a monumental challenge, but it also poses an opportunity as it allows us to reimagine the way we travel in the not-so-distant future: aircraft will be powered by new propulsion systems which reduce fuel use or rely on more electric architectures, while sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, will need to fuel the majority of flights taking off around the world.

But the way to get there is difficult, requiring enormous efforts by all stakeholders. There is no silver bullet to get to net zero and different stakeholders and regions in the world will contribute in different ways. Some will lead through large-scale deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, while others will pioneer hydrogen, hybrid and electric propulsion systems. Together, these efforts are converging into one shared journey: transforming the vision of tomorrow’s flight into today’s reality.

At the heart of this transformation lies the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. Sustainable aviation fuel, which can be produced from feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, algae or even captured carbon, can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. But the challenge is to scale it: this fuel currently represents less than 1% of global jet fuel use. To meet 2050 targets, production must increase exponentially, requiring the creation of an entirely new energy ecosystem. That means new refineries and supply chains as well as harmonised regulations around the globe and investment and financial frameworks.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/11/17/1981296-aviatons-net-zero-future.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:57:06.083972

The demonstrator builds on Joby’s fully electric air taxi platform and integrates a hybrid turbine powertrain along with the company’s SuperPilot autonomy stack to deliver greater range and payload capability. Potential applications for Joby’s hybrid aircraft include longer range air taxi services as well as sales to civilian, commercial, and defense customers.

The start of flight testing comes just three months after Joby announced the aircraft concept alongside a new partnership with L3Harris Technologies, who bring proven expertise on platform missionization, including sensors, effectors, communication, and collaborative autonomy. L3Harris plans to equip Joby’s commercial hybrid aircraft to address defense applications, such as contested logistics, loyal wingman operations, and low-altitude support. The U.S. government has prioritized the acquisition of resilient, autonomous and hybrid aircraft, requesting over $9 billion in the FY26 budget for next-generation platforms.

“It’s imperative that we find ways to deliver new technology into the hands of American troops more quickly and cost-efficiently than we have in the past,” said JoeBen Bevirt, CEO and Founder of Joby. “Our vertical integration puts us in a unique position to deliver on this goal, moving from concept to demonstration – and from demonstration to deployment – at a pace that is unprecedented in today’s aerospace and defense industry.”

The aircraft completed its first flight at Joby’s Marina, California, facility on Nov. 7, 2025. It will continue ground and flight testing before taking part in operational demonstrations with government customers, planned for 2026.

“The magic of dual-use technology is that it creates value in both directions,” Bevirt added. “By building on our proven technology stack, our partners can rapidly deliver new capabilities for the Department of War while we benefit from advancing the maturity of our hybrid and autonomous systems. In turn, this will help pave the way for commercial applications, from longer-range hybrid VTOL missions to autonomous air operations in commercial airspace.”

“The future battlefield relies on unmanned systems augmenting manned platforms, and our partnership with Joby accelerates missionized VTOL aircraft to directly support defense requirements,” said Jason Lambert, president, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, L3Harris. “L3Harris has delivered thousands of missionized aircraft, and our focus is scaling rapidly to bring these commercial VTOL aircraft to the fight.”

The hybrid aircraft builds on an all-electric technology platform that has completed more than 50,000 miles of flight testing and has entered the final stage of the FAA’s Type Certification process for commercial aircraft. Joby’s Superpilot autonomous technology stack has been in development for more than five years and, in July, the company successfully participated in REFORPAC, a landmark Department of War exercise over the Pacific Ocean. Using a conventional Cessna 208 aircraft, the company logged more than 7,000 miles of autonomous operations across more than 40 flight hours in and around Hawaii, managed primarily from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, more than 3,000 miles away.

Praj’s Technology for Ethanol Refinery will generate 890 tonnes per day (or 293,700 tonnes per annum) of 95 percent ethanol and capture biogenic CO2 from the 1G process. The Allied Biofuels project will utilise Ethanol from the 1G process to produce 160,400 tonnes per annum of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and 5,040 tonnes per annum of Green Diesel, whereas biogenic CO2 from the 1G process will combine together with the Synthesis Gas from Gasification process and Green Hydrogen made from 2,000 Mega Watt of PEM Electrolysers to produce annually 257,000 tonnes of Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF). The project represents the crucial first step in establishing Central Asia’s first integrated refinery producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Electro-Synthetic SAF (e-SAF), and Green Diesel.

Under the agreement, Praj will deploy its proven first-generation ethanol technology, supply proprietary equipment, and provide design, engineering, procurement, and commissioning support. Sorghum will be used as the primary feedstock for ethanol production, which will in turn serve as the base input for advanced conversion technologies to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

The project is designed to align with Uzbekistan’s climate strategy and directly support the work of the country’s Net Zero Emissions Office, which is driving national policies toward carbon neutrality. By enabling large-scale ethanol-to-SAF conversion, the refinery will help displace fossil-based aviation fuels, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and advance Uzbekistan’s role as a regional leader in renewable energy.

Alfred Benedict, Chairman and Managing Director of Allied Biofuels, said:

“Signing this MoU is a landmark moment for Uzbekistan and for Central Asia’s clean-energy future. With ethanol as the first step in our value chain, Allied Biofuels is committed to delivering an integrated refinery that will produce SAF, e-SAF, and Green Diesel at world scale. This project will strengthen energy security, reduce emissions, and create long-term economic opportunities for the region. Praj’s technology and expertise provide the right foundation to realise this vision in Khorezm.”

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Chairman, Praj Industries, said:

“We are delighted to partner with Allied Biofuels on this pioneering initiative in Uzbekistan. With our proven expertise and advanced technologies, Praj will help develop the ethanol facility.

Jimmy Samartzis, chief executive of LanzaJet, said the milestone reflects years of work to build a new fuel pathway and deliver a technology with global potential. He added that the company is now positioned to support SAF development in countries seeking to strengthen domestic supply chains while reducing emissions from aviation.

The Freedom Pines facility integrates several first-of-a-kind technologies, including Technip Energies’ Hummingbird process for converting ethanol to ethylene and an oligomerisation system jointly developed by the U.S. Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet invested more than USD 300 million in building and operating the plant, which employed more than 300 workers during construction.

LanzaJet’s ATJ process can use a wide range of sustainable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal waste and captured carbon. The resulting fuel, when blended with Jet A-1, is fully certified for use in existing aircraft and infrastructure.

The facility serves as a blueprint for future commercial deployment of the technology. LanzaJet said it is already working with partners in the United States, Australia, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Colombia, the European Union, the Middle East and Kazakhstan to scale SAF production.

The company’s work builds on earlier demonstrations dating back to 2012, when ethanol-to-jet technology first emerged from LanzaTech’s research programme.

A Shift from Offsets to SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels) Some airlines have already started making changes.","Big European airlines, like Lufthansa and Air France, are changing their tune about carbon offsetting for flights. About 21 of them have now agreed to stop making environmental claims that don't quite add up. This pledge, announced by the European Commission, is timed with Brazil's UN COP30 climate conference (10-21 Nov), really highlighting how serious the EU is about stopping greenwashing in the skies.

Cracking Down on Vague Promises

These promises are a result of talks among the airlines, the Commission, and groups watching out for consumers. Airlines are saying they'll quit saying things like a flight's CO2 can be totally ""neutralized"" just because passengers throw money at climate projects or SAF, or so-called sustainable aviation fuel.

Airlines will need to steer clear of general, unclear language and actually prove any future environmental claims with hard facts and timelines to prevent any more tricky marketing. They're being told to show CO2 numbers clearly, so passengers can see the climate footprint of their trips.

One Commission person said, ""This fits perfectly with what people are pushing for at COP30: real climate action. Aviation needs to be upfront, not just hype, so people can trust sustainable travel.""

The Full List of Committed Carriers

The Commission has shared the full list of the 21 European airlines involved, everything from your main flag carriers to the budget ones. They've all promised to get moving on these changes:

These airlines carry a huge amount of Europe's air traffic, and their collective agreement could totally change the way the industry talks about being green.

Roots in Consumer Complaints and Legal Precedents

These pledges come after a warning in June 2023 by the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), calling out 17 airlines for claims that weren't really true. BEUC said that these airlines were tricking passengers into thinking their flights were eco-friendly when really, they were still adding to aviation's big carbon problem.

These airlines have been in trouble before too. Back in March 2024, a Dutch court ruled against KLM for ads that were ""vague"" and made sustainability seem better than it was. Air France was also rapped on the knuckles by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority in 2023 over Google ads that talked about eco-friendly travel. Lufthansa even had to take down some posters in Belgium way back in July 2022 after they implied that flying was good for the planet.

These decisions are pushing the industry to focus on real progress instead of just flashy marketing.

A Shift from Offsets to SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuels)

Some airlines have already started making changes. Air France and KLM stopped doing carbon offsetting three years ago because people said they weren't really working and didn't reduce emissions directly. These schemes generally involved planting trees.

According to the Commission, ""An Air France-KLM person said the group is now buying SAF."" Sustainable Aviation Fuel, made from waste stuff or crops you don't eat, is a more direct way to reduce carbon, even though it's not easy to get enough of it. The industry is clearly moving towards real innovations, at least.

COP30 and a Path to Reality

With COP30 on the horizon, hosted in Brazil, the EU's move acts as a pertinent message that corporate responsibility should keep pace with government aims. The Commission's goal, to boost consumer choice via clearer rules, could speed up the aviation sector's 2050 net-zero target.

The announcement was met with approval, with environmental groups like BEUC calling it ""a long-overdue victory."" They stressed that successful enforcement is key, though. With these new commitments, perhaps Europe's skies will become less polluted by just ""talk,"" and more so with reality, even as offsets face regulatory uncertainty.",https://www.tourism-review.com/temp/aktualita-detail-facebook_tmb_15190.webp,N,,2025-11-17 04:57:41.749667

In 2025, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai took an important step in that direction by testing engines using sustainable aviation fuel – a first for the Chinese facility.
Every person in the MTU Maintenance Zhuhai extended family is different, he adds, and everyone needs a different approach.","Gert Wagner couldn’t have had a rougher start to his new role as President and CEO. Tasked with leading the team at MTU Maintenance Zhuhai, the aviation veteran found himself in the middle of an unprecedented global pandemic.

""I remember when I arrived, the doors of the aircraft opened and I saw all these people in blue uniforms wearing masks,"" he tells The CEO Magazine. ""I felt like I was in an outbreak movie.""

It was a sobering introduction that took a little of the sheen off Wagner’s new role. He joined MTU Aero Engines, the leading German aerospace company listed in the German DAX, in 2005, and held several positions within the company until the move to China arose.

""Everybody was sick; we had something like a 60 percent absence rate, so it was very hard to run the company at first,"" he recalls. ""But once people came back, so did a big demand, and we’ve grown dramatically ever since. Now, we’re running at full speed and it’s a very exciting time.""

A global engine shop

Since those tenuous early days, Wagner has overseen the significant expansion of MTU Maintenance Zhuhai’s facilities. Just in March 2025, the team celebrated the opening of a second facility.

""That brings us close to being one of the biggest engine shops in the world, capacity-wise,"" he says.

In collaboration with

China Aviation Supplies

In 2024, MTU had 500 shop visits. The recent expansions have given the firm the capacity for up to 710 shop visits in the future.

""We’re very confident about filling those shops,"" Wagner says.

""The market is there within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation alone. Boeing and Airbus are forecasting for the next 20 years their fleets to double, with 80 percent narrow-body aircraft.

""We have all major narrow-body engines in our facility, so now it’s up to us to convince our customers through our performance and our expertise to send their engines to us along with their faith and trust.""

And it’s trust that keeps aviation maintenance airborne. Quality and safety are paramount, so a company such as MTU Maintenance Zhuhai must make trust its currency. Fortunately, Wagner says that’s its strength.

""Everything is prepared for growth,"" he says. ""We have the right capacity, the right people on board; the market is there. I’m very confident.""

Key relationships

Filling those shops requires a world-class parts supply chain backed by a peerless global logistics network, with many services sourced locally. From endoscope supplier Everest VIT Beijing and tooling provider Dedienne Aerospace to aviation supplies firm China Aviation Supplies Co and surface treatment leader John Cockerill, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai has a stable of industry heavyweights in its corner.

""In the supply chain, the most important relationship you have in our business is with the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),"" Wagner says.

""I’ve been in this business for over 20 years and I know all the OEMs. I have personal relationships with them. That communication and networking are key, because when you have a problem, you have to know who to talk to. Suddenly, the market isn’t so big.""

Wagner says that in a high-pressure environment such as aeronautical engineering, fairness is still a factor.

""To keep long-term relationships going, you have to understand these OEMs have their limits,"" he says. ""You have to treat them fairly.""

Sustainability and leadership goals

That close collaboration with a diverse range of OEMs also gives MTU access to a broad spectrum of innovation – especially when it comes to sustainability.

""That’s a big topic for all the OEMs,"" Wagner says. ""They’re all developing concepts to reduce emissions and maybe one day become emission neutral, so the main thing we can do is prepare our customers for using sustainable aviation fuel.""

In 2025, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai took an important step in that direction by testing engines using sustainable aviation fuel – a first for the Chinese facility. ""We’re the first MRO shop in China able to offer this,"" he says.

""It’s a big achievement and a big step forward. It can change our industry.""

With so much at stake, from safety to innovation, Wagner says leadership in this industry is a surprisingly simple matter.

""For me, it’s down to two quotes. Jack Welch said, ‘It’s all about people,’ while Peter Drucker said, ‘A culture eats strategy for breakfast’. As a leader, you have to inject a healthy culture into your organization and you have to take care of your people. They make it happen, so you have to treat them well.""

Every person in the MTU Maintenance Zhuhai extended family is different, he adds, and everyone needs a different approach.

""There’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,"" he says. ""You have to gain trust and they have to believe you’re leading the organization in the right direction.""

Wagner’s trial by fire in the midst of the worst industry crisis since the September 11 attacks went a long way toward building that trust.

""It’s very different than right now, which is very comfortable. We have full order books and it’s all very positive, but that’s a different kind of leadership,"" he says.

""In a crisis, you have to lead from the top; you have to be there and demonstrate confidence so they can trust you. At the moment, I’m leading from the back, making sure everyone’s going in the right direction.

""Leadership is about adjusting to the situation and the people you deal with.""

Originally a mechanical engineer himself, Wagner says he loves being a part of such a high-tech industry.

""There’s nothing better,"" he says. ""We’re at the leading edge of technology and not on a small scale. Two of the most modern aircraft engines are here in our shop.

""Technology and people are such a fascinating combination and it’s why I love this business so much. It couldn’t be better.""",https://static.theceomagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/17094306/Gert-Wagner_MTU-MAINTENANCE_Sharing.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:16.845737

The OneDXB Sustainability Alliance, which launched in September 2024, brings together seven founding partners—Dubai Airports, Emirates, flydubai, dnata, Dubai Duty Free, Emirates Flight Catering and Dubai Air Navigation Services.
“At DXB, we work with hundreds of partners, but the idea behind OneDXB is to create a focused alliance that collaborates on how we decarbonize in the short term and how we plan for future sustainable aviation strategies,” says Sven Deckers, Dubai Airports' head of sustainability.
Thanks to the Dubai Airports’ partnership with Airbus, visitors can also see a physical model of a hydrogen powerplant cell, part of the manufacturer’s research into zero-emission flight.
“It’s about a combination of many actions—electrification, biofuels, hydrogen and new operational efficiencies—each one moving the needle further.” The UAE’s potential to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another focus area.","DUBAI—Sustainability is in the spotlight at this year’s Dubai Airshow where Dubai Airports is unveiling its OneDXB Sustainability Showcase, which it says shows how one of the world’s busiest aviation hubs is steering the industry toward a greener future.

From cutting-edge energy initiatives and electrified ground operations to carbon-reduction strategies, the showcase underlines how efficiency and environmental responsibility go hand in hand.

The OneDXB Sustainability Alliance, which launched in September 2024, brings together seven founding partners—Dubai Airports, Emirates, flydubai, dnata, Dubai Duty Free, Emirates Flight Catering and Dubai Air Navigation Services. The goal is simple yet ambitious: to accelerate collective decarbonization efforts and set new sustainability benchmarks for the region and wider global aviation ecosystem.

“At DXB, we work with hundreds of partners, but the idea behind OneDXB is to create a focused alliance that collaborates on how we decarbonize in the short term and how we plan for future sustainable aviation strategies,” says Sven Deckers, Dubai Airports' head of sustainability.

With Dubai Airports in the midst of master-planning the next-generation mega-hub at Al Maktoum International (DWC), sustainability is being built into the project from the ground up. “As much as we need to look at how we decarbonize today, we must also think across the whole aviation ecosystem—10, 20, or 30 years ahead,” Deckers adds.

Integrated Sustainability in Action

OneDXB’s Sustainable Turnaround Showcase offers visitors a unique, integrated experience that brings together around 35 partners and 45 pieces of equipment in a compact, 20-min. walkthrough. “Rather than visiting 30 or 40 separate stands, delegates can see the full picture of sustainable aviation, from the airport operator to airlines, ground handlers, and service providers, all in one place,” Deckers says.

The showcase includes a flydubai aircraft positioned on site to demonstrate a fully electrified turnaround, illustrating how ground operations can dramatically cut emissions. From electric fire trucks and autonomous vehicles to solar-powered systems and dry-washing technology, the display reflects real-world progress as well as what’s coming next.

“It’s not about showing off,” Deckers says. “It’s about showing what can be done—and inviting others to join the conversation. So, we encourage visitors to come to our stand and see for themselves. This is the start of something big.”

Among the technologies being showcased are multiple alternative-fuel solutions, including biofuels and hydrogen. Dubai Airports is already deploying biofuel in its operations, while also exploring hydrogen-powered ground transport—including a fully licensed hydrogen bus here at the show. Thanks to the Dubai Airports’ partnership with Airbus, visitors can also see a physical model of a hydrogen powerplant cell, part of the manufacturer’s research into zero-emission flight.

“There’s no single solution to aviation’s net-zero goal,” Deckers says. “It’s about a combination of many actions—electrification, biofuels, hydrogen and new operational efficiencies—each one moving the needle further.”

The UAE’s potential to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is another focus area. A truck on display demonstrates how used cooking oil collected across the UAE can be converted into SAF and biofuel. Meanwhile, research into power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels highlights how the region’s abundance of solar energy and desalination capacity could make it a future global hub for synthetic fuel production.

For Dubai Airports, the road to net zero involves a three-pillar approach: decarbonizing DXB through proven technologies such as solar panels, LED lighting

Thankfully, scientists have found a sustainable way to cut that contribution by turning everyday trash into jet fuel.

A study published in Nature Sustainability shows that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel. The findings support that one day, food scraps and packaging could power commercial flights.

Researchers from the U.S. and China found that trash-based jet fuel could account for 62.5 billion liters annually, enough to cut global aviation pollution by 16%, as Anthropocene Magazine reported.

""There is a wealth of organic waste deserving our attention,"" said research team member Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University.

In addition to waste, the Nature Sustainability study also noted that integrating green hydrogen into the process could remove even more carbon, while the biggest hurdle is improving the gasification process, which has been a ""technical challenge.""

For cities already struggling with landfill waste, this breakthrough could turn that problem into a climate solution.

This isn't the only recent advancement in sustainable aviation technology. Scientists at Chalmers University in Sweden presented hydrogen-powered aircraft designs that could reduce fuel consumption. Meanwhile, aviation company Eviation introduced Alice, the world's first all-electric commuter plane, last year.

Choosing low-impact travel options helps support this transition. While no single solution can fully replace dirty-energy-producing fuel just yet, innovations such as waste-based sustainable aviation fuel and electric aircraft are taking us in the right direction.

Despite persistent geopolitical and trade tensions, AAPA members registered robust international air traffic performance. International passenger traffic for Asia Pacific carriers rose 10% in the first nine months of 2025, while air cargo demand expanded 7%, outpacing global averages.

“Asia Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand,” said AAPA Director General Subhas Menon: “However, further escalation of tariffs could exacerbate these bottlenecks.”

The assembly brought together airline leaders, manufacturers, and industry partners to address key industry priorities, including supply chain resilience, the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and enhancing workforce resilience.

“Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty, much as it did during the pandemic,” Menon added.

Assembly Resolutions Passed

The Assembly of Presidents unanimously passed several resolutions addressing key industry priorities.

Aviation Sustainability

The assembly affirmed a collective target of 5% SAF utilisation by 2030, called on governments to support fuel suppliers by establishing policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production, and to adopt ICAO CORSIA-eligible fuel criteria. The resolution further urged states to implement ICAO-approved SAF accounting and registry systems, as well as support cost-effective production pathways, such as co-processing.

Supply Chain Strengthening

The assembly called for targeted investment incentives and regulatory harmonisation to enhance regional MRO and manufacturing capabilities. It also supported the adoption of circular economy principles, including recycling and reuse of serviceable aircraft materials.

Aviation Safety

A resolution focused on lithium batteries was passed, calling on regulators to align practices with ICAO guidance for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, and to enhance data sharing and public outreach materials on the carriage and usage of lithium batteries by passengers.

Taxes and Charges

The assembly called on regulators to refrain from imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance, cautioning against measures that add an unnecessary financial burden on airlines or which impede sustainable air transport growth.

Outlook for 2026

AAPA expects international passenger traffic to continue expanding in line with long-term trends, supported by a growing services sector and rising regional connectivity. The outlook for air cargo demand remains broadly positive. Still, it is subject to uncertainties stemming from global trade policies and elevated costs, including those resulting from new US tariffs and limited SAF availability.

“AAPA airlines are optimistic,” said Menon. “Our focus in 2026 will be to advance aviation safety and sustainability across the Asia Pacific region, strengthen supply resilience in collaboration with regulators and suppliers, and promote air transport connectivity.”",https://www.ttrweekly.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-82-600x372.png,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:19.649003

PDO, which is majority state-owned, currently produces approximately 948,600 cubic meters of produced water daily—this highly saline, oil-contaminated water emerges alongside crude oil.
The partially treated water proceeds to evaporation ponds that concentrate and reduce the volume further.
This comprehensive system effectively removes the majority of oil, producing treated water that is suitable for various beneficial uses.
Several Omani start-ups, alongside international companies, are exploring opportunities to produce biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by cultivating select crops irrigated with treated produced water.","MUSCAT, NOV 16 — Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the Sultanate’s largest oil and gas producer, has taken a pioneering step to create value from the enormous volumes of produced water generated by its daily oilfield operations. The company has invited interested firms to register their interest in utilizing treated produced water for agricultural, industrial, and other commercial applications.

PDO, which is majority state-owned, currently produces approximately 948,600 cubic meters of produced water daily—this highly saline, oil-contaminated water emerges alongside crude oil. This volume is equivalent to filling about 380 Olympic-sized swimming pools every day and is expected to increase to 1.4 million cubic meters per day (around 560 Olympic-sized pools) by 2030.

To manage these vast quantities sustainably and maximize their value within Oman, PDO plans to invite local and international companies to submit techno-commercial proposals for the use of treated water from two major treatment facilities located at Nimr and Rima within its concession area. As an initial step, interested parties must prequalify by submitting their expressions of interest no later than December 21, 2025.

The Nimr Wetlands, established in 2010, are among the world’s largest constructed wetlands for treating produced water, with a current capacity of about 175,000 cubic meters per day. The Rima Water Treatment Plant has a treatment capacity of up to 65,000 cubic meters per day.

At both plants, produced water undergoes a multi-stage treatment process. First, oil is separated from the water, which then passes through extensive reed bed wetlands where plants and microbes naturally break down remaining contaminants. The partially treated water proceeds to evaporation ponds that concentrate and reduce the volume further. In some cases, an additional polishing step enhances water quality. This comprehensive system effectively removes the majority of oil, producing treated water that is suitable for various beneficial uses.

Recently, PDO has intensified efforts to identify market-driven solutions for expanding the beneficial reuse of treated produced water across sectors such as agriculture, wetland development, biodiversity enhancement, and other industrial, commercial, and mineral extraction activities.

At Nimr, a portion of treated water has been successfully used to irrigate crops like cotton, Ricinus (castor), and jojoba, which yield valuable downstream products such as biological oils for further processing. Native tree species such as eucalyptus are also thriving, indicating strong potential for scaling up agricultural operations in the area.

In addition, projects focused on extracting salts and minerals from the water have been pursued. Noteworthy initiatives include the Fahud Salt Making Project, the Qarn Alam Steam Hypersaline Project, and the use of surface water to support plantation schemes.

Several Omani start-ups, alongside international companies, are exploring opportunities to produce biofuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by cultivating select crops irrigated with treated produced water.

Another promising application involves supporting Oman’s 10-million-tree initiative and furthering carbon credit projects, especially in desert regions where water scarcity limits irrigation efforts. These endeavors align closely with PDO’s sustainability strategy, the Environment Authority’s goals to enhance greening, and Oman’s overall net-zero emissions target.

This initiative highlights PDO’s commitment to sustainable resource management and innovative value creation from by-products of its oil and gas operations, contributing to the country’s environmental and economic objectives.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced.
Travellers who fly farther will pay more because longer flights consume more fuel, CAAS said.
For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.
All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS.","Airline passengers departing from Singapore will have to pay a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy ranging from S$1 (US$0.77) to S$41.60 per ticket (US$32.04), depending on their travel destination and travel class.

In imposing this levy, Singapore will become the first country in the world to introduce a SAF tax on outbound flights.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from 1 April 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after 1 October 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced.

This means that if a ticket is bought before 1 April for a flight departing after 1 October, the levy will not apply. Likewise, if a ticket is bought after 1 April for a flight before 1 October, there will be no levy.

Geographical bands

All destinations from Singapore will be grouped into four geographical bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand

Band 4: the Americas.

Travellers who fly farther will pay more because longer flights consume more fuel, CAAS said. Passengers in business or first class are set to pay up to four times more than those in economy class, based on industry norms for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabin classes.

Passengers travelling to Band 1 destinations will pay S$1 (US$0.77) if travelling in an economy cabin, which includes economy class and premium economy, and S$4 (US$3.08) for a premium cabin, which includes business class and first class.

Band 2 passengers will pay S$2.80 (US$2.16) and S$11.20 (US$8.62) for an economy cabin and a premium cabin, respectively.

Band 3 passengers will pay S$6.40 (US$4.93) and S$25.60 (US$19.71), and Band 4 passengers will pay S$10.40 (US$8.01) and S$41.60 (US$32.02) for an economy cabin and a premium cabin respectively.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights – such as private jets and chartered services – departing Singapore.

New entity to procure SAF

The announcement of the levy amounts comes after CAAS said last month that it had set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable and stable supply for Singapore and the region.

Levies collected from passengers will go into a fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel. The airline will collect the levy and must display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold.

All the funds collected through the imposition of the SAF levy will go into a statutory SAF fund to be managed by CAAS. In turn, the fund will subsequently be used solely for the purchase of SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes, said CAAS, and would cover the associated administrative costs.

One percent target

The levy amounts, said CAAS, were calculated based on the volume of fuel needed to meet Singapore’s one per cent target for 2026, and the projected price of the fuel.

Singapore’s target is for sustainable aviation fuel to form one per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

The goal is to raise this target to three per cent to five per cent by 2030, depending on global developments and the availability of the green jet fuel, which is mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil.

CAAS said the levy amount will be fixed for as long as the target remains at one per cent. The amount will be relooked only when the current one per cent target is adjusted in future.

The levy will be applied on top of a total of $65.20 (US$50.21) in fees that departing passengers who start their trips at Changi Airport already pay. These fees will go up in stages from April 2027, reaching $79.20 (US$61) in April 2030 – a 21 per cent rise.

Passengers may not pay the whole levy

However, operating airlines may likely swallow some of the impact of the new levy being charged, to ensure that their flights from Singapore remain competitive.

Instead, airlines may well adjust their base fares to keep the overall cost of tickets competitive, thereby absorbing some, if not all, of the levy. It is also worth noting that in the case of frequent flyer award tickets and other complimentary ticket types, the SAF levy will still apply and is likely to be picked up in full by the passenger, as with any other tax or surcharge.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/singapore-airlines-plane-at-airport-gate.webp,N,,2025-11-16 14:56:13.250221

It's clear that FedEx is working toward a more sustainable, greener future and is seeking more efficient ways to ship your packages.","As companies continue to introduce green initiatives and reduce their carbon footprint, shipping organizations find themselves in the spotlight, and FedEx is making some positive changes.

According to a sponsored piece in Forbes Asia, FedEx has launched several initiatives across the continent to advance its sustainability ahead of its target of full carbon neutrality by 2040.

FedEx's facilities in Singapore and Incheon, South Korea, both use solar panels that reduce their reliance on fossil fuels from the domestic power grid. They've been pushing for more efficient travel routes, while automation is reducing task redundancy and improving energy efficiency.

For their transpacific flights, FedEx has started using sustainable aviation fuel at Los Angeles International Airport, and SAF currently accounts for 20% of their fuel usage, with plans to expand.

But most important to FedEx's Asian decarbonization plans is the implementation of electric vehicles for ground delivery. Last-mile delivery — the stretch between a processing center and the final destination — is often the most carbon pollution-intensive part of a package's journey.

As such, FedEx has been introducing EVs across Asia — from custom-built vans in Singapore to EVs comprising over 20% of its delivery fleet in China — and has introduced electric tricycles in Taiwan to help navigate dense city streets.

The moves come at a crucial time for the freight and shipping industries. Air freight generates significant harmful carbon pollution, and FedEx is a major part of the problem.

According to a 2024 report by the Guardian, FedEx and UPS accounted for 24.7% of the air freight industry's carbon pollution in 2023, and the industry had seen pollution swell by 25% since 2019.

For GE Aerospace, building tougher engines is both a defensive move and an overall growth strategy.
Lastly, feeding durability lessons into next-generation programs allows GE to position itself as the aircraft engine manufacturer of the future, one that truly builds engines that are made to last.
For airlines, durability is ultimately where engineering meets daily reality.","Multinational aerospace manufacturer and market leader in engine production, GE Aerospace, is currently pouring engineering, testing, and analytics resources into achieving the singular goal of producing some of the most durable engines ever created. The company is also beginning to focus on the development of incredibly durable military-grade engines. In addition, the company is refining the GEnx, LEAP, and GE9X families with upgraded hot-section parts, advanced coatings, ceramic matrix composites, and heavy dust-ingestion campaigns that mimic punishing Middle Eastern and Asian conditions.

Lessons from billions of flight hours are currently being fed straight into aircraft fleets and into the next-generation CFM RISE open-fan demonstrator. The mission is ultimately straightforward but somewhat demanding, as it gives airlines a longer time on the wing, fewer surprises in the shop, and a more reliable foundation for the development of future ultra-efficient aircraft. We analyze these latest developments in detail.

What Are The Key Developments In This Story?

General Electric's durability push starts with a ""test early, test often"" philosophy. The GEnx, which was originally designed as a highly efficient Boeing 787 and Boeing 747-8 engine, has received redesigned high-pressure turbine blades, new combustor coatings, and complementary tools like 360 Foam Wash, all of which more than double engine time-on-wing in harsh operating environments. CFM LEAP engines are also undergoing aggressive dust-ingestion campaigns and controlled turn-on, turn-off test sequences to validate hardware tweaks intended to more than double time on wing for LEAP-1A and improve LEAP-1B performance from 2026.

The General Electric GE9X, which was originally destined for the Boeing 777X, has endured over 30,000 cycles, including more than 9,000 endurance and 1,600 dust-related cycles, making it General Electric's most heavily tested commercial engine. Durability concepts are also being baked into the RISE open-fan demonstrator and key military engines like the F110 and the T700, according to commentary from the manufacturer itself.

What Does GE Get Out Of This Ambitious Project?

For GE Aerospace, building tougher engines is both a defensive move and an overall growth strategy. Airlines have been vocal about durability shortfalls across the industry, with long shop turnaround times and grounded fleets driving up costs and airfares. Lufthansa's Chief Technology Officer has publicly urged manufacturers to prioritize time-on-wing as highly as fuel burn.

By demonstrating tangible gains, such as durability kits for LEAP-1A certified by regulators and aimed at achieving CFM56-like market and program maturity, both GE and CFM can continue to maintain the trust of operators and aircraft manufacturers. Better durability also helps strengthen GE's high-margin services franchise, as engines that stay on wings longer require more sophisticated monitoring, on-site maintenance, and eventually equipment overhauls.

However, the big difference, and what is truly the kicker for operators and aircraft builders, is that these engines come along with significantly fewer disruptive unscheduled events. Lastly, feeding durability lessons into next-generation programs allows GE to position itself as the aircraft engine manufacturer of the future, one that truly builds engines that are made to last.

What Benefits Do These Kinds Of Engines Create For Operators?

For airlines, durability is ultimately where engineering meets daily reality. Engines that cannot withstand dust, heat, and long cycles without coming off-wing translate directly into aircraft with higher availability. At the same time, it lowers spare-engine pools' sizes and decreases the risk of schedule-busting equipment-related events. General Electric cites GEnx hot-section upgrades that have more than doubled time on wing in harsh environments, and similar gains are targeted for LEAP, narrowing the gap with the benchmark CFM56.

This means that more flights per engine, more predictable maintenance slots, and a better ability to plan during peak seasons are all byproducts of having such advanced equipment. Improved durability also complements fuel efficiency and sustainability.

Engines like the GEnX, the LEAP, and the GE9X already cut fuel burn versus older types, and they are being certified for higher blends of sustainable aviation fuel, helping airlines meet emissions targets without sacrificing reliability. For operators burned by recent durability crises, a tougher engine is not just a technical win but rather an operational and financial shock absorber.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_1958680975-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-16 12:56:51.400084

The summit has been doing some good noise across the last two days and in fact was very much quite successful and brought solid results in terms of investments.

The state attracted some of the biggest Indian and global companies in data centres, green energy, hydrogen, aviation, EV materials and even space technology showing that the state is back in business in a big way not just by ease but by the speed of doing business setting a strong foundation. In simple words, The Summit resulted in getting investments worth a massive number of 13.26 Lakhs crores with promises to give 16.31 lakhs jobs in the state.

Leading the pack was Brookfield, the global investment giant, along with its partners EVREN and Axis Energy. Together, they announced up to ₹1 lakh crore, the largest investment commitment of the entire summit. Their plan includes a 3 GW clean-energy-powered hyperscale data centre, large solar and wind projects, battery storage, and green hydrogen/green ammonia production. This single commitment itself makes Andhra Pradesh home to India’s Largest sustainable Data centre that would meet the future needs of the nation in terms of sustainability and green energy.

Overall, the system is highly effective, removing the vast majority of oil and producing treated water suitable for a range of beneficial uses.
A number of Omani start-ups, along with international players, are also exploring opportunities to produce biofuel and even Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through the cultivation of select crops using treated produced water.","MUSCAT, NOV 16

In a landmark bid to create value from the massive volumes of produced water generated by its daily oilfield operations, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) — the Sultanate of Oman’s largest producer of oil and gas — has invited interested companies to register their interest in utilising suitably treated water for agricultural, industrial and other commercial purposes.

Majority state-owned PDO currently generates around 948,600 m³/day of produced water — highly saline, oil-contaminated water that comes to the surface along with crude oil — volumes enough to fill an estimated 380 Olympic-sized swimming pools each day. This figure is projected to rise to 1.4 million m³/day (equivalent to about 560 Olympic-sized pools) by 2030.

To sustainably manage these vast volumes and harness their in-country value potential, PDO is preparing to invite local and international firms to submit techno-commercial proposals for the utilisation of treated volumes from two major treatment plants at Nimr and Rima within its concession. As a first step, however, interested parties must prequalify to participate in the competitive process; the deadline for submissions is December 21, 2025.

The Nimr Wetlands (Nimr Water Treatment Plant), launched in 2010, ranks among the world’s largest constructed wetlands for treating produced water. Its current capacity stands at around 175,000 m³/day. The Rima Water Treatment Plant, meanwhile, can treat up to 65,000 m³/day.

At both plants, produced water is cleaned through a sequence of natural and engineered steps: the oil is first separated, after which the water flows through extensive wetland reed beds where plants and microbes break down remaining impurities. The partially treated water then moves to evaporation ponds, which further concentrate and reduce the volume. In some streams, an additional polishing stage improves water quality. Overall, the system is highly effective, removing the vast majority of oil and producing treated water suitable for a range of beneficial uses.

PDO has recently intensified efforts to explore market solutions to increase the beneficial reuse of this treated water in areas such as agriculture, wetland development, biodiversity enhancement; and other industrial, commercial and mineral-extraction activities.

At Nimr, part of the treated water has been used for irrigating plants such as cotton, Ricinus (castor) and jojoba to produce valuable downstream products or biological oils for further processing. Local tree species such as eucalyptus are also flourishing, raising hopes that farming operations at Nimr can be significantly scaled up in the near future.

In addition, initiatives aimed at creating value through the extraction of salts and minerals have been pursued. Notable examples include the Fahud Salt Making Project, the Qarn Alam Steam Hypersaline Project and the use of surface water for plantation schemes.

A number of Omani start-ups, along with international players, are also exploring opportunities to produce biofuel and even Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through the cultivation of select crops using treated produced water.

Another promising application is supporting Oman’s 10-million-tree initiative and enabling additional carbon-credit projects, particularly in desert zones where the availability of irrigation water is the main constraint. This aligns not only with PDO’s sustainability strategy but also with the Environment Authority’s greening objectives and Oman’s broader net-zero trajectory.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/11/16/thumbs/600x600/3193176.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 11:57:51.262022

Scrutiny Over EU Airlines’ Green Claims

Airlines have never been shy about promoting their green credentials. Browse any carrier’s website and you will see buzzwords about net zero flights, carbon offsets, and sustainable fuels. It all sounds great, and in many cases the intentions are sincere, but the follow through has not always been as solid as the marketing. That gap between the promise and the practice is exactly what brought the European Union to step in and tighten the rules. When it comes to advertising, false claims are a significant concern.

Over the last few years the spotlight on environmental advertising has grown brighter. Travelers are asking tougher questions, regulators want honesty, and climate conferences like COP30 are pushing for real progress rather than polished slogans. That created the perfect moment for the EU to put boundaries around what airlines can say, how they can say it, and what proof they need to show.

What Is Green Washing?

The term “greenwashing” (or “green washing”) is a form of false advertising that overstates the environmental impact of eco-friendly green products, clean energy efforts, or fossil fuel offsets. Companies that engage in greenwashing make misleading claims about the effect of its sustainable practices. Fast fashion brands have been called out for greenwashing as the efforts of using more environmentally-friendly products or processes mislead consumers that their efforts reduce the negative impact of the brand in a meaningful way. In fact, the minor offset is unlikely to address the greater concern of a growing pile of deteriorating clothing discarded into poorer countries or the ocean for disposal.

Brands looking to avoid greenwashing can combat unsubstantiated claims by demonstrating a thorough and robust process to its proposed remedies.

What Triggered the EU Crackdown

Back in June 2023 the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) raised a red flag, calling out 17 European airlines for what it described as misleading environmental claims. That prompted the European Commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network to launch a formal investigation in 2024. After months of review, the result was a coordinated push directed at 21 airlines to clean up their language.

Those airlines have now agreed that they will not imply that emissions from a single flight can vanish just because a traveler buys carbon offsets or because the airline uses a small amount of alternative fuel. If a carrier promotes sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, it now must back the term with real data. The same goes for future environmental targets. Airlines must give timelines, outline which emissions they plan to address, and offer calculations that any traveler can understand without a chemistry degree.

Why This Matters for Travelers

For passengers, this is more than a technical rule change. It reshapes how airlines present themselves and how travelers decide which carriers they believe are actually moving the needle. The EU wants to eliminate vague green marketing and replace it with facts. Transparency matters.

National regulators across Europe will monitor compliance. If promises turn out to be more wishful than real, the possibility of enforcement is on the table. For anyone planning their next trip and wanting cleaner travel options, accurate information helps avoid being misled by a glossy sustainability banner that does not hold up.

Across the Channel, the UK has taken a similar stance. The Advertising Standards Authority has ruled against carriers like Air France, Etihad, Virgin Atlantic, and Lufthansa for environmental claims that lacked required evidence. The ASA has made it clear that net zero messaging in aviation is a priority for its oversight, so this is a trend that reaches far beyond the EU.

What It Means for the Future of Sustainable Flying

This push is not meant to slow down the industry’s progress. It is designed to keep airlines honest and make sure the marketing matches the science. Airlines that invest in sustainable aviation fuel, new technology, and real emission reductions will still have plenty to talk about. The difference is that claims must be grounded in evidence rather than ambition.

For travelers, the benefit is a clearer picture of what sustainable flying really looks like. When an airline says it is cutting emissions, investing in better fuels, or working toward climate goals, the hope is that the path is spelled out rather than wrapped in vague language. Honest information helps people choose flights that align with their values, and it encourages the industry to back its promises with action.

Conclusion

The EU’s move to rein in green claims is a sign of where aviation is headed. As pressure builds for real climate progress, airlines will need to show how their environmental plans work rather than simply hint at them. That shift benefits everyone. Travelers get clarity, regulators get accountability, and airlines are encouraged to turn their sustainability messaging into quantitative results.",https://liveandletsfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/KLM-Boeing-777-at-gate-in-Amsterdam.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 10:56:09.433160

United Airlines’ Plans for 2025 United enters 2025 in one of its most dynamic phases of growth.
Bottom Line Scott Kirby’s pay as United Airlines’ CEO reflects the vast responsibility of steering one of the world’s largest and most complex aviation networks.","United Airlines (UA) stands as one of America’s most recognisable carriers and a founding member of the Star Alliance network. Headquartered in Chicago, it operates a fleet of more than 950 aircraft and serves over 350 destinations worldwide. Alongside Delta and American, it forms one of the three major US airline groups dominating long-haul and domestic travel markets.

Over the past few years, United has rebuilt from the turbulence of the pandemic and record fuel costs, while investing heavily in fleet renewal and technology. The airline’s “United Next” strategy has marked one of the most ambitious expansion plans in the company’s history.

Behind that transformation stands Scott Kirby, United’s chief executive officer, whose leadership has brought a sharp focus on operational efficiency, sustainability, and disciplined growth. Here is a closer look at who Scott Kirby is, what his background brings to the airline, and how his pay package is structured for 2025.

Who is United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby?

Scott Kirby is widely recognised as one of the most analytically minded executives in global aviation. Born in 1967 in Texas, he graduated from the United States Air Force Academy with a degree in Computer Science and Operations Research, before earning a master’s in Operations Research from George Washington University.

After completing his military service, Kirby joined the commercial airline industry during a period of rapid deregulation and restructuring. He began at the now-defunct America West Airlines in 1995, working on scheduling and network strategy. His data-driven decision-making quickly stood out, and he rose to become Executive Vice President of Strategy and Planning.

When America West merged with US Airways, Kirby played a key role in integrating the networks and aligning corporate structures. His reputation for analytical rigour followed him through to US Airways and later to American Airlines, where he served as President after the merger between the two.

In 2016, Kirby made the pivotal move to United Airlines as President and, four years later, succeeded Oscar Munoz as Chief Executive Officer.

Under his leadership, United has pushed for reliability improvements, operational discipline, and one of the largest aircraft orders in history. Kirby’s philosophy places employees and passengers at the core of the airline’s success. He is known for walking the terminals, speaking directly with ground crews, and demanding consistent performance standards.

Despite a reputation for being tough and detail-obsessed, Kirby’s approach has modernised United’s culture, making it a profitable as well as popular choice.

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby Salary

United Airlines’ executive pay structure is performance-based and heavily tied to shareholder return, profitability, and long-term growth.

In 2024-25, Scott Kirby’s total compensation stood at approximately $33.9 million, representing a significant rise from the previous fiscal year.

Here is a detailed breakdown of his compensation:

Base salary: around $1 million

Short-term bonus and incentives: roughly $8.5 million (based on annual performance metrics)

Stock awards and equity grants: approximately $24.4 million, including a retention award of nearly $10 million

Other benefits and pension contributions: close to $0.5 million

This brings his total estimated compensation for 2025 to around $33.9 million, positioning him among the highest-paid airline executives globally.

However, as with most large aviation groups, only a fraction of this figure represents guaranteed income. The majority depends on United’s operational and financial performance.

If profitability targets or safety metrics are not achieved, a portion of the bonuses and equity awards can be reduced or forfeited entirely.

Kirby’s remuneration package reflects the scale of leading one of the world’s largest network airlines and the complex, highly competitive environment in which United operates.

Peer Comparison

Among his peers, Scott Kirby sits at the top end of the pay scale.

Robert Isom, CEO of American Airlines, earned around $13 million in 2024, though his total target package can exceed that in strong performance years.

Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, reported total compensation of about $27 million, largely in equity-based awards.

Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest Airlines, earned approximately $6.7 million, reflecting Southwest’s different business model and lower executive-pay scale.

Kirby’s higher pay reflects United’s global size, fleet modernisation programme, and ambitious expansion plan. It also includes the retention component designed to keep him in place through the next growth phase, as United executes the largest fleet renewal project in its history.

While critics may point to the size of the package, United’s board has emphasised that his compensation is performance-linked and benchmarked against other Fortune 500 leaders rather than just airline CEOs.

United Airlines’ Plans for 2025

United enters 2025 in one of its most dynamic phases of growth. The airline continues to expand its “United Next” program, a plan that includes more than 700 new aircraft deliveries by the end of the decade.

For 2025, the company expects a capacity increase of roughly 6%, with several new international routes launching from hubs in Chicago, Newark, and Houston. United also plans to introduce new cabin interiors with seatback screens and enhanced Wi-Fi across all mainline aircraft.

Sustainability remains a major focus. United is investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon-capture technologies, positioning itself as one of the industry leaders in environmental responsibility.

Operationally, the airline aims to improve on-time performance and reduce cancellations through upgraded crew-management systems and predictive maintenance tools.

Kirby has made it clear that consistency and reliability will define United’s success as much as network growth or fleet size.

Bottom Line

Scott Kirby’s pay as United Airlines’ CEO reflects the vast responsibility of steering one of the world’s largest and most complex aviation networks. His compensation is highly performance-driven and mirrors the company’s results-based culture.

At around $34 million, his 2025 package places him among the top tier of airline executives, though the majority of it is dependent on stock and long-term performance targets.

Kirby’s leadership combines analytical discipline with operational insight, and his compensation system is designed to reward sustainable, measurable results rather than mere tenure. For United, his success, and by extension, his pay, is tied directly to the airline’s continued progress, reliability, and profitability.

As the UK is what is known as a “dualist state”, international agreements (treaties) do not automatically have legal effect in domestic law. Implementing legislation must therefore be enacted to give internal legal effect to the UK’s obligations. An agreement is internationally binding in principle on signing, but typically provides that it will not come into operation until signatories ratify their consent. By convention, the Government does not ratify an agreement until any necessary domestic legislation has been passed.

The only non-Government amendments on the amendment paper are from the Conservative Shadow Minister, Andrew Rosindell MP. His amendments would require the Secretary of State to review the powers granted to Ministers, to report on the Bill’s implementation, and to require changes to fees charged under the Bill to be approved by both Houses of Parliament.

Under the terms of the programme order agreed at Second Reading, the Committee Stage debate will conclude no later than three hours after it begins, though it may finish earlier. When the debate ends, the House will vote on any Government amendments, along with any other amendments selected by the Chair for separate decision, which will most likely include some of the Conservative proposals.

When a Committee of the Whole House examines a Bill and makes no amendments, there no Report Stage takes place; the House proceeds directly to Third Reading. In this case, however, the Government has tabled three drafting amendments, so a formal Report Stage may be required. MPs are able to table amendments at Committee Stage, so MPs are unlikely to table any amendments for Report Stage. Therefore, Report Stage will likely take place without debate.

In accordance with the programme order, the Third Reading debate will come to an end no later than four hours after the start of the Committee Stage debate (or one hour after the likely end time of Committee Stage). Divisions on amendments often take up most – if not all – of the remaining time, so Third Reading debates are typically very short.

Statutory Instruments that require the approval of the House of Commons are automatically referred for debate to a Delegated Legislation Committee (DLC), however there is no automatic referral of Measures – a special form of legislation made by the General Synod that is subject to approval by the Commons and Lords before having the force of an Act of Parliament. So Ministers conventionally put forward motions to allow Measures to be debated in Committee.

18:00: MPs will debate e-petition 713714, which calls on the Government to increase funding for people with Parkinson’s and to implement the ‘Parky Charter’.

(House of Commons Library briefing)

Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill (Third Reading): At Third Reading, Peers decide whether to approve the Bill. Unlike the Commons, the Lords can still make amendments at Third Reading, but only for the purposes of clarifying uncertainties, improving the drafting, or fulfilling undertakings made by the Government at earlier stages. No such amendments have so far been tabled.

Because Peers have amended the Bill during its passage, it will return to the House of Commons for MPs to consider the Lords’ changes. ‘Ping-pong’ between the two Houses will then occur, so that both Houses can agree on the same text.

The Government suffered only one defeat during the Bill’s passage through the House of Lords. That defeat was on an amendment from the Conservative Peer Lord Jackson of Peterborough, which requires the Government to collate and publish data on the number of overseas students who have had their visas revoked or have been deported as a result of criminal offences, and for that data to be broken down by nationality. The Government is likely to reverse or otherwise alter this amendment when the Bill returns to the Commons.

Where the Commons has proposed an alternative amendment, or has disagreed with a Lords alternative amendment, the Lords will have to decide whether to insist on its amendment, accept the Commons’ position, or propose yet another alternative amendment. Unless the Lords accepts the Commons’ position on all five issues, ping-pong between the two Houses will continue.

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Labour MP Sonia Kumar will seek to introduce an Access to Finance for Women in Business Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would require the Government to publish a report and relevant data. See our Hansard Society guide for more information about the parliamentary procedure for Ten Minute Rule Bills.

The background to this Bill is the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, often referred to as the Legacy Act. That legislation – enacted under the previous Government – set up the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (“the ICRIR”) to investigate Troubles-related deaths and serious injuries. It would also have ended criminal investigations, inquests and civil claims related to the Troubles that had not reached an advanced stage by a certain date.

Court rulings since the passage of the Act have declared several of its provisions to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including the proposal to end criminal and civil proceedings in relation to the Troubles, which was found to be incompatible and was disapplied by virtue of the Windsor Framework, meaning that part of the Act ceased to be law.

The Bill has been presented to Parliament in tandem with another legislative vehicle – a Remedial Order – to implement a new regime for handling issues relating to the legacy of the Troubles. Under the 1998 Human Rights Act, where a court declares that a legislative provision is incompatible with the ECHR, the Government may make a Remedial Order, a form of Statutory Instrument, to amend the legislation and bring it into compliance with the ECHR. Remedial Orders are subject to a bespoke parliamentary procedure. First, a proposal for a Remedial Order is laid before Parliament for 60 days. After this initial scrutiny period, the final draft Remedial Order is laid. The draft Remedial Order is then subject to a further 60 days of scrutiny, during which it is considered by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. A draft Remedial Order relating to the Legacy Act was laid before the House on the same day the Bill was presented, following a 60-day scrutiny period of the earlier proposal.

The Government’s approach is to use the Remedial Order to repeal any provisions that it does not intend to replace, while using the Bill to replace or restate text from the previous Act. In particular, the Remedial Order would remove all Legacy Act provisions relating to immunity from prosecution and would enable all civil proceedings previously prohibited by the Legacy Act – including future cases – to proceed. In contrast, the Bill would:

At Second Reading, the House will debate the general principles underlying the Bill. No amendments to the text can be made at this stage. Once the Bill has received its Second Reading, the programme motion tabled by the Government provides that it will be committed to a Committee of the Whole House for detailed clause-by-clause scrutiny at the next stage, with the remaining stages of the Bill taking place across two days.

Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill (Committee, day 1): This Bill gives legislative effect to the UK–Mauritius Treaty on the Chagos Archipelago. In accordance with the treaty, the Bill terminates UK sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) and amends legislation to reflect that the BIOT will cease to exist as an overseas territory. By convention, the Government does not ratify a treaty until the necessary implementing legislation – like this Bill – has been passed by Parliament.

This is the first of two days currently scheduled for the Bill’s Committee Stage, which will take place in the House of Lords Chamber. A second sitting is scheduled for Tuesday 25 November. At Committee Stage, the House debates whether each clause should be included in the Bill and considers potential amendments to its provisions.

The clauses and amendments are debated in the order in which they appear, or would appear, in the Bill. Therefore, the first clauses and amendments to be debated will be the earliest clauses of the Bill and the amendments that relate to them. The first two clauses relate to the commencement of the Act and the withdrawal of British sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. (House of Lords Library briefing)

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Labour MP Peter Swallow will seek to introduce a Driving Without Insurance (Penalties and Enforcement) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would make provision about the penalties for driving without insurance and require the Secretary of State to prepare and publish a report containing an assessment of the effectiveness of existing methods of enforcing the law.

As outlined above, the only defeat the Government suffered in the Lords was on an amendment to require the Government to collate and publish data on the number of overseas students who have had their visas revoked or have been deported as a result of criminal offences, and for that data to be broken down by nationality.

The House of Commons must decide whether to agree with the Lords’ amendment, disagree with it outright, or propose an alternative. If the House disagrees with it outright or proposes an alternative, the Bill will return to the House of Lords, which will then need to decide how to respond.

At Committee Stage, MPs consider whether each clause should stand part of the Bill and whether any amendments should be made. Under the terms of the programme order agreed at Second Reading, the debate on Committee Stage will end no later than two hours after it begins, though it may end earlier, and the shortness of the Second Reading debate may indicate that it is likely to end earlier. At the end of the debate the House will vote on any Government amendments and any amendments selected by the Chair for separate decision.

Where the House has scrutinised a Bill in Committee of the Whole House and not made any amendments to it, no Report Stage takes place. Therefore, if no amendments are made, the House will move straight on to Third Reading. So far, no amendments – either from the Government or from non-Government MPs – have been tabled.

In accordance with the programme order, the Third Reading debate will come to an end no later than three hours after the start of the Committee Stage debate (or one hour after the likely end time of Committee Stage). Third Reading debates in the House of Commons are typically very short.

Oral questions: At 15:00, Peers will begin the day by questioning Ministers for 40 minutes, on discussions with the United States about Ukraine; serious injuries and deaths on the roads; and the hydrogen and fuel cell industry.

General debate: International Men’s Day: This debate was scheduled by the Backbench Business Committee at the request of Labour MP Josh Newbury. This will be the tenth year in a row that this day has been marked with a debate in the Chamber (International Men’s Day falls on the 19 November). In his application to the Committee, Mr Newbury explained that it would be an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on “the positive contribution of men and boys to their families, communities and workplaces and to society at large”, including subjects such as health conditions, suicide rates, addiction, unemployment, education and flexible working, violence against women and girls, crime and the criminal justice system. (House of Commons Library research briefing)

General debate: Injury in service award: This debate was also scheduled by the Backbench Business Committee, at the request of the Liberal Democrat MP Tom Morrison. In his application to the Committee he explained that the proposed award is inspired by the experience of his constituent, Jane Notley, whose career as a police officer ended when she had to retire after she was injured in the line of duty, and by former police officer Tom Curry, who has been campaigning publicly for recognition of officers injured on duty. Mr Morrison tabled an Early Day Motion supporting a new Injury on Duty Award scheme in February 2025 which has now been signed by 110 members.

Oral questions: At 11:00, Peers will begin the day by questioning Ministers for 40 minutes, on water and sewerage companies as consultees on nationally significant infrastructure projects; South Western Railway’s performance since nationalisation; and compensation awards to victim of child grooming scandals. The topic of a fourth question will be decided by a ballot drawn at lunchtime on Tuesday 18 November.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill (Second Reading): This Bill completed all its stages in the House of Commons last month and now begins its scrutiny in the Lords. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure stability in the pricing of non-petroleum aviation fuel, with price guarantees funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is deemed one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector. However, SAF supplies are uncertain, so the Bill is designed to support investment in UK production facilities. The Bill has cross-party support and only a few amendments, of a technical nature, were made to it by the Government during its passage in the House of Commons. (House of Lords Library briefing)

At Second Reading, the House of Lords debates the principles and purposes of the Bill but cannot make amendments to the Bill’s text. If Second Reading is agreed, the Bill will be committed to Grand Committee for clause-by-clause examination.

Statutory Instrument debate: The House will debate a motion to approve the draft Radio Equipment (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2025, which implements a 2022 EU regulation in Northern Ireland. The 2022 regulation applies additional essential requirements to certain categories of radio equipment that manufacturers must meet, before placing such equipment on the EU market. Under the terms of the Windsor Framework, the EU regulation must apply in Northern Ireland.

The non-affiliated peer Baroness Hoey has tabled a regret motion – a type of motion which allows the House to express concerns about a Statutory Instrument without blocking it – which states that the Regulations will “give effect to legislation made by the European Commission, without public consultation and without taking account of the needs of small businesses in Northern Ireland.”

Grand Committee: Questions for short debate: There will be four questions for short debate (QSD), which are general debates that come in the form of a question to a Minister. QSDs are drawn from a ballot every five sitting weeks. The first four entries drawn from the ballot are debated in Grand Committee on a Thursday, with the other entries appearing on a supplementary list in the order they were drawn. Questions on the supplementary list can be taken in the Chamber as short debates between items of business, either in the lunch break, dinner break, or as the last business of the day. Today’s topics are the first four entries that were drawn in the ballot on Wednesday 5 November, and each is time-limited to one hour.

10:00: Public Accounts Committee – Costs of clinical negligence: Samantha Jones, the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Health and Social Care, and other senior officials from NHS England and NHS Resolution will give evidence. This inquiry follows up the publication last month of a National Audit Office report on clinical negligence costs. The Committee has indicated that topics for discussion with officials will include what steps are being taken “to reduce patient harm and improve patient safety across the NHS, and the effective management of costs, including the reduction of legal fees”.

At Committee Stage, the House must decide whether each clause and schedule should be included in the Bill, and whether any amendments should be made or new clauses and schedules added. At the time of writing, around 985 amendments have been tabled to the Bill, of which only two have actually been decided or withdrawn during the debate. Related amendments are grouped together for debate, at the suggestion of the Government Whips, to facilitate a more coherent, focused discussion and to avoid repetition. Our recent blogpost looks in more detail at the procedure for Committee Stage in the House of Lords.

The next groups of amendments to be debated relate to coercion, pressure and financial abuse; the age of eligibility for assisted dying; drafting changes; and the requirement for eligible persons to be resident in England or Wales and registered with a medical practice in England or Wales.

In advance of the first sitting last Friday, the Government Whips published the first 20 groups of amendments, covering 219 of the amendments. Lord Falconer of Thoroton – the Bill’s sponsor – set a target for the House to get through ten groups at the first sitting.

In the event, progress through amendments during that first sitting was slow: only two of the ten groups were debated, covering just seven of the hundreds of amendments tabled thus far. At this pace, the prospect of Committee Stage finishing in four days looks increasingly unlikely.

“the Government remain neutral and will not be providing Government time for this Bill. Obviously, we will look at things when we get to the end of our four days in Committee. I will then work with the Usual Channels to see what other time can be made available from non-Government time, but we will have to see whether we will move on over the next few days.”

However, he later struck a more equivocal tone, saying that “the Government do not have any Government time to give it at the moment”.",,N,,2025-11-16 10:56:26.094753

While sales were largely flat, the company posted positive net income after last year's losses.

Calumet’s recent pivot to profitability and rising production have drawn new investor interest, reflected in its share price rallying 41% over the past 90 days. While momentum is building in the short term, the one-year total shareholder return remains down 11%, indicating there is still ground to recover for long-term holders.

If growing momentum like this has you searching for dynamic opportunities, now is the perfect moment to broaden your search and uncover

With shares still trading at a discount to analyst targets despite recent gains, the key question for investors is whether Calumet’s turnaround leaves room for more upside or if the market has already factored in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 7.8% Undervalued

Calumet’s fair value estimate from the most widely followed narrative comes in higher than the last close, suggesting there may still be room for upside. The fair value is set at $20.25, while shares finished the latest session at $18.67. This sets the stage for significant drivers under the surface that could impact future returns.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026, enabling Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs. The project is expected to capture premiums of $1-$2/gallon over renewable diesel and tap into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally. This is likely to drive a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

The world is on the move—literally. Air travel connects continents, fuels global commerce, and brings people closer together than ever before. Yet, with international air passenger numbers projected to nearly double over the next two decades, aviation faces one of the most exciting and urgent challenges in its history: how to grow sustainably while drastically cutting carbon emissions. The industry’s bold goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is not just ambitious—it’s revolutionary.

The stakes could not be higher. As passenger numbers soar, fuel consumption may climb to an astounding 370 million gallons per day. Without decisive action, aviation-related emissions could rise by 40% by 2040. This forecast underscores the need for immediate innovation and global collaboration. But the good news is that the aviation industry is already charting a course toward a cleaner, greener future. From industry leaders to policymakers and engineers, a shared commitment to decarbonization is energizing the skies.

Aviation and the Race Against Climate Change: Charting a New Flight Path to Net Zero

Aviation has always symbolized human progress, connecting people and economies across the globe. Yet, the very industry that unites us is now facing a turbulent challenge—its growing contribution to climate change. From the steady plume of carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions to the fleeting but potent influence of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), the aviation sector stands at the intersection of innovation, sustainability, and urgency. The need for decisive action has never been more apparent, nor more exciting.

In 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) made a bold commitment: achieving net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. This target echoes the global ambition set out in the Paris Agreement—to limit warming well below 2°C, while striving to stay within the 1.5°C threshold. However, current trends indicate that aviation is not on track to meet that goal. Fuel efficiency improvements are progressing, but not fast enough. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), hailed as a game-changer, are still produced in limited quantities. And while electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft spark enthusiasm, they remain primarily in development stages. The message is clear: ambition must now transform into acceleration.

But there’s a silver lining piercing through this complex cloud layer. Scientists are deepening our understanding of non-CO₂ climate effects from aviation, particularly the role of SLCPs such as nitrogen oxides, black carbon, and the mesmerizing but problematic contrail cirrus—those white streaks across the sky that can trap heat in the atmosphere. Recent research suggests that controlling these short-lived pollutants could bring relatively rapid climate benefits. For instance, contrail mitigation strategies—altering flight paths, adjusting altitudes, or developing cleaner combustion technologies—could cool the planet in the short term while longer-term CO₂ reduction technologies mature.

Despite this promising outlook, current aviation decarbonization roadmaps do not yet fully incorporate SLCP controls. This gap represents not a failure, but an opportunity. Integrating SLCP management into aviation’s net-zero strategy could significantly accelerate climate progress, providing a bridge between today’s emissions reality and tomorrow’s cleaner skies.

To put the challenge into perspective, the world’s remaining “warming budget” to stay within 1.7°C is shrinking rapidly. Studies warn that global temperatures may exceed 1.5°C before 2030—an alarm bell for every sector, including aviation. If the industry continues its current trajectory without deep innovation and coordinated global policy, its share of the climate burden will only grow. Yet, the aviation community has something powerful on its side: ingenuity. From the Wright brothers’ first flight to the jet age, aviation has proven that bold vision, science, and determination can transform the impossible into the achievable.

Reimagining aviation for a net-zero future is not just an environmental responsibility—it is a call to action for engineers, policymakers, and travellers alike. Every new aircraft design, every liter of sustainable fuel, and every rerouted contrail brings us closer to a future where the skies remain open, blue, and climate safe. The task is immense, but the opportunity is exhilarating. Aviation’s next great leap will not only be across continents—it will be toward a stable and sustainable planet.

Propelling Aerospace Toward a Cleaner Tomorrow: The Bold Journey to Net-Zero Flight!

The quest to decarbonize the aerospace industry is one of the most ambitious and inspiring challenges of our time. While other sectors have made rapid progress toward net-zero goals, aviation stands apart—flying high, quite literally, on the wings of immense technical complexity, safety imperatives, and energy demands. Yet, these challenges make the journey toward sustainable aviation all the more thrilling. The industry’s goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 isn’t just an aspiration—it’s a moonshot that embodies human ingenuity, persistence, and the relentless spirit of innovation.

Aviation is inherently energy-intensive. Flying an aircraft at 35,000 feet and speeds surpassing 600 miles per hour requires an energy-to-weight ratio that very few materials or fuels can offer. Today, fossil-based jet fuel remains the only energy source capable of meeting these extreme performance demands at a competitive cost. Unfortunately, this dependence comes at a significant environmental price. Burning jet fuel emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, contributing to global climate change. The world urgently needs an alternative, but replacing jet fuel is no simple task.

Achieving Net-Zero: The Trillion-Dollar Journey to Transform Aviation

Reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century is not just a matter of ambition—it’s the defining challenge and opportunity of our generation. The aviation industry sits at the heart of this transformation, a sector that connects the world yet relies heavily on fossil fuels. To achieve true sustainability, industry leaders, governments, and innovators must come together to invest over a trillion dollars in the next two decades. This monumental commitment will fuel the evolution of new technologies, reshape business models, and redefine what flight means in a greener future.

At the center of this transition lies Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which currently accounts for only 0.3% of global jet fuel use. That statistic alone emphasizes the uphill battle ahead. To close the gap between aspiration and reality, SAF production must scale exponentially. This won’t happen naturally or easily; it will require a symphony of global cooperation, with governments implementing forward-looking regulations, creating economic incentives, and ensuring that early adopters of sustainable solutions are not left at a disadvantage. Industry stakeholders must also innovate relentlessly, improving feedstock efficiency, building scalable supply chains, and driving down costs through technology and volume. The success of SAF will be measured not only in gallons produced but in the industry’s ability to make it a mainstream, economically viable alternative to conventional jet fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) have emerged as a promising bridge toward a cleaner aviation future. These fuels can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 70–80% compared to conventional jet fuel—a significant step in the right direction. However, the road to scalable adoption is steep. High production costs, limited access to feedstock, and constrained production capacities have slowed the ramp-up of SAF usage. Even though global SAF production is expected to triple to about 1.9 billion liters in 2024, this figure represents a mere 0.53% of total aviation fuel demand. Clearly, the sector has a long way to go before SAFs can make a substantial dent in emissions figures.

Beyond fuels, the frontier of aircraft and propulsion technology is equally exciting—yet similarly challenging. Hydrogen, electric, and hybrid-electric propulsion systems represent a bold vision for aviation’s future, but these innovations remain in the early stages of development. While breakthroughs are on the horizon, they haven’t yet matured to the point of large-scale deployment. In the near term, the industry will rely on incremental gains within conventional aircraft architectures, continuing the legacy of efficiency improvements that have defined aviation progress for the past 6 decades. Remarkably, every central new aircraft platform since the dawn of the jet age has improved fuel efficiency by about 15%. With ongoing research in aerodynamics, lightweight materials, and engine thermodynamics, there is confidence that the next-generation aircraft—likely entering service around 2034—can achieve similar gains.

However, the intricacies of the industry’s economics add layers of complexity. The typical aircraft development timeline spans eight to ten years, with several more years required to reach peak production. Moreover, the business model for aircraft and propulsion systems relies heavily on long-term aftermarket revenue—often peaking 10 to 15 years after a plane enters service. This means that even if a revolutionary new aircraft were introduced today, its actual market impact would stretch well into the 2040s. In this context, the idea of completely replacing fleets with zero-emission technologies by 2050 becomes practically impossible unless the industry accelerates its readiness for scaled transition technologies right now.

Despite these challenges, the tone of the future is remarkably optimistic. The pathway to net-zero is not one of despair—it’s one of discovery. Industry-wide collaboration, bold investments, and supportive public policy will drive technological evolution at an unprecedented pace. Every dollar invested today in clean energy research, SAF production, and next-generation propulsion moves us closer to an aviation system that connects humanity sustainably.

Re-Capturing Carbon: Paving the Path to Aviation’s Sustainable Future

The aviation industry stands at a thrilling crossroads—where innovation meets responsibility, and ambition embraces environmental stewardship. As airlines continue their journey toward a sustainable sky, the bold challenge that lies ahead is clear: to recapture all the carbon dioxide that cannot yet be avoided. This mission is not simply about offsetting emissions; it is about transforming the very foundation of how we fly.

In the near to mid-term, aircraft will inevitably continue to rely on conventional fossil-based aviation fuels. Despite rapid progress in developing sustainable alternatives, the global fleet cannot transition overnight. Many promising replacements—such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) derived from waste materials or synthetic sources—have the potential to reduce net emissions during flight significantly. However, even these advanced fuels are not entirely free of carbon impact; their manufacture and transport still leave a trace of CO₂ behind. Therefore, to truly achieve climate neutrality, the sector must invest vigorously in atmospheric carbon capture technologies and robust, verifiable carbon offset mechanisms.

This is where the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Net Zero Roadmaps come into play. These five detailed and dynamic roadmaps outline a path toward net-zero emissions by 2050—a monumental goal that demands collaboration among scientists, engineers, policymakers, financiers, and operators worldwide. They represent more than a plan; they are a vision for an aviation ecosystem where every technological advancement, infrastructural investment, operational improvement, and financial model contributes coherently to a sustainable outcome.

What makes these roadmaps particularly inspiring is their adaptability. They acknowledge that the industry’s trajectory will evolve as research deepens and discoveries emerge. Progress in aircraft design, cleaner energy production, optimized flight operations, and supportive government policies will create a symphony of innovation that reshapes our understanding of flight. The journey to sustainable aviation is not linear—it’s an evolving exploration guided by creativity, determination, and global cooperation.

Re-capturing unavoidable carbon is both a technological challenge and a moral imperative. It calls upon the brightest minds to develop scalable carbon removal methods, from direct air capture facilities to nature-based restoration projects. The excitement lies in the possibility: a world where flying no longer contributes to climate change, but instead participates in a balanced, restorative cycle of energy and environment.

The Aircraft Technology Roadmap by IATA stands as a bold, visionary blueprint guiding the aviation industry toward a brilliantly sustainable future —one where technological innovation takes flight toward net-zero emissions! At its core, this roadmap addresses one of the most pressing challenges in aviation—fuel burn and its carbon footprint—by defining how cutting-edge aircraft and engine technologies can achieve revolutionary leaps in energy efficiency. Imagine jet-fuelled aircraft that are 15–20% more efficient than today’s best designs, saving up to 140 million tonnes of CO₂ by 2050 and slashing the sector’s in-flight energy needs by nearly a tenth! These next-generation aircraft will be designed to seamlessly operate on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), marking a monumental stride in decarbonizing air travel. But the transformation does not stop there—visionary breakthroughs in hydrogen propulsion and electric aircraft promise to propel the industry into an age of zero-emission flight, potentially avoiding an additional 35–125 million tonnes of CO₂, depending on how rapidly these game-changing technologies conquer the skies. Supported by substantial investments and ongoing demonstrator programs in areas such as advanced aerodynamics, aircraft structures, propulsion systems, and intelligent flight controls, each advancement will progress through the TRL scale —from experimental trials to exhilarating first flights and finally to commercial service.

Meanwhile, the Energy and New Fuels Infrastructure Roadmap is laying the groundwork for a massive expansion in SAF production, calling for thousands of new biorefineries and a vast hydrogen network that could redefine global energy flows. By 2050, SAF is expected to account for nearly 90% of aviation fuel, reducing emissions by an astounding 62%, while carbon capture facilities extract over 700 million tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere, closing the loop. All of this will be powered by abundant, renewable energy sources, transforming not just aircraft, but the entire aviation ecosystem into a cleaner, smarter, and more inspiring engine of human progress. The future of flight has never looked more promising—innovation, sustainability, and ambition soaring together toward a net-zero horizon!

The global aviation industry is standing at a defining crossroads. As the world accelerates its pursuit of sustainability, air traffic management (ATM) and operations must evolve to meet an undeniably urgent challenge: achieving net—zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. The Operations Roadmap and its partner initiative, the Finance Roadmap, together form an inspiring, action-oriented blueprint for this transformation. They show us that sustainable civil aviation is not just a lofty ambition but a tangible, achievable goal—if we act collaboratively, decisively, and intelligently.

Operations lie at the very heart of aviation’s sustainability journey. Air Traffic Management, as an essential component of national infrastructure, must be prioritized in every strategic conversation about sustainable aviation. It is more than just coordinating airplanes in the sky—it is the nervous system of global aviation, influencing efficiency, fuel use, and ultimately, emissions. Yet today’s ATM systems are riddled with inefficiencies that waste fuel and generate unnecessary CO₂. The exciting truth is that solving these inefficiencies doesn’t require waiting for tomorrow’s technologies—progress can begin *now*. Through smarter routing, better coordination, and more intelligent resource use, operations can deliver meaningful near-term emission reductions.

However, operational improvements can only achieve their full potential through strong alignment and shared vision. Airlines, airports, and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) must synchronize their investment plans and implementation timelines. Without this integration, even the most advanced ATM programs will struggle to deliver on their promises. Airspace is both a scarce and shared resource, and its effective management demands joint stewardship. By fostering partnerships among stakeholders, the industry can turn local progress into global transformation.

The roadmap identifies several exciting strategies to accelerate progress. Local and regional projects can serve as “proof of concept,” showing the real-world benefits of innovative technologies and operational methods, and helping shape global standards. Benchmarking environmental and performance outcomes will track progress, spotlight best practices, and promote the transition toward Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO)—a more innovative, more predictable way to manage flight paths. Furthermore, regional consortia can ensure that the unique needs of airspace users are respected throughout the planning and implementation phases. Collaboration, transparency, and innovation become the fuel for progress.

The Finance Roadmap, updated in September 2024, complements this operational vision by quantifying the investments required to reach net-zero emissions. Its message is clear: achieving sustainability demands not only technological and procedural innovation but also bold financial commitment. The required average annual investment—around USD 128 billion per year until 2050—may sound enormous. Still, it is far less than what the world has already invested in renewable energy markets like solar and wind. This comparison underscores both the feasibility and necessity of the aviation sector’s transition. Governments also have a crucial role to play: redirecting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy production can accelerate this process dramatically, especially in the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The Economics team’s projections remind us of the magnitude and urgency of the task. Transition costs—estimated at USD 1.4 billion in 2025 and potentially rising to USD 744 billion by 2050—underline the need for speed, innovation, and scale. Every year of delay increases both the financial and environmental costs. Yet with unified purpose and wise investment, the aviation industry can turn these challenges into opportunities—creating a cleaner, more resilient ecosystem that benefits not just airlines, but all of society.

Adding to the complexity are structural characteristics unique to aviation. Aircraft have incredibly long lifespans—often flying safely for 20 to 30 years. This extended service life is an engineering marvel, but also means that replacing or upgrading airline fleets with newer, cleaner models happens at a measured pace. Furthermore, each aircraft must undergo rigorous certification to meet strict safety and performance standards. These certification processes, while essential, can take a decade or more, delaying the adoption of cutting-edge technology. This ensures public safety but slows innovation cycles compared to other industries.

The Green Sky Race Takes Off: Global Push to Supercharge Sustainable Aviation Fuels

The global race to scale up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is on, and it’s nothing short of exhilarating! Current project pipelines fall far short of what’s needed—we must multiply capacity by five to six times before 2030 to keep the aviation industry on track for net-zero emissions by 2050. That means bringing both bio-based jet fuels and power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels to market fast, with investments in 300–400 new production plants and supportive infrastructure. The timeline is tight—since it takes at least 5 years to build and commission a SAF plant, planning must begin within the next 2 to 3 years. Clever policy design will be essential, prioritizing sustainable biomass for aviation and leveraging the upcoming electrification of road transport to redirect ethanol toward jet fuel via the alcohol-to-jet process. Combined with optimization of existing HEFA plants to produce more jet fuel, these actions could deliver an additional 14–22 Mt of SAF by 2030—covering up to half of projected demand.

The race to decarbonize aviation is on, and the pace of progress in renewable electricity costs will shape which sustainable fuels take the lead! If renewable power prices drop quickly, Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels—produced using renewable electricity and green hydrogen—are poised to soar, capturing a dominant market share by 2050 as outlined in the optimistic ORE scenario. This rapid decline in electricity costs would make green hydrogen and PtL production far more affordable, eventually outcompeting biofuels. However, if renewable power becomes cheaper more slowly, biofuels will remain the frontrunners, provided that sufficient sustainable biomass is available, which underpins the PRU scenario. In reality, the skies of the future will likely be powered by a blend of solutions—biofuels, PtL, and hydrogen—working together to push aviation toward a cleaner, more sustainable future!

By the late 2030s, hydrogen and battery-electric aircraft are poised to transform global aviation, paving the way for cleaner, more efficient skies. Hydrogen-powered planes could debut around 2035 and soar in market share through 2050, supplying up to one-third of aviation’s total energy demand if range and storage breakthroughs continue. Though early models may be limited to roughly 2,500 kilometers due to hydrogen’s lower energy density, innovation in airframe design and fuel storage could soon unlock longer routes without sacrificing passenger capacity. Meanwhile, advances in battery chemistries are opening new horizons for fully electric aircraft, making regional flights up to 1,000 kilometers feasible by mid-century. While electric planes might replace over 15% of the global fleet, their impact on emissions will complement hydrogen’s broader potential. The first step toward this sustainable revolution lies in “green corridors”—dedicated routes between airports equipped for refuelling and recharging—ushering in a new era of cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable aviation.

Flying Into the Future

Achieving this transformation will require much more than incremental improvements. It calls for a sweeping overhaul of technology, infrastructure, and operational practices. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of the most promising tools in this effort. Derived from renewable sources like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. To meet future demand, however, production must be scaled up massively—an exciting opportunity for innovation and investment worldwide.

Equally transformative are new technologies such as hydrogen-powered and electric aircraft. Green hydrogen, generated using renewable electricity, could power short-haul flights while producing only water as a byproduct. Electric propulsion, though still in its infancy for commercial aviation, promises silent, zero-emission operations for regional routes. Airports, too, will play a crucial role, evolving into hubs of clean energy complete with charging and hydrogen fuelling infrastructure.

Policy and collaboration will be just as important as technology. Governments, manufacturers, airlines, and fuel producers must coordinate to create incentives, establish clear regulatory frameworks, and invest in research and infrastructure. Incremental progress is already visible: modern aircraft are 80% more fuel-efficient than the first generation of airliners and emit 50% less CO₂ than those flying in 1990. Each new aircraft design improves fuel efficiency by an impressive 15–25%, proving that innovation is part of aviation’s DNA.

The journey to net-zero will not be easy, but it will be exhilarating. It represents an unprecedented opportunity to reinvent an industry that has always symbolized human progress and possibility. By combining visionary technology, sustainable fuels, robust policies, and a spirit of global cooperation, aviation can continue to connect the world—this time, with a lighter footprint and a brighter future. The sky is not just the limit; it’s the beginning of a sustainable revolution in flight.

As the aviation sector charts its course to 2050, one thing is sure—the dream of guilt-free flight is no longer science fiction. With innovation at full throttle and sustainability as its compass, the skies of tomorrow promise to be not only busier but also bluer, cleaner, and infinitely more hopeful.",https://www.iadb.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vecteezy_aerial-view-of-airplane-flying-over-mountains-with-network_69901665-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-16 10:57:02.922328

Boeing’s deepening collaboration with India is a testament to the visionary power of partnerships to propel global aerospace innovation to new heights! As the company strengthens its local MRO capabilities through initiatives like the Boeing India Repair Development and Sustainment (BIRDS) program and continues nurturing talent through programs such as BUILD and the Sukanya initiative, India’s aerospace and defence ecosystem is poised for extraordinary growth as Indian Aerospace & Defence gets exclusive insights from Salil Gupte, President, Boeing India & South Asia on its longstanding zero-tariff commitment and decades of engagement in India that perfectly align with the nation’s ambitious Aatmanirbhar Bharat agenda, fostering self-reliance while nurturing global excellence. In an era marked by evolving trade dynamics and expanding strategic ties between India and the United States, such collaborations promise a future where advanced technological exchange, entrepreneurship, and sustainability drive a resilient aerospace industry—one that not only takes flight but soars beyond boundaries!

Q. In light of Boeing’s expanding engagement with India’s manufacturing sector and its long-standing commitment to maintaining a zero-tariff environment in aerospace and defence since 1979, how might future collaborations between Indian enterprises and global aerospace companies evolve, particularly in the context of shifting geopolitical dynamics and ongoing trade negotiations between India and the United States?

A. Boeing’s manufacturing and engineering footprint remains largely based in the U.S., and so naturally, the U.S. is the cornerstone of our global operations. At the same time, the unique talent and supply chain capabilities in international markets, including India, serve local needs and also enhance our global capabilities, driving advancements for Boeing and the industry. The Joint Statement of President Trump and Prime Minister Modi from earlier this year actually called out the opportunities for collaboration in this regard, as both countries continue to see tremendous potential in working together on industrial development for aerospace & defence. Given Boeing’s eight decades of presence in India, we remain committed to working with local partners, investing in talent development, and meeting the needs of the nation for an aerospace and defence ecosystem.

Q. How have Boeing’s initiatives, such as the Boeing University Innovation Leadership Development (BUILD) program and earlier efforts like the Boeing HorizonX India Innovation Challenge and the Accelerated Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Apprenticeship program, contributed to fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and skill development within India’s aerospace and defence industry?

A. Boeing’s commitment to developing India’s aerospace talent ecosystem is long-standing. Initiatives such as the Boeing University Innovation Leadership Development (BUILD) program have helped connect young innovators, entrepreneurs, and startups to real-world aerospace challenges, fostering a culture of co-creation and entrepreneurial thinking. The Accelerated Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Apprenticeship program builds hands-on capabilities for high-demand roles in aviation services. The Boeing Sukanya Program, launched in 2024 by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, promotes women’s participation in aviation through STEM labs, digital skills, and pilot training. The Kaushal initiative supports differently abled individuals and underserved youth with certified training in aircraft maintenance. At the same time, the Veterans Skilling Program has trained over 22,000 ex-servicemen and their families for civilian careers in aerospace. Together, these initiatives reflect Boeing’s long-standing approach: connecting young talent to real-world aerospace challenges and enabling participation. Boeing is helping shape a future-ready workforce that supports India’s journey of aerospace and defence industrialization.

Q. To what extent can Boeing’s initiative to encourage its component suppliers to establish maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities in India be expected to strengthen the country’s aviation ecosystem, and how might this align with India’s broader policy of promoting domestic MRO capabilities through liberalized foreign direct investment and expanding airport infrastructure?

A. Boeing’s efforts to localize Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) capabilities in India are central to its long-term strategy of supporting operational efficiency, economic growth, and self-reliance across the aviation ecosystem. The Boeing India Repair Development and Sustainment (BIRDS) program is a cornerstone of this approach, designed to build a robust MRO infrastructure for both defence and commercial platforms. By combining resources across civil and defence sectors, BIRDS enhances cost-effectiveness, reduces turnaround times, and introduces advanced defence technologies into civil aviation, fostering innovation across both domains.

These efforts directly support India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision. Boeing’s in-country development includes state-of-the-art facilities such as the C-17 MRO and training center at Hindon and the P-8I training facility at Rajali, which ensure operational readiness and set industry benchmarks for excellence. The program also creates high-skilled jobs, attracts foreign investment, and fosters the growth of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Where more work remains is in component and engine MRO. That’s why Boeing is actively encouraging OEM partners to deepen their footprint in India. As customs, tax, and repair-exchange norms evolve, India is well-positioned to become a regional MRO hub, retaining maintenance spend that previously flowed overseas and strengthening its aviation infrastructure.

Q. How is India’s air cargo and freighter segment expected to evolve, and which structural or market forces are influencing its growth?

A. Approximately half of the global demand for conversions is expected to come from the regions of Asia and Africa, including India. This is driven by the rapid expansion of e-commerce and the electronics manufacturing industry, which has revolutionized customer expectations and supply chain needs. Global e-commerce revenues are projected to reach more than double pre-pandemic levels by 2026, with air cargo playing a key role in emerging markets lacking well-established ground and postal networks. The rise of high-end electronics manufacturing in India, such as smartphones and wearables, along with other high-value-added manufacturing, like semiconductors, is creating opportunities for future air cargo growth.

India’s domestic air cargo trade is forecasted to continue rapid growth at 6.9% per year over the next two decades. The growth is driven by factors including the overall expansion of the Indian economy and increased demand for air cargo transportation. Furthermore, the expansion of India’s e-commerce sector is contributing to the demand for efficient and reliable logistics and transportation solutions. This has led to the entry of cargo carriers into the Indian market that are operating a range of freighters, including the Boeing 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter, to cater to the growing demand for air cargo services.

Q. What kind of role do you see Boeing play in the growth of India’s civil aviation sector in the coming years?

A. With a partnership spanning over eight decades, Boeing is today the largest foreign OEM sourcing from India through a network of over 325 suppliers, including more than 25% MSMEs that form an integral part of our global supply chain. Supporting the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative is central to our long-term strategy. Partnerships are crucial for supporting India’s aviation growth while improving operational efficiency and ensuring safety. Boeing is also open to supporting India’s Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) programme, which aims to develop a commuter aircraft with a range of 600–700 km. We see an opportunity to support advanced manufacturing to help India scale production efficiently. This initiative aligns with India’s long-term aviation and industrial ambitions and complements our broader commitment to building a robust ecosystem, including pilot training, MRO, and aerospace industrialisation. Additionally, some of the recent contributions made by Boeing include the following:

In 2025, we partnered with HPCL to help advance India’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ecosystem and support the Indian Government’s environmental goals.

In 2024, in alignment with the guidance provided by the Honorable Prime Minister, Boeing initiated the Boeing Sukanya Program aimed at promoting women’s participation and leadership in aviation through STEM education and scholarships.

In 2024, Boeing set up the India Distribution Center in Khurja, Uttar Pradesh, for regional customers to maintain higher fleet utilization and mission readiness rates.

In 2023, Boeing and GMR Aero Technic are partnering to establish a new Boeing Converted Freighter line in Hyderabad. This collaboration supports cargo growth and expands aircraft modification capabilities and MRO services in India. It contributes to India’s ambition of becoming a regional MRO hub.

India is a strategically vital region for Boeing, supported by its Global Strategic Initiatives team and the establishment of a Global Support Center in Gurugram. Together, these efforts drive growth, safety, innovation, and sustainability through key programs like the India Air Cargo Symposium, India Pilot Roundtable, Executive Development Programs, Sustainability Workshops, and tailored operational efficiency projects for airline customers, regulatory bodies, and industry stakeholders.

To support the growing demand for pilots and technicians, in 2023, Boeing announced a $100 million investment in infrastructure and programs to train pilots in India, which will support India’s need for new pilots over the next 20 years.

Yet this rapid expansion is now running into the hard reality of demand. With annual solar installations expected to be only 45–50 GW - against 60–65 GW of available module production - the industry is staring straight at an overcapacity issue, say experts.

A fast-growing domestic solar industry

Until 2014, India depended almost entirely on China for solar cells and modules to meet its ambition of reaching 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. A series of policy interventions under Atma Nirbhar Bharat — the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), which almost blocked imports, basic customs duties on imported modules and cells, and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, changed the domestic industry landscape.

The ALMM order came into force in January 2019. When the first list was published in March 2021, India had just 8.2 GW of enlisted module capacity across 21 manufacturers. In just over four years, this surged more than twelvefold to 100 GW of ALMM-listed capacity, with the number of manufacturers rising nearly fivefold to 100, with 123 manufacturing units.

As of September 2025, India’s manufacturing base stands at 109 GW of modules and 17.9 GW of cells — one of the fastest build-outs globally. And yet, the expansion continues.

The Problem of Plenty

Industry projections indicate that India’s module capacity will touch 130 GW and cell capacity 35 GW by March 2026. By March 2027, capacities may reach 165 GW for modules and 70 GW for cells. The implementation of ALMM List-II for solar PV cells from June 2026 has fuelled further investments in cell lines by module makers.

“Cell manufacturing capacity is likely to grow to about 100 GW by December 2027, from 17.9 GW currently under ALMM,” notes rating agency ICRA.

Domestic installation demand — at 45–50 GW per year — simply cannot absorb the 60–65 GW of modules rolling off production lines annually. And with the recent US tariffs redirecting exports back to India, the domestic glut is worsening, say sources.

On the Cusp of Consolidation

ICRA expects overcapacity to squeeze margins and accelerate consolidation among the country’s 100-odd OEMs. Seven large players today control nearly half of India’s installed module capacity, and that share is likely to rise as smaller players come under pressure.

“The operating profitability of domestic solar OEMs, which stayed elevated at 25% in FY2025, is set to moderate due to competitive pressures and overcapacity,” says Ankit Jain, Vice President & Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

Adding to their challenges is the increase in uncertainty in the US — a key export market — following new tariff measures. The redirection of shipments to India is likely to intensify price competition further.

There’s also a cost disadvantage. Modules made with domestic cells cost 3–4 cents per watt more than those made with imported cells. While modules using imported cells land at around 16 cents/W, domestically sourced cells push the cost to 19.5 cents/W, says the ICRA analysis.

A reprieve comes from the exemption available to projects whose bid submission deadline falls before September 1, 2025 — a 45–50 GW pipeline that will not require ALMM-listed domestic cells even after June 2026. This should support non-integrated OEMs in the near term, although bidding activity has slowed recently, observes ICRA.

Despite India’s impressive strides, China still towers over the global solar supply chain — accounting for over 90% of polysilicon and wafer, 85% of cell, and 80% of module manufacturing capacity worldwide. Indian manufacturers remain heavily dependent on imported wafers and ingots, leaving them vulnerable to geopolitical risks and supply disruptions.

Backward integration into polysilicon and wafer manufacturing demands far higher technological sophistication — and billions in capital. Building these capacities, stabilising them, and reducing China-dependence remain among the toughest challenges ahead. Already, large corporates like Reliance Industries and Adani Group are investing billions to create an entire solar equipment value chain.","https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india/import/2022-08/c1aab1bd-f4d4-4357-8862-5dbe9986532e/Solar_GettyImages_1327629473_copy.jpg?rect=0,44,3000,1575&w=1200&ar=40:21&auto=format,compress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100",N,,2025-11-16 10:57:33.978987

Singapura menjadi negara pertama di dunia yang menerapkan pungutan pajak bahan bakar hijau (Sustainable Aviation Fuel/SAF) bagi penumpang pesawat yang berangkat dari Singapura. Meski demikian, kebijakan serupa dinilai belum cocok jika diterapkan di Indonesia.

Pengamat penerbangan, Alvin Lie, menjelaskan Indonesia memang memiliki mandatori dengan target kandungan 2 persen mulai tahun 2026. Namun, cara yang dilakukan Singapura tak cocok karena penumpang pesawat di Indonesia sangat sensitif terhadap harga.

“Harga SAF saat ini masih berkisar 300 sampai 400 persen dari avtur konvensional. Kewajiban penggunaan SAF akan berakibat naiknya harga tiket secara signifikan seperti di Singapura. Padahal penumpang kita sangat sensitif terhadap harga,” kata Alvin kepada kumparan, Minggu (16/11).

Selain itu, Alvin juga menyoroti mengenai Tarif Batas Atas (TBA) yang belum diubah oleh pemerintah sejak 2019. Jika nantinya Indonesia menerapkan cara seperti Singapura untuk mengejar target penggunaan SAF, ia mengkhawatirkan daya beli penumpang.

“Pemerintah tidak mau menaikan (TBA) walau biaya operasi airlines sudah naik signifikan. Pada tahun 2019 ketika TBA ditetapkan nilai tukar Rp12.500 per USD. Sekarang Rp 16.700. Saat itu harga avtur Rp 9.500. Bulan November 2025 Rp 13.111 per liter. Apakah daya beli konsumen kita akan mampu menerima kenaikan tersebut? (Jika Indonesia pakai cara Singapura),” ujarnya.

Maka dari itu, menurut Alvin cara seperti Singapura yang menambah pungutan untuk SAF baru bisa dilakukan jika pemerintah sudah berani mengubah TBA yang menurutnya sudah usang. Selain itu, edukasi kepada penumpang pesawat sebagai konsumen mengenai SAF juga perlu terus dilakukan.

“Pemerintah perlu edukasi konsumen tentang mengapa perlu beralih ke SAF dan apa konsekuensinya. Ketika konsumen kita sudah siap, baru jalankan kebijakan tersebut. Jika tidak, pasar penerbangan kita (terutama domestik) akan menyusut,” kata Alvin.

Adapun edukasi mengenai SAF menurutnya bisa dilakukan dengan kampanye tentang dampak perubahan iklim, gas rumah kaca serta komitmen Indonesia untuk mencapai Net Zero Emission pada tahun 2060.

Sebelumnya, pungutan SAF di Singapura akan dikenakan untuk tiket yang dijual mulai 1 April untuk penerbangan yang berangkat dari Singapura mulai 1 Oktober. Selain penumpang, pajak tambahan tersebut juga akan dikenakan pada penerbangan kargo di mana pajak tambahan akan berdasarkan beban barang per kilogram. Meski demikian, penumpang yang hanya transit di Singapura tak akan dikenakan pajak tambahan tersebut.

Berdasarkan keterangan dari Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), penumpang kelas ekonomi dan ekonomi premium untuk penerbangan ke Asia Tenggara akan dikenakan pajak tambahan sebesar SGD 1, Asia Timur, Asia Selatan, Australia dan Papua Nugini sebesar SGD 2,80, Afrika, sebagian Asia, Eropa, Timur Tengah, Pasifik, dan Selandia Baru sebesar SGD 6,40 dan penerbangan ke Amerika akan dikenakan pajak tambahan sebesar SGD 10,4.","https://blue.kumparan.com/image/upload/fl_progressive,fl_lossy,f_jpg,q_auto,w_600,h_315,c_fill/g_south,l_og_kumparan_zscykb/co_rgb:ffffff,g_south_west,l_text:Heebo_20_bold:Konten%20Redaksi%20kumparan%0DkumparanBISNIS,x_140,y_26/01hypwf6qxcjrbs1v4ypecm8f0.jpg",N,,2025-11-16 10:57:40.329679

To the eco-minded, it might seem a reasonable expense for a healthier planet. But for backpackers heading to Bali on a budget, it might feel like a sting. Singapore, a major player in Southeast Asian aviation, is making a move by adding a ""green fuel tax"" to plane tickets, with the revenue going towards greener aviation.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) says the levy will apply to plane tickets bought from April 1, 2025, for flights taking off after October 1, 2025. The cost, ranging from about S$1 (US$0.77) to S$41.60 (US$31.95), depends on the flight's distance and the class you're flying in – economy pays less, while business and first-class cough up more, sometimes four times as much. Short flights around Southeast Asia? Just S$1 for economy seats. Long journeys, like to the Americas? S$10.40, rising to S$41.60 for premium seats. If you're just passing through Changi, no tax for you. Cargo flights will also have a surcharge per kilogram, so everyone contributes.

Pioneering the Path to Sustainable Skies

What makes Singapore's move special? It's not just another airport fee; it's a tax that's explicitly linked to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAFs are eco-friendly fuel blends made from waste oils, agricultural leftovers, or even captured CO2, but they're pricier. So far, no other country has done this, making Singapore a leader in green aviation. Changi Airport, famous for its orchids and butterflies, is on track to beat its 2019 record of 68.3 million passengers this year, making this initiative all the more important.

Interestingly, SAF prices have recently fallen, meaning CAAS could reduce the levy from its initial S$3 to S$16 range. As a CAAS representative pointed out, this change shows their dedication to keeping travel affordable while pushing for decarbonization. The levy, they said, is central to Singapore's broader environmental plans.

Fueling the Future

Every cent from the levy will be used to buy SAF in bulk, reducing aviation's carbon footprint one flight at a time. Singapore aims to have SAF make up 3-5% of jet fuel use by 2030, quite a jump from today's almost zero. This is a big challenge, given the industry uses 300 billion liters of conventional kerosene each year globally. While aviation currently accounts for just 1.2% of global greenhouse gases, this percentage could increase as passenger numbers are expected to double by 2050.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported that SAF production doubled last year. However, it still only accounts for about 0.3% of all jet fuel used. This situation clearly shows how difficult it is to obtain SAF at scale. The high costs (SAF can be 2-4 times more expensive than fossil fuels) and scaling issues make this transition ""challenging but necessary"", according to an analyst. Singapore's levy could inspire other regions, like the EU (which has its own SAF targets), to take similar steps.

Mixed Reactions

The announcement has been met with both approval and worry. Environmentalists are calling it a ""bold, necessary step,"" and groups such as the World Wildlife Fund are happy to see a direct link between passenger fares and emissions reductions. Airlines, including Singapore Airlines and Scoot, seem to be supportive, viewing centralized SAF purchasing as a way to stabilize volatile SAF markets.

Not everyone's happy, though. Some industry observers are warning that the green fuel tax could hurt competitiveness, particularly for budget airlines flying to India and Indonesia. The Asian Travel and Tourism Association worries that the levy may ""price out leisure travelers"" at a time when Asia's aviation sector is still recovering. Social media discussions reflect this divide: hashtags like #GreenTaxSG are trending, with both humorous ""eco-farewells"" and serious commitments to offset flights. Initial research points to limited deterrent effect—the majority of air travelers express a willingness to contribute for the benefit of environmental initiatives—although budget-conscious flyers voice concerns regarding the accumulation of fees on top of already escalating fuel expenses.

Clearing the Air: A Blueprint for the World?

With Changi Airport witnessing unprecedented levels of air traffic, Singapore's approach hinges on widespread public acceptance: a small fee added to each ticket to fund environmental sustainability efforts. Should it prove effective, it could serve as a model for worldwide environmental responsibility, prompting hesitant governments from Tokyo to Toronto to take action. Detractors, however, argue that genuine change necessitates groundbreaking technologies, not merely incremental surcharges—for instance, electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles or hydrogen-powered aircraft in the future.

Currently, the skies above the equator are incrementally greener, achieved through a step-by-step levy system.

A UK pilot has been formally recognised for her work in pushing this future forward.

Thanks to this recognition, it’s a moment for travellers to understand what flying greener means—and how it may affect travel choices and experiences.

What’s Happened?

The British monarch has honoured a pilot who has long campaigned for sustainable flying. According to media reports, she has been appointed an OBE for her efforts in the aviation sector championing net zero flights.

She is also chair of the UK government‑industry group focused on zero‑emission flight technology.

For travellers, this means more than an award—it signals that airports and airlines in the UK are shifting gear towards greener options.

Why It Matters to Travellers

When you book a flight or choose a destination, the broader aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint.

The UK’s government has set out the Jet Zero Strategy: Delivering Net‑Zero Aviation by 2050, which lays out how the country plans to achieve zero‑emission aviation by 2050.

For you as a global traveller, this means:

You may see more flights using sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs).

Airports might start offering more green services or options.

Future travel could include aircraft that are electric or hydrogen‑powered (at least for shorter hops).

It’s about flying smarter, not just flying further.

What the UK Is Doing

Here are key actions from the UK that directly affect travel:

The government launched a group to make zero‑emission flights a reality—led by that same pilot.

UK policy documents stress that aviation must decarbonise while preserving the ability to travel globally.

Travellers can expect incremental changes: from fuel type and aircraft tech, to airport infrastructure and regulation.

In short: The path to net zero aviation flights is being paved now.

What Travellers Should Watch For

Since you (TTW) might care about travel experiences and destinations, here are things to keep in mind:

Check if your airline or departure airport mentions sustainable aviation fuel usage or green initiatives.

Short‑haul flights might evolve more quickly than long‑haul ones when it comes to zero‑emission tech.

Airports in the UK (and globally) may begin highlighting their “greener” credentials: less noise, cleaner fuel, smarter operations.

While prices may not jump solely because of sustainability yet, cost structures could change as technology scales.

By choosing airlines or routes that emphasise these green credentials, you’re aligning with a trend rather than later catching up.

Travel Tips for the Greener Flyer

If possible, pick flights from major UK airports that have announced sustainability commitments.

Ask your airline about SAF usage or aircraft efficiency—many now provide sustainability info.

Consider connecting flights or shorter hops where newer tech may already be in operation.

Monitor airports’ website pages for travellers: some may start offering “green traveller” guides or information on infrastructure upgrades.

Stay flexible—marks of sustainable travel may change rapidly in the next few years, so being aware gives you an edge.

A Bigger Picture for the Industry—and You

For the industry, this isn’t just about decarbonising; it’s about staying viable for future generations, preserving global connectivity, and making travel both possible and greener.

For you, the traveller, it means the flying experience may shift to something that feels more responsible without sacrificing adventure.

This recognition of the UK pilot is symbolic: it says the days of ignoring aviation’s climate impact are ending. Travel can remain thrilling—but now with a conscious edge.

IKFINA RAHMAH AULA Editor's Choice: One Direction Singer Liam Payne Passes Away After Falling from Buenos Aires Balcony","TEMPO.CO, Jakarta -Rumors of Zayn Malik returning to One Direction have once again stirred up excitement among fans. Two different media reports from Complex and The Sun present contrasting narratives: one claims it's just an administrative change, while the other asserts that Zayn is returning as a director of the group. A minor shift in legal documents has turned into widespread speculation about the reunion of one of the biggest boy bands of the past decade.

Explosive Speculation from Company Documents

The commotion started with updates to the documents of PPM Music Limited, the company overseeing One Direction's business affairs. The Sun reported that Zayn Malik has ""returned"" as an active director as of November 3, 2025, based on data from Companies House in the UK. This claim was immediately seen as a sign of his return after a decade of leaving the group that propelled his fame.

The report also linked the circulating rumors of a reunion to the tragic death of Liam Payne in 2024, which was said to have ""brought the members back together."" This narrative strengthens the assumption that the administrative change is not without reason, but rather a signal of musical movement behind the scenes.

The Sun emphasized that although there has been no announcement of a new project, Zayn's return to the company's structure is seen as a definite step towards a One Direction reunion, an issue that has continued to haunt the pop music world since the group went on hiatus in 2016.

Denial: No Evidence of Zayn Malik Rejoining the Group

However, Complex presented a much more cautious perspective. The media outlet affirmed that Zayn did not return as an active director based on the latest data, and the surfaced address change was just a routine administrative update. They stated that Zayn's status remains in the category of ""individual with significant influence or control,"" not a director.

The article also reminded that address changes or routine documents are often misinterpreted by fans as a sign of a reunion, although there is no evidence pointing to any new musical activity. Furthermore, the active directors in the company's files are two industry executives, not former group members.

Complex concluded its report emphatically, stating that there is currently no indication that Zayn Malik has truly returned to One Direction, either as a member or as part of a reunion plan.

Amidst the two contrasting narratives, one thing is for sure: the minor administrative dynamics of PPM Music Limited have once again fueled public longing for one of the biggest pop phenomena of the 2010s. These two versions of the news show how fans' longing can magnify even the smallest movement into a global reunion discourse.

The world’s first commercial-scale Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) plant is now fully operational, marking a critical milestone for the aviation sector. This development immediately de-risks the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply chain by validating a new pathway. This pathway is scalable, unlocking ethanol feedstocks that are more abundant than the limited supply of used cooking oil (HEFA) currently dominating the market.

For the aviation manufacturing process, this means a proven, non-fossil fuel source is ready to deliver real volume, providing a viable path to meet tightening global mandates. The plant’s initial capacity is up to 10 million gallons of fuel per year, proving the technology’s readiness to deliver commercial-scale output.

Context

The industry consensus was that the primary SAF pathway, HEFA, would soon hit a “feedstock wall” due to the finite supply of used cooking oil and animal fats. The informed professional was therefore wondering if any of the next-generation technologies, such as Alcohol-to-Jet, could successfully transition from pilot projects to reliable, commercial-scale production before 2030 to meet the aggressive global decarbonization mandates.

Analysis

The cause is the successful integration and operation of a proprietary catalytic process that chemically converts ethanol into long-chain hydrocarbons suitable for jet fuel. This breakthrough is the result of 15 years of research and development, backed by significant investment from major aviation and energy players. Manufacturers and fuel producers are expected to react by accelerating Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) on ATJ-based plants globally, as the technology is now a proven reference design. Think of the ATJ process like a chemical “Lego set” that takes simple, abundant ethanol building blocks and rearranges them into the complex, high-energy molecules required for jet fuel, bypassing the need for crude oil.

Outlook

This development implies a significant acceleration in the diversification of the SAF market, shifting the focus from feedstock scarcity to technology deployment. The simple thing to watch next is the announcement of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for new, large-scale ATJ plants in regions with strong ethanol supply chains, such as Europe and Asia. These FIDs will confirm the global replication of this proven commercial model.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bio-based-feedstock-integration-with-petrochemical-infrastructure-for-circular-economy-transition.jpeg,N,,2025-11-16 02:56:31.415986

The Massachusetts Port Authority has been working for years to expand Lawrence G. Hanscom Field with 17 new hangars. Opponents have decried the atmospheric pollution caused by private jet travel, while the Authority has claimed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would help cut emissions.

""SAF won't help the Commonwealth reduce emissions. Period. It will not scale at the pace of climate change,"" said Chuck Collins of the Institute for Policy Studies, per the CommonWealth Beacon. ""It is a diversion of money and attention in this moment.""

Airlines have been eager to tout sustainable aviation fuel innovation as a solution to growing emissions, though the credibility of some of their claims has been called into question.

Luxury air travel generates a massive amount of pollution, given how many people use it. One study suggested it would take 207 years for the average Amazon employee to emit as much as CEO Jeff Bezos' two private jets. Emissions like these exacerbate destructive floods, droughts, and heatwaves. The aftermath of these patterns, in turn, incurs agricultural, housing, ecological, and other costs.

While governments need to hold the elite accountable for their damaging travel habits, individuals can choose low-impact travel options, such as commuter rail. These can help mitigate the worst impacts of climate shifts.

Many Massachusetts politicians see the inherent hypocrisy of supporting private jet travel in their own backyard and have openly opposed it.

""There is no way you can put in a whole bunch of essentially garages for private jets and still claim ever again, at least in the living memory of those of us in the room, to be concerned about climate.

The solar farms will be spread out across Europe in Greece, Latvia, Spain, Poland, Romania, and Italy. Currently, more than 90% of Apple's manufacturing in China is powered by renewable energy, and it will also invest $150 million to raise that percentage further.

A notable fact about this news is that Apple has announced it on all of its international websites but not on its U.S. press site, potentially to avoid drawing attention or backlash from the Trump Administration, which has ended multiple clean energy projects and removed incentives.

Apple earned almost $400 billion in revenue from iPhones alone in 2024, according to Business of Apps. As one of the most profitable businesses in the world and one with a high carbon footprint, its energy offset is an incredible step toward reducing that.

Apple's goal is to power 100% of its products with clean energy by 2030. This sets a stellar example for other companies around the world to do the same. Its investment also helps lower the overall cost of solar and wind power, as their prevalence increases, making it more affordable for everyone.

Fossil fuels, also known as dirty energy, are non-renewable and expected to deplete over the next 30 to 60 years, according to Investopedia. Exposure to these fuels in our air can also cause respiratory issues, such as asthma and lung cancer, and stroke.

When Apple products finally become solar-powered, solar panels are the ultimate home energy upgrade, as they can reduce your electricity bill to as little as $0. TCD-vetted service EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes in your area, potentially saving homeowners up to $10,000 per installation. Solar also makes other energy-saving devices cheaper to run, including a heat pump, which Mitsubishi can help you find to suit your household's needs.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Apple-solar-investmentimage-recCZ8HSO7yXP3AmE-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 22:56:13.876371

International passenger traffic for Asia Pacific carriers rose 10% in the first nine months of 2025, while air cargo demand expanded 7%, outpacing global averages.
“Asia Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand,” said Subhas Menon, AAPA Director General.
Supply Chain Strengthening: The Assembly called for targeted investment incentives and regulatory harmonisation to enhance regional MRO and manufacturing capabilities.
“AAPA airlines are optimistic,” said Menon.","At the conclusion of the 69th Assembly of Presidents, leaders of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) expressed confidence in the region’s continued air transport growth through 2026, supported by resilient economies and strong passenger and cargo demand. Despite persistent geopolitical and trade tensions, AAPA members registered robust international air traffic performance. International passenger traffic for Asia Pacific carriers rose 10% in the first nine months of 2025, while air cargo demand expanded 7%, outpacing global averages.

“Asia Pacific airlines continue to demonstrate agility in managing supply chain constraints, with capacity growth keeping pace with demand,” said Subhas Menon, AAPA Director General. “However, further escalation of tariffs could exacerbate these bottlenecks.”

Supply chain recovery undermined by tariffs AAPA says in opening speech

AAPA Director General’s industry presentation

VIEWPOINT: Trump & tariffs — and you thought COVID was bad

The Assembly brought together airline leaders, manufacturers, and industry partners to address key industry priorities, including supply chain resilience, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) deployment, and enhancing manpower resilience. “Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The Assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty, much as it did during the pandemic,” Menon added.

The Assembly of Presidents unanimously passed a number of resolutions on several key industry priorities.

Aviation Sustainability: The Assembly affirmed a collective target of 5% SAF utilisation by 2030, called on Governments to support fuel suppliers by establishing policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production, and adopt ICAO CORSIA-eligible fuel criteria. The resolution further urged States to implement ICAO-approved SAF accounting and registry systems, and support cost-effective production pathways such as co-processing.

Supply Chain Strengthening: The Assembly called for targeted investment incentives and regulatory harmonisation to enhance regional MRO and manufacturing capabilities. It also supported the adoption of circular economy principles, including recycling and reuse of serviceable aircraft materials.

Aviation Safety: A resolution focused on lithium batteries was passed, calling on regulators to align practices with ICAO guidance for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, and to enhance data sharing and public outreach materials on the carriage and usage of lithium batteries by passengers.

Taxes and Charges: The Assembly called on regulators to refrain from imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance, cautioning against measures that add an unnecessary financial burden on airlines, or which impede sustainable air transport growth.

AAPA expects international passenger traffic to continue expanding in line with long-term trends, supported by a growing services sector and rising regional connectivity. The outlook for air cargo demand remains broadly positive, but subject to uncertainties from global trade policies and elevated costs, including those from new U.S. tariffs and limited SAF availability. “AAPA airlines are optimistic,” said Menon. “Our focus in 2026 will be to advance aviation safety and sustainability across the Asia Pacific region, strengthen supply resilience in collaboration with regulators and suppliers, and promote air transport connectivity.”

Airbus: APAC will need 19,560 new planes over 20 years:

The Asia Pacific region is projected to require 19,560 new narrowbody and widebody planes over the next 20 years, majorly driven by demand from India and China, Airbus Asia Pacific President Anand Stanley told the AAPA conference.

This inaugural service, powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), represents not only Thailand’s first low-cost carrier flight on this route using clean energy but also a major step forward in regional cooperation to reduce carbon emissions and promote eco-friendly travel across ASEAN tourism corridors. The program highlights Thailand’s strategic role in fostering environmental leadership within the aviation sector while enhancing its global tourism appeal.

Strategic Partnership Advancing Regional Green Aviation

The Green Route initiative is a collaboration involving the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), VietJet Thailand, and PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited (PTT OR). The historic inaugural flight on November 6, 2025, from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok demonstrates the region’s commitment to reducing aviation’s carbon footprint through technological innovation and cross-sectoral partnerships.

This collaboration links Thailand’s tourism aspirations with energy sector expertise to accelerate the deployment of cleaner aviation fuel resources, setting an example for integrated sustainable tourism growth.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Critical to Low-Carbon Tourism

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from renewable and waste-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas, adheres to stringent international standards (ASTM D7566) and performs comparably to conventional Jet A-1 fuels. The adoption of SAF on the Bangkok–Phu Quoc route marks a tangible reduction in carbon emissions, cutting approximately two hundred fifty kilograms of CO₂ per flight and achieving up to eighty percent emissions reduction on a lifecycle basis.

VietJet Thailand’s goal is to blend SAF at a five-percent level across its fleet by 2030, contributing to a cumulative reduction of more than one hundred fifty-three thousand tonnes of CO₂ within six years. This transition supports Thailand’s overarching national goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, reflecting global trends toward environmental accountability in tourism infrastructure.

Enhancing Tourism Through Environmental Leadership

TAT’s strong endorsement of VietJet’s Green Route reflects Thailand’s evolving approach to responsible tourism, promoting travel experiences that minimize environmental impacts while sustaining economic benefits. The integration of clean aviation fuels aligns with TAT’s initiatives such as the Thailand Tourism Awards, CF-Hotels certification, and the Sustainable Tourism Acceleration Rating (STAR) program, all designed to foster green practices across the industry.

These measures reinforce Thailand’s reputation as a trusted destination for eco-conscious travelers and contribute to the diversification and resilience of the tourism economy.

Regional Connectivity and Market Growth

Phu Quoc Island, a tropical gem off Vietnam’s coast, is emerging as a favored leisure destination for tourists seeking pristine beaches and relaxed atmospheres. The Green Route flight enhances connectivity between Thailand and Vietnam, two of ASEAN’s fastest-growing tourism markets, supporting the expected influx of over six hundred thousand Vietnamese visitors to Thailand in 2025.

Strengthened air links support increased bilateral visitation, fostering cultural exchange, wellness tourism, and cross-border ecotourism development. TAT continues to collaborate with airlines and digital partners on campaigns such as Thailand Summer Blast and the Krabi Prototype project to spotlight sustainable travel options aligned with certification programs.

VietJet Thailand’s Role in Sustainable Aviation

Under the management of Chief Executive Officer Woranate Laprabang, VietJet Thailand’s SAF integration symbolizes the airline’s commitment to balancing commercial growth with ecological responsibility. By incorporating SAF into regular operations and enabling passengers to contribute to emission reduction, VietJet serves as a catalyst for a greener aviation industry within Southeast Asia.

The airline collaborates with key energy providers like PTT OR and fuel suppliers such as Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services (BAFS) to ensure reliable SAF supply chains that underpin sustainable operations.

Thailand’s Broader Sustainable Tourism Framework

Thailand’s sustainable tourism agenda integrates multiple sectors, focusing on environmentally responsible hospitality, community engagement, and innovation in destination management. Initiatives by TAT and government agencies prioritize:

Certification schemes encouraging green standards in hotels and attractions

Conservation-focused projects supporting protected areas and natural heritage

Promotion of cultural authenticity and local community benefits

Reduction of carbon emissions across tourism value chains

These efforts create a resilient, future-oriented tourism industry aligned with international climate commitments.

Economic and Social Benefits of Green Aviation

The Green Route not only reduces environmental externalities but also generates economic and social dividends. Improved air accessibility to emerging destinations fosters regional development, supports small businesses, promotes sustainable employment, and enhances visitor experiences anchored in natural and cultural heritage.

By blending environmental stewardship with operational innovation, Thailand’s aviation and tourism sectors model transformative growth pathways for the broader ASEAN region.

As a state-owned airline, Air Algérie is in the process of making a long, multi-year capital investment in the renewal of its long-haul fleet.
From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A330neo gives Air Algérie a more compelling platform to pursue its ambition of ultimately turning Algiers into a North African hub that will link Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia.","Air Algerie has recently become the world's newest operator of the Airbus A330neo, after taking delivery of its first A330-900 model. This jet is the first of eight aircraft on order by the carrier. The widebody marks a major step in modernizing the flag carrier's long-haul fleet and deepening its relationship with Airbus, with the aircraft configured with around 308 seats across three cabins.

The jet introduces Air Algerie's most competitive onboard product to date, and it is powered by fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. The new aircraft type will support growth from Algiers on longer-haul markets, including additional transatlantic and Asian routes, all while positioning the carrier as the largest African operator of the Airbus A330neo once all deliveries have been fully completed.

What Are The Key Developments In This Story?

The first Airbus A330-900neo, which was delivered from Toulouse and bears registration 7T-VTA, inaugurates an eight-strong order that is set to reach complete fulfillment by 2027. The aircraft features 18 full-flat business-class seats in a 1-2-1 layout, alongside 24 premium-economy seats and 266 in the economy cabin, combining for a total of 308 passengers. This is an upgrade in both capacity and comfort over the airline's Airbus A330-200s.

Airbus' Airspace cabin adds larger bins, updated lighting, and next-generation in-flight entertainment and overall connectivity. The jet is powered by a pair of Trent 7000 engines, and it is certified for use of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, with manufacturer Airbus targeting 100% SAF usage by 2030. Air Algérie plans to deploy the type on routes such as Algiers to Montreal and future services to Beijing and Guangzhou, as well as other long-haul markets. In its statement regarding the delivery, Airbus had the following words to share:

""Air Algérie will position itself as a center of excellence for the A330neo, supported by the development of its maintenance and repair capabilities and the establishment of a maintenance training center.""

What Are The Financial Benefits The A330neo Offers?

From a financial perspective, the Airbus A330neo fleet helps Air Algérie reshape its long-haul cost base. The Trent 7000-powered Airbus A330-900 offers a roughly 25% lower fuel burn and lower carbon emissions per seat over older-generation widebodies. This is ultimately a critical lever at a time when fuel prices are elevated, and environmental regulations only continue to tighten.

With 308 seats in comparison to 263 on existing Airbus A330-200s, the aircraft can help lower unit costs as fixed cockpit and maintenance costs are spread out across more passengers, provided the airline is able to maintain its load factors. As a state-owned airline, Air Algérie is in the process of making a long, multi-year capital investment in the renewal of its long-haul fleet.

The eight Airbus A330neos the airline will be ordering are set to join additional purchase orders for the Airbus A350-1000, which have already been announced by the carrier, a move that allows the airline to lock in a modern, homogenous fleet for the next decade. In the near-term, depreciation costs as well as financing costs for the acquisition will rise, and the airline is ultimately betting that the improved operating economics of the A330neo, alongside higher-yield potential in premium cabins, will help enhance profitability on key trunk routes and support sustainable growth in long-haul revenue.

What Are The Strategic Benefits The A330neo Brings To The Table?

From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A330neo gives Air Algérie a more compelling platform to pursue its ambition of ultimately turning Algiers into a North African hub that will link Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. The aircraft's comfortable range of around 7,200 nautical miles (13,334 km) covers current endpoints of the airline's network, including Montreal and Beijing, while offering additional flexibility to serve these kinds of markets.

The aircraft will offer a competitive three-cabin product with true long-haul business-class seating that will help win over some higher-yielding travelers. The airline's principal competitors are European legacy carriers and flag airlines from the Gulf.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_1209484417.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-15 18:56:09.625267

Scientists have used genetically engineered bacteria to simultaneously create and color fabrics in a one-pot method. Compared with current methods that rely on fossil fuels, the new technique offers a simpler and more sustainable way to produce colored textiles.

In a new study described Nov. 12 in the journal Trends in Biotechnology, the researchers created cellulose-based fabrics spanning the colors of the rainbow by altering the conditions used to grow the bacteria.

Synthetic fibers rely ""heavily on chemical synthesis and post-treatment steps that are energy-intensive, laborious, and environmentally harmful,"" said study lead author Sang Yup Lee, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Such processes can generate large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and contaminate water and soil with heavy metals and carcinogens, Lee told Live Science in an email.

Therefore, in recent years, there has been a growing trend to use an alternative method of producing natural fibers from the fermentation of bacteria. Cellulose is a promising target, as this material mimics the natural fibers found in fabrics such as cotton. A wide range of bacteria ordinarily convert glucose into fibers of cellulose to lend structural support and defend against other microbes. However, cellulose produced by bacteria is naturally white, which means it often needs to be dyed after processing.

Lee and his team have now simplified this process by growing cellulose-producing bacteria alongside microbes that produce natural colorants. The team used strains of color-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) to create two classes of dyes: darker violaceins (which produced colors such as purple, blue and green) and warmer carotenoids (which produced colors such as red, orange and yellow).

Initially, the researchers genetically modified the metabolic pathway of a strain of Komagataeibacter xylinus bacteria to increase cellulose production during fermentation. Subsequently adding the violacein-producing E. coli to the reaction vessel resulted in purple-, blue- and green-dyed fabric.

However, the team was not able to use the same method to achieve the warmer tones, because the bacteria did not produce enough dye to stain the cellulose fabric, likely due to poor bacterial growth. To overcome this issue, they added pregrown and treated cellulose to a culture of carotenoid-producing E. coli. This co-culture method successfully led to red-, orange- and yellow-dyed fabrics, thereby completing the team's rainbow palette.

Overall, this method ""eliminates the need for separate dying and washing processes,"" Lee said, adding that this helps to reduce chemical waste and water consumption.

The colored bacterial cellulose showed an overall strong stability against acids, bases, heat treatments, and washing. However, the team noted that further work is needed to fully test these materials — notably, to check their durability against industrial detergents and mechanical wear and tear.

Moving forward, Lee wants to ""extend the current seven color platform to a broader spectrum"" and scale up the process to an industrial level while maintaining consistent quality. Further altering the way bacteria produce the cellulose could open up other uses of the material, such as biodegradable packaging, he said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0aGhjNSeDuXikd5PqJg7lQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/live_science_953/63f121f608eb79eab6201fa9a30a8440,N,,2025-11-15 13:56:09.758705

Energy access and clean cooking A major push on energy access rounded out the day.","The 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on November 14 delivered one of the most consequential accelerations of the summit so far, with governments, industries, financiers and civil society converging around a shared message: the transition away from fossil fuels is underway, systemic, and increasingly irreversible. What had long been framed as ambition took shape as concrete platforms, financing mechanisms, industrial agreements and cross-sector coalitions aimed squarely at implementation.

From the launch of the Clean Energy Ministerial’s Future Fuels Action Plan to a new global transport declaration, green industrialisation commitments, and strengthened coal and oil and gas transition efforts, Day 5 offered the clearest sign yet that COP30 is attempting to turn political pledges into coordinated global action.

“Momentum has shifted,” said Dan Ioschpe, COP30 High-Level Champion. “The energy transition is no longer a niche conversation among specialists. It is a systems challenge that requires governments, private capital and industry to move in lockstep — and we are finally seeing that alignment.”

Future fuels take centre stage

The day opened with the formal launch of the Future Fuels Action Plan, the implementation backbone of the rapidly expanding Belém 4X Pledge, which aims to quadruple global sustainable fuel use by 2035. The coalition has grown from four countries at pre-COP to 23 endorsers, spanning Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe and small island states.

The plan outlines 20 actions — from transparent carbon accounting to trade corridors — and establishes annual tracking by the International Energy Agency.

In the private sector, Maersk intensified the decarbonisation push in shipping with a major scale-up of methanol-enabled vessels. The company will operate 41 dual-fuel ships by 2027 and has signed offtake agreements for 500,000 tonnes of green methanol annually from 2026.

A second regional milestone came from Latin America, where six organisations representing farmers, biofuel producers, airlines, aviation regulators and energy institutions signed a Joint Declaration to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across the region. The agreement sets out unified fuel standards, farm-to-flight supply chains, and a regional roadmap — a move observers described as potentially transformative for a region with vast biomass and feedstock potential.

“There is enormous opportunity for this region to lead,” said Lucía Andrade, a senior official involved in the SAF coalition. “For the first time, producers and airlines are designing a market together rather than waiting for one to emerge.”

Meanwhile, the Global Environment Facility confirmed $15.8 million for UNIDO, unlocking $213.5 million in co-financing across nine countries to accelerate clean hydrogen production and use. The multilateral 10 GW Lighthouse Initiative also announced that 1 GW of electrolyser capacity has been enabled at early stages, with 68 hydrogen projects assessed for financial structuring support.

Green industrialisation breakthroughs

A second major pillar of the day was industrial decarbonisation. Ministers adopted the Belém Declaration on Global Green Industrialization, committing to scale low-carbon manufacturing, strengthen standards, and accelerate technology transfer along global supply chains.

In a landmark step, interoperability agreements among steel standards initiatives — now covering 70 per cent of global production — were finalised. Experts say this could unlock a credible global market for near-zero steel by lowering transaction costs and harmonising carbon accounting.

“This is what systemic change looks like,” said Marina Kovács, an industrial standards specialist advising the negotiations. “You cannot decarbonise steel mill by mill. You need markets that reward near-zero production, and today we built the foundations of that market.”

Transitioning away from fossil fuels: From concept to roadmap

The momentum behind transitioning away from fossil fuels — a headline outcome from Dubai’s COP28 — accelerated meaningfully.

The Powering Past Coal Alliance unveiled a Plan to Accelerate Solutions, offering technical, financial and policy support to countries preparing coal phase-out strategies. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) presented a new mechanism for a managed decline in oil and gas production, including illustrative pathways to be developed with major producing countries.

Financial signals emerged as a powerful theme. Since 2021, members of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CETP) have reduced international public finance for fossil fuel projects by up to 75 per cent, redirecting nearly $31 billion away from carbon-intensive systems. Over the same period, CETP members increased clean-energy finance abroad by 77 per cent.

New IMF data underscored the scale of current fossil incentives: $7.63 trillion globally, with only 9 cents of every dollar reaching the poorest quintile — a statistic that drew sharp responses throughout the plenary.

“This is not just inefficient — it is regressive,” said Mireille Diop, an economist from Senegal. “Subsidy reform is climate policy, social policy and fiscal policy rolled into one.”

The non-governmental consortium EFFECT also announced a cooperation framework for real-world pilot partnerships between fossil fuel exporting and importing countries.

Together, the initiatives showed that transitioning away is no longer an abstract aspiration but an increasingly structured process. As negotiators noted, countries are beginning to assemble the first pieces of a global roadmap built on shared learning and shared responsibility — a spirit many referred to using the Amazonian term mutirão.

Transport declaration sets a global 2035 benchmark

Transport — responsible for 23 per cent of CO2 emissions — took a major step toward alignment with 1.5°C pathways. Led by Chile, 10 countries endorsed a Declaration for a Global Transport Effort, committing to:

· 25 per cent reduction in transport energy demand by 2035

· One-third of transport energy from renewables and sustainable biofuels

Chile’s Transport Minister Juan Carlos Muñoz called it “a turning point,” adding: “We have proved that clean transport improves cities, boosts innovation and lowers pollution. The next decade is about scaling this transformation globally.”

The declaration emphasises differentiated national circumstances and highlights electromobility, sustainable biofuels, and modal shifts as complementary solutions.

Energy access and clean cooking

A major push on energy access rounded out the day. The Clean Cooking Fund has allocated $86 million in grants to 28 countries, leveraging an additional $102 million from IDA/IBRD, $10.81 million from carbon finance and $279 million from private capital. Together, the financing has supported access to clean cooking solutions for more than 37 million people and 2,772 public institutions.

A new Platform for Clean Cooking in Schools will launch tomorrow, aiming to expand programs from 10 countries to 20 by 2026, with the objective of global coverage by 2030.

Delivery, not dialogue

If earlier COP30 sessions focused on negotiations and positioning, Day 5 stood out for its emphasis on coordinated delivery — the clearest signal yet that COP30 is shaping itself as an implementation COP.

As Katie White of the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office put it: “Momentum is on our side. If we can clear the traffic ahead with this roadmap, we can — and must — accelerate.”

With system-wide actions across fuels, industry, finance, transport and energy access, Day 5 cemented COP30’s emerging identity: a summit determined not only to raise ambition, but to construct the machinery to achieve it.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-11-15%2F1tklaes3%2FDay-5.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-11-15 10:57:26.829951

We were told that nothing could be done without a formal diagnosis and, once the diagnosis was provided, very little changed.

Because she masked so effectively at school, our repeated and urgent concerns, raised almost daily, about the emotional crises she experienced at home were dismissed.

We were told the issue must be at home, and that the school was already doing all it could.

Despite her diagnosis, she was not offered a place in the ASD (autism spectrum disorder) class, and we were told no further support would be provided.

We applied for a year to other schools with an ASD class and we are still on waiting lists.

She was also not accepted by the children’s disability network team, and primary care psychology services informed us that her needs were too complex for them to meet.

We also underwent an assessment of needs, which was likewise not accepted on the grounds that “the definition of disability as defined in the Act has not been met in this case”.

When her emotional wellbeing seriously deteriorated, she was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) but her case was initially not accepted.

Only after contacting government ministers was she taken on but even then, with a nine-month waiting list.

As we could not access therapy through the public system, we attempted to go private but found that the waiting lists were either closed or years long.

After exhausting every local avenue and watching our daughter’s wellbeing decline, we made the heartbreaking decision to relocate to Spain, where her needs were recognised almost immediately.

She was granted the highest level of dependency and a disability.

She now attends a school where she has her own classroom, a dedicated teacher, and regular support from a speech and language therapist and occupational therapist.

We are grateful she is finally receiving the help she needs but the damage from years of inaction has already been done.

This is not just about the toll on our family though it has been significant.

My husband has remained working in Ireland for a year, only able to visit once a month while I have been alone with our daughter in Spain, rebuilding her life, her mental health, and education.

But, most importantly, this is about the long-term impact on a 10-year-old child.

She now faces an educational delay of approximately five years, which is extremely difficult to reverse.

She lives with the psychological impact of having spent years in a system that did not provide her with a safe or supportive environment.

She was a child with visible needs who was repeatedly overlooked, misunderstood, and effectively denied her rights, simply because she masked.

This experience has left her not only behind in her education, but with emotional wounds from being dismissed by the very structures that should have protected and supported her. And sadly, her story is not unique.

It should not take moving abroad or escalating to ministers for a child to be seen. No child should have to reach a breaking point before support is offered. And no parent should have to fight for years, every single day, for their child to receive even the most basic help.

I share this not just for my daughter, but for every other child in Ireland still waiting still unheard, still unseen, and still fighting for the support they deserve.

Is EU plan for aviation fuel just greenwashing?

John Whelan’s article — ‘EU’s €2bn plan to fix shortage of sustainable aviation fuel’, Irish Examiner, November 10 relating to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — seems a bit optimistic.

The EU will solve the problem of the shortage of SAF by spending €2bn.

This miracle SAF is defined as that made from agricultural waste or used cooking oil.

These products are already used in road transport fuels and some of these will also be in demand for the much heralded production of bio-methane from anaerobic digestion.

Thus the supply of these waste materials is not assured for the voracious needs of the aviation industry.

There are also reports that many existing biofuels in Europe are produced from imported palm oil rather than indigenous waste sources.

The only solution I have seen to produce clean aviation fuel is to use carbon capture from flue gases and to combine this with hydrogen generated from hydrolysis/wind power to produce a sustainable synthetic fuel.

This could be something like methanol but would likely cost six times the cost of the conventional fuel. Michael O’Leary has rightly scoffed at the idea of any form of SAF.

He knows that the customer does want to pay the real cost for sustainable aviation. Thus, is this EU initiative just another form of ‘greenwashing’?

Defence Forces role in President’s inauguration

For someone who, in the past, stridently declared that Ireland does not need an army, Catherine Connolly’s inauguration as Uachtarán na hÉireann would have greatly lacked a sense of solemnity, an aura of dignity, and the observance of ceremonial occasion befitting the appointment of our head of State, had the Irish Defence Forces not been present.

Irish language act may be discriminatory

I have always been a lover of the Irish language but I struggle with the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 which says that 20% of recruits to the public sector will be competent in the Irish language by the end of 2030.

That means that when you go into your nursing home and a Filipino or Indian nurse is taking care of you, you can exercise your constitutional right to have your healthcare delivered through Irish.

I find this to be really discriminatory against people when it comes to jobs.

This is akin to saying that if you can do your job through Irish, then your application goes into one pile.

That certainly doesn’t sit easy with me.

The Long-Term Vision For Hydrogen So, could Rolls-Royce’s hydrogen engine concept redefine jet power?","The aviation industry stands at a critical juncture, facing immense pressure to decarbonize by 2050. While Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers an immediate ""drop-in"" solution, its long-term scalability and total emissions reduction potential remain subjects of debate.

Enter hydrogen, a fuel source with the potential for true zero-carbon emissions at the point of use. British engine maker Rolls-Royce, in partnership with airline easyJet and various research institutions, has embarked on a pioneering journey to develop and test hydrogen-powered gas turbine engines. But could today's hydrogen engine concept tests truly redefine the future of jet power?

The Rationale Behind Hydrogen Power

Testing of hydrogen for jet engines began as early as the mid-1950s by the US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a precursor to NASA. Ground tests of a liquid hydrogen fuel system with a modified J65 engine were conducted at NACA's Lewis Field laboratories in 1955. This led to the world's first experimental flights of a hydrogen-powered aircraft, a modified Martin B-57 Canberra bomber, in early 1957.

Back then, interest in hydrogen-powered flight was primarily focused on performance. But hydrogen’s appeal today lies in its clean-burning properties, producing only water vapor as a byproduct. Specifically, the environmental advantages of hydrogen as a jet fuel are:

Zero CO₂ Emissions: When hydrogen is burned in a jet engine, the only direct byproduct is water vapor. This eliminates carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, a major contributor to global warming, making it an attractive solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry, especially if the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy (""green hydrogen"").

Reduced Other Pollutants: Hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxides than conventional jet fuel and eliminates the formation of particulate matter, improving local air quality around airports.

Potential to Reduce Climate Impact: While water vapor creates contrails, studies suggest that hydrogen combustion could lead to a 30–50% reduction in overall climate impact compared to kerosene aircraft, a figure that could reach 75–90% with fuel cell technology.

Hydrogen also has significant operational advantages. It possesses nearly three times the energy per kilogram as kerosene, so less fuel by weight is needed to achieve the same amount of energy. Theoretically, it can be generated anywhere there is water and electricity, reducing the reliance on complex oil extraction and refinement supply chains and potentially allowing airports to produce their own fuel. Thinking even more broadly, using liquid hydrogen's cryogenic properties as a heat sink could also open up new design possibilities for improved engine and system performance.

A Landmark Ground Test

All that theory started being put into practice on November 28, 2022. At an outdoor test facility at Boscombe Down in the UK, engineers from Rolls-Royce and easyJet gathered to run a converted Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A test engine on 100% green hydrogen. Years of research and development had led to that day, and the hydrogen produced using renewable wind and tidal power by the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC) in the Orkney Islands, was ready. When the day was out, the partners had set a new aviation milestone with the world’s first run of a modern aero engine on hydrogen.

This initial test was more of a proof of concept than a test of the actual power of the engine. It demonstrated that a modern turboprop engine could combust hydrogen without immediately encountering show-stopping issues. The engine technology itself remained largely the same, a crucial point for future certification and integration, but the fuel system was radically altered to handle the unique properties of hydrogen. The success of this ground test injected a new wave of optimism into the sector, showing that the zero-carbon potential of hydrogen was an achievable goal, not just a theoretical aspiration.

Overcoming The Thermal Challenge

Following the initial low-power test, the engineers moved to tackle a more significant hurdle: achieving maximum takeoff thrust. This is where hydrogen's properties pose their greatest challenge. Hydrogen burns far hotter and more rapidly than traditional kerosene, making flame control a significant engineering feat.

The team, collaborating with the German aerospace research agency DLR and Loughborough University, focused their efforts on redesigning the fuel spray nozzles within the combustor of a Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engine, the exclusive engine for the Gulfstream G700 and G800. The result was a novel system that progressively mixes air with the hydrogen to manage its high reactivity and control the flame position. The tests, conducted at DLR's facilities in Cologne, proved that hydrogen could indeed be combusted at conditions representing maximum takeoff thrust.

The results were precisely in line with expectations, confirming the viability of Rolls-Royce's advanced fuel system design. Grazia Vittadini, former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Airbus and now the CTO at Rolls-Royce, had the following to say:

""This is an incredible achievement in a short space of time. Controlling the combustion process is one of the key technology challenges the industry faces in making hydrogen a real aviation fuel of the future. We have achieved that, and it makes us eager to keep moving forward.""

This milestone was crucial because it went beyond the initial proof of concept. Via intermediate and full pressure testing, it addressed a major technical unknown in hydrogen combustion, proving that it could be used in real-world conditions. In doing so, it moved the conversation from ""if"" hydrogen could power an engine to ""how"" it could be safely and efficiently integrated into existing engine architectures.

Major Infrastructure Hurdles Remain

The engineering breakthroughs in the lab were significant, but the path to commercial aviation involves more than just engine technology. A massive obstacle looms large: the lack of infrastructure. For hydrogen to be a viable aviation fuel, a global ecosystem for its production, storage, and distribution at airports needs to be built from scratch.

The current production of ""green"" hydrogen—created using renewable energy sources like wind and tidal power—is minimal and expensive. Most hydrogen produced today relies on fossil fuels, which negates the carbon-neutral benefit. Rolls-Royce is actively advocating for government support and cross-industry collaboration to scale up production and drive down costs, but the investment required is substantial, representing many billions of dollars.

Airports and energy companies are hesitant to invest such sums without guaranteed demand, creating a classic ""chicken and egg"" scenario. As a result, Rolls-Royce and partners like easyJet are working with airports, such as AGS Airports (Aberdeen, Glasgow, Southampton), to plan for on-site hydrogen generation and storage, a crucial step in preparing for zero-emission flights. The success of this concept is intrinsically linked to overcoming this monumental infrastructure hurdle.

A Redesigned Future For Aircraft

The challenges aren't limited to the ground or the engine itself. Aircraft running on liquid hydrogen will require fundamental design changes. Hydrogen, even in liquid form, has a much lower energy density by volume than kerosene. This means operators would have to sacrifice either passenger capacity or range to accommodate the bulky, insulated cryogenic fuel tanks needed to store hydrogen at -253°C.

The consensus in the industry is that hydrogen will likely be limited to smaller, shorter-haul segments initially. Rolls-Royce is targeting small to mid-sized aircraft (30–40 seats) from the mid-2030s. This focus on regional aviation makes sense, as shorter flights require less fuel, making the volume/weight trade-off more manageable. While radical aircraft redesigns are necessary, the path is clearer for smaller platforms, allowing the technology to mature before potentially scaling up.

The Long-Term Vision For Hydrogen

So, could Rolls-Royce’s hydrogen engine concept redefine jet power? The answer is nuanced. The current consensus within Rolls-Royce and the broader industry is that while hydrogen has immense potential, especially for zero-emission flight at the point of use, it will likely start as a complement to other solutions like SAFs, rather than an immediate replacement for all aviation.

SAFs remain the only viable option for decarbonizing existing long-haul fleets in the near to medium term. Hydrogen's role is expected to blossom first in the regional and short-haul sectors. The technology needs years of rigorous development and certification, with commercial availability likely only by the mid-2030s for smaller planes.

However, the groundbreaking tests have fundamentally altered the landscape, proving the viability of hydrogen combustion in a modern engine. By pushing the boundaries of engineering and design, Rolls-Royce has demonstrated that a future of zero-carbon aviation is possible, even if it requires a radical rethink of aircraft design and global infrastructure. As such, the redefinition of jet power will be a phased evolution, led by the pioneering work of companies willing to take a leap into the cryogenic future of flight.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-new-generation-could-rolls-royce-s-hydrogen-engine-concept-redefine-jet-power.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-15 10:58:37.459796

A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to U.S. airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat – called tallow – into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue JBLU.O and Southwest Airlines LUV.N, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

TAINTED CATTLE

In 2022 Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency said it lifted a commercial ban on Vale do Paraiso last year because its owner Antonio Lucena Barros presented a plan to restore the deforested area. Barros also obtained a court injunction suspending a fine of over $3 million, which the agency said it will appeal.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

FAT TO FUEL

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value – less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.

I just recently took a trip to Iceland, and then tagged on a fun review trip from there. Now I’m heading back out on the road (or in the skies, I guess!). So you can expect some live updates, and then upon returning home, I’ll publish the full review series from all of these trips.

Given the upcoming holidays, I feel like this is the second to last trip of the year that I’ll manage to squeeze in (with one more between Thanksgiving and Christmas). Let me explain what I have booked so far, in chronological order.

I’m first flying PorterReserve on the Embraer E195-E2

I’m kicking off the trip with a product I’ve been curious about for some time. Canada’s Porter Airlines has massively expanded in recent years, including operating Embraer E195-E2s on transborder flights. So I’m starting the trip by flying PorterReserve, the carrier’s premium product, from Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to Montreal (YUL).

This is the carrier’s premium product, and think of it as basically being an extra legroom seating option with improved service (even though Porter has very high service standards already). I can’t wait to give the airline a try, as I last flew with Porter when it was an all-turboprop operator.

By the way, this is such a spectacular use of Alaska Atmos Rewards points — we’re talking just 10,000 points for a one-way premium cabin ticket!

Then I’m flying Air France’s Boeing 787-9 business class

From Montreal, I’ll by flying Air France’s Boeing 787-9 business class to Paris (CDG). Okay, I’ve flown Air France business class many times before (on the Airbus A350-900, Boeing 777-300ER, etc.), so why am I flying the airline again? Well, several reasons.

For one, I haven’t flown the Air France Dreamliner in many years, so I think it’s time to see how that product is holding up, since it’s a different seat than on Air France’s other planes. Second, I’m curious to check out Air France’s new business class bedding, which was recently rolled out. Third, it gets me where I need to go, with interesting segments on both ends. Fourth, there was actually saver award availability!

Lastly (and perhaps most importantly, at least to me), I have Flying Blue Platinum status, and my status qualification period ends in a couple of weeks, and I’m a small number of XPs short of requlaifying for status. So by purchasing sustainable aviation fuel for the flight, I’ll get the XPs required to get me over the edge, and to keep the status.

Next I’m flying Aircalin’s Airbus A330-900neo business class

Okay, here’s a really fun one. From Paris, I’ll be flying Aircalin’s Airbus A330-900neo business class to Bangkok (BKK). How fun is that?! For those not familiar, Aircalin is the airline of New Caledonia, and the airline has greatly adjusted its route network in recent times, now flying between Paris and Noumea with a stop in Bangkok.

So I’m taking the first segment of the journey, which I managed to book in business class with Flying Blue miles. I’ve been wanting to fly Aircalin for so long, so I can’t wait to finally check this out!!

I’m returning in Thai Airways’ Boeing 787-9 business class

From Bangkok, I’ll make my way back to the United States, but via Europe. I’ll be flying Thai Airways’ Boeing 787-9 business class to Milan (MXP), as that’s the only European route operated by that specific plane, which has what I’d argue is Thai’s best business class product.

I haven’t flown Thai’s long haul business class in a long time, and I managed to book this as part of a larger itinerary, where I’m paying just 87,500 Air Canada Aeroplan points to fly from Asia to the United States via Europe. You can’t beat that value, eh?! These redemptions used to be so common for me back in the day, but with how award availability has evolved, it’s tougher than in the past, so this got me downright giddy.

I’m finishing with SWISS’ Airbus A350-900 business class

For the final portion of my trip, I’ll be flying SWISS’ brand new Airbus A350-900 business class from Zurich (ZRH) to Boston (BOS). This plane recently entered commercial service, and I’m looking forward to being among the first people to experience this on a long haul flight. It features the new SWISS Senses experience, based on the Lufthansa Allegris concept.

Quite honestly, this segment is what motivated the entire trip. When I saw award availability on this sector, I figured “okay, I have to review this.” And then I worked backwards. “Well, if I’m redeeming Aeroplan points from Europe to the United States, I might as well originate in Asia, since it’s a better value.” And that’s how the whole trip planning started.

The hotels I’m staying at on this trip

I do have a few hotel stays on this trip, so what do I have planned? Truth be told, I have so many of these Amex Platinum $300 hotel credits to burn through, which are ideal for one night stays, so I’m more focused on luxury properties than anything, given the good value available on short stays:

In Montreal, I’ll be spending a night at the Four Seasons, which I’ve heard great things about, and which is regarded as the best hotel in the city

In Paris, I actually potentially have a couple of nights (but maybe not — more on that in a separate post); should I review the Park Hyatt again, check out Hyatt’s Hotel du Louvre, stay at Hilton LXR’s SAX Paris, or check out one of Marriott’s Luxury Collection options (Hotel de Berri or Prince de Galles)?

In Bangkok, I’m leaning toward staying at the Ritz-Carlton, though I’m open to other ideas for points properties (I’ve reviewed the Park Hyatt and Waldorf Astoria in the past); I’d like to return to Bangkok again soon for a proper visit, so I’m saving the Aman, Capella, and Four Seasons, for when I go with Ford

Bottom line

I just planned another review trip, where I’ll be flying a variety of products that have been on my list. I’ll be experiencing Porter’s E195-E2 PorterReserve, Air France’s 787-9 business class, Aircalin’s A330-900neo business class, Thai Airways’ 787-9 business class, and SWISS’ A350-900 business class.

The aim of the bill is to utilise strategies to meet the supply demand with SAF mandate of 2% blending in 2025 to 22% by 2040. Therefore, the mandate creates demand for SAF but the struggle for supply continues.

Proposed strategies to meet the mandate

On Jan. 1, 2025, the government imposed a SAF mandate on the aviation industry to blend a minimum and increasing percentage of SAF into the total fuel mix for flights departing the UK. The rise is targeted from 2% in 2025 to 22% in 2040.

To meet these targets and support the commercial production of SAF in the UK, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill was introduced on May 14, 2025 in the House of Commons.

One of the main targets of the bill is to introduce a Revenue Certainty Mechanism. The Secretary of State may instruct a government-owned counterparty to enter contracts with SAF producers while reducing investment risks. A fixed “strike price” for SAF will be guaranteed over a defined period.

If the market price falls below the strike price, the counterparty pays the producer the difference.

If the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the counterparty the surplus.

Such resolutions will ensure that the mechanism mirrors the UK’s Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme used in low-carbon electricity and hydrogen. It will also aim to lower financing costs, boost investor confidence, and accelerate final investment decisions for SAF plants.

The bill also specifies the counterparty which must be a company wholly owned by the government. This is to ensure responsibility for issuing and managing contracts with SAF producers, handling payments under the strike price mechanism, and administering the overall scheme.

Were certain targets missed?

During the Report stage of the bill, on Oct. 15, 2025, Olly Glover, Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Transport), introduced new clauses and at the same time highlighted a few missed targets,

In 2010, Boeing announced the target that 1% of aviation fuel globally should come from SAF by 2015, and in 2019, the International Air Transport Association set out hopes of reaching 2% by 2025, but today, globally, the figure is just 0.3%.

He observes the continued talks of using SAF over the years yet notices a poor track record of unambitious targets. He says,

The Conservative Government promised back in 2022 to have five commercial UK SAF plants operational by 2025, but there is still only one. It is therefore right of the Government to have introduced legislation to make sure that the latest set of SAF targets move from fantasy to realistic, credible and deliverable plans.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/l_bailey_of_paddington_hol070325-71.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-15 10:59:12.266134

Speaking at the 69th Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) here, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said there was huge frustration that the supply chain issues are not getting much better. While airlines are a low margin industry, he said the margins of OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are high.

Global airlines are bracing for another cost squeeze as the industry warns that tariff-linked price hikes by aircraft and engine suppliers could derail the fragile recovery in aviation manufacturing. IATA Director General Willie Walsh on Saturday said supply-chain disruptions continue to delay aircraft deliveries and increase operating costs — and expressed concern that some OEMs are now talking about raising prices.

Speaking at the 69th Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA), Walsh said “there was huge frustration that the supply chain issues are not getting much better,” even as airlines continue to operate with thin margins. In contrast, he noted that OEMs enjoy much stronger profitability.

Taking examples, he said engine makers “are actually improving their financial performance during a period of massive disruption which has added massive costs to the airline industry.”

Walsh added that “it is bothering when he hears suppliers talking about that they want to increase prices because of tariffs and other supply chain issues.”

“There's got to be a correction to this. Airlines need to be properly rewarded. I don't object to anybody making profits....

Live Events

But we've got to see a greater balance and we need to see these critical suppliers raising their game and raising their game significantly to ensure that they're serving the industry in the way that we need to be served,” he said.

The global aviation sector continues to struggle with prolonged supply-chain bottlenecks since the pandemic, leaving airlines waiting for new aircraft even as passenger demand rebounds sharply. The worldwide commercial aircraft backlog exceeded 17,000 units last year — significantly higher than the 2010–2019 annual average of 13,000 — according to an IATA–Oliver Wyman study.

AAPA Director General Subhas Menon warned that tariffs now threaten to slow the already fragile recovery. “Tariffs will impact the nascent recovery of the supply chain and also increase non-fuel cost for the airlines,” he said.

He pointed out that while aircraft and engines are exempt, many of the raw materials and components sourced globally are not. “Supply chain recovery is now undermined by tariffs which increase supplier costs. While aircraft and engines are exempt, their raw materials, and components which come from many parts of the world, are not.

“Tariffs also affect demand through inflation. It is a double whammy as both supply, and demand sides of the market are affected,” Menon said, even as he reiterated that air transport demand remains strong.

On sustainability, Menon said that taxing airlines “directly or indirectly through mandates has not worked” and noted that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production remains low.

The IATA–Oliver Wyman study estimates that supply-chain challenges will cost airlines more than USD 11 billion in 2025, driven by excess fuel burn, additional maintenance, increased engine leasing and higher inventory-holding expenses.

,,2025-11-15 07:10:18+00:00,The Brighter Side of News,Scientists convert household trash into jet fuel — cutting aviation emissions by up to 90%,"Joseph Shavit, Mac Oliveau",,,,,https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-convert-household-trash-into-jet-fuel-cutting-aviation-emissions-by-up-to-90/,"Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is already compatible with the jet fuel formulated today and in use across the globe, and it could reduce aviation emissions by over 65 percent through mid-century.
Converting this waste into jet fuel could help cities handle rising trash while giving airlines a cleaner energy supply.
In that scenario, we would have reduced the global amount of aviation emissions by about 16 percent in 2019.
The United States anticipates getting to 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year by 2030, and 35 billion gallons a year by 2050.
""Turning everyday waste into jet fuel could be an innovative but significant near-term step toward cleaner aviation,"" Zhang argues.","A walk through any busy airport makes it clear that flying remains a central part of modern life. Yet every plane that lifts off depends on fuel that adds to a warming climate. Aviation is responsible for roughly 2.5 percent of the world’s carbon emissions, and demand for air travel is expected to keep rising.

Unlike cars or buses, long flights cannot easily switch to batteries or hydrogen because they need far more energy. That reality has pushed scientists and policymakers to search for fuels that can power jets without heating the planet.

One possible option is gaining traction. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is already compatible with the jet fuel formulated today and in use across the globe, and it could reduce aviation emissions by over 65 percent through mid-century. However, SAF currently accounts for less than 1 percent of global jet fuel use due to high costs, tight supplies, and limited experience.

A recent article published in Nature Sustainability highlights an unexpected way forward. The researchers investigated a new source of low-carbon jet fuel, not from crops, cooking oil, or forestry waste, but from everyday municipal solid waste. The results provided a potential pathway to reducing waste and emissions that also alleviates the pressure on landfills.

Waste to Winged Flight

Municipal solid waste is the mix of food scraps, paper, plastics, metals, and other materials found in trash cans and on the curb each week (see image below). The considerable accumulation of waste is diverted to landfills nearing saturation or incinerators that must undergo costly pollution reduction procedures. Converting this waste into jet fuel could help cities handle rising trash while giving airlines a cleaner energy supply.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Program utilized real operational data from a commercial gasification facility and Fischer-Tropsch operation facility to further evaluate this concept at the industrial scale. Their study analyzed each part of the process from the waste collection point to the loading of the finished fuel product into the aircraft.

Trash is first sorted, crushed, dried, and shaped into pellets that combust more evenly. Gasification, gas cleaning, and reactor processes convert feedstock pellets into liquid hydrocarbons, which have been upgraded through further refining in order to meet jet fuel specifications.

With the full life-cycle evaluation, the biogenic fraction of municipal solid waste generated an intensity of emissions of 14.1 grams CO2 equivalent per MJ of fuel energy produced. Conventional jet fuel has an intensity of emissions in the range of 89 grams CO2 equivalent per MJ of fuel energy produced, indicative of at least an 84% emissions reduction that could be realized via waste-derived sustainable aviation fuel when all systems are operating properly.

Where Emissions Are Added or Reduced

Not all aspects of the system are the same. The most carbon-intensive step is the gas cleaning process, due in part to the water gas shift reaction that consumes carbon monoxide (CO) and produces CO2 as a product that is released (and not captured or used). Additionally, the drying process of shredding waste adds a large energy burden to the total emissions reduction assessment, as much of the waste in many countries has a high amount of moisture.

The most uncertain aspect of the overall gasification process is gasification performance. Municipal waste may contain varied sizes, moisture, or composition, making it difficult to gasify consistently. When the hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio drifts far from the preferred amounts for reactors, additional energy is needed to maintain the fuel output. Even modestly reducing the effective gas composition can result in life cycle emissions increasing by more than half and the amount of fuel yield being reduced by nearly one-third.

The energy source also matters. Running the system on clean power can reduce carbon emissions by more than 75 percent. The waste composition plays an additional role. Plastics can support improved gasification by increasing the overall heating value, but as a fossil-based material, they can nearly double life cycle emissions if not carefully managed.

Improvements can take place through sorting or shifting to lower-energy drying processes, like biodrying, to reduce the environmental impact of gasification. Such improvements are most beneficial when food waste makes up a large portion of the trash stream, making heating for drying more energy-intensive.

Closing the Carbon Loop

Even gasification, with very low carbon emissions, operates at only about 1/3 of the carbon in the waste to fuel output conversion. This is the case because the fuel gas coming from the waste does not match the preferred reactant or gas mixture the reactor wants.

Researchers looked at two alternatives. In one example, nearly pure carbon dioxide is extracted from the gasifier during the cleaning process. This carbon dioxide can be stored underground, resulting in a net negative carbon intensity for the system runs. However, this means that some of the carbon that could become fuel is locked below ground.

The carbon dioxide can also be reacted with “green” hydrogen as a way to produce fuel. This method, referred to as a power-to-liquid route, has the potential to elevate carbon conversion efficiencies above 60 percent; however, it requires substantial use of renewable hydrogen and energy.

An alternative method can also add renewable hydrogen directly into the gas mix rather than converting the carbon monoxide. This has already had preliminary trials in industrial processes. This process increases the carbon conversion amount by 1.5 times the amount of emissions, reducing the emissions to around 7 grams per megajoule.

Emissions could also potentially go down below 4 grams per megajoule with an excellent gasification process and lower energy drying methods. For example, with one ton of municipal waste, this could displace over 170 kg of carbon dioxide while using a fraction of the hydrogen required by the power-to-liquid processes.

Global Scale and Policy Momentum

Researchers have mapped the potential production of jet fuel from municipal waste worldwide under different assumptions. Under one scenario, reflecting current practices, the potential was up to 50 million tons of fuel per year. In that scenario, we would have reduced the global amount of aviation emissions by about 16 percent in 2019.

If you add renewable hydrogen to the conversion, the potential jet fuel is estimated to be 80 million tons per year, which would satisfy greater than 25 percent of the global demand for jet fuel and reduce annual emissions by way of avoiding around 270 million tons of carbon dioxide.

Different geographic regions are more suited than others. China is estimated to produce over 11 million tons of waste-derived SAF, representing the potential for roughly 30 percent of its jet fuel. The European Union, the United States, and India are anticipated to contribute around 5 million tons each. In those regions where food- and feed-based fuels are banned, such as Europe, some type of waste-derived fuel is likely to be necessary in order to meet long-term fuel blending regulations.

Governments are providing impetus to this industry now. The United States anticipates getting to 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year by 2030, and 35 billion gallons a year by 2050. European regulations require increasing SAF fractions to be implemented on all flights leaving EU airports starting at 2 percent next year. And, under the International Civil Aviation Organization framework, airlines are expected to offset growth in emissions, making waste-based SAF increasingly financially attractive as carbon prices increase.

Can Airlines Afford Waste-Derived Fuel?

Costs are still a factor. Initial commercial plants may produce waste-derived SAF at 0.89 to 1.70 dollars per liter. If plants ramp up production and improve technology, these costs may fall to between 0.60 and 1.08 dollars per liter. This is still above fossil jet fuel and almost consistent with current SAF prices for sale in today’s market.

The bulk of costs will be capital outlay. Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch units spend the most money for the total implementation. Any pretreatment adds to operating costs and significant investments as well. Even small charges for the waste itself could raise fuel prices quite a lot.

In the end, though, waste-derived SAF starts to become a better deal versus purchasing offsets under CORSIA prices around the year 2030. A more salient switch occurs in countries where offset prices rise quickly or public subsidies decrease the price of SAF production. In China, using waste-derived SAF instead of offsets from 2027 to 2035 could save over 2 billion dollars, and in the United States, the savings would be around 1 billion dollars. In high offset price scenarios, savings are even larger.

A New Way of Thinking About Flight

Flying will persist as part of everyday life, but the way the world powers those flights is beginning to change. While waste-derived SAF will never mitigate the entire climate impact of aviation, the thought that household garbage could help fuel global travel hints (at the very least) at a surprising new addition to both waste management and clean energy.

The sentiments of the study from Tsinghua University and Harvard University note that this pathway could significantly mitigate emissions through their findings, as long as the technology improves and policy persists and solidifies.

Jingran Zhang, the first author of the study, argues that the switch could occur quickly in time. ""Turning everyday waste into jet fuel could be an innovative but significant near-term step toward cleaner aviation,"" Zhang argues. Michael B. McElroy, a senior researcher at Harvard and co-author, stated that broad cooperation across government, airlines, and manufacturers would be required to make this efficient on a larger scale.

The plane that carries you across the world one day could, in part, run on the waste you left at the curb. At first thought, the idea is surprising, but the associated science suggests it could make a significant difference if the world chooses to invest in it.

Research findings are available online in the journal Nature Sustainability.

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry is projected to require 450 billion liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) annually by 2050 to meet net-zero carbon emissions targets. That’s a staggering increase from the mere 300 million liters produced in 2023. In my work with global aviation leaders, I’ve seen firsthand how this single statistic is reshaping everything from fleet planning to corporate strategy. We’re witnessing an industry at a critical inflection point, where the traditional paradigms of aviation are being completely reimagined. The current state reminds me of the early days of digital transformation I observed in other sectors – there’s both tremendous pressure and unprecedented opportunity. What fascinates me most is how quickly SAF has moved from a niche environmental initiative to a central business imperative that will define which airlines survive and thrive in the coming decades. The transformation ahead isn’t just about fuel; it’s about reinventing an entire global industry.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I see in my consulting work with aviation executives is the sheer scale of production required. As Deloitte research highlights, current SAF production meets less than 0.1% of global jet fuel demand, creating what I call the “scale-up dilemma.” This isn’t just about building more refineries; it’s about creating entirely new supply chains, securing sustainable feedstocks, and managing complex logistics. I recently advised a major European airline that had committed to 10% SAF usage by 2030, only to discover they would need to secure nearly their entire region’s projected SAF output to meet this target. The financial implications are equally daunting – McKinsey estimates that achieving aviation’s net-zero ambitions will require $175 billion in annual capital investment by 2050. What many leaders don’t realize is that this challenge extends far beyond their own organizations to encompass agricultural systems, energy infrastructure, and global trade patterns.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Gap

The second critical challenge is what industry experts call the “green premium.” Current SAF production costs are typically 2-4 times higher than conventional jet fuel, creating a massive competitive disadvantage for early adopters. In my experience working with airline CFOs, this isn’t just an accounting problem – it’s a fundamental business model challenge. As Harvard Business Review recently noted, “The economics of sustainable aviation remain the single greatest barrier to widespread adoption.” I’ve seen airlines struggle with how to absorb these costs without pricing themselves out of the market. The situation creates what I call the “first-mover disadvantage paradox” – where the companies taking the boldest steps toward sustainability face the greatest financial pressure. This challenge is particularly acute in emerging markets, where I’ve observed that price sensitivity among consumers makes cost recovery even more difficult.

Challenge 3: Regulatory and Certification Complexity

The third challenge that consistently emerges in my discussions with aviation leaders is the fragmented and evolving regulatory landscape. Different regions are implementing varying standards, incentives, and mandates for SAF adoption, creating a compliance nightmare for global airlines. According to World Economic Forum analysis, “The lack of harmonized global standards for SAF represents a significant barrier to efficient market development.” I’ve worked with airlines that operate across multiple jurisdictions, and the administrative burden alone is substantial. Certification processes for new SAF pathways can take years, delaying implementation and increasing costs. What many executives underestimate is how regulatory uncertainty impacts investment decisions throughout the value chain. From feedstock producers to fuel distributors, the absence of clear, stable policy frameworks creates hesitation that slows the entire ecosystem’s development.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many realize. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that are already showing promise.

First, advanced biofuel pathways using novel feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and even carbon captured from industrial processes are dramatically expanding production potential. Companies like LanzaJet are demonstrating that commercial-scale production is achievable today.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. By combining captured carbon with green hydrogen, these processes can create carbon-neutral fuels without agricultural constraints. As Accenture’s latest energy transition report notes, “Electrofuels could eventually supply up to 85% of aviation’s energy needs without land use concerns.”

Third, digital fuel management systems are optimizing SAF blending and distribution. I’ve seen airlines using AI-powered platforms to maximize the environmental impact of every liter of SAF while minimizing costs. These systems enable what I call “precision sustainability” – ensuring that limited SAF supplies are deployed where they create the greatest value.

Fourth, corporate sustainability programs are creating new funding models. Major corporations are increasingly purchasing SAF to decarbonize their business travel and supply chains, creating guaranteed demand that helps de-risk production investments. Microsoft’s recent multi-year SAF commitment demonstrates how corporate procurement can accelerate market development.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a picture of rapid transformation.

According to BloombergNEF projections, SAF production capacity will grow from less than 1 billion liters today to over 30 billion liters by 2030. By 2040, I predict we’ll see SAF account for at least 25% of aviation fuel consumption in developed markets. The financial implications are equally significant – PwC estimates the global SAF market will reach $15 billion annually by 2030 and could exceed $80 billion by 2050.

In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, we’ve explored several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate this transition. What if carbon taxes become universal, making conventional jet fuel increasingly expensive? What if synthetic biology breakthroughs enable cost-competitive SAF production from non-food biomass? What if major aircraft manufacturers mandate SAF compatibility for all new aircraft?

The technological breakthroughs I’m most excited about include bio-engineered microorganisms that efficiently convert CO2 to fuel, advanced catalytic processes that reduce production costs by 60% or more, and digital twins that optimize entire SAF value chains in real-time. By 2035, I expect we’ll see the first fully SAF-powered long-haul flights becoming routine.

The industry transformation timeline suggests that 2025-2030 will be the critical scaling period, 2030-2040 will see SAF become cost-competitive, and by 2040-2050, we’ll witness the emergence of entirely new aviation ecosystems built around sustainable energy sources.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, I believe we’ll witness the most dramatic transformation in aviation since the jet engine. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream commodity, fundamentally reshaping airline operations, aircraft design, and global energy markets. The airlines that thrive will be those that treat sustainability not as a compliance requirement but as a core competitive advantage. We’ll see new business models emerge, including SAF-as-a-service offerings and integrated mobility solutions. The risks remain substantial – particularly around feedstock availability and geopolitical factors – but the opportunities for innovation and value creation are even greater. The coming decade will separate the aviation leaders from the laggards, with SAF capability becoming the new differentiator in a carbon-constrained world.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of aviation isn’t just about reaching destinations faster or more comfortably – it’s about reaching them smarter and more sustainably. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The most sustainable mile is the one we never have to fly, but for the miles we must fly, let’s make them count toward a better future.” The transition to sustainable aviation represents one of the greatest innovation opportunities of our generation. It requires bold vision, collaborative spirit, and relentless execution. The question isn’t whether SAF will transform aviation, but how quickly and how wisely we’ll navigate this transformation together.

The levy will apply to passengers departing from Singapore starting October 1, 2026, for tickets sold from April 1, 2026, according to Travel + Leisure Asia.

Citing the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) via The Straits Times, passengers will be charged between 1 and 41.60 Singapore dollars, approximately Rp13,000 to Rp535,000, depending on cabin class and flight distance. For short-haul routes within Southeast Asia, economy passengers will pay S$1 (Rp13,000).

For medium-haul destinations such as East Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea, the levy ranges from S$2.80 (Rp36,000) for economy to S$11.20 (Rp144,000) for premium cabins.

Flights to Africa, West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific will incur charges of S$2.80 (Rp36,000) for economy and S$25.60 (Rp329,000) for premium seats.

The highest fees apply to flights to the Americas: S$10.40 (Rp134,000) for economy and S$41.60 (Rp535,000) for business and first class.

CAAS noted that premium cabins and long-haul flights face higher levies due to greater fuel consumption. The levy will not apply to transit passengers, training flights, or humanitarian operations.

Emission Reduction Targets and Funding Mechanism

Revenue from the SAF levy will be used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel through a newly established company, Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage SAF procurement for Singapore’s airport hubs.

The initiative supports Singapore’s goal of having SAF account for 1 percent of total jet fuel consumption at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3-5 percent by 2030. Updated price estimates for SAF have also allowed the government to set the levy lower than initially projected.

Inclusion of Cargo and Private Jet Flights

The SAF levy will also apply to cargo operations, calculated based on shipment weight and distance. For private jets and charter flights, the charges will be determined by aircraft wingspan and flight distance, following the same distance-band categories used for commercial flights.

This policy forms part of Singapore’s long-term roadmap to achieve net-zero emissions in both domestic and international aviation by 2050.

SAF, which is produced from used cooking oil, municipal waste, and captured carbon, is considered the most viable near-term solution for reducing aviation emissions without requiring major changes to existing aircraft technology.

Airlines are burning vast quantities of fuel before they ever leave the ground. For an industry locked in arguments over sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen and long-term aircraft programmes, electric taxiing might quietly be the fastest way to cut emissions this decade.

The hidden emissions problem: Why taxiing is aviation’s blind spot

Taxiing has long been treated as an operational footnote rather than a climate problem. Yet multiple studies suggest it is anything but marginal.

Speaking on the sidelines of the World Aviation Festival, David Valaer, CEO of Green Taxi, explained to AGN why this is such a problem.

“We did a detailed analysis with Cirium, which shows that 7% to 20% of the fuel for the whole flight is burned on the ground,” he said.

That tallies with broader research. An OAG analysis found that anywhere between 2% and 17% of total fuel burn can be consumed in taxi out and taxi in, with the highest shares on the shortest sectors.

Consultancy Roland Berger goes further, estimating that around 10–15% of aviation’s CO₂ emissions are attributable to airport platforms, including taxiing, ground handling and auxiliary power.

And a 2022 academic study notes that taxi phases run at low thrust settings where combustion is comparatively inefficient, producing disproportionately high local emissions around airports.

Against that backdrop, Green Taxi’s focus on ground operations does not look like tinkering at the edges. It looks like a direct shot at a double-digit share of the sector’s emissions.

How electric taxiing works, and why it is suddenly viable

Green Taxi’s system avoids batteries altogether. Instead, it uses the aircraft’s existing auxiliary power unit (APU) to drive an electric motor on the main landing gear.

“We take the three-phase, 400 hertz power from the APU,” the CEO explains. “That comes forward to our motor controller, called an inverter. And then that provides the speed control for [an] axial flow permanent magnet motor that’s mounted on the main landing gear.”

The design uses a single main gear leg to save weight, and targets a certified maximum taxi speed of 25 knots, with a steady state of around 16 knots determined by APU power limits. Crucially, the main engines stay off throughout taxi, cutting both fuel burn and local noise.

Safran, L-3 and Honeywell demonstrated an electric aircraft taxi system on an A320 in 2012, proving the concept but never bringing it to market. The stumbling block was mass and packaging.

“Safran’s system in 2012, their motor electronics were on a pallet. It weighed 500 pounds,” Valaer recalls.

The difference today is the maturity of high-performance electric drive tech, much of it inherited from motorsport.

“With all the billions of dollars in hybrid vehicle technology, our motor inverter is 30 pounds and is one foot by one foot,” David says. “Motor technology has rapidly advanced, and our technology is benefiting.”

The emissions and fuel-saving potential: What airlines could gain

The economics are what turned Delta from a curious observer into an active partner. Green Taxi has been working with the airline’s Sustainable Skies Lab to model the impact of its Zero Engine Taxi™ on a typical regional jet operation.

“Their average taxi out time is 18 minutes,” the CEO says. “You put all that together with the ground fuel flow, and you come up with about 100,000 gallons of fuel per year per aircraft.”

He does not soften the point: “That’s a hell of a lot.” In financial terms, “It’s equivalent to around $300,000 of fuel savings” per aircraft per year, he continues, “and it’s equivalent to around 250 cars of CO₂ for the whole year.”

He offers a provocative comparison: “If you electrify the whole airport, you would not save as much as one aircraft taxi for one year.”

In other words, focusing on aircraft ground emissions may move the needle far more than cleaning up ground support equipment alone.

There is, of course, a weight penalty. Green Taxi expects the system to come in at around 300 lbs. But the company has modelled this carefully.

“Carrying that extra mass is going to use about 8,000 gallons of fuel each year,” he explains. “That’s around 8% of the 100,000 gallons we’re going to be saving that aircraft.”

He argues that once airlines trust the system, they can simply offload that fuel. “We’re going to save them 400 pounds of fuel for burn,” he says, making the net weight effect close to zero once flight planning adapts.

Why electric taxiing could outpace SAF in the short term

The timing matters. SAF is central to every net-zero roadmap, but the volumes are not there yet. According to IATA and other recent analyses, SAF represented only around 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, and even with rapid growth, is expected to reach just 0.7% of airline fuel consumption in 2025.

Individual airlines frequently report SAF costing two to three times more than conventional jet fuel.

By contrast, Green Taxi’s system bolts onto existing aircraft. “Our system will be a two-day installation time,” the CEO says, carried out during scheduled B or C checks lasting 8–20 days. “This is not invasive. This will not take them away from their operation.”

Critically, it is non-flight-critical. “If, for some reason the system doesn’t work, you can still fly the aeroplane normally,” he says. In that case, crews revert to standard single-engine or two-engine taxi, with no hit to dispatch reliability.

That combination of retrofit speed, operational simplicity and high fuel savings is why he calls electric taxiing “the lowest hanging fruit that you can find for emissions and fuel reduction” over the next decade, while airlines wait for SAF, hydrogen and full-electric aircraft to scale.

Airline operations: what changes and what stays the same?

The cockpit changes are deliberately modest. Green Taxi has been working with Delta, SkyWest and others to ensure pilot flows are intuitive and that the system respects union and safety sensitivities.

Some ideas that crop up repeatedly in industry debates will not fly.

“Other people said, well, put reverse cameras on this,” he notes, to allow aircraft to back themselves off stands. “It’s never going to be embraced by the industry because the pilot union is not going to let the pilot back up an aeroplane and be responsible for crunching the tail. There’s always going to be wing-walkers.”

Likewise, the notion of pre-spinning wheels before landing to reduce tyre wear is a non-starter. “Everyone’s thought of that,” he says. “It’s a great theory.” But adding a motor that has to instantly spin up to touchdown speed introduces more problems than it solves.

Maintenance integration is also being designed to fit neatly into existing cycles. On one airline’s Embraer fleet, for example, tyres are replaced every 400 cycles. The company plans to swap the sprocket on the driven wheel at the same interval, treating it as a normal wear part.

The fleet-scale impact: How electric taxiing reshapes airline fuel and emissions

If the per-aircraft numbers hold, the aggregate impact is hard to ignore. A 100-strong regional fleet could theoretically save 10 million gallons of fuel per year. For a major carrier with several hundred suitable aircraft, the savings quickly reach into the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars annually, alongside a measurable cut in both global and local emissions.

Industry bodies estimate aviation accounts for roughly 2.5–3% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions today.

Within that, airport ground operations are a small but fast-actionable slice. With SAF still representing less than 1% of fuel use worldwide, there is a growing recognition that “boring” efficiency measures will have to do more of the heavy lifting in the 2025–2035 window.

The path to certification: When electric aircraft taxiing could enter service

Technical promise is one thing, certification another.

“We touch the APU, we touch the landing gear, we touch the pilot control system,” the CEO says. “It’s a very complicated project,” involving around 10 designated engineering representatives across structures, electrical, software and flight operations.

Green Taxi plans to certify the system first for the Embraer E170/175 family, where high daily utilisation and short sectors produce strong economics. CRJs, 737s, A220s and A320-family aircraft are all on the long-term target list, with forward-fit options for OEMs also in play.

The company is currently finalising its certification plan with the FAA. The aim is to have a conforming prototype ready for tests in the second half of this decade, with a supplemental type certificate to follow.

If it all comes together, airlines may one day look back and wonder why it took so long to turn off the engines on the ground.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_372820207-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 21:56:10.250487

Synhelion has now delivered its first solar aviation fuel to SWISS World’s first solar jet fuel plant inaugurated by Synhelion","Collaborating with Synhelion engineers, a solar research team at the Solar-Institute Jülich (SIJ) of FH Aachen presented two papers at SolarPACES 2025 assessing the accuracy and reliability of dynamic process models for a solar fuel production system. They used operating data from Synhelion’s DAWN pilot plant.

In Synhelion’s solar fuel plant, DAWN, concentrated solar power drives endothermic chemical reactions to convert biogenic methane, carbon dioxide, and steam into synthesis gas (syngas), which can then be processed into liquid hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene for aviation or gasoline.

Because the methane and carbon is derived from bio-waste rather than fossil fuels, and heat is generated from concentrated solar heat instead of burning fossil fuels, Synhelion is pioneering a sustainable drop-in replacement for today’s liquid fuels.

Synhelion’s DAWN pilot plant in Jülich (which can be toured at the next SolarPACES conference in the Fall of 2026) uses RED-certified sustainable biogenic waste as the methane and carbon source and has demonstrated the complete production chain under real solar operation conditions.

Synhelion’s solar-absorbing gas receiver is a unique design that is capable of extremely efficient conversion of solar irradiance from the heliostats to temperatures as high as 1500°C.

How can Synhelion’s solar receiver achieve such high temperatures?

Speed matters for real-time simulation

Now that Synhelion is beginning its first commercial production of solar fuels, plant operators will need to adapt to changing information in real time. Traditional physics-based models can be fast, but that usually comes at the cost of lower accuracy. So the team took a new approach.

“We needed a system where we can offer simulation results in real time to aid the operators who run the plant and make the decisions,” explained lead author Falko Schneider in a call from SIJ in Germany.

“For example, when to switch operation modes, what kind of mass flows or compositions of the reactants to set. To achieve this, we need models that can deliver both high accuracy and high computational speed. You can also use the process model offline to test potential operating and control strategies, of course, where speed doesn’t matter as much. The physics-based model takes a bit longer, but still, it’s very fast. It’s not like it needs days to simulate a week of operation.

The studies are to validate physics-based and machine-learning-based models for simulating DAWN’s solar fuel plant operation. The idea is to replace the more computationally expensive physics-based simulations with machine-learning models and validating an efficient alternative. The team first created a machine-learning model of the thermal energy storage with synthetic data from the physics-based model and successfully validated it.

In the overall system study, Validation of a Dynamic Process Model of a Thermochemical System for Solar Fuel Production, all three key components are validated against real-time operation. The key components are the solar receiver, the reforming reactor where the thermochemistry happens, and the thermal energy storage, which is crucial in solar fuels production, as the thermochemistry must operate continuously.

Synhelion’s high-temperature solid thermal energy storage system uses ceramic refractory bricks with internal channels to carry the heat transfer fluid.

The thermal energy storage had the most comprehensive study

The second study, A Validated Machine Learning Approach to Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Simulation Using Synthetic Data, focused on this component, the thermal energy storage. Of the three aspects studied, the thermal storage was most fully modeled.

The thermal energy storage model successfully reproduced charge-discharge transients over 8 cycles across 10 days, achieving errors of less than 3% of the temperature swing in the upper storage layers, although deviations increased toward the bottom due to potential material property variations and mass flow measurement uncertainties.

The team’s surrogate model yielded results in milliseconds on the synthetic validation data, compared with on average over five seconds for a physics-based model—making it roughly 100 to 1000 times faster. On operational validiation data from DAWN, it is even up to 50.000 times faster. Its run times were also much more consistent, allowing the system to run many simulations very quickly, making it practical for optimization tasks or real-time control.

Since solar flux onto the receiver wasn’t directly measured during operation, the researchers developed a simplified data-driven surrogate solar field model using a 4th-degree polynomial with ridge regression.

“We used experimental data as input and compared the output to the experimental data,” Falko explained. “ The coupled surrogate-receiver simulation achieved outlet gas temperatures of approximately 1000°C, showing good agreement with experimental data, although it slightly overestimated temperatures due to a minor systematic bias in the surrogate model. And since then, the receiver has been operated at output temperatures of over 1200°C.

The model validation for the reforming reactor revealed major discrepancies, though. Especially under partial-load conditions, the model overestimated the reaction rate and heat consumption, with residual methane present, contrary to equilibrium predictions, and lower CO₂ conversion than expected.

“We still have some work to do there,” Schneider noted.

“Usually you have these physical models, and then you fit them with operational data. There are components that work very well, right out of the box, without a fitting. The thermal storage model worked quite well already without any fitting. But regarding the chemistry, we need to do some more work. We assumed that a thermochemical equilibrium had been reached within the reactor. That was the statement we got from an industrial manufacturer. However, in the end, it did not align with reality, probably due to the relatively small reactor size.”

So the team needed to implement some kinetics:

“For example, we could implement some factors that allow us to say, ‘Okay, depending on how fast the reactants flow through the catalyst, it will get that close to a thermal chemical equilibrium.’ If it reaches or not, or how close it gets, and what the composition would look like are factors that can be fitted with operational data from DAWN. So this is about the reactor kinetics,” he said.

Work continues on the solar receiver and the reforming reactor

“For the solar receiver, the problem is that we do not have the operational measurements of the concentrated flux hitting it,” he said. “So we are missing an input variable, and we don’t have a detailed model of the heliostat field because a lot of factors go into this. You usually use ray tracing tools to create these kind of models which are not applicable in the process model. So I created this approximation of the heliostat field model, and used that to validate the receiver model. That’s not a strict validation, but at least it’s a successful plausibility check.”

And the reforming reactor model still needs major improvements. It may be necessary to replace the current equilibrium method with a kinetic model or utilize effectiveness factors to more accurately capture how the system behaves under partial loads. However, both provide a solid base for building a digital twin of the solar fuel process.

“Since we are already creating some component models based on machine-learning, we are checking as well if this would be suitable to accurately reproduce the chemistry,” Scheider pointed out.

“This was a publicly funded project between Synhelion, SIJ and Germany’s Institute of Future Fuels at DLR as partners, within which DAWN was built. DLR also created a small lab setup to evaluate different kinds of catalysts. They developed more detailed chemical models with that data. So we are working with them to see whether we can implement it in our model.”

The team’s machine-learning models have been developed within the TwinSF project in the EU, which combines tested physical models with data-driven approaches to help guide operations in alternative fuel production plants using concentrated solar energy to produce sustainable fuels.

The long-term goal is to develop a functioning digital twin that enables real-time plant monitoring, predictive control, and virtual testing of control strategies before they get implemented on an actual solar fuels plant’s system.

The humid weather and air conditioning are blowing hot and cold, depending on which corner of the venue you are in, which one delegate quipped was “a bit like the carbon markets” at the moment. Nature and carbon are firmly on Friday’s agenda across side events at the summit, and negotiators on Article 6 were also said to have enjoyed calmer talks on Thursday, though after a new text on crediting Paris projects landed overnight, it now seems reopening adopted work on the new crediting mechanism may be back on the table at the conference.

Timestamps are in local time (GMT-3).

0800 – New texts, new drama: But just when parties were saying they did not intend to create fresh drama at COP30 on Article 6, a new text concerning the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM) dropped. Heavily bracketed, containing provisions around an extended transition of Kyoto-era projects to the new Article 6.4 system, and a proposed extension of current Supervisory Body members’ term limits, one observers said it was “looking really bad”, with some of provisions in the text calling for adopted standards on the PACM, such as on baselines and additionality to possibly to be tweaked. Carbon Pulse will look to analyse in full and publish an update later on Friday.

0900 – You shall not pass: A peaceful protest by Indigenous groups blocked the main entrance to COP30 this morning, with demonstrators calling for a meeting with President Lula and highlighting that major projects – including those related to soy, waterways, and carbon markets – are moving ahead without their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). Delegates were redirected to a side entrance, with officials stressing there was no security risk. Commenting from the scene, Cool Earth’s Natalie Klepacova said the action reflected longstanding exclusion and broken promises, adding that Indigenous peoples are rights-holders and frontline defenders whose voices must be central to climate decision-making.

1000 – To Tulio, with love: Building on the Brazilian presidency’s description of negotiations as therapy sessions, where parties should feel encouraged to share their true feelings in a safe space, Brazil’s top COP strategist Tulio Andrade asked delegates on Thursday to send him private “love letters” expressing how they felt the conversations were proceeding – and encouraging those that hadn’t to write soon, according to one negotiator in the room. The presidency extended talks on the four main issues – around the ambition gap, trade, finance, and reporting on progress – until another plenary on Saturday. The plenary is likely to be in the morning, to give the SB chairs time to take stock of talks, but not set yet.

1000 – Whitehouse in the house: US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is arriving in Belem as the sole representative of the US federal government. The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee plans to participate in discussions on Friday on the future of offshore wind, clean shipping, and non-CO2 GHG emissions and hold meetings with international leaders and the private sector.

1030 – Total investment: French oil and gas major TotalEnergies is putting $100 mln into a fund that backs technologies to cut emissions from the oil and gas value chain. Climate Investment’s venture strategy fund has had a portfolio impact of 133 MtCO2e since 2019, particularly in the detection and abatement of methane, carbon capture, and energy efficiency, TotalEnergies said. Climate Investment was launched in 2015 by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, of which Total is a member.

1130 – Document development: The Mexican state of Jalisco has submitted its registration document to J-REDD+ standard ART TREES. The document will now undergo a completeness check, and if accepted, will be posted for a public comment period.

1200 – Virtual hugs from US Democrats: US Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) joined the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition as the former Speaker of the House to critique the absence of the Trump administration from the international climate negotiations. Pelosi and other members had planned to attend in Belem but were delayed by the federal shutdown, which ended on Thursday. The House Democrats reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement.

1330 – Utility upgrades: Utilities around the world plan to up their annual investment in the energy transition to $148 bln per year, from $117 bln, IRENA announced on Friday. The plan, by the members of the Utilities for Net Zero Alliance, will see the companies mobilise over $1 trillion towards the energy investment up to 2030, since the group was established in 2023. Investments will go towards power grids and networks, including $1.24 spent on grids and storage for every $1 spent on renewable generation. It also includes delivering tends of thousands of kilometres of new and upgraded grid infrastructure.

1430 – France and Italy’s red carpet for fossil fuels: While European Commissioner Hoekstra kept his promise and did not bring fossil fuel lobbyists to COP30 as part of his entourage, France and Italy didn’t get the memo, according to NGO Friends of the Earth. Research by Fossil Free Politics shows that France, Sweden and Italy had the largest EU fossil fuel delegations out of the other 27 member states. France brought along five TotalEnergies lobbyists, including CEO Patrick Pouyanne, and sizeable delegations from EDF and ENGIE, for a total of 22 lobbyists. Italy brought along 12 lobbyists, and Sweden 18. In total nine EU governments brought 84 fossil fuel lobbyists into COP30 on their official government delegations, out of the 1600 fossil fuel lobbyists present at Belem’s conference.

1430 – Badgering the State Department: US Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) told reporters in Belem that federal representatives of the US are missing from the international conference as much due to the federal shutdown, as due to complicated logistics. Without the cooperation of the US State Department, the senator said it has been challenging to access the Blue Zone at COP30. In previous years, Whitehouse and other member of Congress have asked the State Department for “party overflow” badges to the US delegation. The State Department denied the request, according to a Whitehouse staffer, as the country had not applied to attend, leaving Whitehouse and others to scramble for spare “observer” badges through NGOs. Whitehouse is attending as an observer with international association Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment (GLOBE).

1530 – Concrete jungle: C40 Cities urged on Friday national governments at COP30 to advance a credible global plan to end dependence on fossil fuels, echoing Brazil’s call and responding to climate impacts already hitting cities. Building on COP28 commitments to transition away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, and double energy efficiency by 2030, mayors stressed the need to turn ambition into concrete action through a just and equitable phaseout supported by stronger local-national collaboration. C40 cities have pledged to halve fossil fuel use by 2030, with the highest-emitting countries moving fastest. They are already cutting emissions five times faster than national targets, demonstrating that a fossil-free future is achievable.

1630 – Plans for action: New action plans for the African Union, Caribbean, Chile, Colombia and Mozambique, under the Global Clean Power Alliance (GCPA), have been published on Friday on the UK government website. They aim to identify priority needs and outline targeted support for clean energy transitions, in the countries, including transmission infrastructure and project readiness. These demand-led plans guide collaboration with local partners, the UK government, which co-launched the GCPA, said. Complementing them is a private-finance-endorsed High-Quality Energy Investment Planning Roadmap, designed to help countries mobilise private capital at scale and accelerate global clean energy deployment. At COP30, the UK and Brazil also unveiled new deliverables for the GCPA finance mission, backed by a broad coalition of NGOs, private investors, international organisations, MDBs and other partners committed to advancing energy transitions in developing economies. The alliance was first launched at the G20 Summit in Nov. 2024 by the UK and Brazil, with an initial mission to scale clean energy finance.

1700 – Cheaper SAF agreement – Latin American Airline Abra Group and Japanese company Sumitomo Corporation announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to scale up sustainable aviation fuel. Abra, which owns companies like Brazilian Gol Linhas Aereas, and Sumitomo will establish a Brazil-Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement to ensure supply of SAF between Abra and Sumitomo. Brazil wants to become a leading global SAF producer via the production of ethanol and biodiesel.

1730 – I want to live by Common Principles: The 10 multilateral development banks in the MDB Nature Working Group have launched an update to the Common Principles for Tracking Nature Finance, which were first released in 2023. They were created in response to the 2021 MDB Joint Statement on Nature, People and Planet, which highlighted the deep connections between poverty reduction, climate action and addressing the drivers of nature loss. The new Joint Statement, published Friday, committed MDBs to embedding nature more fully across their policies, analyses, advice, investments and operations. It also pledged to scale up nature-positive finance and to create stronger methods for tracking such investments across MDB portfolios.

1800 – Big figs: A new Oxford Smith School report shows that a rapid shift to renewables could double energy-sector productivity in low- and middle-income countries within 25 years, delivering GDP gains of around 10% by mid-century. Solar-rich nations such as Burundi, DR Congo, and Mozambique could see particularly strong economic benefits, the researchers said. Renewables raise productivity by generating more electricity per dollar invested and by providing cheaper power, allowing households and industries to operate longer at lower cost. The study found these gains are greatest in the Global South and could help narrow global income disparities. It also shows renewable investment has already boosted GDP in developing countries far more than fossil fuels, adding $1.2 trillion between 2017 and 2022. In Brazil alone, renewables contributed $128 billion. However, the authors stressed that communities benefit only when intentional mechanisms – such as local ownership and community funds – are in place. They also highlighted the importance of distributed renewables to expand access and ensure an inclusive transition.

1800 – BB carbon desk: Banco do Brasil (BB) formally launched its carbon credit desk on Friday, becoming the first Brazilian bank to do so. The bank’s carbon business will rely on three prongs: project origination, commercialisation of credits, and decarbonisation advisory. Currently, BB already has more than 30 projects under development, with the capacity to generate up to 3 mln carbon credits per year, it said.

LanzaJet, the alternative fuels technology company that is marked as a significant player, has achieved a major breakthrough in Soperton, Georgia, which can be regarded as a monumental step for the aviation industry. The firm has made history by being the first-ever to produce jet fuel out of ethanol at the scale of a commercial operation. This new method is not simply a technical success but rather a major leap that will greatly affect the use of eco-friendly travel in the future.

A New Era for Aviation Fuel in Georgia

LanzaJet’s new facility in Georgia, known as LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels, marks the first-ever commercial production of jet fuel derived from ethanol. This facility, strategically located in Treutlen County, has successfully achieved ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) certification for on-spec jet fuel. The plant’s operations have now reached full capacity, positioning LanzaJet at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

This development has been years in the making. After 15 years of research, development, and collaboration, LanzaJet’s ethanol-to-jet (ATJ) technology is now fully operational, offering the aviation industry a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based jet fuels. With the aviation sector under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, this new fuel offers a viable, eco-friendly solution.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet Technology

LanzaJet’s innovative Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology is a game-changer for sustainable aviation. Unlike traditional fossil fuels, which rely on limited oil reserves, LanzaJet’s fuel is derived from widely available ethanol feedstocks. These feedstocks can come from a range of sources, including agricultural residues and recycled carbon from waste. The versatility of this technology means that nations worldwide can tap into their local agricultural resources to produce jet fuel, promoting energy security and reducing reliance on imported fuels.

By using ethanol as a feedstock, LanzaJet’s fuel solution offers substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions over traditional jet fuel. When blended with conventional Jet A-1 fuel, it creates a fully certified sustainable aviation fuel that is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. This means airlines can start using this cleaner fuel without making costly adjustments to their fleets or operations, further enhancing its appeal.

Impact on Travel and Tourism

This breakthrough will undoubtedly influence the future of air travel. As the aviation industry grapples with its carbon emissions, sustainable aviation fuels like those produced by LanzaJet offer a promising pathway towards more eco-conscious travel. With the aviation industry contributing a significant portion of global CO2 emissions, LanzaJet’s innovation could help reduce the environmental impact of air travel, making it more sustainable for future generations.

For the tourism industry, this means a future where travellers can feel better about the environmental impact of their flights. As more airlines adopt SAF, air travel will become greener, supporting tourism in a more sustainable way. This could encourage eco-minded travellers to choose more environmentally friendly options and contribute to the overall sustainability of the tourism sector.

Georgia’s Role in Leading the Way

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility is a model for future sustainable aviation fuel production worldwide. With the plant’s successful integration of cutting-edge technologies, it sets a blueprint for other regions to follow suit. This project also highlights the growing importance of regional investments in sustainable technologies and infrastructure, boosting local economies and creating new job opportunities.

Illinois’ investment comes at a time of increasing climate vulnerability across the United States and the globe.
Illinois is a critical contributor to the efforts of biofuel production.
Currently, soy and corn crops are major contributors to the input of biofuel production.
The SAF project poses a major challenge to the health of Illinois soil, indirectly encouraging monoculture cultivation.","Since Dec. 3, 1818, the sun has set and risen across the state of Illinois. From the urban center of Chicago, to the agricultural cores of Peoria, Champaign and Decatur, to the fields of the southern counties, generations have seen the same sun mark the passing of every day.

Today, Illinois no longer shares the same mark of a new day. In the north, the day ends with the light of opportunity. In the south, the sun sets into the darkness of poverty.

In 2025, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced a joint collaborative investment with Avina Clean Hydrogen Inc. to develop a $820 million biofuel aviation fueling plant in southwestern Illinois. Both parties announced the investment in huge advancements to promote clean energy economies and lead a national industry.

Illinois’ investment comes at a time of increasing climate vulnerability across the United States and the globe. As calls for environmental stability and justice increase, calls for change arise across the U.S.

What is critical about the investment is the location: the agricultural heart of Illinois, home to acres of farmland, the national leader of soy crops and a dominant producer of field corn. Illinois is a critical contributor to the efforts of biofuel production. Yet Pritzker’s policy lacks long-term solvency to protect the true heart of Illinois: our farmers.

The issue with the investment in the sustainable aviation fuel plant, in its simplest form, exists within the goals of the Pritzker administration and actions for environmental sustainability. Nowhere have the interests and environmental justice of Illinois communities been attempted to be protected.

In the status quo, Illinois is home to over 71,000 farms — over 95% of them being family operated. Even when disregarding the scale of operations, family farms are crucial in preserving local ecosystem health. Family farms use less intensive farming practices, leading to less nutrient and soil degradation.

The importance of soil health extends far beyond simply growing crops; a healthy soil holds more organic carbon. When we boost soil health, we reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through carbon being held in the soil, strengthening photosynthesis alongside increased water retention and soil nutrients.

Currently, soy and corn crops are major contributors to the input of biofuel production. When investment in biofuels expands, more operations are going to grow soy — due to easier management and lower production costs — in larger quantities to maximize profits. The issue with this is that when soy is grown more frequently, Soil Organic Carbon decreases, causing soil health to decline and emissions to rise.

The SAF project poses a major challenge to the health of Illinois soil, indirectly encouraging monoculture cultivation. This is critical as operations attempt to invest in a growing industry, projected to be worth $257.61 billion by 2034.

Solvency in the long term is limited for Illinois farmers due to distance decay. One of the premises of the project is entirely designed to benefit large-scale corn and soy monopolies over Illinois farmers, through the dominance of agricultural monopolies and their control of the entire supply chain.

What we see here is a shifted reliance on monopolies to meet higher demands for corn and soy through higher production methods, streamlined through unsustainable and soil-degrading cultivation.

Even if we argue that Illinois farms will be able to keep up with production demands and not be outcompeted by large-scale operations, they will still be placed at an economic disadvantage. As the distance from the market increases, the interaction between the two places decreases, due to local operations remaining more cost-efficient to run.

As infrastructure increases in southwest Illinois, to maximize profit and minimize costs, large operations inherently want to be near the plant. Large-scale operations are further outcompeting Illinois farmers through control of the supply chain and placing localized pressure.

To acknowledge the impacts of wide-scale climate change, the transportation sector is a heavy producer of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the only impacts you see from the Avina plant are the depreciation of Illinoisans’ livelihoods and the sustainability of poverty, not the climate.

One critical factor is true: the biofuel plant is for aviation, a factor that does not justify the impacts on local communities. Major airports are marginal within southern Illinois, making the positive benefits of aviation biofuels not relevant to southern Illinois, nor would they justify the lack of protective policy.

I am not saying that we should avoid investment in clean energy because it has no direct impact on Illinois. We should avoid investments that exacerbate existing inequalities placed on rural constituents, paired with no direct benefits for the community.

Holding Pritzker at his highest ground, you see job growth of roughly 150 permanent positions, critical in any rural economy, temporary or long-term. What you also see is that the lack of skill sets needed for working in the biofuel sector is not transferred over from local rural populations, but instead outsourced to people outside of rural communities.

This is essential as the soy industry is already facing pressures amid the Trump administration tariffs and China’s boycott. Investing in a facility with no protections for rural Illinoisans whose very livelihoods rely on the next harvest exposes them to unemployment and poverty.

What I am not doing is disagreeing with Pritzker’s policy and the SAF project’s long-term goals. I am, however, disagreeing with the implementation and the decimation of the backbone of the State of Illinois: multi-generational family farms.

While sustainability, energy and fuel investment are essential for our state and nation in the long term, the SAF project, today, does not provide the change that all can benefit from.

To encourage proper sustainability, Pritzker needs to change his priorities from profit to his people. Constituents who are further isolated from opportunity to advance the goals of wealthy agricultural conglomerates.

For once, the emphasis of environmental action and justice needs to prioritize the sustainability of our current generation, not the future. To create true change and solvency, our farmers need to be protected rather than threatened.

The group has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sumitomo Corporation do Brasil, a key subsidiary of Japan’s global trading giant Sumitomo Corporation, to accelerate the creation and deployment of industry-ready decarbonization solutions for aviation.

The agreement marks a strategic alliance between two regions with increasingly aligned climate ambitions. It also signals a new phase in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Brazil, a country widely regarded as one of the world’s most capable future producers.

A Partnership Designed to Fast-Track Emissions Reductions

The MoU establishes a joint framework for Abra – represented in Brazil through Gol Linhas Aéreas – and Sumitomo to coordinate deeply with government bodies, regulators and private-sector stakeholders in both Brazil and Japan. Their primary goal is to advance the implementation of a Brazil–Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), developed under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement.

The JCM is a bilateral carbon-offset system introduced by Japan in 2011 to support low-carbon projects in developing regions. In exchange, Japan receives a portion of the generated emission-reduction credits, helping the country meet its domestic climate targets while accelerating climate-positive investments abroad.

For Abra and Sumitomo, establishing the JCM in Brazil represents the essential step toward enabling a long-term offtake agreement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. By aligning both nations’ climate policy frameworks, the two companies aim to remove one of the most significant barriers to SAF expansion: the need for reliable long-term financing and guaranteed market demand.

Meeting Soaring Global Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry is entering a crucial era. Global demand for SAF is projected to reach nearly 400 million tons by 2050, driven by international decarbonization commitments, emerging regulatory pressure and the aviation sector’s urgent need to reduce its footprint.

Developed economies with minimal access to feedstock – including Japan, Singapore and several European nations – are already bracing for severe supply constraints. SAF production requires large quantities of biomass or renewable feed materials, making resource-rich countries like Brazil pivotal to the global energy transition.

Brazil has long been recognized as an agricultural and biofuel leader, with decades of experience in ethanol, biodiesel and renewable energy technologies. This positions the country uniquely well to become a central hub for SAF production. Yet, despite having the natural and industrial advantages, large-scale SAF development faces persistent financial challenges. High production costs, investment risks, and the need to preserve affordable domestic air travel for Brazilian consumers remain critical concerns.

The introduction of the Brazil–Japan JCM could provide the missing bridge. The framework would unlock new financial flows, lower market-entry risks for producers and create a stable foundation for long-term SAF supply agreements. Airlines in both countries would benefit, while Brazil would expand a new renewable-energy export market without compromising its domestic aviation accessibility.

Mutual Gains for Governments, Producers and Passengers

The Abra–Sumitomo collaboration generates unique benefits for both countries. Japan gains access to competitively priced SAF sourced from a reliable partner with vast renewable potential. Brazil secures investment, technology and market guarantees that support local producers and job creation, while reinforcing its leadership role in the global renewable-energy landscape.

Brazilian airlines, including Gol, stand to benefit from increased SAF availability within their domestic market—an essential advantage as global regulations tighten and consumer pressure for sustainable travel intensifies. Passengers across both nations ultimately gain from a cleaner, more responsible aviation ecosystem with long-term safeguards for affordability and operational continuity.

Strengthening Latin America’s Sustainability Voice Ahead of COP30

The signing of this MoU comes at a critical moment. With the world turning its attention to Latin America as Brazil prepares to host COP30, sustainability partnerships of this scale signal the region’s growing influence in shaping global climate solutions.

For Abra Group, the agreement reinforces its commitment to responsible aviation policies that safeguard connectivity, economic opportunity, environmental responsibility and social progress across Latin America. By championing innovation and aligning with global partners, the group aims not only to transform its own operations but also to set a benchmark for regional and international airlines.

As the aviation sector moves into a defining decade, the Abra–Sumitomo partnership stands out as a forward-looking blueprint for cross-border cooperation, climate-aligned investment and large-scale deployment of sustainable aviation technologies. Through collaboration, innovation and strategic policy alignment, the two organizations are helping shape a future where growth in air travel can coexist with meaningful climate action.

Maria Del Mar Whittaker, Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, Abra Group, said: “At a time

Andrew Clarke, CEng, Applications Engineer — Sealing Systems, Greene Tweed

What are the differences in various types of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and how do these variants affect common elastomers?

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are renewable alternatives to traditional jet fuels, intended to reduce carbon emissions. SAFs are produced from a variety of renewable feedstocks, including biomass, algae, animal fats, vegetable oils, and agricultural residues like corn stalks. The ASTM D7566 standard outlines eight approved SAF pathways, enabling the production of sustainable fuels tailored to both environmental goals and fuel performance requirements.

Within SAF, there are different formulations, including Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK) and Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK). These variants differ primarily in their aromatic content [benzene (ring) hydrocarbons], which plays a vital role in determining their compatibility with elastomers commonly used in aerospace fuel systems:

SAK contains a high level of aromatics, which are essential for maintaining the performance of certain elastomers, such as those used in seals and gaskets. Aromatics help elastomers retain their flexibility and prevent excessive swelling or weakening.

SPK has no aromatic content, making it a cleaner-burning fuel. However, its lack of aromatics can lead to challenges with elastomer compatibility, such as swelling or reduced sealing performance.

Both SAK and SPK formulations play a critical role in the adoption of SAF. While SAK’s high aromatic content supports compatibility with traditional elastomers, SPK offers a cleaner-burning alternative with fewer emissions but requires careful consideration of elastomer performance. Advanced materials like FKM seals provide a reliable solution across SAF blends, ensuring safety and performance without compromising sustainability goals. As the aviation industry continues its transition toward greener fuels, understanding the nuances of SAF formulations and their impact on materials will be key to a seamless shift toward more sustainable skies.

Which form of SAF – SAK or SPK – is more in use or likely to come into use?

Currently, SPK is more widely adopted and is set to play a key role in the future of aviation. The diversity of feedstocks approved under ASTM D7566 highlights the broad range of sources available for SPK production. Aircraft manufacturers are also making strides toward sustainability, with plans to design aircraft capable of operating on 100% SPK by 2030. Certain SPK feedstocks are already proving to be the dominant choice for SAF.

We worked with Virant to source and test SAK (which is 97% aromatic) – a material with a high aromatic content (97%) derived from algae. This product was specifically developed to blend with approximately 80% SPK, ensuring the correct aromatic balance needed for a drop-in fuel compatible with nitrile seals exposed to jet fuel. While SAK is not intended to be used as a standalone fuel, it serves as a critical blending component. A mixture of 80% SPK and 20% SAK creates a 100% sustainable fuel option, eliminating the need for petroleum-based jet fuel while maintaining performance and reliability.

Where are elastomer seals used and for what purpose?

In aerospace applications, elastomer seals are critical components used in fuel systems, hydraulic systems, and engines to prevent leaks and ensure safety. Their primary purpose is to create a reliable barrier that prevents leaks, withstands elevated temperatures, and resists chemical degradation.

What material used in commercial applications underperforms with SAF and in what ways (swelling, weakening) and under what conditions?

Fluorosilicone elastomers (FVMQ), such as Greene Tweed’s 409 compound, showed underperformance in certain conditions:

Hardness Change: FVMQ materials exhibited greater and/or inconsistent hardness reduction when exposed to SAF fluids.

Weakening: Prolonged exposure to dry-out conditions or fuel switching (e.g., from conventional jet fuel to SAF) led to reduced sealing performance and dimensional instability.

Based on the variance in results between the different types of SAFs used, we recommend further application testing of any FVMQ compound in the specific SAF fluid intended for use. In contrast, under the same test conditions Greene Tweed’s fluorine-based elastomers (FKM compounds 665, 731, and 772) demonstrated good compatibility and consistent performance.

How widespread is the use of seals that use this material?

FVMQ (the material which underperformed during testing) represents a choice for static fuel applications that require good sealing performance over a broad temperature range. Few material options were historically available that could offer excellent levels of sealing performance at very cold temperatures (i.e. below -54°C or -65°F). However, newer grades of FKM material are also capable of performing well at these cold temperatures.

Are substitute materials available (and approved by the FAA, EASA, etc.) to replace the underperforming seal materials?

As mentioned above, newer grades of FKM material (notably those compliant against AMS7379 and AMS7410 industry specifications) can perform well at very cold temperatures. As such, they can meet the operating temperature envelope that only an FVMQ material can offer. In addition, FKM materials also typically cost somewhat less than FVMQs. FKM materials can therefore represent an attractive alternative to an FVMQ material.

It should be noted that if a type of sealing product is replaced within an aircraft system, it is the responsibility of aircraft system manufacturers to qualify the replacement and demonstrate an equivalent level of performance.

Do FKM seals cost more?

The cost impact would be from having to replace nitrile seals with the FKM seals due to the higher cost of FKM material. As mentioned earlier nitrile seals require some aromatic content, so the blending of aromatics or switching to FKM seals would be a cost consideration.

Is the supply chain for the substitute material challenged?

The supply chain for advanced elastomer materials like FKM is currently stable, however, fluctuations are always possible depending on factors like increased demand. Greene Tweed’s global manufacturing and distribution network ensures a reliable supply of high-performance elastomers to meet industry needs.

What is Greene Tweed’s expertise in supplying elastomers for SAF (can cover research, testing, verification, manufacturing or distribution strengths).

As a global leader in advanced materials and high-performance solutions, with decades of experience in elastomer technology, our expertise spans multiple areas, including advanced material science capabilities in research and development.

We follow this with comprehensive testing and verification protocols to ensure our materials meet or exceed industry standards. For this particular application, we conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the compatibility of fluorine-based elastomer seals with various SAF blends, including SPK and SAK. The seals were tested under accelerated aerospace conditions, such as temperatures up to 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure, to ensure their reliability in real-world applications.

Our manufacturing facilities also enable us to produce high-quality elastomers at scale, while our robust global distribution network ensures efficient delivery to customers worldwide.

Proving seal compatibility with SAFs through rigorous testing ensures that existing aircraft and systems can safely transition to these fuels without costly overhauls, paving the way for a more sustainable future in aviation while maintaining safety and reliability standards.",https://www.aerospacemanufacturinganddesign.com/fileuploads/image/2025/11/14/pav-greene-tweed-fusion-665-image-ko-szd.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:56:26.662438

,,2025-11-14 16:00:44+00:00,Earth.com,Jet fuel made from trash could dramatically cut aviation emissions - Earth.com,Andrei Ionescu,,,,,https://www.earth.com/news/jet-fuel-made-from-trash-could-dramatically-cut-aviation-emissions/,"Unlike cars, planes can’t simply switch to batteries at scale, which is why sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has become the industry’s main decarbonization lever.
“Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation.
The resulting liquids are upgraded into a kerosene-range blend that meets existing jet fuel specifications.
The headline is the life-cycle assessment: depending on configuration, MSW-derived jet fuel could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 80 to 90 percent compared with conventional fossil jet.
Global potential of trash jet fuel Policy ambition for SAF is rising fast.","Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5 percent of global CO₂ emissions today, and demand for flights is on track to double by 2040. Unlike cars, planes can’t simply switch to batteries at scale, which is why sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has become the industry’s main decarbonization lever.

The hitch is supply. SAF still represents less than one percent of jet fuel use worldwide because it’s expensive to make and limited by feedstocks such as used cooking oil and energy crops. A new study points to an overlooked, highly scalable input: municipal solid waste (MSW).

By converting everyday trash into drop-in jet fuel through industrial gasification and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project found a powerful emissions lever. Their analysis shows that airlines could slash lifecycle emissions using this pathway.

The researchers found that aviation has surprisingly few practical, near-term tools to cut emissions in a meaningful way.

“Unlike road transport, which is shifting toward electrification, there’s no silver-bullet for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,” said Jingran Zhang, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project.

“Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today’s engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.”

Turning trash into jet fuel

The pathway the team evaluated is well-established chemistry at industrial scale. Mixed municipal waste – including organic scraps, paper and cardboard, a portion of plastics, and other combustibles – is sorted and then gasified into a synthesis gas of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

After cleanup to remove contaminants, that “syngas” is fed into a Fischer–Tropsch reactor to build longer hydrocarbon chains.

The resulting liquids are upgraded into a kerosene-range blend that meets existing jet fuel specifications. Airlines can use it now without modifying engines or fueling infrastructure.

The headline is the life-cycle assessment: depending on configuration, MSW-derived jet fuel could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 80 to 90 percent compared with conventional fossil jet.

Savings stem from diverting waste, preventing methane, and substituting petroleum with a far lower-carbon fuel. But a real bottleneck is scaling gasification systems that can reliably process mixed waste with consistent quality and uptime.

Boosting efficiency with hydrogen

Trash isn’t a uniform feedstock, and syngas composition doesn’t always perfectly match what Fischer–Tropsch reactors prefer.

In the scenarios the authors analyzed, only about one-third of the input carbon became fuel without additional process adjustments. This is good enough for big emissions gains, but is definitely improvable.

The analysis shows two levers to push efficiency higher: capture and recycle CO₂ within the plant, and blend in green hydrogen produced with renewable electricity.

Both tactics raise carbon utilization and fuel yield. They strengthen climate benefits and economics, especially in regions with supportive power and carbon policies.

Trash problem to jet fuel solution

MSW is a municipal headache nearly everywhere. Landfills consume land, leak methane, and are increasingly constrained. Incineration reduces volume but brings air quality challenges.

Routing appropriate fractions of that waste to fuel production offers cities a credible “zero-waste” pathway that also displaces fossil fuels.

The researchers emphasize that plastics must be handled carefully to meet sustainability criteria. However, with proper sorting and modern gas cleanup, a large fraction of urban trash becomes a reliable SAF feedstock rather than an environmental liability.

Global potential of trash jet fuel

Policy ambition for SAF is rising fast. The United States aims for up to 35 billion gallons per year by 2050, backed by tax credits.

The European Union is mandating rising SAF blends on all departing flights, from two percent in 2025 to 70 percent by mid-century.

Against that backdrop, the MSW potential is striking. In the study’s “practical” case, existing waste could produce about 50 million tons (roughly 62 billion liters) of jet fuel annually. That is enough to cut aviation’s lifecycle CO₂ by about 16 percent.

With green hydrogen integration and optimized plants, output could climb to 80 million tons per year. That would supply up to 28 percent of global jet fuel demand and avoid as much as 270 million tons of CO₂ annually.

Regionally, Europe’s potential from MSW alone would exceed near-term EU blending mandates while staying within sustainability guardrails.

Under carbon pricing and offset programs such as ICAO’s CORSIA, lower-carbon fuel also carries an economic edge: airlines reduce their compliance costs by burning fewer fossil tons, and incentives help close the price gap with conventional jet.

Scaling depends on policy

Despite strong climate performance, MSW-to-jet won’t scale on chemistry alone. Siting and financing large gasification plants, upgrading waste collection and sorting, securing long-term feedstock contracts with cities, and aligning utility-scale green hydrogen supply all require durable policy.

Production-side tax credits, contracts for difference that guarantee a stable SAF premium, and clear sustainability standards can unlock private capital.

On the demand side, blend mandates that ratchet up predictably give airlines and fuel producers the certainty to invest.

Trash and the future of jet fuel

“This study presents a blueprint for converting urban waste into sustainable aviation fuel, offering future environmental benefits,” said lead author Michael McElroy, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard.

“Broad collaboration among governments, fuel producers, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers will be essential to lower costs, and accelerate aviation’s path to net-zero emissions.”

The big picture is pragmatic. There’s no single fix for aviation. But MSW-derived SAF is one of the few options that can scale this decade using existing airplanes and pipelines. It also helps solve a waste problem that cities already pay to manage.

Pair it with efficiency gains, smarter operations, other certified SAF pathways, and hydrogen or electric aircraft where they make sense, and the sector’s path to deep decarbonization looks a lot more achievable.

The study is published in Nature Sustainability.

Logistics, Community and Operational Detail Capturing CO₂ at a bioethanol plant is itself complex.

The company marked the operational start of a new carbon-capture and storage (CCS) project, now labeled the world’s largest bioethanol carbon-capture facility.

What makes this milestone even more compelling isn’t just its scale. It was how their CCS project was achieved.

The project harnesses an existing 400-mile natural-gas transmission line formerly used for fossil fuel transport. It has been retrofitted and retooled to carry captured CO₂ from multiple ethanol plants to underground sequestration deep in Wyoming.

By repurposing infrastructure rather than building completely new pipelines and systems, the companies involved drastically reduced costs, expedited timelines, and reframed what a “new” facility can look like in the sustainability era.

The Project at a Glance

The pipeline in question is the Tallgrass Energy “Trailblazer” system. Formerly a natural-gas transmission line running through Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, it has been converted to transport CO₂ from an array of ethanol plants, including ADM’s Columbus facility and plants operated by POET in Nebraska and Iowa.

The operation is designed to transport over ten million tons of CO₂ per year. The scale is equivalent to removing more than two million passenger vehicles from the road.

Reuse of Legacy Infrastructure

What sets this project apart is that the pipeline didn’t start as a CCS project. It was a natural-gas facility that found new life converted for a new purpose.

Adapting old infrastructure in this way carries several benefits. For one, the operation required fewer new rights-of-way, reduced need for entirely new construction, and faster integration. Smaller, lateral lines were constructed using voluntary easements from landowners, simplifying permitting and community engagement. Together, this meant far less disruption for ADM to accomplish their goals.

This adaptation underscores the theme: “old infrastructure, new purpose.” Rather than laying entirely new conduits across vast terrain, the project leveraged what was already in place. Doing so reduced cost, decreased logistical friction, and hastened its time-to-market.

Logistics, Community and Operational Detail

Capturing CO₂ at a bioethanol plant is itself complex. Fermentation processes release CO₂, which must be collected, compressed, and transported safely.

In this case, multiple ethanol plants now feed into the pipeline, creating a shared logistics infrastructure that benefits from economies of scale. Once transported, the CO₂ is injected deep underground in rock formations roughly 9,000 feet beneath the surface in southeast Wyoming.

Community engagement also played a significant role. Tallgrass worked with landowners and citizens’ groups, creating a community investment fund tied to the pipeline’s throughput (10 cents per metric ton of CO₂ sent).

Initial contributions toward local services such as early childhood development, senior care, and food pantries were given. This is a critical element of the project as repurposing infrastructure isn’t just a technical exercise—it has to fit socially and politically, too.

Reinforcing the Theme: Beyond the Pipeline

While the retrofitted pipeline is the highlight of this development, the project’s broader strategy reinforces the theme of transformation.

The ethanol plants themselves are evolving. By capturing their CO₂, they lower their carbon-intensity scores and position themselves for new markets such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

These plants were originally built for one purpose: fuel production. Now they’re adapting to serve a net-zero future. That second layer of reuse speaks to the broader mindset shift of legacy assets repurposed for modern climate goals.

From Old to New: Progress in the Carbon Transition

The transition to sustainable operations is no easy feat. New technology, shifting regulations, massive capital costs, and intricate logistics all stand as formidable barriers. Many decarbonization projects stall not because the science is impossible, but because the infrastructure and business-model challenges are real and steep.

Yet in this case, the company behind this facility demonstrated how a measure of ingenuity can go a long way. Choosing to repurpose an existing natural-gas line, building lateral connections via voluntary easements, and aligning community interests all unlocked what might otherwise have been prohibitively slow or expensive.

Their story serves as a beacon. It shows that while the challenges are steep, a path forward to a more sustainable future is very much possible.

Repurposing yesterday’s infrastructure for today’s climate challenge isn’t just clever… it’s necessary. And as we scale the next generation of decarbonization efforts, the “old-infrastructure, new-purpose” mindset may be one of our most effective tools.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Growth Factors

Aviation's climate strategy pivots on fuels with verifiable lifecycle cuts. CORSIA (ICAO) moved into wider implementation in 2024-2026, tightening accepted sustainability criteria and methodologies for SAF.

This compliance-grade carbon value is monetized. Airlines' decreasing reported emissions exposure can trim ETS-CORSIA liabilities. At the same time, producers earn higher credits in LCFS if they drive CI lower (for instance, via renewable power, green hydrogen, or CCUS on ethanol feedstocks). The global sustainable aviation fuel market is hence rewarding projects that can document traceability and additionally, increasing investment into digital MRV and lower-CI feedstocks.

The price delta remains the central brake, but it's easing at the margin. Based on the region and feedstock, SAF premiums have commonly ranged $2 to $4/gal above Jet-A. With IRA + LCFS, specific United States lanes can compress this to sub-$1-$2/gal efficient premiums for qualifying low-CI volumes, mainly for HEFA and some ATJ routes tied to low-CI ethanol.

Based on Technology, the global sustainable aviation fuel market is segmented as HEFA-SPK, FT-SPK, HFS-SIP, and ATJ-SPK. The HEFA-SPK leads the market due to its established supply chains, cost-effectiveness, and broad ASTM approval for blending up to 50% with a conventional jet fuel.

Based on Platform, the global market is segmented as commercial, regional transport aircraft, military aviation, business & general aviation, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The commercial segment dominates the market, driven by the high fuel consumption of cargo airlines and passengers worldwide.

Regional Scope:

North America is likely to sustain its leadership in the sustainable aviation fuel market due to large-scale airline commitments, advanced production infrastructure, and technological dominance, as well as significant R&D investment. Key regional carriers like Alaska, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines have contracted multi-year SAF purchase agreements, assuring continuous demand. United Airlines alone is committed to buying more than 3 billion gallons of SAF in the upcoming years. This long-term commitment fuels production investments and assures a stable industry infrastructure.

Europe continues to secure the second-highest share in the sustainable aviation fuel industry owing to robust regulatory mandates, established airline commitments, and strategic projects and partnerships. Europe holds a second-leading position in the worldwide market due to stringent regulations, such as the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, which mandates a 2% SAF blend by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050. This lawfully binding target forces fuel suppliers and airlines to amplify SAF adoption. The European Green Deal also backs this shift by integrating SAF into the continent's broader decarbonization strategy.

In a project funded by the Minnesota corn checkoff, Dauenhauer is testing a series of metal catalysts, to see which could produce the highest yield at the greatest economic efficiency.
“Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel.
“In 2022, the USA produced about 14 billion bushels of corn (~360 million tonnes of corn, source: USDA),” Dauenhauer wrote in his research proposal.
“(That same year), the USA consumed about 145 million tonnes of diesel fuel (source: EIA).","With support from Minnesota Corn, Professor Paul Dauenhauer is exploring the corn-to-methanol pathway for biofuels.

Modern corn ethanol is a marvel of clean fuel production, harnessing the energy of the sun to make a single seed into 600 or more kernels, and then rendering the glucose polymers in the grain into an alcohol fuel. Modern production efficiency renders nearly three gallons of fuel from every bushel.

Making alcohol is a biological catalytic process as old as civilization, but, even with the latest refinements, the biology in the process requires the sacrifice of about a third of the glucose molecules in the lifecycle of the yeast catalyst, producing CO2 along with the alcohol.

Paul Dauenhauer, a University of Minnesota Professor of Chemical Engineering, asks, what if there were a process that could utilize 100% of the corn glucose polymers to make fuel? He believes an inorganic catalyst could turn all those molecules into another form of alcohol, called methanol.

In a project funded by the Minnesota corn checkoff, Dauenhauer is testing a series of metal catalysts, to see which could produce the highest yield at the greatest economic efficiency.

“Methanol has a universality to it,” Dauenhauer said. “Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel. You can also make clean burning diesel fuel, and you can make polyethylene polymers—plastics.”

The jet fuel made this way achieves a major reduction of carbon emissions, and so qualifies as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—corn-based methanol could potentially supply that entire American SAF market, he said.

He believes this new process will yield 50% more fuel, while still leaving the corn fiber, protein and oil for coproducts like distillers grains animal feed.

“In 2022, the USA produced about 14 billion bushels of corn (~360 million tonnes of corn, source: USDA),” Dauenhauer wrote in his research proposal. “(That same year), the USA consumed about 145 million tonnes of diesel fuel (source: EIA). Using about half of the annually produced corn would provide the renewable carbon required to manufacture all of the country’s current jet fuel consumption.”

The “universality” of the methanol molecule will allow biorefineries to respond to the various markets and direct production into different amounts of jet fuel, diesel, or plastic, depending on demand, Dauenhauer said.

Methanol-based diesel also offers a huge environmental benefit.

Dauenhauer said, “You manufacture a molecule called dimethyl ether…People have been talking about it for a long time. The benefit of using dimethyl ether in a diesel engine versus conventional diesel is it burns really cleanly. All the problems you have with exhaust with a conventional diesel engine, you would not have with methanol-based diesel.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Minnesota_Corn_Nov25_6f013edadd.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:43.986467

“[Trump] may be skipping COP30, but his fossil fuel allies aren’t,” Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International told DeSmog.
The IETA is a business lobby group made of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers and greenhouse gas emitters.
He also defunded renewable energies and accelerated drilling for planet-heating oil and gas, while branding the climate crisis a “con job”.
Fossil fuel executives are the arsonists of the climate crisis.","Top American oil and gas producers are using trade groups to gain access to this year’s COP30 climate summit in the absence of an official U.S. delegation, DeSmog can report.

ExxonMobil and Chevron — which are among the fossil fuel industry’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters — have sent a combined total of 13 executives to the talks, while both companies have either sponsored events or pavilions at the conference.

In addition, Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke at a number of COP30 side events, including one in Sao Paolo on November 3, where he noted in an interview with Reuters that crude oil and hydrocarbons were “going to play a critical role in everybody’s life for a long time to come”.

U.S. President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of deciding against sending an official U.S. delegation to the COP30 climate summit, where over 50,000 delegates are gathered in the Amazon city of Bélem, Brazil.

“[Trump] may be skipping COP30, but his fossil fuel allies aren’t,” Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International told DeSmog. “This is proof that Big Oil still holds a dangerous sway over the climate process.”

The 13 executives identified by DeSmog are among the more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists attending this year’s summit. This is the largest ever proportion recorded at a climate conference, according to a new analysis published today (Friday) by the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition, a coalition calling to remove fossil fuel companies and lobbyists from influencing climate negotiations.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to the climate crisis, and Exxon and Chevron are among the 57 polluters directly linked to 80 percent of the world’s global fossil CO2 emissions since the 2016 Paris Agreement. Two years ago, the COP28 summit in Dubai ended with a historic call to “transition away” from fossil fuels to meet climate targets, but emissions from polluting fuels are on track to hit a record high this year.

Exxon and Chevron also have a history of delaying action on climate change through lobbying and false advertising. Earlier this month, DeSmog and The Guardian revealed how Exxon funded think tanks to spread climate denial in Latin America and across the Global South during the 1990s and early 2000s.

Both companies say they are committed to climate action, but neither has committed to a 2050 net zero target that includes Scope 3 emissions from the burning of their fuel, which make up the vast bulk of their polluting gases.

Exxon and Chevron did not respond to DeSmog’s request for comment.

This was the first year in COP history when attendees have been able to voluntarily disclose which organisation or individual paid for their attendance.

Analysis of the delegates list reveal that the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), which counts ExxonMobil as a member, paid for two Exxon executives to attend, as well as delegates from BP and TotalEnergies. Meanwhile Washington D.C.-based Thaddeus Segal from ExxonMobil, senior director of Exxon’s global energy transition in public and government affairs, accessed the talks as part of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) delegation.

The IETA is a business lobby group made of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers and greenhouse gas emitters. This year, the group’s pavilion was sponsored for a second year running by Chevron, among other polluters, including BP. As DeSmog reported last year, the group’s COP29 pavilion in Baku, Azerbaijan, was also sponsored by ExxonMobil.

DeSmog also found that ExxonMobil is sponsoring a “high-level” side-event on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) on November 15, hosted by the U.S. and Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and pesticides giant Bayer. Here, Exxon “leaders” will speak alongside members of Congress on the “economics and policy support to scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF]”.

Experts have warned that the widespread production of SAF without sustainable practices could lead to deforestation, loss of biodiversity and competition for land with food crops.

Chevron, meanwhile, has gained access to the talks through industry groups IPIECA, a London-headquartered global oil and gas group which focuses on providing an industry channel into official UN proceedings. The group sent just three delegates: two of its own employees, and a third from Chevron.

This year, the American Petroleum Institute (API)sent just one delegate — also an executive from Chevron. The Washington D.C.-based API is the world’s biggest oil and gas industry group, with a history of undermining the global consensus on climate change.

A third Chevron executive attended as the sole delegate of the European Roundtable on Climate Change and Sustainable Transition, an independent Brussels-based think tank.

Exxon’s Woods also headlined a COP30 launch event on November 7 in Brasilia, hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Amcham Brasil to “discuss business solutions for carbon accounting and emission reductions”. Exxon has joined an industry effort to create a new carbon accounting system to create more accurate calculations of emissions-intensity, which critics have described as a “new climate delay tactic”.

Speaking on Bloomberg’s Zero podcast on the sidelines of COP, Woods praised Trump for changing the “paradigms” of the energy transition, but insisted Exxon still has a role to play in lowering emissions. Since his inauguration in January, Trump has quit the Paris Agreement, the legally-binding international treaty to limit catastrophic temperature rise. He also defunded renewable energies and accelerated drilling for planet-heating oil and gas, while branding the climate crisis a “con job”.

Meanwhile, away from COP, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on Wednesday that revival of international oil and gas exploration could be at least partly attributed to the President’s energy policies.

“The Trump administration has played a critical role in opening doors and creating an environment where people are looking to do these kinds of deals,” he told Bloomberg TV.

Rees of Oil Change International said: “Trump is the fossil fuel industry’s best investment and the world is paying the price.”

He called for fossil fuel companies to be denied access to the talks.

“No Big Oil executive can claim their objectives align with the UN’s multilateral climate treaty,” Rees said.

“These companies continue to drill, pollute, and profit from the destruction of our planet and communities. Fossil fuel executives are the arsonists of the climate crisis. They cannot be trusted to help extinguish the fire.”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3D4E3TE-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:49.642033

Chief Strategy Development Officer

Bangalore International Airport Limited

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Raghunath worked closely with all the aero concessionaires and cargo operators to minimise disruption and provide financial relief to them. The airline marketing team helped launch a historic first route to the U.S. West Coast and the cargo team at BIAL also achieved record numbers over this period, with the airport becoming India’s leading airport for the export of perishables. Despite the impact of COVID-19, Raghunath has led a digital transformation and expansion at BIAL airport, with new initiatives and the deployment of the fully biometric-based self-boarding solution for seamless passenger flow and travel experiences and a process automation and analytics platform. These initiatives amongst many others, meant that the airport won ACI World’s ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative, which recognised BIAL airports efforts to prioritise their customers during COVID-19. Raghunath has remained a staunch and resilient leader during such an uncertain time and is very much appreciated by his team.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Airport General Manager

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Balram Bheodari leads Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as North America’s most efficient airport, due to his vast knowledge of and astute attention to efficiency in aviation, which has allowed the airport to thrive in the most difficult of markets. Bheodari combines operational expertise, integrity, and selflessness to provide a quality of leadership throughout Atlanta Airport. He oversees all facets of airport governance, including operations and a multi-billion-dollar capital improvement programme, ATLNext, designed to pave the way for Atlanta’s growth over the next 20 years. During COVID-19, Bheodari developed a comprehensive resumption of operations playbook that served to support ATL’s recovery efforts. With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

CEO

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Chief Executive Officer

Budapest Airport

Chris Dinsdale has worked at Budapest Airport since 2015, originally as CFO until March 2021, where he was nominated for the position as CEO. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dinsdale, as CFO of the airport at the time, fought relentlessly to make sure that the company survived the crisis and worked with great commitment to secure the funding of the airport. For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport. This will also mean that we come out stronger of the pandemic and have a clear focus. Dinsdale is an inspiring true leader who helped us all to cope with the very difficult times of the pandemic and I am convinced that he truly deserves this award.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/IAS25-Register-Now-Banners-2_1200x628-BYG-e1755764536394.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 10:56:25.625650

Instead, it’s a layered task: multiple levers need to be put to work together, each one reducing and addressing emissions in its own way. Airbus is putting this idea into practice, combining four levers in a single flight.

Between 17-21 November 2025, Dubai Airshow will open its doors to the public. With the tagline ‘The Future is Here’, this 19th edition of the show has a focus on technological advancements, innovative products and technologies. Where better for Airbus to bring together four key complementary levers in a single flight – latest generation aircraft, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Book and Claim (B&C) and carbon dioxide removals (CDR) – to showcase how each of these levers can play a part in reducing the emissions gap.

Today, around 30% of the world’s in-service aircraft fleet are of the latest generation, which deliver a 20-30% fuel saving compared to their predecessors. Replacing older aircraft with more modern ones – like the Airbus A350-1000, which first entered into service in 2018, and requires on average 25% less fuel than previous generation aircraft – is a key way for the aviation industry to make progress towards decarbonisation.

In fact, it is an Airbus A350-1000, flying from Toulouse to Dubai, which will provide an opportunity to showcase the various decarbonisation levers in a single flight. While the use of all these levers in routine operations is still rare and challenging for airlines to implement, this showcase aims to emphasise the point that no single technology in isolation can help the aviation industry reach its decarbonisation targets.

Multiple levers, working in parallel

Industry bodies like ATAG recognise the complexity of decarbonising aviation in their Waypoint 2050 report (2nd edition, 2021). In their three scenarios which depart from a continuation of current trends, SAF remains the lever with the capacity to make the greatest difference, accounting for between 53-71% of emissions reduction contributions in 2050. This depends on the level of ambition and commitment with which the industry embraces decarbonisation and the particular levers that gain the most focus and support.

Alongside SAF, market-based measures such as carbon dioxide removals will be needed to close the emissions gap by 2050. This combination of SAF and carbon removals or other emission mitigation options presents the industry with a practical solution to many of the challenges that put pressure on the wider adoption of SAF.

Inspired by these scenarios, Airbus is deploying the following levers to address each tranche of emissions created during the flight:

Deconstructing our SAF, B&C and CDR showcase flight

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

The A350 is travelling from Airbus’ operational headquarters in Toulouse, France, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to participate in the Dubai Airshow flying display. For this flight the A350 will benefit from a 35% blend of physical SAF. The remaining 65% will be conventional aviation fuel (CAF).

Toulouse is well-served to supply SAF, as it benefits from not only the infrastructure at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport but also Airbus’ own dedicated fuelling facilities, but this is not the case for all cities. So what options are there when SAF is not readily available or where an airline or operator may wish to have a greater percentage of SAF than is physically available on site?

Book and Claim (B&C)

An airport or airline may be enthusiastic about using SAF, and willing to pay the additional cost to acquire it – SAF costs between 2-7x conventional aviation fuel, depending on the feedstock – but there may be logistical challenges that make it complex to have SAF delivered where they operate, for example, being located in a part of the world without easy access to SAF producers or suppliers.

For this reason, there exists an accounting mechanism called ‘Book and Claim’ that enables airlines and airports to be able to take advantage of SAF without needing to physically take delivery of it. We can use this to virtually replace the CAF on the flight. By using Book and Claim, Airbus purchases SAF emissions reduction certificates from an independent registry, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), an NGO that defines sustainability standards for SAF.

In simple terms, the Book and Claim mechanism allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Book and Claim could be a key lever in the scaling of SAF, connecting supply and demand and improving SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those located far from supply points or production facilities. In practice, this means the physical SAF is delivered to another operator, which then consumes the amount of SAF as indicated by the certificate.

Carbon dioxide removals (CDR)

Even by effectively replacing all of the fuel with SAF (through a mixture of physical SAF and through SAF Book and Claim certificates), emissions remain. Airbus will use carbon dioxide removal (CDR) units to neutralise the residual emissions of this flight. CDR is a credible measure for addressing residual remaining emissions by physically removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it. For this specific flight, Airbus has selected CDRs from reforestation projects in Mexico which are certified by the Climate Action Reserve (vintage 2022-2023).

What does this showcase reveal about aviation’s path to decarbonisation?

The whole industry needs to come together to tackle decarbonisation, from airlines to airports, and fuel producers to OEMs like Airbus, as well as regulatory bodies. We are playing our part: increasing the use of SAF in our own operations with fuel providers like TotalEnergies, participating in the SAFFA Fund alongside AirFrance-KLM Group and Qantas, amongst others, and investing directly in SAF producers like LanzaJet.

When it comes to Book and Claim, Airbus has launched its own Demonstrator in collaboration with RSB. The demonstrator has the ambition to facilitate demand from some of its smaller-scale customers and connect it with supply, making it easier for these clients to access SAF. Airbus has also been working to raise the profile and credibility of Book and Claim as a mechanism. As yet, Book and Claim is not recognised by the regulated markets – neither by the EU Renewable Energy Directive nor by CORSIA – however Airbus believes this could be a powerful lever to make SAF more accessible and is advocating for the recognition of this lever.

The aviation industry will not reach its long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions overnight. To achieve this by 2050 will take hard work, investment, regulatory support, and the willingness of all industry participants to drive progress. The industry agrees that multiple levers are the way to go. This flight takes that idea, and puts it in the air.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102142/642843-6f5j6v2vyc-preview.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:23.596283

The UK Government is mandating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending as a requirement for all suppliers of Aviation fuel – starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 22% by 2040 – and backing industry with price guarantees to accelerate production, reduce costs, and support net-zero goals. SAF is key to greener air travel, economic growth, and circular energy innovation.1

Key purpose of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill introduces a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism to support the commercial production of SAF in the UK. It aims to reduce investment risk and enable the construction of first-of-a-kind commercial SAF plants, while directly contributing to the UK's aviation decarbonisation targets.

The first reading in the Lords took place on 20 October 2025, with the date for the second reading yet to be announced, but Royal Assent expected by the end of 2026.2

How the SAF Bill works: key features explained

Revenue certainty contracts To support investment in UK SAF Production, the Bill introduces a Revenue Certainty Mechanism. The Secretary of State may instruct a government-owned counterparty to enter contracts with SAF producers, guaranteeing a fixed ""strike price"" for SAF over a defined period.

If the market price falls below the strike price, the counterparty pays the producer the difference.

If the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the counterparty the surplus.

This mechanism mirrors the UK's Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme used in low-carbon electricity and hydrogen, in which the mechanism aims to lower financing costs, boost investor confidence, and accelerate final investment decisions for SAF plants.

The mechanism is intended to be a time-limited measure to stimulate an early market for SAF and will become obsolete once investor confidence is proven on a commercial scale.

Designated counterparty The counterparty must be a company wholly owned by the government. It is responsible for issuing and managing contracts with SAF producers, handling payments under the strike price mechanism, and administering the overall scheme.

Levy funding The mechanism is funded through a variable levy imposed on UK aviation fuel suppliers, calculated according to each supplier's market share of aviation turbine fuel. This approach reflects the ""Polluter Pays"" principle under the Environmental Act 2021. This levy covers:

Payments under strike price contracts

Administrative costs of the scheme

The levy adjusts to market fluctuations through recurring charging periods, with potential redistribution of surplus funds to levy payers when market prices exceed strike price. Suppliers may need to provide financial collateral to ensure payment security.

Placing the levy on fuel suppliers distributes costs across the supply chain, targets those with SAF Mandate obligations and minimises administrative burden.

Administration and enforcement The counterparty (a government-owned company) is responsible for administering both the levy and the contractual framework, with oversight and support from the Secretary of State. To ensure compliance with levy regulations, the Secretary of State is empowered to impose financial penalties of up to £100,000 or 10% of a supplier's turnover.

Oversight and flexibility The Secretary of State retains powers to direct the government-owned counterparty, request relevant information, and provide financial assistance to support the scheme. Key regulations underpinning the mechanism are subject to parliamentary approval, ensuring appropriate oversight. The Bill applies across the UK, with consultation requirements in place for devolved administrations to ensure coordinated implementation.

Policy rationale The mechanism is designed to address key investment barriers – including technology readiness, feedstock availability, construction risk, and revenue uncertainty. It complements the UK's SAF Mandate, which requires fuel suppliers to blend a minimum proportion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, by offering long-term price certainty. Together, these measures aim to unlock private investment and accelerate the commercial-scale production of SAF in the UK.

By Craig Langford

Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative aimed at finding more effective ways to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce both carbon and non-carbon emissions, the company stated.

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.

While SAF is already recognised for its potential to cut carbon emissions compared with fossil jet fuel, studies have shown that it can also reduce the number of ice crystals that form in aircraft contrails. According to Rolls-Royce, fewer and thinner contrails could lessen aviation’s wider climate impact.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said “SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO2 emissions. This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO2 climate effects as well.”

Because contrails are only formed under specific weather conditions, most of the climate effect is caused by a relatively small number of flights. The QRITOS project aims to determine whether SAF can be prioritised for those flights most likely to produce persistent contrails, using flight trials, atmospheric modelling, and satellite data collected at Heathrow.

Marcin Dutka, Environmental Sustainability Technologist at Rolls-Royce and project manager for QRITOS, said “Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties. This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

British Airways is contributing operational data from its fleet. “At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment. “Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails.”

Heathrow Airport is also participating. Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, said “As SAF continues to scale it is important to take a closer look at how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit. As one of the world’s busiest airports we’re proud to participate in this project to demonstrate how targeted SAF use could help to address non-CO2 emissions.”

The research team at Imperial College London will develop new computational models and satellite imaging tools to monitor contrail formation. Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham said “We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques, with the goal of performing both prediction and near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of targeted SAF deployment for contrail warming reduction.”

Industry Minister Chris McDonald described the project as an example of collaboration between government and business. “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.

According to the ATI, QRITOS will conclude in April 2027 and aims to improve forecasting methods, advance understanding of contrail formation, and develop new ways to verify environmental outcomes using satellite data.",https://ifairworthy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Blue-IFA-Logo-Graphic.png,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:42.517114

On November 13, 2025, Airbus formally handed over the first A330-900neo to Air Algérie at its Toulouse delivery center. This event immediately launched the Algerian flag carrier into a new phase of long-haul operations. The aircraft, registered 7T-VTA and named “Novembre 54” in homage to the date that sparked the Algerian Revolution in 1954, completed its ferry flight the same day and touched down at Algiers Houari Boumediene International Airport to an official welcome ceremony. Exclusively powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, this delivery marks the opening chapter of a firm commitment for 10 A330-900neo aircraft, with deliveries expected to be completed by mid-2027.

The journey to this ten-aircraft contract began in June 2023 when Air Algérie originally signed for seven widebodies: five A330-900neo and two A350-1000s. Early in 2025, the carrier made the pragmatic decision to convert both A350-1000 positions into additional A330-900neo, prioritizing complete fleet commonality on the long-haul side to minimize training, spare parts, and maintenance costs. Subsequent option exercises and production-slot agreements subsequently increased the firm order to ten aircraft. The updated delivery schedule calls for four examples (including the one just received) before the end of 2025, with the remaining six arriving at a steady pace throughout 2026 and the first half of 2027. Temporary leases of both A330neo and older A330ceo aircraft are ensuring uninterrupted capacity during the transition period.

Air Algérie’s choice of the A330-900neo is rooted in a combination of operational efficiency and environmental performance that is particularly well-suited to its network profile. The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000, the sole powerplant available on the A330neo family, delivers a 14 % reduction in fuel burn per seat compared with the Trent 700 that equips the airline’s current eight A330-200s, while cutting perceived noise by half (6 dB) and offering full compatibility with 100 % Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Those improvements translate directly into lower operating costs at a time of persistently high fuel prices and ever-stricter carbon regulations on the carrier’s core European routes. With a range of 13,300 km in typical configuration, the aircraft comfortably enables non-stop operations from Algiers to Beijing, Guangzhou, Johannesburg, or even the North American East Coast without payload restrictions.

Inside, the cabin benefits from Airbus’s latest Airspace design: larger overhead bins, advanced LED mood lighting, higher humidity levels, and the quietest environment in its class. Air Algérie has opted for a three-class layout that places particular emphasis on long-haul comfort, featuring fully-flat beds in business class, a dedicated premium-economy section, and significantly improved economy seating with the newest generation of in-flight entertainment and connectivity options. Exact seat counts have not yet been disclosed publicly. Still, the configuration is understood to be in the 300–320-seat range, balancing premium offerings for diaspora traffic with the higher density required on high-demand leisure routes.

Operationally, the ten new A330-900neo will first replace the ageing A330-200 fleet, whose average age now approaches 18 years, and then fuel an ambitious expansion program. The very first aircraft is expected to enter commercial service before the end of November 2025, initially reinforcing frequencies to Paris, Montreal, Istanbul, and Dubai before inaugurating the long-awaited Beijing route. Guangzhou is scheduled to follow in 2026, while sub-Saharan Africa will see rapid growth: Ndjamena was relaunched in October 2025, and Addis Ababa, Libreville, Luanda, and several additional points are confirmed for the coming months, with a stated objective of doubling the airline’s African network by 2028.

This long-haul renewal forms only one pillar of a much broader modernization effort validated at the presidential level. Eight Boeing 737 MAX 9 will modernize medium-haul operations from 2027 onward, while fifteen ATR 72-600 will strengthen domestic and regional connectivity through a forthcoming dedicated subsidiary. By 2030, Air Algérie targets a fleet of 75–80 aircraft, with an average age reduced by more than half, restoring sustained profitability after the heavy losses incurred during the pandemic and enabling consistent double-digit annual growth.

For Algeria’s national carrier, the arrival of “Novembre 54” is far more than the simple addition of a new aircraft type. It represents the concrete manifestation of a strategic pivot designed to recapture market share lost to Royal Air Maroc, EgyptAir, Ethiopian Airlines, and the major Gulf carriers on key Europe–Africa corridors, while capitalizing on the country’s geographic position and the purchasing power of its large diaspora in France and Canada. With quieter, cleaner, and dramatically more efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines powering its wings, Air Algérie has equipped itself to compete aggressively in an aviation landscape where sustainability and cost control are non-negotiable. The new era of growth promised by this first A330-900neo is now officially underway.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/75f19d50bbd7f16ccf14d26f9dfc6127_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:55.376372

Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago.
However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025.
Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources.
Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services.","Globally, energy-related investments are set to reach USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, according to the IEA’s latest World Energy Investment 2025 report. Around USD 2.2 trillion is expected to go collectively towards renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, efficiency and the electrification of end-use sectors, with USD 1.1 trillion going to oil, gas and coal.

This analysis, prepared jointly by the IEA and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), dives further into the latest data. It examines energy investment trends in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) since 2015, highlighting investment opportunities for the region as countries look to support economic growth, enhance energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring energy affordability and access.

Latin America has some of the world’s best solar, wind and hydro resources, and it is a pioneer in the development of biofuels and renewable power. Leveraging these assets, the region has seen clean energy investment grow by 25% since 2015. Spending on renewables, grids, energy efficiency and electrification are on course to increase to about USD 70 billion in 2025.

Fossil fuel resources are unevenly distributed across the region; some countries are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, while others are major exporters. Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago. This year’s fossil fuel investment is expected to be about 20% lower than in 2015.

Overall, energy investment in the region is projected to reach USD 160 billion in 2025. This would be around 7% lower than a decade earlier, though this can be explained in part by cost declines over this period, both for both for upstream oil and gas activities as well as for key clean energy technologies.

Fifteen countries1 in the region have pledged to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. Meanwhile, a slightly different group of 15 LAC countries2 have put forward new Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement with targets for 2035. Across the region, meeting announced energy and climate targets would require a significant acceleration in investment in low-emissions power generation, grids and storage, low-emissions fuels, energy efficiency and the electrification of end-uses. Based on today’s policy settings, annual clean energy investments would exceed USD 110 billion by 2035, rising by 60% from current levels. However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025. Investments in EVs would need the largest amounts of additional capital, with investment needs for energy efficiency and electrification nearly quadrupling and accounting for about 45% of end-use investments in 2035.

Grids in particular will need a boost in spending; as with many other regions, spending on distribution and transmission have not kept up with the rapid growth in solar and wind capacity. Today, for each dollar spent on new power generation in the region, less than USD 0.50 is spent on grids and storage. By 2035, this needs to reach about USD 0.85, with total spending on grids and storage reaching nearly USD 50 billion under the APS.

As energy transitions in LAC accelerate under the APS, investments in fossil fuels decline, reaching about 50% of 2015 levels by 2035. Total spending on fossil fuels drops by over USD 30 billion by then, with much of this reduction offset by a sharp increase in investments in low-emissions fuels, which rise to nearly five times current levels.

Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources. Northern Chile and Western Argentina have high-quality solar radiation, while the “Southern Cone”3 and Northern Colombia offer highly productive wind corridors. Brazil has well-established bioenergy and sustainable fuel industries, along with most of the continent’s installed capacity in distributed solar, utility-scale solar and wind generation. Capacity across these categories is also expanding in Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay. In the Caribbean, countries are exploring solar, storage and hybrid projects to reduce fossil fuel dependence and increase energy security. These are very much in line with the ambitious targets adopted in the region: Barbados seeks to establish a 100% renewable power mix by 2035, and Antigua and Barbuda aims to source one-third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. And many other countries, including Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia and Dominica, have policies in place to support significant decarbonisation efforts in the coming decade.

For the moment, the region receives only 5% of global private investment in clean energy, compared with 8% of private sector spending on fossil fuels. There are, however, multiple examples from across LAC that show how a clear vision for energy transitions and a willingness to engage with the private sector can produce results.

Across two auctions in 2024, Brazil raised nearly USD 4 billion to build almost 7 300 kilometres (km) of new transmission lines. In October 2025, another auction was successfully held for the construction and operation of more than 1 000 km of new lines. These investments, which aim to strengthen the grid, integrate more renewable energy and improve system reliability, show how competitive auctions can attract private capital for major infrastructure projects.

In Argentina, the first large-scale auction (AlmaGBA) for a battery energy storage system (BESS) targeted the installation of 500 megawatts (MW) of capacity in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. The market responded strongly, with over 1 300 MW in bids and a final allocation of around 660 MW. The programme focused on congested areas and enabled greater renewable integration.

In Honduras, energy storage is being used to stabilise the electricity system in regions where renewable expansion is limited by transmission capacity and variability, showing that flexibility solutions are spreading across the region beyond large electricity markets. The National Electricity Company (ENEE) launched an international tender in 2025 to contract 1 500 MW of firm capacity to secure electricity supply through 2030. At least 65% of capacity must come from renewables with storage under a multi-round reverse auction and a Build-Operate-Transfer scheme with contracts of about 15 years.

This year, the Dominican Republic, through its National Energy Commission (CNE) and the Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company (EGEHID), also launched an international tender for up to 600 MW of new renewable capacity with mandatory storage, with the aim of diversifying the country’s energy mix, reducing fossil fuel dependence and achieving 30% renewable generation by 2030 under long-term power purchase agreements spanning from 15 to 20 years.

In Chile, a strong regulatory framework is in place that encourages battery integration and transmission improvements as renewable penetration grows.

Overall, these initiatives show that countries across the region are actively fostering conditions for further growth in energy investment, particularly amid their shift toward more resilient, flexible and renewable energy-focused power systems.

Regional energy integration is a key tool to harmonise planning, facilitate decision-making and enable the development of larger-scale projects. In line with this objective, OLADE created in 2024 a Regional Energy Planning Council, whose goal is to act as a regional coordination platform that identifies opportunities for integration and promotes a common energy agenda by helping energy ministers share information, reach agreements and align national planning efforts. The broader aim is to speed up the energy transition in Latin America and the Caribbean by exchanging best practices and creating better conditions through coordinated sustainable energy policies and market integration across the region.

Another critical element is the implementation of stable frameworks for renewable energy auctions and contracts. Recent experiences in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Honduras show that competitive auctions and long-term contracts provide certainty to developers and reduce financial costs for investors. OLADE’s Regional Regulatory Convergence initiative reinforces this principle by promoting the harmonization of criteria and contracting practices that encourage cross-border and regional investment.

National incentives and regulations have an important role to play. For example, Brazil’s Fuel of the Future Law, passed in late 2024, could unlock around USD 4 billion per year in investments for sustainable fuels, including green diesel, biogas and sustainable aviation fuel. The law sets mandatory blending targets, carbon intensity mandates and incentives to expand biofuels, supporting the country’s energy transition and attracting private capital to the sector.

The availability of instruments to mitigate currency risk and public guarantees is another key factor in attracting foreign investment, while the expansion and digitalisation of electricity grids also serves as an essential enabler to unlock investments in distributed generation and large-scale renewables. Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services. As elsewhere in the world, robust energy planning in LAC remains central to creating a strong enabling environment for investments in a secure, affordable and sustainable energy future.

The G20 Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries, developed by the IEA for Brazil’s G20 Presidency in 2024, identifies opportunities and actions to help achieve a rapid scaling up of clean energy investments. The roadmap outlines specific, timebound steps for increasing private financing in order to mobilise the investments required across different regions and sectors to build modern, clean energy systems.
