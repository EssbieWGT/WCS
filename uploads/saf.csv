The British aerospace giant reported a 50% profit surge in the first half of 2025, alongside significant strides in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and small modular reactors (SMRs), sparking optimism in the market.

Let's examine how Rolls-Royce's sustainability efforts are fuelling its financial success and investor confidence.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels Market Optimism

Rolls-Royce's commitment to sustainable aviation fuel has positioned it as a leader in decarbonising aviation. In late 2023, the company completed testing of 100% SAF on all its in-production civil aero engines, a milestone that aligns with global net-zero goals.

Simon Burr, Group Director of Engineering, Technology and Safety at Rolls-Royce, stated, 'This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry.'

The successful test underpinned a historic transatlantic flight on 28 November 2023, using 100% SAF on a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787 powered by Rolls-Royce engines.

This achievement led to a 1.6% share price increase on the day of the announcement, with shares trading at £235.75 ($315.99).

The company's SAFinity programme, launched in 2025, further supports business aviation customers by combining sustainable aviation fuel investments with verified sustainability projects.

On X @RollsRoyceMENA posted, 'We shared our vision for a net-zero future, committing to eliminating operations facility emissions by 2050 & enhancing engine efficiency.'

This initiative reflects Rolls-Royce's strategy to meet rising demand for green aviation solutions, boosting investor confidence as aviation faces pressure to reduce emissions.

Financial Resilience Bolsters Investor Confidence

Rolls-Royce's financial performance in 2025 has been a key driver of its share price surge.

The company reported an operating profit of £1.73 billion ($2.31 billion) in the first half of 2025, up 50% from £1.15 billion ($1.54 billion) the previous year, with free cash flow reaching £1.6 billion ($2.14 billion).

CEO Tufan Erginbilgic attributed this to 'strong operational and strategic progress', stating, 'Our actions led to strong first half-year results, despite supply chain challenges and tariffs.'

The company raised its full-year operating profit forecast to £3.1 billion–£3.2 billion ($4.15 billion–$4.29 billion), driving shares to a peak of £1,073 ($1,437.82) on 31 July 2025, an 8.6% increase in a single day.

The civil aerospace division, powered by engine maintenance and upgrades, contributed £4.7 billion ($6.30 billion) in revenue, up 17%.

Meanwhile, the power systems segment saw a 20% revenue increase to £2.04 billion ($2.73 billion), driven by demand for data centre backup power.

These results underscore how sustainability-driven innovations are enhancing financial resilience, attracting investors seeking long-term growth.

Small Modular Reactors Expand Green Horizons

Beyond aviation, Rolls-Royce's small modular reactor (SMR) programme is a cornerstone of its sustainability strategy, contributing to its share price rally.

Selected as the sole provider for the UK's Great British Energy – Nuclear programme, Rolls-Royce expects its SMRs to generate positive cash flow by late 2025, with full profitability by 2030.

The £210 million ($281.40 million) investment from ČEZ Group has bolstered the project's credibility, with potential for European expansion.

This aligns with global demand for clean energy, enhancing Rolls-Royce's appeal to environmentally conscious investors.

The company's battery energy storage systems (BESS) also support growth, with orders from Lithuania's Ignitis Group driving a projected 20% annual revenue increase in the power systems division.

These initiatives, combined with a 46% reduction in GHG emissions from operations since 2019, demonstrate Rolls-Royce's commitment to net zero by 2050.

Under the agreement, DHL Express will purchase 2,400 tonnes of SAF from Cathay, which will be used on flights operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group. This collaboration is set to boost SAF production and usage across the air cargo sector, marking a key milestone in advancing green logistics solutions.

Expanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Use in Asia

The newly established SAF partnership will see the sustainable fuel used on international flights departing from three major airports in Asia—Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita, and Singapore Changi. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, which provides express cargo services for DHL Express in the region. The initiative is part of both companies’ shared commitment to lower-carbon air logistics and the long-term sustainability of the aviation sector.

The SAF deal is expected to significantly reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 tonnes. This is equivalent to the emissions produced by over 100 flights between Hong Kong and Singapore using an Airbus 330 freighter. By expanding SAF usage in the region, DHL and Cathay aim to accelerate the production and uptake of this greener aviation fuel, which currently represents less than 1% of global jet fuel consumption.

A Milestone in Green Logistics

DHL Express has been a frontrunner in SAF adoption, continually working to scale its use across its global network. The company’s Senior Vice President for Network Operations & Aviation in Asia Pacific, Peter Bardens, emphasized the need for increased SAF usage in Asia to help mitigate the environmental impact of air transport. “We are at the forefront of SAF adoption and are eager to see more partners and customers join us in building a robust SAF ecosystem in Asia,” said Bardens.

DHL’s Strategy 2030 highlights “green logistics of choice” as one of its four core objectives, underscoring the company’s focus on sustainable operations. As a result, the company is not only increasing its SAF usage but is also investing in creating a more resilient and environmentally friendly logistics network.

Strengthening Partnership with Cathay Group

This new agreement further solidifies the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group. For over two decades, Air Hong Kong has been a critical component of DHL Express’s Asia Pacific network. The collaboration on SAF builds upon this strong foundation, positioning the two companies to continue working together to reduce carbon emissions in the air freight industry.

Cathay’s Director of Cargo, Tom Owen, noted that this partnership represents the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights. “SAF is a core pillar of our strategy to address carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to work with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia,” he explained.

Expanding the SAF Ecosystem in Asia

This collaboration is also a part of Cathay Group’s Corporate SAF Programme, launched in 2022 to help corporate partners reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight. The program has enabled the use of over 6,000 tonnes of SAF in 2024 alone, with 16 corporate partners, including major organizations like HSBC, AIA, and Standard Chartered.

Earlier this year, Cathay also entered into agreements with Sinopec and SK Energy to secure SAF supply in Hong Kong and South Korea. These partnerships further underscore Cathay’s commitment to expanding the use of SAF within its network and fostering a regional SAF ecosystem.

DHL’s Global SAF Initiatives

DHL Express has been proactive in scaling SAF usage globally, securing long-term agreements with SAF suppliers such as Neste, BP, and World Energy. Earlier this year, DHL partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing in Japan to use SAF produced in the country for flights departing from Japan. Most recently, DHL completed an agreement with Neste for 7,400 tonnes of SAF for international flights from Singapore Changi Airport.

DHL’s continued efforts to invest in SAF align with its Strategy 2030, particularly the “New Energy” growth sector, which focuses on sustainable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydrogen, as well as alternative fuels like SAF. These initiatives ensure that DHL can meet its net-zero emissions logistics goals by 2050 while supporting the broader adoption of sustainable energy solutions in the logistics industry.

Conclusion: A Commitment to Sustainability

This partnership between DHL Express and Cathay Group marks a significant step in the fight against climate change and showcases the role of the logistics sector in driving the use of sustainable aviation fuel. As both companies work to scale SAF usage across Asia, they are setting an example for the air cargo sector in reducing emissions and transitioning to greener practices.

With both companies leading the charge, the future of air logistics looks greener, and the push for SAF adoption is likely to continue to grow, particularly in Asia where the demand for sustainable practices is on the rise.

The small diameter trees that are thinned during precommercial thinning or wildfire mitigation activities are also regarded as forest biomass when they don’t have marketable value.
Finding a market for this forest biomass, particularly as a bioenergy product, has long been a goal for the forest sector to further offset the costs of managing forestland.
Question: There have been other projects that have studied forest biomass for use as bioenergy in the Pacific Northwest.
Schedule of listening sessions and meeting link The following days and times are set for virtual listening sessions.","On the first stop of the Montesano City Forest tour last month, several 15 to 20 foot-high slash piles served as the backdrop.

These piles are comprised of treetops, small diameter trees and branches, the byproducts of a timber harvest that don’t have marketable value. This material is considered forest biomass, and come winter, it will be burned.

The small diameter trees that are thinned during precommercial thinning or wildfire mitigation activities are also regarded as forest biomass when they don’t have marketable value. Finding a market for this forest biomass, particularly as a bioenergy product, has long been a goal for the forest sector to further offset the costs of managing forestland.

“Since I got here in 2001 to do my master’s, we’ve been looking at ways to use more biomass, to deal with low-value material, and we haven’t cracked the nut yet,” said Elaine Oneil, PhD, executive director of the Washington Farm Forestry Association. “Any effort that can turn over another rock to address an emerging situation, that’s a good thing.”

The latest attempt to crack the nut is being undertaken by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) through a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office-funded study that complements the Billion-Ton Reports the agency has published since 2005. These Billion-Ton Reports assess the “potential biomass resources available in the United States” — the latest report published in 2023 is the fourth assessment.

Francesca Pierobon, a chemical engineer with PNNL, who is leading this study shared via email that “Our study is related to the Billion-Ton Reports, but we are refining the analysis for biomass availability and mobilization pathways in different U.S. regions. In the first year, we are focusing on U.S. Pacific Northwest [Washington and Oregon].”

The study overview describes this three-year study as to “play a critical role in unlocking biomass potential that is currently being underutilized. Additionally, by connecting biomass feedstock producers with bioenergy producers, the proposed project will support the creation of jobs for workers and stakeholders.” A deliverable is Regional Bioenergy Guidelines, “which will incorporate key take-away messages and recommendations about how to enable deployment.”

Throughout August, the research team is holding virtual listening sessions for forest landowners, forestry professionals, agencies and Tribes to learn about the technical, economic and environmental barriers to getting forest biomass to market.

“The target of the listening sessions or outreach really has to be the harvesting and logging community because they need to know where to send stuff,” Oneil said. “And it has to be economical to do it.”

The Daily World spoke with Pierobon to learn more about the reason for this study and its deliverables; Pierobon also has joint appointments with the University of Washington School of Environmental and Forest Sciences as an affiliate assistant professor and the Washington State University-PNNL Bioproducts Institute as a research assistant professor.

What follows is our conversation edited for length and clarity.

Question: There have been other projects that have studied forest biomass for use as bioenergy in the Pacific Northwest. How does this project fit in with this other research?

Pierobon: The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between bioenergy research, community engagement, and policy analysis to understand the perspectives of the different stakeholders. These stakeholders include forestland owners, but also potentially farmers, policy makers, and industry. Their perspectives are very important to understand what are the main drivers and the barriers to bioenergy system adoption in order to identify potential solutions.

We are looking specifically at forest biomass to see how much could be available for integrating into the potential pathways that we are looking at.

Q: What are these pathways?

P: Both existing pathways and those with near-future potential that we have economic and environmental impact assessment on. Existing pathways are mainly for energy production: electricity, steam and pellet, or also biochar production. And then we’re looking at sustainable aviation fuel production; there is a lot of interest from the Department of Energy on sustainable aviation fuel production.

Q: Specifically for forest biomass, what outstanding questions are you trying to answer?

P: We’re trying to understand the perspectives of different groups regarding economic factors, as well as potentially forest health and wildfires. We also want to understand their values; for example, what could be the benefit for community development or what is most important to the different groups and if this project can fit well within that framework.

In terms of economic factors, understanding the issues with potential environmental incentive schemes and carbon payments, logistics, and what prices would actually make a difference for the different stakeholder groups when considering the cost of biomass based on different harvest options, as well as the access to the harvest sites. There is also the training and equipping staff or contractors who do the work and understanding the landowner needs, in terms of management and technical assistance.

There has been a lot of research that analyzed economic, environmental, and social impacts separately, and this study tries to bridge that gap. DOE has invested a lot on figuring out different pathways for bioenergy production and sustainable aviation fuel production but the missing part is the stakeholder perspective and they’re interested in that right now.

Q: What is the role of Washington State University (WSU) in this project?

P: The partnership with WSU is because of their forest extension program. We want as much participation from all the different stakeholders as possible. Our role is to lead the research on the economic and environmental impact assessments and partner with WSU on the outreach.

Q: For the listening sessions, what do you want each respective stakeholder to bring to the discussion?

P: For each of the sessions, there are targeted specific groups — forest landowners versus industry or agency — and there is one session where everyone is invited. There will be an initial presentation, giving a quick overview of the project and what we’re trying to achieve and then there will be a list of open-ended questions regarding different topics where we want to hear from the groups. We would like to capture as many points of view as possible and get a discussion around the most important factors of the project.

Q: From these listening sessions, what will you report back to the Bioenergy Technologies Office?

P: We would like to create a list of different perspectives from each one of the listening sessions where we understand the major concern and things to focus on as the next steps for each of the regions. And for each of the groups, what are the most important things for them and how can we address the current barriers.

González stressed that ethanol from sugarcane would not compete with food production, would lower fuel costs, and could create agricultural jobs.","Mexico’s 2024 energy reform and the new biofuels law in March have opened the door for the country to revive bioethanol and biodiesel production, with potential benefits for state oil company PEMEX and the wider economy.

Experts see significant potential for the country to tap into agricultural surpluses and align with global trends. The Ministry of Energy will issue regulations to implement the law over the next couple of months, which industry specialists say will be critical to coordinate public-private efforts and create incentives to attract capital investment with predictable returns.

Although the new legislation focuses more on biogas, it also opens opportunities to produce bioethanol and biodiesel. However, infrastructure adaptations remain a barrier. Andrés Gutiérrez, Director General and Co-Founder, CIEFSA, shared with Milenio that upgrades typically involve cleaning tanks, updating consoles, installing probes and filters, and other adjustments. “Efficient incentives are needed so that all participants in the biofuel value chain can achieve a faster return on investment.”

Industry specialists argue that mandatory blending mandates will be essential to stimulate domestic production. Currently, more than 70 countries blend 10 to 80% ethanol with gasoline, including Brazil, which has achieved substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. In Mexico, such efforts have been stalled by regulatory restrictions.

Luis Alonso González, technical Advisor to the Association for Biofuel Mobility in Mexico, told La Jornada that the government’s energy plans now include ethanol-gasoline blends for the first time, alongside a target to begin using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2027. One promising route for SAF production is Alcohol-to-Jet technology, which converts biomass-derived alcohols into jet fuel. He emphasized that a robust ethanol market is a prerequisite.

A robust SAF industry had promise of new jobs, domestic energy security, and technological leadership.","The One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in early July, has paralysed progress towards making aviation fuel mainstream in the US. What now?

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill has tarnished the President’s relationship with former chum Elon Musk, but there’s plenty of collateral that hasn’t received nearly as much attention.

The Act, consistent of Trump’s ideologies packed into one neat and tidy file, has heavily targeted plans for renewable infrastructure. Already, federal funding towards developing aviation fuels has received a huge hit and the industry’s recent momentum has been lost.

Aviation is responsible for around 2.5% of yearly global carbon emissions, and there’s little prospect of that figure diminishing, given we have no viable alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. An electric battery capable of powering an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

Before Trump began his second term in the White House, there had been optimism about the industry’s prospects for becoming significantly more sustainable, driven by bold targets. By 2030, the US aimed to produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with the goal of scaling up to supply enough to power all commercial flights by 2050.

That vision now appears entirely pie in the sky, if you’ll pardon the pun.

The administration’s rollback of incentives has sent shockwaves through a sector that was only just beginning to gather steam. Promising SAF startups are already reporting delayed projects, investor pullback, and increased uncertainty around long-term viability.

Without policy stability or federal backing, the high production costs of green fuels make it near impossible to compete with traditional jet fuel, especially in a market now chock-full of deregulation and fossil fuel favouritism.

As you may recall, the previously mentioned bust-up between Musk and Trump was sparked by sweeping slashes on tax credits for electric vehicles – a financial mechanic the Tesla boss had relied on to run his EV empire. The provision has also removed this financial lever for SAF producers, creating what industry insiders describe as a ‘chilling effect’ on the industry’s innovation.

The rot isn’t just applicable to environmental goals, either. A robust SAF industry had promise of new jobs, domestic energy security, and technological leadership. With this all now resting on a knife-edge, these companies don’t have the luxury of thinking big and are focused purely on survival.

The irony is that Trump is shooting himself in the foot, too. Considering he has repeatedly stressed a desire to bring energy production home to native soil, neglecting aviation fuel rubbishes any prospect of the US spearheading a solution to decarbonising a massively-stubborn industry.

Instead, the initiative has been handed to SAF companies in Europe and Asia, where governments are doubling down on green aviation projects. France, the Netherlands, and Japan have ramped up their production targets, recognising not just the ecological imperative but the economic opportunity that comes with propelling the technology forward.

Trump may have clipped America’s wings, but it’s encouraging that other suitors are taking up the challenge.",https://thred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sustainable-aviation.png,N,,2025-08-13 13:56:53.209219

Like the clean fuel programs in British Columbia, California and other U.S. states, the CFR assigns a carbon intensity value to fuels.
Dive Insight: Clean fuel programs in North America have provided a powerful incentive for RNG production.
“Clean fuels programs and, in general, mandates have become increasingly important for RNG to make sense,” Sriha said.
Sriha noted the jump in RNG registration follows a similar pattern seen in U.S. states that have adopted clean fuel programs.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

Environment and Climate Change Canada reported that the volume of fuel registered in the country’s Clean Fuel Regulation program jumped 417% from 2023 to 2024, an analysis by market intelligence firm cCarbon found. That’s a much larger increase than that of any other fuel included in the program, such as ethanol, biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The surge is likely due in part to new projects responding to the recently created market incentive, said Aakanksha Sriha, an associate with cCarbon. Markets for the fuel, including utilities using it for heat and natural gas-powered vehicle fleets that have yet to procure RNG, are also demand drivers for the fuel. “It’s a watershed year,” Sriha said.

This is the second annual report from regulator ECCC, which launched its clean fuels program on July 1, 2023. Like the clean fuel programs in British Columbia, California and other U.S. states, the CFR assigns a carbon intensity value to fuels. It requires producers of certain high-carbon fuels to purchase credits generated by low-carbon fuels like renewable natural gas.

Dive Insight:

Clean fuel programs in North America have provided a powerful incentive for RNG production. That’s especially true for on-farm anaerobic digesters that process manure. Canada’s CFR program, like California’s LCFS, includes a boost to RNG’s carbon intensity score calculated from the emissions avoided by not letting manure decompose without gas capture.

The mechanism, which environmental groups say unnecessarily incentivizes factory farms, gives RNG producers a strong financial incentive to register their fuels with these programs and generate sellable credits. In Canada, fuels can also be registered both with the national CFR program and British Columbia’s LCFS, creating a stacking incentive that further boosts the value of the fuels.

Those incentives matter because the technology used for anaerobic digestion can be expensive and might not otherwise be economical, Sriha said. Additional incentives could further drive adoption of RNG in the heating and electricity sectors, she added.

“Clean fuels programs and, in general, mandates have become increasingly important for RNG to make sense,” Sriha said.

Julie Flynn, who is Canada director for RNG developer Waga Energy, said the CFR program “has acted as a catalyst, accelerating both production and adoption.” The company has four active RNG projects in Canada and one in development, and is currently fielding a bid from private equity investor EQT for a majority stake in the business.

”From our perspective, this regulation has done more than just set targets—it’s created a real market. Utilities have led the charge, but we’re now seeing corporate buyers entering the space, which is a strong signal of long-term confidence in RNG as a decarbonization tool,” Flynn said in an emailed statement.

Sriha noted the jump in RNG registration follows a similar pattern seen in U.S. states that have adopted clean fuel programs. There, incentives encourage a buildout of RNG projects once programs are implemented, due to demand for RNG as a transportation fuel. But the transportation market can become saturated after a few years as most fleets make the switch to RNG, forcing producers to need new end markets to boost demand for their fuel.

“The thing with transport is, once you’ve reached a certain percentage of blending, it becomes stable,” Sriha said.

The Canadian market has the advantage of blending requirements for fuel used for heating, which can be a long-term driver of demand for RNG. Both FortisBC and Énergir — utilities that serve British Columbia and Quebec, respectively —have set minimum RNG procurement requirements. FortisBC touted itself as the first North American utility to automatically allocate 1% RNG into its fuel mix for all of its customers in June 2024.

Quebec regulations also require 5% of the natural gas distributed to utility customers to be RNG in 2025. That requirement ratchets up to 10% in 2030.

Those blending requirements have led to deals with anaerobic digestion companies in the U.S. and Canada. FortisBC inked a 20-year offtake agreement with EverGen Infrastructure subsidiary Fraser Valley Biogas last summer. Énergir signed its own 20-year agreement with Viridi Energy around the same time.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Uwxbe7eVlfQSSQCKcexKmotB_sECNRBsJjbZxs_nZo4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DbGVhbi1FbmVyZ3ktdGltZS1maWxsLXB1bXBzLVJOR0NORy5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-08-13 13:56:57.769557

Biofuels Market Key Growth Drivers

The biofuels market has experienced significant growth owing to ongoing innovations in biofuel technologies, such as second-generation and advanced biofuels are enhancing efficiency, yield, and feedstock flexibility. Developments like algae-based fuels and cellulosic ethanol make biofuels more viable and scalable, reducing reliance on food-based crops, and improving the overall sustainability of biofuel production.

Another key factor driving the market growth is the transportation sector, especially aviation, and road freight, is increasingly seeking sustainable fuel alternatives to meet decarbonization goals. Biofuels, specifically biodiesel and bioethanol, have an immediacy in use since they fit straight to the engines and existing infrastructure. With their ability to reduce lifecycle emissions, they are a preferred option by environmentally conscious fleet operators and logistics companies.

Recent Developments in Biofuels Market

In May 2025, UK‑based HutanBio released a lifecycle assessment confirming its proprietary HBx microalgal biofuel achieves net‑negative emissions—removing up to 1.48 t CO₂e per tonne in Morocco, the Middle East, and Australia. This milestone marks a scalable, transparent benchmark for algal biofuel sustainability.

In May 2025, Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech shipped its first cargo of SAF (13,400 tonnes) from its east‑China plant to Europe. This follows the award of a 2025 export license and marks the company's entry into international low‑carbon aviation fuel exports.

In April 2025, Repsol and Bunge partnered to integrate camelina and safflower crops into Europe's renewable fuel supply. Hydrotreated vegetable oils (HVOs) and sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are derived from these intermediates, which have reduced lifecycle emissions by up to 90% and increased low-carbon crop use.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/35c459bdec4cc55ad6576b279537f54f,N,,2025-08-13 15:56:32.812149

Truth be told, both things are moonshot endeavors, and neither is really happening at scale, yet. But CO2 pipelines still have real momentum—towels are not being thrown in—and there’s overwhelming consensus that ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) simply must happen for global SAF goals to be met. These parallel industry pursuits—necessary, inevitable or both—converge in this issue through the lenses of policy, economics, science and legacy.

In “Angle of Ascent,” on page 14, we take a pragmatic look at the near- and mid-term profitability of SAF derived from alcohol. ETJ is widely expected to be a major piece of the global SAF movement—perhaps larger than HEFA, ultimately—but the profitability of making the fuel will unquestionably hinge on state, federal and international incentives. Our story is based mostly on presentations given at this summer’s International Fuel Ethanol Workshop & Expo, which took place prior to the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the 45Z enhancements housed within it (which should have a favorable impact on SAF economics). But nothing in the bill changes the fact that ETJ will require low-carbon production strategies and creative business plans that fully leverage stackable incentives for ethanol-based SAF and its coproducts.

Next, in “Unleashing Ethanol’s Potential,” on page 22, we bring you highlights and key takeaways from the FEW. The industry’s big summer event, once again in Omaha, Nebraska, was one of the best in memory with nearly 2,500 participants representing 45 U.S. states, 30 countries and, most importantly, over 94% of the installed ethanol production capacity in America. Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper gave this year’s keynote, delivering a mid-year state of the industry speech that focused on industry priorities under the second Trump administration. The policy panel that followed dove deeper into many of the same legislative and regulatory issues. And the FEW’s annual awards presentation was, once again, full of inspiring stories, which our coverage includes.

On page 28, we bring you “The Legacy of Bob Lundeen,” a piece about the life and work of the late founder of Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland, a 48 MMgy ethanol plant in Nebraska. Through the memories and reflections of Lundeen’s wife and daughter, as well as others, we get to know this special industry leader, a one-of-kind entrepreneur who made a lasting impact on not only his friends and family, but his community and, indeed, the greater ethanol industry. MAAPW is pursuing CCS, participating in the planned Tallgrass Trailblazer CO2 pipeline, which was perhaps Lundeen’s final career aspiration.

In the United States, the SAF Grand Challenge—a multi‑agency initiative led by DOE, USDA, and DOT—set two numeric goals that are publicly documented: 3 billion gallons per year of domestic SAF by 2030 and sufficient SAF (about 35 billion gallons per year) to meet 100% of projected domestic aviation fuel demand by 2050. These goals are recorded across DOE and Biomass R&D Board materials and have been reiterated by federal agencies.

The Turning Point: U.S. Policy Shift

In July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law. Legal and policy advisories summarising the statute report material changes to clean‑energy tax incentives, including provisions that reduce or eliminate certain SAF‑related credits on specific timelines and alter eligibility/stacking rules. Given that tax credits have been a core driver for early‑stage SAF economics, the law represents a tightening of federal support relative to prior policy. This update reflects the verified substance of the act without extrapolating beyond publicly available legal summaries.

Where SAF Stands Today

Global SAF output remains small but growing. IATA stated that SAF production is expected to reach ~2.0–2.1 million tonnes in 2025, representing ~0.7% of total jet‑fuel needs. On emissions, both Our World in Data and the IEA place aviation at around 2.5% of global energy‑related CO₂ emissions in recent assessments. These numbers are widely cited across industry and policy sources and are consistent over the past year.

Prices and the Cost Gap

The cost gap between conventional jet fuel and SAF is well documented, but precise spot prices vary by region and contract structure. For a conventional benchmark, the U.S. DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported an average U.S. airline fuel cost of about $2.32 per gallon in December 2024. Multiple industry analyses (including Argus/airlines.org dashboards, RMI, peer‑reviewed literature, and law‑firm/market notes) show indicative SAF prices several dollars per gallon higher—often in a mid‑single to low‑double‑digit $/gal range depending on pathway and credits. Because exact SAF prices are volatile and thinly traded, this draft avoids a single point estimate and instead presents the verified directional gap.

Feedstocks and Brand Involvement

SAF can be produced from waste oils and fats (HEFA), alcohol‑to‑jet (ATJ) routes using ethanol or isobutanol, Fischer–Tropsch pathways using biomass‑derived syngas, and other approved methods under ASTM D7566. Engine and aircraft OEMs—including Boeing, Airbus, Rolls‑Royce, and GE Aerospace—have public test programmes and compatibility statements for SAF within approved blend limits. Airlines such as United Airlines, British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Virgin Atlantic, Emirates and others have disclosed SAF purchase agreements, trials, or one‑off 100% SAF demonstration flights under special approvals. These brand references reflect public disclosures and do not rely on unverified claims.

What’s Approved to Fly

Under ASTM D7566/D1655, most SAF pathways today are certified up to a 50% blend with conventional jet fuel, with some specific pathways limited to 10%. FAA and industry materials confirm ongoing R&D to enable higher blend ratios. Commercial service flights generally use blends; neat (100%) SAF has been flown only under demonstration or special approval conditions and is not the prevailing operational standard.

The European Approach

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation set a legally binding SAF mandate beginning in 2025 at 2% of fuel supplied at EU airports, with scheduled increases over time (e.g., 6% in 2030 and higher levels thereafter). The EU has also advanced funding mechanisms and reference price frameworks to narrow the cost gap and stimulate supply. These details are documented by EU Commission materials and related industry guidance.

Investment Signals and Uncertainty

Industry groups and market reporting indicate that policy stability is a primary catalyst for capital investment in new SAF capacity. The combination of a global mandate trajectory in the EU and credit changes in the U.S. creates mixed signals for developers and airlines planning multi‑year offtake agreements. This section reflects verified trends from IATA communications, EU policy documents, and recent market reporting without speculating on individual company outcomes.

Implications for the Sector

For airlines, the main verified issues are supply availability, cost pass‑through, and compliance with schemes such as CORSIA for international flights. For producers, the challenges include feedstock access, capital intensity, and policy‑driven demand signals. For OEMs, the focus remains on fuel certification and preparing for higher‑blend compatibility in engines and aircraft systems. These are consistent themes across IATA, IEA, FAA/ASTM, and EU materials.

Removed or Rephrased Items

Removed: A singular point estimate claiming a specific SAF price per gallon (market too illiquid/variable for a universal figure).

Rephrased: The description of U.S. measures as general “budget cuts” now specifies tax‑credit changes and eligibility/phaseout provisions, which are directly documented in reputable legal summaries of the law.

Clarified: U.S. targets for 2050 are explicitly tied to the SAF Grand Challenge goal of meeting 100% of projected domestic aviation fuel demand with SAF, not a blanket statement that all Flights presently will run on SAF by that date.

How Brands Can Respond

Plan for blended operations: Align procurement and fleet operations with ASTM‑approved blend limits and published OEM guidance.

Diversify offtake: Consider multi‑pathway portfolios (HEFA, ATJ, FT) to manage feedstock and price risk.

Leverage mandates and incentives: Map exposure to EU mandates and evaluate the post‑2025 U.S. credit landscape to structure bankable contracts.

Support certification R&D: Participate in industry efforts to raise blend limits and cut testing/approval timelines.

Disclose with precision: Report SAF volumes, blend ratios, and lifecycle accounting methods consistent with CORSIA/EU frameworks.

The project, led by Dr Rahman Daiyan in collaboration with industry partners, is receiving over $4 million in total investment, including a $1.2 million grant from the TRaCE Lab to Market Fund.

The innovative electrolyser system transforms carbon dioxide and water into precursors that can ultimately be converted into green fuel for aircraft, offering a promising pathway to reducing the aviation sector’s greenhouse gas emissions.

The funding, provided through TRaCE (Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy), a program established by the Australian Department of Education, has been bolstered by additional industry partner contributions, raising the total to $4.2 million.

The investment aims to achieve a significant breakthrough in aviation emissions reduction by supporting technology that is notoriously difficult to decarbonise.

The UNSW-led project involves Dr Rahman Daiyan, Scientia Professor Rose Amal, and Adjunct Professor Jimmy Yun, and partners with Australian company Tjindu Power and China’s Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) Technology Company, a prominent clean tech developer.

The research team has already developed a low-cost carbon dioxide electrolyser system using transition metal and carbon catalysts, designed to integrate with the well-established Fischer-Tropsch process to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

Dr Daiyan, a Scientia Fellow in the School of Mineral and Energy Resources Engineering, said: “Our goal is to revolutionise how we produce clean fuels for aviation, using renewable energy to transform CO₂ into usable fuels without requiring costly infrastructure changes.

“This technology could be the key to decarbonising aviation, one of the world’s most challenging sectors.”

Decarbonising aviation remains a leading challenge on the road to net zero, with the sector responsible for an estimated 2-3 per cent of global emissions and few viable alternatives to conventional jet fuel.

While many clean energy solutions are in development, most remain expensive, energy-intensive, and not yet ready for large-scale adoption.

Professor Amal, from UNSW’s School of Chemical Engineering, added: “This breakthrough proves that with smart catalyst design and integrated system thinking, we can transform waste CO₂ into the very fuels that drive our economy.

“It’s the kind of scalable innovation we need to tackle hard-to-abate sectors and achieve net zero.”

The TRaCE grant will help propel the project from proof-of-concept in the laboratory (technology readiness level 4) to a validated prototype suitable for real-world environments (level 6).

To support commercialisation, a spin-out company, Gurung Fuel, has been established to drive business development and engage stakeholders.

Adjunct Professor Yun of Chuangqi Times (Qingdao) said: “This partnership is a major step towards scaling the cutting-edge electrolyser technology.

“We’re not just developing a solution, we are creating a game-changer for the aviation industry, with the potential to make a global impact.”

Beyond environmental benefits, the project represents a strategic opportunity for Australia to bolster its fuel security.

Aviation is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity in our hyper-connected world. Whether for business, leisure, or logistics, air travel enables us to traverse continents in hours.

Behind this seamless mobility lies a quiet revolution in materials science: the widespread use of fibre-reinforced polymer composites. Compared to traditional metals like aluminium, these composites drastically reduce aircraft weight which directly translates into fuel savings and lower carbon emissions per passenger-kilometre.

In today’s modern aircraft, polymer composites make up more than 50% of structural components, including the fuselage, wings, empennage, and radome.

The secret behind their strength and lightness lies in their architecture: strong and stiff carbon fibres embedded in an epoxy resin matrix. Think of the epoxy as a pancake—initially a pourable liquid, it cures into a stable, irreversible solid by thermal treatment.

Through decades of innovation in design and certification, composite aerostructures have matured into industry-standard technology. But a hard truth remains: they are designed to last, not to come apart—and therein lies the sustainability challenge.

Is it a circular business?

When aviation companies showcase their environmental progress, the headlines often focus on alternative fuels: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen propulsion, or electrification. These innovations are indeed crucial.

However, what rarely enters the public spotlight is the end-of-life dilemma facing aerospace materials.

Composite structures, despite their energy efficiency in flight, are rarely recyclable. Once cured, thermoset polymer matrices resist reshaping or melting. When aircraft are decommissioned, these durable materials are mostly landfilled or, at best, incinerated, sharing a fate with wind turbine blades which use similar technologies.

Several efforts have emerged to address this. Pyrolysis and solvolysis can extract short carbon fibres from waste composites, and these can find second life in non-structural automotive or construction parts. However, these methods are energy-intensive, and they downgrade the fibre properties as well as preventing closed-loop recycling.

What this reveals is a structural contradiction: we’re applying circular economy principles to fuels, but not to the materials that form the aircraft itself. The consequence is a growing stockpile of highly engineered, high-carbon-footprint waste. If we can find ways to retain or recover the value of these materials, we not only reduce waste but also lessen our dependence on virgin petrochemical inputs.

From a performance perspective, carbon fibres remain irreplaceable. But the feedstock used to make them need not be fossil-based. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), the standard precursor, is energy-intensive to produce. However, recent studies have shown promising routes to generate carbon fibres from renewable lignocellulosic biomass.

Additionally, polymer matrix can be engineered using renewable starting materials which possess similar properties to petroleum derived parts. If brought to scale, this could dramatically cut the embedded emissions of next-gen composite parts.

Meanwhile, several new frontlines are reshaping the sustainability landscape. High-performance thermoplastic composites offer another route. Unlike thermosets, thermoplastics can be reheated and reshaped multiple times. Their growing adoption suggests a future where structural parts could be manufactured, joined, disassembled, and reused more readily. However, their processing and raw materials still remain a significant hurdle towards sustainability.

Vitrimers are thermosetting polymers with dynamic covalent bonds. Unlike traditional thermosets, vitrimers can be reshaped or reprocessed with heat, while still maintaining excellent mechanical stability during use. This enables both repair and recycling while their composite manufacturing is compatible with current industrial standards.

Frontal polymerisation is an emerging technique that enables ultra-fast curing of thermosetting composites with minimal energy input. By localising the reaction zone and propagating it through the material like a flame front, this approach cuts down on manufacturing time and energy hence contributes to sustainable manufacturing of parts.

There is a global effort on sculpting sustainable aerostructures. While some technologies are still at low technology readiness level, their payoff at improved levels will be significant: a future in which high-performance materials no longer carry a high environmental cost.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage, and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops—turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport, and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol,, or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All of these approaches—and others being explored as well—aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes, and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging $2.34 per gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 per gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand: Starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump, and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes, and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research and investment from governments, manufacturers, and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.

It sources crude tall oil from a nearby pulp mill, as well as from other facilities in Finland and the United States.
Olli Lahdenperä, head of renewable fuels at St1, said the market supply of tall oil is insufficient for multiple producers.
“Only about two million tonnes of tall oil is available, and just a third of that is used in fuel production,” Lahdenperä said.
Most funding has gone into electric boiler systems, but none of the projects will increase SAF production.","Petri Rekonen, director of the Lappeenranta biorefinery, said UPM has already tested the fuel in a dual-engine turboprop aircraft. One engine ran on renewable fuel produced at the plant, the other on conventional jet fuel.

“The results show our fuel performs well in aircraft,” Rekonen said.

UPM is waiting for international approval to use tall oil as a SAF feedstock. The approval process through ASTM, a global standard-setting body, takes about two and a half years. Once granted, UPM will decide whether to launch full-scale SAF production.

The Lappeenranta plant has an annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes of renewable diesel and naphtha. It sources crude tall oil from a nearby pulp mill, as well as from other facilities in Finland and the United States.

One tonne of pulp yields 20 to 30 kilograms of tall oil. Due to its limited availability, the substance is also used to produce animal feed, paints, adhesives and plant-based sterols for cholesterol treatment.

While UPM focuses on tall oil, St1 is exploring other forest-based materials. In cooperation with Swedish forestry company SCA, St1 plans a biorefinery in Östrand, Sweden. The facility would use sawdust, bark and other industrial wood residues to produce SAF and e-fuels.

Olli Lahdenperä, head of renewable fuels at St1, said the market supply of tall oil is insufficient for multiple producers.

“Only about two million tonnes of tall oil is available, and just a third of that is used in fuel production,” Lahdenperä said.

The Östrand refinery would use feedstocks currently used for heat generation. The site would also process logging residues, which are largely unused in Sweden. Half of the refinery’s output would be SAF and the rest e-fuels.

Lahdenperä said the investment, estimated in the billions of euros, would only proceed if long-term pricing support is introduced for e-fuels.

“A mechanism is needed to guarantee price stability for at least ten years,” he said. The facility could begin operations in the early 2030s.

Neste is also developing technologies to expand its use of forest waste and lignocellulosic biomass. The company already sources used cooking oil and animal fat for fuel production, but sees limited room for growth in waste-based inputs.

Carl Nyberg, head of renewable products sales at Neste, said the company is researching new feedstocks to scale production.

“We have the capability to use tall oil,” Nyberg said, adding that the firm has also studied the energy potential of lignocellulosic materials for some time.

Neste estimates that renewable fuels based on forest residues could eventually replace the energy content of 350 million tonnes of crude oil.

Since January 2025, EU regulations require all jet fuel sold at major European airports to contain at least two percent SAF. That figure will rise to 70 percent by 2050.

Marie Owens Thomsen, chief economist at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said SAF will be critical to reaching aviation’s 2050 net-zero targets. Most production technologies are still under development or in pilot stages.

“All possible feedstocks and technologies must be used,” Thomsen said. She added that each region must rely on its natural advantages. For the Nordic countries, these include forest residues and renewable electricity.

Thomsen criticised the lack of financial incentives for SAF production. She compared the situation to early wind and solar investments, which received annual global funding of USD 150 billion during market formation.

“That same level of investment is now needed for SAF,” she said.

Thomsen also noted that current market dynamics favour fossil fuel production due to higher returns. Still, she expects SAF prices to decline in the coming years, despite an oversupply that exists today.

In Finland, investment in green energy is rising. Data from the Confederation of Finnish Industries shows EUR 233 million in fossil fuel replacement projects will be completed this year. Most funding has gone into electric boiler systems, but none of the projects will increase SAF production.

July saw a striking contrast between ambitious policymaking and the continued drag on hydrogen project delivery. Although governments in Germany, the UK and the EU have taken steps to speed up planning approvals, clarify regulations and unlock funding, infrastructure projects are still facing delays, and cancellations continue to occur. From new national legislation to final investment decisions and revised subsidy schemes, this month underscores the growing tension between policy acceleration and market execution.

This edition of Hydrogen Compass has been authored by Giulia Cannatelli (gcannatelli@westwoodenergy.com). Please do share any comments or feedback you might have. The next edition will be published in September.

Policy Acceleration: Governments Step In

Governments are clearly signalling that the hydrogen rollout must pick up speed. Germany’s Ministry for Economic Affairs proposed a Hydrogen Acceleration Act, aiming to fast track planning and approval processes for hydrogen projects, including electrolysers, pipelines and import terminals by granting them overriding public interest status – a legal designation that prioritises these projects in planning processes and shields them from certain legal challenges. The law would also include CCS-enabled hydrogen, signalling a pragmatic shift to encompass climate-neutral options amid stalled deployment.

The UK government announced it will publish an updated hydrogen strategy in autumn 2025 – its first major revision since 2021 – to improve and fast-track delivery against its 10GW by 2030 target. The update will be accompanied by a refreshed low-carbon hydrogen strategy and plans for future subsidy rounds. While the first hydrogen allocation round (HAR 1), backed only 125MW, upcoming HAR 3 and HAR 4 rounds are expected to allocate up to 1.5GW in total, alongside new support for hydrogen transport, storage and industrial decarbonisation. The UK has also launched a consultation to allow up to 2% hydrogen blending into the national gas grid, a step up from the current 0.1% cap. While this would provide a limited offtake route for electrolytic hydrogen projects, the government has clarified that the aim is not decarbonisation but rather to act as an “offtaker of last resort” – offering a guaranteed offtake for producers struggling to secure commercial buyers due to delays in dedicated hydrogen infrastructure or insufficient demand from end-users.

At EU level, RED III non-compliance triggered legal action against 26 member states, illustrating how policy ambition still outpaces national implementation. RED III requires countries to transpose renewable hydrogen targets for transport and industry into national law by the 21 May deadline. The European Commission is allowing a two-month window for countries to respond and implement the mandates. Only Denmark was excluded from proceedings, having passed partial legislation including a 0.9% RFNBO transport fuel mandate. Although Denmark did not introduce the required 42% industrial hydrogen mandate, the Commission may have deemed its subsidy regime sufficient to meet the target — or judged that its industrial profile did not warrant a mandate. Meanwhile, Finland did claim partial compliance, and Spain, France and the Netherlands have draft laws pending, but none have been formally finalised or notified to the Commission.

Separately, the European Commission published its Delegated Act on low-carbon hydrogen, introducing complex GHG accounting rules and strict methane thresholds. While welcomed for bringing regulatory clarity, the act has also drawn criticism for being overly bureaucratic and potentially deterring investment.

Project Delivery: Progress and Setbacks

Despite regulatory momentum, delivering projects continues to show uneven progress. Air Liquide made a final investment decision in July on the ELYgator project, a €500mn, 200MW electrolyser in Rotterdam. Backed by Dutch and EU funding, the project is on track for commissioning by 2027 and will supply hydrogen to TotalEnergies and other industrial users.

By contrast, the Hydric project in Puertollano, Spain – once set to deliver 200MW – has been cancelled by Repsol and RIC Energy after feasibility studies found it economically unviable. Although Repsol had been lined up as the sole offtaker and the project has received public funding, the developers cited construction challenges and high costs as decisive factors.

Elsewhere Gasunie confirmed delays to its national hydrogen backbone, now postponed to 2033, with permitting and labour shortages driving costs from €1.5bn to €3.8bn. Spain’s Enagás admitted that the H2Med corridor may not be operational until 2032.

These bottlenecks reinforce that regulatory frameworks and incentives alone cannot deliver infrastructure. Timelines and permitting remain persistent challenges.

Targeted Funding: Supporting the Right Projects

Despite delivery risks, funding activity remains high, with several countries progressing auctions or direct subsidies. The table below highlights funding announcements from July:",https://www.westwoodenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Webpage-Header-H2Compass.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 08:56:14.303333

DHL Express and Cathay Group sign new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) deal to drive production and uptake in Asia

By DHL

DHL Express purchases 2,400 metric tons of SAF from Cathay Group to be used on flights operated by Air Hong Kong, an express all-cargo carrier and wholly owned subsidiary of Cathay.

The SAF will be used on Air Hong Kong flights departing from Seoul Incheon, Tokyo Narita and Singapore Changi airports.

The new agreement underscores both parties' commitment to lower-carbon air logistics and driving the production and use of SAF for the air cargo sector.

HONG KONG SAR/SINGAPORE - Media OutReach Newswire - 13 August 2025 - DHL Express and the Cathay Group have entered into a new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnership that reinforces their shared commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the air cargo industry. Under the agreement, Cathay will supply DHL Express with 2,400 metric tons of SAF for international flights departing from three airports in Asia namely Seoul Incheon International Airport, Tokyo Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport. These flights are operated by Air Hong Kong, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Cathay Group, which principally operates express cargo services for DHL Express.

Continuing through 2025, the partnership is expected to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7,190 metric tons —equivalent to the emissions of over 100 flights from Hong Kong to Singapore with an Airbus 330 freighter.

""Sustainable aviation fuel currently accounts for less than 1% of the total global jet fuel consumption, yet air transport is one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand,"" said Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations and Aviation – Asia Pacific, DHL Express. ""DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia. Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group's Strategy 2030, which recognizes 'green logistics of choice' as one of the four bottom lines.""

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong. For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express's Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

""This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network. SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia,"" said Tom Owen, Director Cargo, Cathay.

This collaboration makes DHL Express the latest strategic partner of Cathay's Corporate SAF Program, an initiative launched in 2022 to support corporate partners in addressing greenhouse gas emissions from business travel and airfreight through the use of SAF. In 2024, the Corporate SAF Program enabled the use of over 6,000 metric tons of SAF, with a record 16 partners participating, including HSBC, AIA and Standard Chartered.

Cathay has been steadily expanding its SAF efforts across the region. Earlier in 2025, the Group entered into an agreement with Sinopec to uplift SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland at Hong Kong International Airport, marking the first such export by Sinopec to Hong Kong. Additionally, Cathay has partnered with SK Energy to secure SAF supply in South Korea from 2025 to 2027. Apart from working closely with suppliers, the Group also co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) to collectively drive policy development and adoption of SAF locally. These initiatives reflect Cathay's mission to expand the use of SAF within its network and foster a regional SAF ecosystem.

Investments in SAF are therefore critical to ensuring its availability on a long-term and predictable basis. DHL Express has also been a frontrunner in scaling SAF uptake globally, securing long-term SAF agreements with multiple partners, including Neste, bp, and World Energy. Earlier this year, DHL Express also partnered with Cosmo Oil Marketing to use SAF produced in Japan for flights departing the country. Most recently, DHL Express completed an agreement with Neste that comprises 7,400 metric tons of SAF for international flights departing from Singapore Changi Airport, further demonstrating the company's proactive approach to driving SAF demand and supply across the region.

These efforts will also enhance DHL's understanding of how to transport these alternative fuels, as it is a segment under its Strategy 2030's key growth sector, ""New Energy."" DHL Group is developing end-to-end logistics solutions for eight segments: wind, solar, electric vehicle (EV) and batteries, battery and energy storage systems, EV charging, grid, alternative fuel and hydrogen.

The plant, 80km south-west of Seoul, will be built by the LG Chem and Enilive joint venture, LG-Eni BioRefining, and is scheduled for completion in 2027. It aims to process approximately 400,000 tonnes of renewable bio-feedstock annually.

HVO and SAF, whose demand is expected to surge driven by renewable fuel mandates, are made by hydrogenating more sustainable vegetable oils such as Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and other waste and residues through Ecofining, a technology developed by Eni in collaboration with Honeywell UOP.

Taking into account the entire product value chain, HVO and SAF greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced, compared with traditional fossil fuels.

“LG Chem is transforming its portfolio to build a low-carbon foundation that ensures both a progressively more sustainable growth and profitability,” said Shin Hak-cheol, CEO of LG Chem. “By advancing innovation in renewable fuels and bio-based feedstocks like HVO, we aim to strengthen our global competitiveness and meet our customers’ evolving needs efficiently.”

Stefano Ballista, Enilive’s CEO, said the Seosan biorefinery breaking ground reaffirms its strategy to offer increasingly sustainable products and position itself as a leader in biofuels production.

“Together with the plants that are already operational in Italy and in the US, and with new biorefining plants under construction in Italy and Malaysia, the upcoming biorefining plant in Daesan will contribute to reach our 2030 target to increase our biorefining capacity to over 5 million tonnes per year, with the potential to produce more than 2 million tonnes per year of SAF.”

By integrating HVO into its supply chain, LG Chem plans to reduce carbon emissions and expand its portfolio of ISCC PLUS-certified bio-circular balanced (BCB) products.

Target applications include acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for electronics and automobiles, ethylene-vinyl acetate for sporting goods, and super absorbent polymers for hygiene products.

LG Chem is also teaming up with South Korean steel manufacturer Posco Holdings to pilot carbon capture and utilisation technology that converts CO2 from steelmaking into synthetic gas for reuse in industrial processes.

The demonstration project, part of South Korea’s national CCU Mega Project, will see CO2 captured at Posco’s Pohang steelworks and processed using LG Chem’s dry methane reforming technology.

“Our decision to expand our SAF usage in Asia with Cathay is another important step that we have taken to drive momentum in SAF production and demand.

“DHL Express is at the forefront of SAF adoption, and we look forward to seeing more partners and customers join us on this journey to build a more robust SAF ecosystem in Asia.

“Our continued investment in this area aligns with DHL Group’s Strategy 2030, which recognises ‘green logistics of choice’ as one of the four bottom lines.” ​

This SAF deal builds on the long-standing partnership between DHL Express and the Cathay Group, including through Air Hong Kong.

For more than two decades, Air Hong Kong has played a vital role in DHL Express’s Asia Pacific network. This latest collaboration builds on that strong foundation and paves the way for deeper cooperation in advancing SAF.

Tom Owen, Cathay Director Cargo said: “This partnership marks the first SAF uplift on Air Hong Kong flights, a key milestone for Cathay as we continue to expand the SAF usage across our global network.

“SAF remains a core pillar of our strategy to address our carbon emissions, and collaboration is essential to scaling its use. We are excited to be working with like-minded partners like DHL Express to make SAF more accessible and scalable, particularly in Asia.”",https://caasint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/08/Screenshot-458-scaled-e1755078122380.png,N,,2025-08-13 07:57:06.111732

What is a specified source feedstock?
Under California’s LCFS, specified source feedstocks (SSFS) are byproduct fats, oils and greases from commercial or industrial processes.
Why this matters for producers The new SSFS attestation rule elevates compliance standards and places greater accountability across the feedstock supply chain.
For renewable fuel producers, the implications are serious:","As of July 2025, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard requires renewable fuel producers using specified source feedstocks to secure attestation letters reaching back to the point of origin. This marks a significant shift in compliance expectations, creating new challenges for producers to document and verify every step of their supply chain.

What is a specified source feedstock?

Under California’s LCFS, specified source feedstocks (SSFS) are byproduct fats, oils and greases from commercial or industrial processes. Examples include:

• Used cooking oil

• Animal fats and fish oil

• Distiller’s corn or sorghum oil

• Yellow or brown grease

These feedstocks are used in pathways for biodiesel, renewable diesel, alternative jet fuel and coprocessed refinery products. SSFS pathways can qualify for a reduced carbon intensity (CI) score, making them especially valuable for producers seeking to maximize LCFS credit generation. But with this benefit comes stricter oversight, producers must now provide evidence of chain of custody from the point of origin through delivery to the fuel production facility.

The requirement in detail

Under the amended LCFS, each entity in the SSFS supply chain must now maintain a supplier attestation letter. Covered entities include points of origin, collectors, aggregators, traders, distributors and storage facilities involved from the feedstock’s origin through delivery to the fuel producer.

The attestation letter must:

1. Confirm feedstock integrity

• No additional processing (such as drying or cleanup) beyond what is explicitly included in the pathway life cycle analysis and carbon intensity (CI).

2. Verify truth and accuracy

• Feedstocks meet the definitions approved by the Executive Officer during fuel pathway validation and certification.

• Deliveries match feedstock transfer documents and are not mixed with other materials.

• Feedstocks were not intentionally produced, modified or contaminated to meet the definition of an SSFS.

3. Meet strict documentation standards

• On company letterhead.

• Separate letter for each specified source feedstock.

• Signed by an authorized representative of the supplier.

• Maintained by the supplier and submitted electronically upon request by a CARB accredited verifier, verification body or the Executive Officer.

Looking ahead, starting with the 2026 data year for all pathway reports, crop-based feedstocks will also require attestations from the point of origin through the first gathering point, including submission of farm level geographical shapefiles or coordinates—an added step that will demand both time and resources.

CARB guidance still developing

Although the SSFS requirement is already in effect, the California Air Resources Board is still developing implementation guidance. Key questions remain unanswered, particularly: what happens if a producer cannot obtain 100% of the required attestations?

It is not yet clear whether missing attestations will trigger a qualified positive statement through third-party verification, or more severe consequences. While it seems unlikely CARB will immediately classify such situations as adverse verification statements, the risk remains until guidance is finalized.

Why this matters for producers

The new SSFS attestation rule elevates compliance standards and places greater accountability across the feedstock supply chain. For renewable fuel producers, the implications are serious:",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Danielle_Anderson_6714d97a0d.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 07:57:36.240400

The tariff-free quota introduced by the deal represents the entire size of the UK market.","The Government has under a week to save Britain’s bioethanol industry from collapse, leaders from the country’s biggest plant have warned.

Vivergo Fuels has told ministers that it needs a decision over its future from the Government by next Monday (18 August) or else it will be forced to start the irreversible process of closing on that day.

The bioethanol plant helps underpin £24.8 billion (€28.7 billion) in potential growth over the next 25 years for Hull and the surrounding area, with at least £7.3 billion (€8.5 billion) directly dependent on Vivergo.

Meld Energy, which has signed a £1.25 billion (€1.45 billion) letter of intent with Vivergo to build a Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility in Hull warned that without a bioethanol plant at Saltend Chemicals Park, it could be forced to look to invest overseas instead.

Negotiations between the Government and Britain’s bioethanol industry began in June and are now in their final phase.

Britain’s bioethanol industry was plunged into crisis by the Government’s decision to axe a 19% tariff on US bioethanol imports, allowing cheap, subsidised American fuel to flood the UK market.

In the just over 100 days between when the US-UK trade deal was announced on 8 May and the end of this week, the plant will have shouldered almost £10 million in losses. This equates to around £3 million (€3.5 million) per month, or £36 million (€41 million) per year.

The industry had already been in talks with Government over the UK’s unfair regulatory system that favours overseas producers, but the trade deal was a hammer blow for Britain’s domestic industry.

Bosses from the Ensus plant in Redcar, the other major bioethanol producer in the UK, joined Vivergo’s leadership in writing to the Prime Minister in May warning him their plants would close without immediate Government action as the deal rendered their businesses “commercially unviable”.

The trade agreement introduced a tariff-free quota of 1.4 billion litres, allowing US firms to sell their heavily subsidised ethanol into the British market, no longer requiring a 19% import tariff which was originally levied to help British producers compete on a more level playing field.

The tariff-free quota introduced by the deal represents the entire size of the UK market.

This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery.
The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.
“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production.
Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","On the occasion of World Biodiesel Day, MOL Group highlights a recent milestone in its energy transition journey. Sustainable aviation fuel has been successfully produced for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery during a pilot project to process biocomponent, as well as a significant volume of renewable diesel HVO . This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These underscore the company’s technological readiness and strategic commitment to alternative fuel development in meeting EU climate targets and enhancing regional energy security.

The successful pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was implemented in cooperation with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor of the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit, with the aim of testing the co-processing of 5% POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent – a by-product of palm oil production) with fossil feedstocks. During the pilot, 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) standard for sustainable biofuels.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties. During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14 analysis) was carried out by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF. HVO was produced using oil from cashew nut shells and the biocomponent produced this way was processed together with crude oil. In case of SAF, partially refined cooking oil was processed with the traditional raw material. The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

MOL Group had been using the co-processing method at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for years: the process reduces the emissions of traditional fuels by mixing plant residues, as the bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously directly during production.

Renewable fuels play a key role in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already a key player in both the Hungarian and regional biofuel markets, with hydrotreated vegetable oil produced from waste, i.e., renewable feedstock, being among the most climate-friendly fuel options, and ranks among the pioneers in Europe when it comes to the production of aviation biofuels.

“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production. This readiness underscores our strategic commitment to sustainable mobility—whether in road or air transport. For us, becoming a complex mobility service provider means offering an increasingly diverse range of fuels, thus creating all the necessary conditions for a smart energy transition for our customers. We are already playing a leading role in this process in the region, and we are determined to maintain this position through continued investments and innovation.” – said Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President, Fuels at MOL Group.

MOL Group is continuously researching and developing new possibilities for the production and use of biofuels. In partnership with Budapest Airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Supply Llc., MOL Group launched commercial testing of SAF in 2022 in Hungary. Building on this, the company now sells SAF as part of its regular operations in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, in quantities equivalent to approximately 14 kilotons of biocomponents.

SAF can only be produced from classic renewable feedstocks (such as materials of vegetable origin) or waste, but it should meet the same technical and environmental specifications as conventional kerosene. Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The current and projected global supply of SAF falls significantly short of demand, as reflected in prices. This is why MOL Group’s developments are of strategic importance, both from a climate protection and supply security perspective.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/New-Project-213.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 02:57:03.245968

P.A.N.”, nell’ambito di una collaborazione con Enilive e con la Ricerca e Sviluppo di Eni.

Le attività sono state organizzate e coordinate dalla Divisione Aerea di Sperimentazione Aeronautica del Comando Logistico dell’Aeronautica Militare con il contributo della Direzione degli Armamenti Aeronautici e per l’Aeronavigabilità e in collaborazione con la Leonardo.

Il progetto si sviluppa in aderenza all’entrata in vigore del regolamento ReFuel EU Aviation (Fit for 55), che a partire dal 2025 impone ai fornitori di carburante per l’aviazione di garantire quote crescenti di componente ecosostenibili (Sustainable Aviation Fuels – S.A.F) nel Jet Fuel da mettere a disposizione degli operatori aerei negli aeroporti dell’Unione Europea.

Il carburante utilizzato durante il test contiene il 30×100 di SAF, è stato realizzato con materie prime al 100×100 rinnovabili nella bioraffineria Enilive di Gela, in linea con i requisiti tecnici definiti dal Reparto Tecnologie Materiali Aeronautici e Spaziali (R.T.M.A.S.), e la Leonardo, quale produttore del T-346A, ne ha preventivamente verificato la compatibilità con gli impianti di alimentazione del velivolo per la sicurezza dell’aeronavigazione.

La miscela ottenuta è stata inoltre verificata mediante le analisi del radio carbonio dai Laboratori di ppqSense per la determinazione esatta del contenuto biogenico.

La verifica di rispondenza a normativa tecnica del carburante per l’immissione nel ciclo logistico della F.A. è stata effettuata presso il 2° Laboratorio Tecnico di Controllo di Fiumicino (RM) in coordinamento con il Reparto Servizi Tecnici Operativi (R.S.T.O.) della D.A.S.A.S. per poi essere testato in volo sul velivolo T-346A, il nuovo Addestratore della Leonardo che sostituirà l’attuale MB339 della Pattuglia Acrobatica Nazionale-Frecce Tricolori.

Sebbene il “ReFuelEU Aviation” non si applichi formalmente alle FFAA, di fatto la filiera del rifornimento degli aeromobili militari è fortemente interconnessa con quella dell’aviazione civile; per tale ragione risulta strategico per la F.A. conservare la possibilità di rifornire gli aeromobili militari presso infrastrutture aeroportuali dual use, ovvero sia militari che civili, presso le quali non è logisticamente possibile gestire linee separate per il carburante SAF e quello convenzionale di origine fossile.

Il test volativo rappresenta il culmine del processo di integrazione che coniuga l’esigenza dell’Aeronautica Militare di intraprendere un percorso di allineamento alla normativa europea sui SAF per incrementare la capacità strategico-operativa nel pieno rispetto della sostenibilità ambientale e le nuove strategie di produzione dei carburanti progressivamente più sostenibili avviate da Enilive.",https://www.aeronautica.difesa.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/T346-SAF-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 02:57:20.532368

As the Australian Government’s biggest consumer of fossil fuels, Defence has a unique leadership role to play.

From a strategic point of view, Australia also needs to improve its energy security. That is because Australia imports a large proportion of its fuel, and the shipping lanes our nation relies on are vulnerable to disruption in the event of a crisis.

To meet its social and strategic responsibilities, Defence is making a concerted effort to transition to a more sustainable future.

That means using science and technology to increase Defence’s energy resilience while reducing environmental impact.

One way Defence is taking action is through the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), produced using components from renewable sources. Australia is rich in these renewable sources, allowing for potential domestic production of SAF.

Once blended with conventional jet fuel in accordance with fuel standards, it can be used in all types of Australian Defence Force (ADF) aircraft.

SAF is a drop-in fuel, which means no changes to aircraft or infrastructure are necessary for Defence aircraft to be refuelled with SAF.

Defence first demonstrated its use in 2023, with an aerobatic display of Air Force Roulettes fuelled by a 30 per cent SAF blend. Since October 2024, Defence has maintained a 5 per cent SAF blend in the fuel installation at RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria.

Behind the scenes, there is a small but dedicated team of Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) scientists who provide expert guidance to ensure fuels perform as intended.

'In fuel chemistry, you’re always looking for a needle in the haystack, and that needle is the thing that can turn a good fuel into a bad fuel pretty quickly, especially at elevated temperatures.'

Defence fuel chemist Dave Evans said although fuels might seem relatively simple, they can actually consist of thousands of different chemical compounds. Sometimes, a subtle change in composition drastically alters a fuel’s behaviour.

“In fuel chemistry, you’re always looking for a needle in the haystack, and that needle is the thing that can turn a good fuel into a bad fuel pretty quickly, especially at elevated temperatures,” Dr Evans said.

As the push to embrace sustainability gathers pace, the main focus of the DSTG fuels team will remain to support the ADF by making sure the fuel it is using is fit for purpose, whatever source it comes from.

Tori Guarnera is a Defence STEM cadet who works with Dr Evans at DSTG. During her work placement, she has been investigating the properties of renewable diesel fuels, made from animal fats and waste oils.

“The thing that I like about it is that it’s very relevant, because we all use fuels every day, and it’s a very important part of the Defence Force,” she said.

Ms Guarnera’s cadetship has not only given her the chance to get her hands on DSTG’s advanced chemistry equipment. She has also broadened her horizons by discussing science with colleagues.

“I thought that going into science I would be locked in a lab alone, a bit lonely, but it’s completely the opposite,” Ms Guarnera said.

“There are so many opportunities to connect with other scientists or engineers, which is a really brilliant way to learn.”

Bringing together the Australian scientific community to engage in discussions like these might lead to new discoveries, enabling Defence to strengthen energy security and reduce emissions.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources — such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops – turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research, and investment from governments, manufacturers and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.

1. Saudi Arabian crude output growth outstripping Russian supply

What's happening? Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest crude producer, is bringing barrels back to market faster than Russia -- the largest non-OPEC producer taking part in the OPEC+ crude output agreement. While Russian output is stymied by Western sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Saudi Arabia is able to capitalize on quota increases. Overall, OPEC+ crude output fell to 41.65 million b/d in July, a decrease of 140,000 b/d from June. This drop followed contingency measures to address potential supply shocks from the Iran-Israel conflict, which bolstered output in June.

What's next? If OPEC+ sticks to current plans to accelerate quota increases, analysts expect Saudi Arabia to continue to increase production faster than Russia. S&P Global Commodity Insights analysts forecast that Saudi production could be 800,000 b/d more than Russian from September, when OPEC+ plans to fully phase out 2.2 million b/d of voluntary production cuts. These cuts are being implemented by a group of eight producers, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Kazakhstan and Algeria. The group is next scheduled to meet on Sept. 7 to discuss market conditions, compliance, and compensation. It can change policy at any time if delegates think that market conditions require a change in strategy.

2. China's appetite for Russian oil in focus ahead of Trump-Putin meet

What's happening? US President Donald Trump has warned of more secondary sanctions to come for countries buying Russian energy products, after slapping a 25% tariff on India effective Aug. 7. With India widely expected to diversify its crude sources due to the additional tariff, sources said China's refineries may be able to absorb Russian supply given up by Indian buyers. Monthly Russian crude imports by China once hit a record high of 2.27 million b/d in 2023 when other buyers stayed sidelined due to the G7's price cap.

What's next? China's Russian crude volume dropped 10.4% year over year in the first half of 2025, and sources said the volume of Russian crude barrels they can absorb depends on how low the price can go and whether secondary sanctions are imposed, a Beijing-based analyst told Platts. Eyes are now on the upcoming meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who are expected to discuss on Aug. 15 how to end the war in Ukraine, and how the talks could potentially impact energy trade.

3. Mexican ferrous scrap demand to surge following ArcelorMittal's temporary shutdown

What's happening? ArcelorMittal temporarily suspended its blast furnace due to critical boiler failures, shifting to scrap-based steel production. This has prompted Mexican scrap buyers to increase bids by up to Peso 600/mt and rebar producers to announce price hikes of up to Peso 1,000/mt. The Platts assessment for Mexican ferrous scrap has risen Peso 500/mt since July 29, the day before ArcelorMittal's announcement.

What's next? With the country's only blast furnace offline, all steel production in Mexico will shift to electric arc furnaces. Market participants expect Mexican producers to absorb at least half of ArcelorMittal's production, potentially increasing scrap demand by 30,000 mt/month. This shift will likely drive further price increases as demand ramps up. The rising demand will worsen the deficit between scrap consumption and generation in Mexico, necessitating increased imports. April saw a record 137,140 mt in scrap imports and if US demand shifts toward Mexican scrap, it could compete with local supply.

4. Falling Asian imports push European renewable diesel prices above SAF

What's happening? Lower Asian imports throughout 2025 have pushed renewable diesel prices in Europe above those of sustainable aviation fuel, inverting the historic pricing relationship of the two fuels. Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, assessed the RD-A outright price at $2,290.75/mt on Aug. 6, the highest since November. It edged down to $2,277.50/mt Aug. 7 but remains well above SAF prices in the region. RD has been pricing above SAF since April, buoyed by a lack of imports. The CIF NWE Sustainable Aviation Fuel outright price was assessed Aug. 7 at $2,063.50/mt, having reached lows of $1,715.15/mt on May 7. The SAF assessment has averaged $2,292/mt since it was launched in September 2023, while the RD assessment has averaged $1,792/mt over the same period.

What's next? Renewable diesel prices in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp hub hit a nine-month high Aug. 6, as EU antidumping measures continued to curb imports while market participants report tight prompt physical supply. Further, strong demand is expected through the end of the year as obligated parties seek to stock up on volumes of advanced biofuels ahead of incoming regulatory changes stipulated in revised RED III proposals, set to take effect from 2026 onward.

5. Milling wheat sees initial price drops; quality, supply concerns persist

What's happening? The Platts Milling Wheat Marker fell to $238/mt Aug. 5, down 1.24% from July 24, marking the first decline since the new marketing year began in July. The drop was primarily due to weaker demand, but traders said concerns over quality and supply in Russia and Ukraine could limit significant declines in the short term

What's next? Russian sellers said low stocks, harvest delays and low yields in southern Russia are key factors in preventing further price declines. Producers, meanwhile, are hesitant to sell, hoping for higher carriage-paid-to bids from exporters. Despite these concerns, buyers remain optimistic about further price drops as more wheat is harvested, particularly from Russia's central and Volga regions. In July, the MWM averaged $233.21/mt, with Russian 12.5% protein wheat priced at parity and maintaining that parity so far in August.

The Asian country is negotiating a billion-dollar partnership with Brazil to boost sustainable fuels and reduce foreign dependence.

A China wants Brazilian ethanol as a central input in its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production strategy. Chinese authorities are discussing with the Brazilian government a long-term supply agreement that could generate billions of dollars, positioning Brazil as a key player in the energy transition of the world's second-largest economy.

According to the investigation of Sheet, the negotiation involves representatives of China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation (CPCIF), Chimbusco — a subsidiary of PetroChina — and Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (Mapa). China's goal is reach 3% SAF blend on its flights by 2030, producing 46 million tons per year, and Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is seen as the most viable alternative.

Why Brazilian ethanol is strategic for China

China faces agricultural land limitations for non-food crops and low domestic ethanol production. Among the four technological routes evaluated for SAF production—recycled oil, synthetic fuel, hydrocarbons, and ethanol—Brazilian sugarcane stands out for its high potential for scale, competitive cost and lower environmental impact.

The president Xi Jinping told the president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that the partnership can become an example of “unity and self-reliance” among countries of the Global South. According to Xi, the cooperation will allow China and Brazil avoid rules imposed by third parties, like the United States, which has already applied high tariffs to Brazilian ethanol.

Ethanol and energy geopolitics

A China wants Brazilian ethanol not only for energy efficiency, but also as a strategic move in the face of the global trade dispute. The technical protocol for SAF standardization, currently in its final stages at the CPCIF, will allow the Brazilian product to adapt to the demands of the Chinese market.

Negotiations include bilateral green finance funds and BRICS mechanisms to reduce investment costs, as well as studies to restore degraded pastures in Brazil to expand biofuel production. The proposal is to finance projects with low interest rates and protection against exchange rate fluctuations.

Next steps of the partnership

Brazil intends to sign, during COP30 in Belém, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) for cooperation in sustainable trade. In addition to ethanol, the document should address environmental certifications for agricultural products, allowing seals such as Carbon Neutral Beef (CCN) e Low Carbon Meat (CBC) are accepted by the Chinese market.

The alignment also reinforces integration with the New PAC and Belt and Road Initiative, strengthening Brazil's presence in strategic production chains and diversifying markets for agribusiness.

Impact for Brazil

Experts point out that, if the agreement is consolidated, Brazil will be able to expand its ethanol exports, add value to production and attract investment in logistics and refining infrastructure. At the same time, it will be necessary to balance the internal supply and external to avoid impact on domestic prices.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/China-quer-etanol-brasileiro-e-mira-acordo-bilionario-para-produzir-46-milhoes-de-toneladas-de-combustivel-sustentavel-de-aviacao-por-ano-ate-2030.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 04:56:10.235294

Hailing from 11 countries, these innovative companies will collaborate with IAG’s airlines on solutions capable of scaling across the aviation industry.

The accelerator is IAG’s flagship open innovation programme, designed to fast-track collaboration between early-stage innovators and the Group’s airlines across six focus areas: artificial intelligence (AI), automation and robotics, sustainability and mobility, experiential platforms, connectivity and next generation computing.

For the first time, the accelerator offers two tracks depending on a start-up’s readiness to deploy their solution:

Fourteen start‑ups join the Deploy Track to collaborate directly with IAG and six of its operating companies - Aer Lingus, BritishAirways, IAG Loyalty, Iberia, SOUTH and Vueling. Through Deploy, start-ups will work on a 12-week proof-of-concept to test their solutions in operational conditions. This year, almost all participating start-ups are leveraging AI technologies - which range from computer vision for baggage tracking to AI models for optimising network planning.

Fifteen early-stage start‑ups have been selected for the Discover Track, which focuses on three areas: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), carbon removals and fuel efficiency. Through Discover, deep-tech start-ups participate in tailored sessions delivered by IAG and external experts over a six-month period, gaining valuable insights for commercialising their technologies.

Ignacio Tovar, Director of Innovation, said: “We’re welcoming the largest-ever cohort of start-ups to the IAGi Accelerator, drawing on exceptional talent from across the world. We offer a unique opportunity for founders to work directly with our airlines to demonstrate the potential of their solutions. At its core, the accelerator exists to help scale the most impactful technologies for our industry, both today and into the future.”

The accelerator programme aligns with IAGi’s goal of supporting early-stage founders whose technologies demonstrate strong future potential. Over 75% of this year’s start-ups are at pre-seed or seed stage. Following the accelerator, many start-ups go on to extended trials or commercial contracts with our airlines, and in some cases, investment from IAG’s corporate VC, IAGi Ventures.

Since its launch in 2016, the IAGi Accelerator has supported over 120 companies. Past alumni have gone on to scale their technologies across IAG and the wider aviation industry, including Assaia, who specialises in optimising airport and airline operations using computer vision and AI, and Twelve, who has pioneered technology to turn captured CO₂ and hydrogen into sustainable aviation fuel.

The initiative, spearheaded by Pertamina’s refinery unit, PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional, paves the way for a more environmentally friendly aviation sector and highlights the nation’s strategic use of domestic resources to meet global climate goals.

The inaugural batch of SAF, produced at Pertamina's Cilacap refinery, is a co-processed fuel blend containing 2-3% used cooking oil. This initial shipment of approximately 32 kilolitres is destined for a pioneering flight from Jakarta to Denpasar, Bali, scheduled to take place later this month. The flight will be operated by Pelita Air, an airline subsidiary of Pertamina, serving as a symbolic and practical demonstration of the fuel's viability. The company has ambitious plans to deliver a total of 1.7 million litres of the new fuel to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta to support the upcoming trial.

The production of SAF from used cooking oil is a major step forward for Pertamina and Indonesia's broader energy strategy. The Cilacap refinery has an SAF production capacity of around 1,400 kilolitres per day, and its ability to repurpose a common waste product into a valuable, low-carbon fuel promotes a circular economy.

Globally, the aviation industry is under increasing pressure to decarbonise, with sustainable aviation fuels emerging as one of the most promising solutions. SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, and it can be used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure without requiring significant modifications. Pertamina's project leverages the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, a commercially dominant technology for SAF production. This development places Indonesia among a growing number of countries, including those in the EU, the UK, and Singapore, that are actively pursuing SAF mandates and production. In fact, Indonesia has already set a target for international flights departing the country to use 1% SAF by 2027, with that figure rising to 2.5% by 2030 and a significant 50% by 2060.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:18.555114

“I’m going to need to grow 400 bushel corn to make money this year,” Rep. Brad Finstad said from the Farmfest stage during a panel on ag policy Aug. 5.

The Republican is a member of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and farms near New Ulm, Minnesota.

A stronger market for ag products is one answer he sees for low crop prices.

“We want to farm for a market,” he said. “We don’t want to farm to run down our driveway to the mailbox to see what the government is going to put in our mailbox to help us succeed for another year.”

His comments came shortly after the newly confirmed Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Vaden lauded the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s work to deliver assistance for economic and weather disasters. That included nearly $8 billion in Emergency Commodity Assistance Program money that went to more than 571,000 farmers across 49 states, according to Vaden.

“At USDA, we are mindful that farm economy is not where it should be,” he said.

The agency has been working with President Donald Trump to negotiate trade deals, he said. That includes an agreement with the United Kingdom to buy more American livestock and ethanol and putting pressure on Canada to allow American dairy products across the border.

An agreement with the European Union in late July will pave the way for easier imports of pork and dairy to European countries. Another agreement with Japan will increase U.S. rice imports there by 75% in addition to Japan’s promise to buy $8 billion in U.S. goods. Those goods include corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

Speaking ahead of the afternoon panel on the Farmfest stage, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said trade is big for Minnesota as the nation’s fourth largest ag exporter, but more than 100 tariff changes in the last few months have affected the state’s economy.

Fellow Democratic Rep. Angie Craig of District 2 also doesn’t like tariffs as a negotiating tactic, calling them a “new tax on Americans.”

Craig is a ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, and while she’s pleased to see updates to crop insurance, tax deductions and reference prices in the One Big Beautiful Bill signed July 4, she said those issues should have been taken care of with a new farm bill. Klobuchar also criticized the Big Beautiful Bill for favoring Southern crops like peanuts over corn and soybeans.

Rep. Pete Stauber, R-District 8, from Duluth, said the bill is not perfect, but it’s very good legislation, focusing his comments on new work requirements for Medicaid and efforts to remove non-citizens from the program that were part of the bill.

Vaden said the bill will protect farmers’ operations for “years to come,” thanks to safety net programs, more certainty in the tax code and removal of the death tax for more families.

“Because of that, people can continue to farm,” he said. “That is exactly what farm policy should do.”

Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow US carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers' pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10 per cent SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy's plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

""Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases"" overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. ""People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.""

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United's fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy ""a few years ago"", without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a ""valued partner"" since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy's struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry's plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

No clear pathway

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7 per cent of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3 per cent in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6 per cent this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry's claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector's faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialised, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

Of the remaining projects, 23 have been abandoned, 27 are delayed or on indefinite hold, 31 have yet to produce any fuel, and 4 are SAF credit deals, where no physical fuel is delivered.

For the other 44 projects, Reuters was unable to find any public updates since their initial announcements.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That's about 10 per cent of what's needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn't producing enough fuel.

""These guys are the cause of the problem, and they've got to start playing their part,"" said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group .

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

""I'd like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,"" Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

Paramount 'reset'

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy's partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a US industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What's more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry's long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

'Exercise in futility'

Aviation accounts for 2.5 per cent of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59 per cent, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

""This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,"" said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2 per cent of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6 per cent by 2030, and eventually hitting 70 per cent by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of US President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the US airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8 per cent of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

New technology

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys's English venture, and the British government awarded a £27 million ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another £3 million in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on US SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-123251908,imgsize-901320,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etinfra,resizemode-75/news/aviation/airlines-sustainable-fuel-plans-unravel-as-major-projects-fail.jpg",N,,2025-08-12 12:56:30.321414

This innovation holds the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of aviation, which currently accounts for nearly 3% of global CO2 emissions. The new method, developed by researchers at ETH Zurich, uses solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water from the air into syngas, which is subsequently transformed into kerosene and methanol. As the world grapples with climate change, this advancement could become a cornerstone in the global effort to decarbonize transportation, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuels.

Harnessing Solar Power for Sustainable Fuels

The process developed by Swiss scientists revolves around a state-of-the-art industrial plant that extracts carbon dioxide and water from the air, using solar energy to split these compounds into syngas. Syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, can then be processed into kerosene and methanol. This solar-powered transformation is revolutionary in its ability to create carbon-neutral fuels, as the CO2 emitted during combustion is offset by the CO2 absorbed during production.

Professor Aldo Steinfeld, who leads the research at ETH Zurich, emphasizes the dual impact of this technology: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from aviation and utilizing desert areas for fuel production. Unlike biofuels, which often compete with food crops for arable land, solar fuels can be generated in sun-rich desert regions, preserving valuable agricultural land. This strategic advantage not only enhances environmental sustainability but also aligns with global efforts to transition to renewable energy sources.

The Economic and Environmental Challenges

Despite its promising potential, the large-scale production of solar fuels faces significant economic and logistical challenges. Initial investments for establishing industrial-scale plants are substantial, and the current cost of solar kerosene ranges between $1.35 and $2.20 per liter. To overcome these hurdles, researchers suggest implementing policy measures such as fuel quotas, mandating airlines to source a portion of their fuel from solar-based options. Such regulatory frameworks could facilitate the scale-up of this technology, driving down costs through increased demand and production.

Moreover, the reliance on sunlight as a primary energy source presents geographical constraints. While desert areas offer optimal conditions for production, transporting these fuels to major aviation hubs necessitates a robust infrastructure, further complicating the economic viability. Addressing these challenges will require coordinated global efforts, involving governments, industry stakeholders, and financial institutions to create an ecosystem that supports sustainable aviation fuel development.

Global Implications and Industry Response

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recognizes the critical role of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that SAFs could meet 10% of aviation fuel demand by 2030, escalating to nearly 20% by 2040. This transition is vital as global air travel is set to rebound post-pandemic, with passenger numbers expected to reach 7.5 billion by 2035.

Initiatives like the World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition are pivotal in accelerating the deployment of SAFs. Comprising over 60 stakeholders, this coalition aims to power the aviation industry with 10% sustainable fuels by 2030. Through collaborative efforts, the coalition seeks to create a demand aggregation mechanism, co-investment vehicles, and industry-specific blueprints to facilitate the adoption of carbon-neutral flying.

Major Challenges in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry

As SAF is still two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel, operating an airline is more costly. Global output in 2025 will only cover about 0.7% of demand due to limited manufacturing capacity. Due to strict blending regulations like ReFuelEU, it will be difficult to get enough of the product. These factors increase the cost of tickets and prevent their widespread use.

In addition, regulations that are unclear or subject to change, such as China's postponing mandates, and the US's modifications to its ethanol credit models, are the source of market volatility. Additionally, the absence of production and blending infrastructure, such as refineries, storage facilities, and distribution networks, hinders growth and reduces the likelihood of investment from the public and private sectors.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Segmental Analysis

The global sustainable aviation fuel market is segmented into fuel type, biofuel conversion pathway, biofuel blending capacity, aircraft type, end user, and region.

By fuel type, the biofuel category is the most widely used type of SAF in 2024 due to their compatibility with current airport fueling systems and aircraft engines. Commercial use of biofuels, which are made from spent oils and fats, is already permitted. They are therefore a good option for reducing aviation's carbon footprint soon.

By biofuel conversion pathway, in 2024, the most common SAF conversion mechanism remained the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) conversion pathway. A globally approved and commercially viable fuel, HEFA-SPK is derived from renewable lipids such as recycled cooking oil. With lower lifetime emissions and minimal infrastructure requirements, it is a dependable drop-in fuel choice for airlines.

By biofuel blending capacity, in 2024, the sector with blending capacities below 30% is the most popular due to current technological and legal limitations. Within this range, the majority of commercial airlines use a blend of SAF and ordinary jet fuel. Without having to replace the engines or install new fueling systems, this keeps the aircraft operating efficiently and helps them meet their sustainability goals.

By aircraft type, since major airlines like United and Lufthansa started using SAF on their regular flights, commercial aircraft used it the most in 2024. The rapid adoption of SAF in the aviation fuel industry can be attributed in large part to this market. This is a result of the desire for more environmentally friendly travel held by both the public and the government.

By end user, airliner segment accounted for the majority of demand in 2024, they are the primary end users of SAF. As more people want to travel in an environmentally friendly manner, airlines are incorporating SAF into their fuel mix to reduce emissions, comply with regulations like CORSIA and ReFuelEU, and enhance their brand value.

Regional Outlook

North America dominated the sustainable aviation fuel market by 2024, due to US initiatives like the SAF Grand Challenge and resolute pledges from United and Delta Airlines. Airlines and fuel producers can collaborate more easily and increase their output due to federal regulations and incentives, such as tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

SAF programs are expanding quickly throughout Asia-Pacific, particularly in Singapore and Japan. SAF is now being used on commercial flights operated by ANA and Japan Airlines. The largest SAF manufacturing facility in the world is in Singapore's Neste factory. In addition to meeting aggressive decarbonization targets for aviation hubs in 2025, it improved the local supply.

Europe holds a significant share of the market due to its strict climate change regulations. The ReFuelEU program calls for a higher SAF composition beginning in 2025. Governments are supporting manufacturing initiatives with funding and partnerships to meet strict emissions reduction targets. Airline companies such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are also investing in SAF.

The usage of SAF is on the rise in LAMEA and the two leaders in adoption currently are Brazil and the United Arab Emirates, and Etihad and Emirates have both been testing it on long-haul flights recently. Brazil is using its understanding of biofuels to investigate domestic SAF production, however, in too many locations it becomes difficult for others to pursue it due to infrastructure and regulatory challenges.

disruption

of train services on the North East Line (NEL)

on Aug 12 was caused by a failure of the power switchboard at the NEL depot’s substation.

Preliminary investigations found that the failure caused a flashover – an unintended electrical discharge – in one of the voltage transformers used to regulate the power supply, said SBS Transit group chief executive Jeffrey Sim in a statement on Aug 12.

This led to a power trip in both the main and backup power supplies as part of the power protection mechanism, he added.

A voltage transformer reduces a high voltage to a lower, safer level, while a power switchboard distributes power from electric sources to several smaller circuits.

The trip at 11am crippled services on the NEL along an 11-station stretch between Farrer Park and Punggol Coast, as well as the entire Sengkang-Punggol LRT.

Mr Sim said engineers from SBS Transit and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will be working to restore power to the affected substation at the NEL depot in Sengkang after the end of rail service.

The Sengkang and Punggol LRT services were operating on a single track each on the evening of Aug 12, until services were fully reinstated at 9.20pm, said SBS Transit in a Facebook post.

Mr Sim said the faulty voltage transformer at the NEL depot substation could not be repaired immediately after the power trip, so SBS Transit decided to draw power from its other substation at Dhoby Ghaut.

Engineers carried out extensive checks to ensure that the fault would not affect operational stations on the NEL, he added.

Train services then progressively restarted at affected stations as power was restored, before fully resuming across all NEL stations from 2.10pm.

As for the LRT system, Mr Sim said recovery works had to be carried out in stages to ensure a steady increase in electrical load, and prevent another power trip.

He noted that both the NEL and Sengkang-Punggol LRT were relying on one shared substation, with the NEL depot substation down.

A complete restart of the signalling and power systems, followed by checks of those and the LRT trains, had to be carried out to ensure safety, Mr Sim said.

Service on the Sengkang LRT resumed at 3.34pm, while trains started plying the Punggol LRT again at 4.04pm.

Mr Sim said SBS Transit decided to run Sengkang-Punggol LRT services on a single track from both the eastern and western loops during the evening peak period to avoid stressing the power supply from the single substation.

He apologised to affected commuters, and said the operator will work closely with LTA to prevent a repeat of the incident.

In a Facebook post, LTA said about 350 staff from LTA and SBS Transit, on top of regular station staff, were deployed to the affected stations to guide commuters. It added that the NEL has been running an average of 4 million train-km between delays of more than five minutes.

To achieve this goal, new technologies and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are expected to reduce emissions by 80%, will be required. Additionally, air routes are being optimized, airport congestion is being decreased, and environmental impacts are being managed through noise and waste reduction.

As environmental awareness increases globally, eco-friendly alternatives to traditional jet fuels are gaining popularity among passengers and airlines. SAFs, which are derived from renewable resources like biomass, waste oils, and agricultural residues, significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions when compared to conventional fossil fuels. Airlines are driving this demand to meet corporate sustainability goals, improve environmental ratings, and comply with international carbon-reduction commitments, like those set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The increasing demand for SAF is expected to increase production capacity, and investment in green aviation technologies.

Major Challenges in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry

As SAF is still two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel, operating an airline is more costly. Global output in 2025 will only cover about 0.7% of demand due to limited manufacturing capacity. Due to strict blending regulations like ReFuelEU, it will be difficult to get enough of the product. These factors increase the cost of tickets and prevent their widespread use.

In addition, regulations that are unclear or subject to change, such as China's postponing mandates, and the US's modifications to its ethanol credit models, are the source of market volatility. Additionally, the absence of production and blending infrastructure, such as refineries, storage facilities, and distribution networks, hinders growth and reduces the likelihood of investment from the public and private sectors.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Segmental Analysis

The global sustainable aviation fuel market is segmented into fuel type, biofuel conversion pathway, biofuel blending capacity, aircraft type, end user, and region.

By fuel type, the biofuel category is the most widely used type of SAF in 2024 due to their compatibility with current airport fueling systems and aircraft engines. Commercial use of biofuels, which are made from spent oils and fats, is already permitted. They are therefore a good option for reducing aviation's carbon footprint soon.

By biofuel conversion pathway, in 2024, the most common SAF conversion mechanism remained the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) conversion pathway. A globally approved and commercially viable fuel, HEFA-SPK is derived from renewable lipids such as recycled cooking oil. With lower lifetime emissions and minimal infrastructure requirements, it is a dependable drop-in fuel choice for airlines.

By biofuel blending capacity, in 2024, the sector with blending capacities below 30% is the most popular due to current technological and legal limitations. Within this range, the majority of commercial airlines use a blend of SAF and ordinary jet fuel. Without having to replace the engines or install new fueling systems, this keeps the aircraft operating efficiently and helps them meet their sustainability goals.

By aircraft type, since major airlines like United and Lufthansa started using SAF on their regular flights, commercial aircraft used it the most in 2024. The rapid adoption of SAF in the aviation fuel industry can be attributed in large part to this market. This is a result of the desire for more environmentally friendly travel held by both the public and the government.

By end user, airliner segment accounted for the majority of demand in 2024, they are the primary end users of SAF. As more people want to travel in an environmentally friendly manner, airlines are incorporating SAF into their fuel mix to reduce emissions, comply with regulations like CORSIA and ReFuelEU, and enhance their brand value.

Regional Outlook

North America dominated the sustainable aviation fuel market by 2024, due to US initiatives like the SAF Grand Challenge and resolute pledges from United and Delta Airlines. Airlines and fuel producers can collaborate more easily and increase their output due to federal regulations and incentives, such as tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The usage of SAF is on the rise in LAMEA and the two leaders in adoption currently are Brazil and the United Arab Emirates, and Etihad and Emirates have both been testing it on long-haul flights recently. Brazil is using its understanding of biofuels to investigate domestic SAF production, however, in too many locations it becomes difficult for others to pursue it due to infrastructure and regulatory challenges.

Author: Emily Skor CEO of Growth Energy","It has been twenty years since Congress passed the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)—a bold, bipartisan commitment to strengthen our nation’s energy independence, support rural economies and reduce harmful emissions. For two decades since, the RFS has done exactly what it was designed to do. It has delivered real, measurable benefits to consumers, farmers and the environment. But as we celebrate this milestone, we also need to recognize how to build on our success.

Let’s start with consumers. Every time drivers fill up with fuels like E15, they’re saving money at the pump. The RFS introduced competition into a market previously dominated by fossil fuels. This helped hold down fuel prices for American families, especially during volatile periods for global oil markets. The sum of these savings has kept billions of dollars in Americans’ pockets. It’s a powerful reminder that energy policy can directly improve lives when it puts American innovation and consumers first.

The RFS has also unlocked a wider economic revitalization in rural America. Across the heartland, biorefineries have created tens of thousands of high-quality jobs in engineering, plant operations, research and transportation. These aren’t just numbers on a page. They’re real careers in communities that broader economic shifts have all too often left behind. For rural towns across the Midwest, biofuels are a cornerstone of economic opportunity and growth.

And no one understands the impact of the RFS more deeply than America’s farmers. For generations, farmers have fed our families and fueled our economy. By creating a reliable, high-demand market for corn, soybeans and other feedstocks, the RFS has given farmers a source of stability that is nothing short of essential. This steady demand helps farm families invest in their operations, adopt more sustainable practices and navigate the ups and downs of global commodity markets. The result is a more resilient agricultural sector.

Of course, the RFS is also a cornerstone of U.S. energy security. Two decades ago, we were heavily reliant on foreign oil. Today, thanks in part to the RFS, we’ve dramatically increased our use of domestically produced renewable fuel. Every gallon of ethanol or biodiesel made here in America is one less gallon we need to import. That strengthens our national security and gives us more control over our energy future.

And the environmental impact? According to Growth Energy’s research, the RFS has helped curb over 725 million metric tons of carbon emissions since its inception. That’s the equivalent of taking more than 150 million cars off the road for a year.

For all the progress we’ve made, there’s more work to do. We need strong, stable biofuels blending targets and consistent oversight of refinery exemptions. We need policies that reward innovation, open up new pathways for sustainable aviation fuel and ensure that new technologies like carbon capture are fully recognized under the RFS.

The next chapter of the RFS must be one of momentum. That’s why I’m calling on policymakers on both sides of the aisle to recommit to the promise of the RFS. A promise to America’s farmers, to rural communities, to consumers and to our clean air future. That is a promise worth fighting for.

The company significantly improved gross margins to -31% from -92% last year, aided by service cost reductions, equipment efficiencies, and better hydrogen pricing. CEO Andy Marsh cited “growing scale and cost discipline” as critical drivers toward achieving gross margin neutrality by Q4 2025.

Context

The results mark a turnaround effort under Plug’s “Project Quantum Leap,” which targets cost structure optimization through workforce streamlining, facility consolidation, and renegotiated supply contracts, including a new hydrogen procurement deal set to reduce molecule costs in the second half. Non-cash charges tied to the initiative totaled $80 million in Q2, compared to $6 million a year earlier.

Cash outflows from operations and investments fell more than 40% year-over-year, and Plug ended the quarter with $140 million in unrestricted cash plus over $300 million in accessible debt capacity. The company also expects to monetize U.S. clean energy tax credits under Sections 45V (Clean Hydrogen Production) and 48E (Investment Tax Credit).

Strategic Highlights

Electrolyzer Expansion: Over 230 MW of GenEco electrolyzer projects are underway across Europe, Australia, and North America. In April, Plug’s Georgia plant set a U.S. production record using GenEco systems, underscoring its industrial-scale hydrogen capability.

Market Penetration: GenEco has become a preferred choice for industries from oil refining to steelmaking, with additional large-scale customer commitments expected this year.

Material Handling Growth: Extension of the ITC through 2026 is spurring demand for GenDrive fuel cells, with new bookings expected in H2 2025 to set up growth in 2026.

Energy Transition Diversification: Plug is leveraging liquefier and skid-packaging expertise to enter renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel markets, aiming for new revenue streams later this year.

Policy Tailwinds

· Air cargo volumes in the United States through May have declined approximately 25%, year-over-year, per estimates from freight forwarders and customs brokers.
Since the Trump administration announced reciprocal tariffs in April, China-U.S. cargo volumes have dropped by up to 60%.
· The elimination of the $800 de minimis exception for imported goods, combined with increased tariffs, is expected to send air cargo volumes plummeting for low-value e-commerce shipments.
This will reshape network planning, capacity deployment, and aircraft acquisition strategies as carriers adapt to altered trade routes and cargo volumes.","New trade policies introduced by the United States have ushered in a challenging period for the aviation industry, particularly the air cargo and freight sector.

“The industry was set to build on a record 2024 performance with strong prospects for 2025 and beyond after years of post-COVID rebuilding and growth. It would be unfortunate and counterproductive to destabilize this important industry and its complex ecosystem, and we are hopeful that new international trade agreements can be reached with common-sense exemptions and reduced levies,” according to Cassel Salpeter & Co. “Until tariff uncertainties are resolved, it remains difficult to forecast the future of the industry and supply chains. We are cautiously optimistic that the industry will be able to adapt with new routes and strategies to weather the storm, executing a smooth landing after tariff turbulence.”

Despite the challenging landscape, the air cargo industry is exploring strategies to adapt, while hoping for policy resolution. And, new opportunities may emerge through expansion into additional global markets and premium air cargo pricing, according to datasets released by Cassel Salpeter & Co.

Key takeaways:

· Air freight operators might take proactive measures to mitigate tariff impacts by relocating or onshoring some of their operations and adopting hybrid models that combine direct air fulfillment with pre-stocked forward warehouses in key markets. This approach has the potential to establish new partnerships with countries that can reach negotiated settlements and reduced tariffs, which could diversify existing freight routes and generate additional business for air freight carriers.

· U.S.-based cargo airlines are actively seeking ways to offset higher import costs. Lower fuel prices can provide relief if demand remains stable, while rising jet fuel prices allow airlines to implement fuel surcharges that typically include profits above actual costs.

· Another cost-reduction opportunity involves consolidating air and ocean shipments under single customs entries, potentially reducing customs brokerage and government processing fees per shipment.

· The International Air Transport Association (IATA) downgraded its 2025 guidance for air cargo demand from its 5.8% growth forecast, issued December 2024, to a revised forecast of near-zero growth for the year. This represents a significant reversal for an industry where air cargo volume for passenger and all-cargo airlines grew 12% in 2024, reaching all-time highs.

· Air cargo volumes in the United States through May have declined approximately 25%, year-over-year, per estimates from freight forwarders and customs brokers. The decline has accelerated since May 2, when the de minimis exemption ended for goods from China. Since the Trump administration announced reciprocal tariffs in April, China-U.S. cargo volumes have dropped by up to 60%. Tariffs have severely impacted e-commerce bookings, which fell approximately 50% in May 2025.

· The daily number of trans-Pacific air freighters arriving at the Top 18 U.S. airports has decreased by approximately 30% since April, according to Cirrus Global Advisors. Current forecasts suggest the air cargo market could experience a continued downturn in the second half of the year due to the persistence of new U.S.-imposed tariffs and potential retaliatory measures taken by other countries.

· The impact of new U.S. tariff policy will extend far beyond immediate cost pressures; new trade policy aims to transform international trade and recast global trade routes. As a result, the tariffs have been particularly destabilizing to the airfreight industry, driving price volatility and forcing comprehensive route planning overhauls, particularly within the e-commerce sector.

· The elimination of the $800 de minimis exception for imported goods, combined with increased tariffs, is expected to send air cargo volumes plummeting for low-value e-commerce shipments. With de minimis exemptions unlikely to return, Chinese e-commerce leaders now send products into the United States via bulk sea freight shipments to U.S.-based warehouses and distribution centers, abandoning their use of individual air shipments for direct-to-consumer fulfilment that previously drove cargo aviation growth.

· The air cargo sector faces major headwinds within this evolving tariff environment. Cargo airlines must navigate an increasingly complex landscape of disrupted trade flows as manufacturers and retailers reconfigure supply chains in response to new levies. This will reshape network planning, capacity deployment, and aircraft acquisition strategies as carriers adapt to altered trade routes and cargo volumes.

· The implications of new trade policies are concerning and include declining demand for freighter aircraft and fleet expansion. This may be amplified by a downturn in freighter conversions, driven by rising component costs and procurement delays. Dedicated freighters increasingly dominate global trade volume over passenger aircraft belly cargo; volatility in the freighter market can drive significant systemic impacts.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/08/mariakray-adobestock-178549802.O3GlRYRts2.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-08-12 12:57:43.146773

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is often described as the airline industry’s most immediate tool for cutting emissions, but its adoption remains stubbornly low.

According to industry estimates, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use in 2024.

To align with net-zero targets, production must grow more than 100-fold by 2050. That scale-up will require billions in investment, coordinated policy support, and a steady pipeline of viable projects; something that, until recently, has proved elusive.

Progress on sustainable aviation fuel from all corners of the world

From South America to South Asia, new facilities and investments are proving that SAF production can happen far beyond its traditional bases in Europe and North America.

In a national first, Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery has been certified to produce SAF from used cooking oil, making it the first facility in the country to do so. Dubbed “from samosa oil to jet fuel” by local media, the project aims to tap into abundant waste feedstocks, turning everyday kitchen waste into a low-carbon alternative to kerosene.

In Argentina, the state-owned oil company YPF has committed $400 million to launch Santa Fe Bio, a joint venture producing SAF from agricultural residues and waste oils. Based at the San Lorenzo refinery, the venture is designed to serve both domestic demand and export markets, positioning Argentina as a regional SAF hub.

On the other side of the world, Pertamina in Indonesia has delivered its first SAF shipment to Soekarno–Hatta Airport, produced at its Cilacap refinery using a blend of waste cooking oil and conventional jet fuel. With a production capacity of 1,400 kilolitres per day, Pertamina plans to supply 1.7 million litres to Jakarta this year, starting with a commercial Jakarta–Bali flight later this month.

Encouraging developments in SAF overshadowed by deep-rooted problems

Despite these encouraging developments, the sector is still struggling to achieve the scale needed. A recent Reuters investigation found that many SAF projects announced in recent years have been stalled, abandoned, or unable to reach a final investment decision.

Notably, United Airlines has quietly discontinued its fuel purchase agreement with Boston-based World Energy. As a result, its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles ceased operations in April. World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of SAF.

The CEO of World Energy, Gene Gebolys, told Reuters some airlines were in the habit of overstating their commitment to SAF projects. “People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little,” he said.

Reuters found that World Energy’s plight mirrors those of dozens of clean energy startups around the world.

Feedstock availability, high production costs, and uncertain long-term policy incentives remain major hurdles. Industry groups warn that without stable regulation and guaranteed offtake agreements, private capital will continue to view SAF as a risky bet.

New projects around the world mark real progress, both technologically and geographically. But the gap between today’s volumes and what’s needed to meet climate targets is still vast.

Without faster scaling, stronger policy frameworks, and more resilient business cases, SAF risks remaining a promising technology that never truly takes off.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SAF-from-World-Energy-2.jpeg,N,,2025-08-12 12:57:52.266638

Against a strengthening regulatory environment, this is no longer an acceptable situation for the chief marketing officer or chief executive.

Environmental claims are finally starting to be held to the same evidentiary standards as financial ones. With the Competition and Markets Authority now empowered to issue fines of up to 10 per cent of global turnover for unsubstantiated or misleading sustainability claims, without the need for court proceedings, the stakes for non-compliance are no longer theoretical.

A few decades ago, brands might have reasonably argued that verifying complex environmental claims in a timely and structured way was operationally difficult. The regulatory landscape was less developed, and access to reliable data and third-party verification more limited.

But that defence no longer holds. Environmental, social and governance assurance is now a mainstream, well-established process that can be deployed at pace and with confidence.

Given this shift, we wanted to understand how many recent cases of greenwashing could have been avoided if ESG assurance had been applied during advertising campaign development. Menzies reviewed more than 1,000 ASA rulings published between March 2020 and March 2025, identifying 53 that related directly to sustainability or environmental claims.

What brands are still getting wrong

The majority of these ASA rulings reflected four recurring failings:

Unqualified or incomplete claims lacking essential context.

The use of absolutes, such as “zero emissions” or “100 per cent sustainable”, without sufficient evidence.

Failure to consider lifecycle emissions or upstream and downstream impacts.

Ambiguous or undefined language, particularly around terms such as “green” or “eco-friendly”.

These errors are not limited to fringe players or niche sectors. They include major names across aviation, automotive, retail, energy and fast-moving consumer goods. In many cases, the campaigns referenced meaningful progress in sustainability, but poor framing or missing context turned credible advances into compliance failures.

Virgin Atlantic’s “Flight 100” campaign is a case in point. The use of 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel marked a significant step forward, with a 64 per cent reduction in lifecycle emissions compared with fossil jet fuel. But the phrase “100 per cent sustainable” was ruled misleading, due to lack of qualification and context. What could have been a showcase for progress became a reputational risk.

This and other examples reinforce a broader point: sustainable innovation must now be matched by sustainable communication.

Where ESG assurance makes the difference

Of the green claim rulings we reviewed, 62 per cent could have been avoided if brands had applied ESG assurance during campaign development. For a further 19 per cent, assurance could have reduced the likelihood of a complaint being upheld.

While ESG assurance is well understood in policy and reporting contexts, its role in brand and marketing governance is, for many major brands, clearly absent. Done well, it can test data, clarify language, flag omissions and ensure alignment with international standards.

Just as importantly, it shifts the focus from reactive to proactive. Rather than rushing to defend a claim post-publication, assurance allows brands to launch with confidence, knowing their statements have been independently validated.

A better story, better told

There is a perception that assurance slows campaign development or limits creativity. It often does the opposite. By sharpening the evidence base and tightening language, it enables stronger, more credible storytelling, and allows teams to be bold without being reckless.

Assurance also acts as a forcing function internally. It encourages early co-ordination between ESG, legal, marketing and leadership. It sets a higher bar for internal sign-off and helps elevate ESG from a compliance exercise to a core pillar of brand strategy.

With greenwashing risks rising on the agendas of investors, regulators and consumers, the value of independent validation could not be clearer.

The essential mindset shift

The rules have changed. Sustainability claims are no longer judged on intent, they are judged on evidence and clarity. This responsibility does not sit solely with the CMO.

Advertising and branding agencies also have a role in protecting their clients and their own reputations. Rather than accepting sustainability claims at face value, they should be asking, “show me the evidence” and advocating for ESG assurance when it is missing.

The choice today is no longer whether to adopt ESG assurance, but when. Waiting until after a complaint, investigation or fine is no longer a viable business or career growth strategy.

Those brands that embed assurance early will not only reduce the risk of regulatory fallout, but they will also gain the confidence to craft campaigns that are more creative, more credible and more impactful in the eyes of the public.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/94fc892c-4a59-4bb5-b336-2ee0a015ec83.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 06:56:25.577694

Made up of a coalition of leading ANSPs, the initiative centres around the development of the GAIN tool, the first globally collaborative data and analytics application designed specifically for ANSPs to measure airspace efficiency in a standardised way.

GAIN is designed to enable ANSPs around the world to benchmark performance, share insights, and drive more sustainable airspace management. In Europe alone, routing inefficiencies are thought to cause roughly 5-11% additional fuel burn per flight, translating to tens of millions of tonnes of CO₂ annually. By leveraging cutting-edge analytics and complex algorithms, GAIN equips ANSPs with the tools to identify airspace hotspots, set actionable targets, and benchmark performance.

NATS, alongside CAAM, skeyes, and AZANS, officially launched GAIN as a not-for-profit initiative in May this year, and with ATNS now joining the collaboration, over 10% of the world’s air traffic falls under the jurisdiction of the Founding Members. Together they have the potential to achieve annual savings of at least 450,000 tonnes of CO2 through airspace and aircraft routing improvements.

On joining GAIN, the acting CEO of ATNS,Matome Moholola said: “I believe that collaborative programs such as the GAIN initiative will assist the industry in understanding their contribution and defining measures in improving operational efficiency and reducing aircraft emissions to meet the global target of Net-Zero by 2050”.",https://www.timesaerospace.aero/sites/aerospace/times/files/ta-favico.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 06:56:30.973040

The biofuels market is evolving rapidly, with new technologies and policies shaping the future of sustainable fuels. How do you see GIDARA’s role in this changing landscape?

The biofuels sector is at a crossroads: demand for sustainable fuels is surging, but the industry is running up against hard limits – particularly with feedstock availability. At GIDARA, we are addressing this head-on by turning an abundant challenge – waste – into a powerful solution for the energy transition.

Our HTWR gasification technology enables the conversion of a wide range of waste streams into sustainable fuels and chemicals, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and methanol. What sets us apart is our gasification pathway, which is emerging as one of the most important solutions to the industry’s feedstock bottleneck.

By licensing our technology, we empower global partners to tap into new, locally available feedstock streams and accelerate the rollout of fuels and chemicals where they’re needed most. Our focus extends beyond growing our business; it’s about significantly increasing our impact and helping the energy transition overcome its current limitations.

The aviation sector is under intense pressure to decarbonise, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is seen as a key solution. What are the main obstacles to scaling SAF, and how is GIDARA working with others to overcome them?

Aviation’s decarbonisation challenge is urgent. While SAF is widely recognised as the most viable near-term solution, the sector remains stuck at less than 1% SAF penetration. The HEFA route alone will not be enough to meet future demand, as it is constrained by limited supplies of waste fats, oils and greases.

This is where GIDARA’s gasification pathway makes a real difference – it opens the door to a much broader and more abundant feedstock base, allowing for true scaleup of SAF production. Our HTWR technology has been proven at industrial scale, and we believe it is key to delivering the SAF capacity the industry needs.

However, technology alone is not enough to move the needle. That’s why we’ve joined forces with Johnson Matthey, Honeywell UOP and Samsung E&A. Together, we combine expertise in catalyst development, automation, engineering and project delivery.

What makes this SAF Technology Alliance unique is that, for the first time, all the critical elements for commercial-scale SAF production have been brought together. Cutting-edge technology, world class engineering and proven project execution are now unified under one coordinated partnership.

This alliance enables us to reduce project lead times by more than 15% and lower investment risk for our customers. Our coordinated approach provides customers with a single, integrated solution that meets the market’s demand for speed, certainty and tangible progress.

Looking ahead, what gives you confidence that advanced biofuels and alliances like yours can deliver on the promise of a lower carbon future?

What gives me real confidence is the unique capability of gasification to unlock a future for sustainable fuels that simply isn’t possible with other technologies. Gasification stands out because it can transform a vast array of low-value waste materials – otherwise destined for landfill – into high-quality syngas, which is then converted into sustainable fuels and chemicals. This approach isn’t just about volume – it’s about flexibility and resilience. Unlike other pathways that are limited by scarce feedstocks, gasification opens access to a much broader spectrum, from municipal solid waste to biomass, making true scale-up achievable.

At GIDARA, we’ve refined this pathway using our HTWR gasification technology, which is proven at commercial scale, robust, and highly adaptable. Our process is engineered for efficiency, reliability and operational simplicity, making it deployable at industrial scale and easily integrated into existing infrastructure.

This is a gamechanger for decarbonisation: it enables the production of fuels that meet stringent standards while reducing waste and emissions at the source. Another positive sign is the momentum we’re seeing across the board: policymakers are raising the bar with new mandates – such as ReFuelEU and the IMO; investors are backing scalable solutions; and the industry is embracing new technologies that can finally help us overcome the current limitations of the energy transition.

At GIDARA, our role is to enable and connect – to provide our technology, experience and partnerships that turn ambition into action. By focusing on practical, scalable solutions and working as part of a powerful alliance, we’re helping to build the infrastructure for a truly circular and low-carbon economy.

As we celebrate this important anniversary, I remain committed to championing renewable fuels every single day and pushing for policies like nationwide, year-round E15,” said Rep. Budzinski.

“Over the past two decades, the Renewable Fuels Standard has played a critical role in strengthening our nation’s economy, solidifying our energy independence and supporting our rural communities,” said Rep. Craig. “The RFS has enabled Minnesota’s farmers and producers to contribute to the all-of-the-above energy policy America needs, while helping to lower prices for consumers at the pump. It’s common-sense programs like this one that help our state, and our country stay ahead.”

“A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is vital to a vibrant agricultural economy and the success of Iowa biofuels. For twenty years, this American energy initiative has supported Iowa farmers, biofuels producers, and our rural communities by ensuring that Iowa ethanol, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels are blended into our nation’s fuel supply. The RFS also helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lowers gas prices for families, and incentivizes rural energy production. Representing hardworking farmers and biofuels producers, I will always advocate for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard that invests in rural Iowa, supports the production of homegrown Iowa biofuels, and stands with our farmers and agricultural communities,” said Rep. Feenstra.

“Twenty years ago, the Renewable Fuel Standard ignited economic growth across our rural communities, as biofuel plants brought jobs and support for hardworking farmers. Today, American biofuels deliver cleaner, more affordable fuel to millions worldwide. Simply put: biofuels have proven their stay as a new cornerstone of innovation for our nation’s rural economies,” said Rep. Flood.

“For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has strengthened America’s energy security, lowered costs at the pump, and delivered real markets for Iowa’s farmers,” said Rep. Nunn. “It’s proof that homegrown energy can power our economy and support rural communities at the same time.”

“The RFS supports a growing domestic energy sector which provides more affordable fuel options and complementary markets for agricultural commodities. American biofuels and agriculture producers are leaders in innovation, and I am proud of the progress they have made over the past 20 years to maximize the value of every kernel of corn while producing more with less. As a co-chair of the Biofuels Caucus, I join in celebrating this anniversary of the RFS as we work to continue empowering American producers, retailers, and consumers through sound federal policy,” said Rep. Smith

Support from Industry

“The 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuels Standard is more than just a milestone for policy—it’s personal for farmers like me. The increased demand for ethanol created by the RFS helped open a door for me to come back to our family farm, raise my kids here, and build a future rooted in rural Ohio. It’s driven investment in our community, strengthened markets for our corn, and allowed my family and many others to keep doing what we love. The RFS hasn’t just fueled our cars, it’s fueled opportunity, growth, and resilience across the country.” — Tyler Drewes, President of the Ohio Corn & Wheat Growers Association

“The Renewable Fuel Standard’s establishment 20 years ago helped soybean oil go from a byproduct to a main driver of demand for America’s farmers in the form of biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. Soy-based biofuels support the rural economy by providing over 107,000 jobs nationwide and contributing $42.4 billion to the U.S. economy. This kind of economic impact would not be possible without the RFS. As part of the RFS, the U.S. EPA recently proposed new renewable volume obligations that represent another significant step forward in protecting American energy independence.” — Rusty Goebel, Ohio soybean farmer and Ohio Soybean Association President

“As the Renewable Fuel Standard marks its 20th anniversary, we reflect on a landmark program that has strengthened America’s energy security while delivering significant benefits to American agriculture. Over the past two decades, the RFS has spurred demand for domestically grown oilseeds, encouraged investment in U.S. processing facilities, and supported the growth of advanced biofuels. By ensuring more of our soybeans are crushed here, the program adds value domestically and creates new opportunities for U.S. farmers and rural communities. NOPA remains committed to working with policymakers to ensure the RFS continues to advance American agriculture and our nation’s energy future.” — Devin Mogler, President and CEO, National Oilseed Processors Association

“For 20 years, the Renewable Fuels Standard has strengthened American farmers, manufacturing, and energy security. Today, our domestic biofuel industry supports hundreds of thousands of good jobs across the American Heartland. Our farmers know that they have access to a key market and help fuel our cars and trucks. ADM appreciates the work of Congressman Miller, Senator Ricketts and all the cosponsors for recognizing the 20th Anniversary of this important policy. We remain committed to the continued growth and success of our domestic biofuel industry.” — Nick Smith, President, North America Energy and Biofuels, ADM

“The RFS has created new grain markets and supported rural communities, all while lowering costs at the pump. As the bioethanol industry increased from less than one to over ten percent of the nation’s fuel supply, farm income nearly tripled, and land values more than doubled. Looking ahead, expanding biofuels in the U.S. will strengthen the nation’s energy security and deliver lasting benefits to America’s farmers and rural communities.” — Joshua Shields, POET Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs

“Over the past two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has delivered tremendous benefits for our nation-reducing dependence on foreign oil, lowering fuel costs for consumers, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across rural America, and strengthening the agricultural economy. It has spurred market competition and expanded choices at the pump for drivers nationwide. We’re thrilled to see Congress commemorating this milestone with a strong bipartisan resolution, and we applaud Senator Pete Ricketts, Representative Max Miller, and the many lawmakers who joined in honoring one of the most successful and forward-looking energy policies in U.S. history.” — Geoff Cooper, Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO

Gevo, Inc. is a renewable fuels company out to give oil a run for its money with low-carbon versions of jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel. Its main trick: turning renewable agricultural feedstocks into isobutanol through fermentation, then upgrading that into things like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Gevo’s money comes from fuel supply deals (mainly SAF and some renewable gasoline/diesel) with airlines and fuel distributors, selling ethanol and isobutanol, and licensing its tech to others. It’s playing in the bigger world of biofuels and clean energy, where government rules (like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard and the EU’s ReFuelEU) and rising corporate decarbonization goals are driving the agenda. Gevo faces competition from giant agribusinesses like Archer-Daniels-Midland and POET, biofuel specialists like LanzaTech, and major refiners like Neste and Shell moving into SAF. What sets Gevo apart? Its patented isobutanol process, early partnerships with airlines such as Delta, DHL, and Virgin, and its “Net-Zero” plant model, which is designed to produce ultra-low-carbon fuel.

Recent Performance

From August 2024 to August 2025, Gevo’s share price slipped from about $1.85 to $1.19—a hefty 36% drop, while the S&P 500 gained around 15%. Gevo’s stumble boils down to a cocktail of factors: ongoing losses, constant cash burn, worries about delays at its big Net-Zero plant in South Dakota, and a market that’s grown wary of small renewable names thanks to rising rates and tighter funding.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Gevo posted 13.9% revenue growth year-over-year, comfortably outpacing the 8.3% market average. That’s mostly thanks to more isobutanol sales and some early wins in SAF supply. The real test is ahead: Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 facility is expected to hit commercial scale late 2025, and a second facility in Texas (Lake Charles) is in the pipeline. There’s potential licensing income too, if others buy into its conversion tech. Over the longer run, mandates for sustainable jet fuel, especially with U.S. incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and new EU targets, should keep demand healthy—although revenue and profit growth will depend heavily on Gevo actually delivering projects and getting enough feedstock.

Quality & Moat

Gevo is still deep in the red, clocking in a –209% operating margin. But believe it or not, that's a big step up from its five-year average of –2,930%. Gevo holds a net cash position (net debt/EBITDA of –1.47x compared to the market’s +1.30x), so debt isn’t an issue. Its edge comes from its patented conversion process and early deals with big-name airlines, but negative returns on invested capital and equity tell you this is still a cash-burning growth story. Free cash flow is sharply negative (–132% FCF yield), showing just how much money Gevo needs to build out its business.

Valuation

Gevo trades at a steep price: its enterprise value is 9.1 times sales (the market average is 4.4x), mirroring high hopes for its SAF rollout. Since it isn’t set for positive earnings yet, the forward P/E doesn’t mean much. That premium could make sense if Net-Zero 1 is a hit and profits improve, but it’s a big 'if'—and rivals trade around 5–7x EV/Sales.

Market Sentiment

The mood around Gevo is a mix: environmental investors and airline partners like its early lead in SAF, but there’s high short interest and only modest institutional buying. Analysts tend to recommend a 'hold,' wary about execution risks and funding needs. The recent price trend isn’t flattering—Gevo trades 12% under its 50-day average and shows wild swings (59% annualized volatility versus the market’s 27.6%). Clearly, this stock is not for risk-averse investors.

Key Risks

Execution Delays: If project timelines slip, revenue gets pushed out and Gevo needs even more capital.

Feedstock & Input Costs: Wild moves in corn or natural gas prices can squeeze Gevo’s already negative margins.

Regulatory Shifts: If U.S. or EU policies change around renewable fuels or SAF credits, demand and pricing could take a hit.

Cash Burn & Dilution: Gevo’s need for cash may mean new share issues—and dilution for current investors.

High Volatility & Beta: With a beta of 1.92 and annual volatility at 59%, the stock is especially sensitive to market swings.

Bull Case

SAF Demand Surge: Aviation’s push to cut emissions should boost long-term demand for sustainable jet fuel.

Net-Zero Ramp: If the first commercial-scale plant comes online as planned late 2025, Gevo could see a jump in sales and profit margins.

Favorable Policies: Supportive U.S. tax credits and EU mandates give more visibility to future revenues.

Licensing Upside: If Gevo starts licensing its process, it could unlock a stream of high-margin fees.

Net Cash Balance: With negative net debt/EBITDA, Gevo has room to expand without loading up on debt.

Bear Case

Cash Burn Intensifies: Ongoing losses and heavy spending mean more capital raises—and more dilution risk.

Execution Risk: Plant construction and operation are complex—delays and cost overruns are a real threat.

Valuation Stretch: At 9.1x EV/Sales, the stock could tumble if Gevo falls short on growth.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Tighter biofuel rules or dropped incentives in the U.S. or EU could hurt project economics.

Feedstock Volatility: Big rises in corn or natural gas prices could eat into margins and slow recovery.

On Our Radar

Q2 2025 Earnings: Set for August 13, 2025—expect updates on the Net-Zero 1 plant and management guidance.

DOE Grant Decision: Expected in September 2025—a win could mean non-dilutive cash for SAF expansion.

Lake Charles Project FID: Due late 2025—the management’s final investment call on the second big SAF plant.

Investment Conclusion

Gevo is a classic high-risk, high-reward bet on the future of sustainable aviation fuel. The company’s unique technology, top-tier industry partners, and soon-to-launch Net-Zero plant offer meaningful upside—if everything goes to plan and policy support holds. But persistent losses, cash flow issues, and a lofty valuation mean Gevo has to execute flawlessly, with no slip-ups or policy changes. Adventurous, long-term investors with nerves of steel might see opportunity on any further price weakness. For those who want more reliable cash flow, waiting for better proof may be the safer call.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-08-11 22:56:35.584303

Federal lawmakers also marked the occasion with resolutions introduced in the House and Senate earlier this month.

The RFS was first established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which was signed by President George W. Bush on Aug. 8, 2025. The program was later expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, also signed by Bush on Dec. 19., 2007.

Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, on Aug. 1 introduced resolutions commemorating the success of the RFS. The resolutions honor the RFS “as a milestone in America’s commitment to strengthening energy security, supporting rural communities, growing the economy, and improving environmental performance.” It further “recognizes the positive impacts of the RFS on United States energy policy, the agricultural sector, and the environment over the past 2 decades.”

The Renewable Fuels Association recently published a report highlighting the positive impacts of the RFS, noting the program has lowered gas prices, enhanced domestic energy security, supported the farm economy and helped the air and environment. “Over the past two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has delivered tremendous benefits for our nation—reducing dependence on foreign oil, lowering fuel costs for consumers, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs across rural America, and strengthening the agricultural economy,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFS. “It has spurred market competition and expanded choices at the pump for drivers nationwide. We’re thrilled to see Congress commemorating this milestone with a strong bipartisan resolution, and we applaud Senator Pete Ricketts, Representative Max Miller, and the many lawmakers who joined in honoring one of the most successful and forward-looking energy policies in U.S. history.”

Growth Energy noted that U.S. biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol since the RFS was first established in 2005. Over the same time period, U.S. ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue for American farmers. “The RFS is the foundation of America’s bioeconomy,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it’s still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. EPA recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren’t yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America applauded the congressional resolutions and highlighted the impact of the program on the U.S. biobased diesel industry. “Clean Fuels thanks Senator Pete Ricketts and Representative Max Miller and their colleagues for honoring the Renewable Fuel Standard’s foundational role in strengthening America’s energy and farm security,” said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels. “Under the RFS over the last twenty years, U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production has grown from a few hundred million gallons to 5 billion gallons, meeting 9 percent of the nation’s on-road diesel demand. Biodiesel and renewable diesel production is vital for America’s economy, supporting $42.4 billion in economic opportunity. It is essential to America’s farmers, supporting 10 percent of the value of every soybean grown in the United States. With robust RFS volumes proposed for the coming years, the benefits keep growing.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2017/07/RFSNew_14998913260613.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 20:56:14.261831

This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery.
The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.
""MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production.
Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","On the occasion of World Biodiesel Day, MOL Group highlights a recent milestone in its energy transition journey. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been successfully produced for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery during a pilot project to process biocomponent, as well as a significant volume of renewable diesel HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil). This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These underscore the company’s technological readiness and strategic commitment to alternative fuel development in meeting EU climate targets and enhancing regional energy security.

The successful pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was implemented in cooperation with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor of the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit, with the aim of testing the co-processing of 5% POME (palm oil mill effluent – a by-product of palm oil production) with fossil feedstocks. During the pilot, 1,000 metric tons of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification standard for sustainable biofuels.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties. During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14 analysis) was carried out by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF. HVO was produced using oil from cashew nut shells and the biocomponent produced this way was processed together with crude oil. In case of SAF, partially refined cooking oil was processed with the traditional raw material. The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

MOL Group had been using the co-processing method at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for years: the process reduces the emissions of traditional fuels by mixing plant residues, as the bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously directly during production.

Renewable fuels play a key role in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already a key player in both the Hungarian and regional biofuel markets, with hydrotreated vegetable oil produced from waste, i.e., renewable feedstock, being among the most climate-friendly fuel options, and ranks among the pioneers in Europe when it comes to the production of aviation biofuels.

Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","On the occasion of World Biodiesel Day, MOL Group highlights a recent milestone in its energy transition journey. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been successfully produced for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery during a pilot project to process biocomponent, as well as a significant volume of renewable diesel HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil). This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These underscore the company’s technological readiness and strategic commitment to alternative fuel development in meeting EU climate targets and enhancing regional energy security.

The successful pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was implemented in cooperation with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor of the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit, with the aim of testing the co-processing of 5% POME (palm oil mill effluent – a by-product of palm oil production) with fossil feedstocks. During the pilot, 1,000 metric tons of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification standard for sustainable biofuels.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties. During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14 analysis) was carried out by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF. HVO was produced using oil from cashew nut shells and the biocomponent produced this way was processed together with crude oil. In case of SAF, partially refined cooking oil was processed with the traditional raw material. The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

MOL Group had been using the co-processing method at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for years: the process reduces the emissions of traditional fuels by mixing plant residues, as the bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously directly during production.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn“100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story.","(MENAFN- The Conversation) The federal spending law passed in early July 2025, often called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly reduces federal funding for efforts to create renewable or sustainable types of fuel that can power aircraft over long distances while decreasing the damage aviation does to the global climate.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It's particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks .

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer , is a category of fuel called“sustainable aviation fuel .” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources - such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump's second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there's a long journey ahead.

A U.K. Royal Air Force jet is refueled by a tanker carrying a mix of standard jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel. Leon Neal/Getty Images A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops – turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don't compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition , which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes . In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel , mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel , with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024 , but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies , effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel , with minimum percentages increasing over time.

A Wall Street Journal video reports on how trash can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft's weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn“100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That's because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft's fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research, and investment from governments, manufacturers and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.",https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2025-08/11/TC_6a6c3image_story.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 22:56:40.336389

Achieves Positive Net Income in the Second Quarter and Positive Adjusted EBITDA1 for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2025

Positive Net Income Attributable to Gevo of $2.1 million in the Second Quarter

Positive Adjusted EBITDA1 of $17 million in the Second Quarter

Revenues Increased $14 million Quarter-Over-Quarter

Positive Earnings per Share Attributable to Gevo of $0.01 for the Second Quarter

Results Driven by Successful Execution on Low-Carbon Ethanol and Carbon Capture Acquisition, First Sales of Clean Fuel Production Credits

ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) (“Gevo”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), a leading developer of cost-effective, renewable hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals that also can deliver significant carbon emission abatement, today announced financial results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2025. In a landmark milestone, the Company reported positive net income for the second quarter of 2025 and that it achieved the previously announced positive Adjusted EBITDA1 target for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2025, as a result of successful performance of our assets.

Net Income Attributable to Gevo Grew by $20 Million and Adjusted EBITDA1 Grew by $32 Million During the Six Months Ended June 30, 2025, Compared to Same Period Last Year

The key growth drivers were:

Carbon Dioxide Removal (“CDR”) credit sales have begun, immediately adding a new co-product and stream of revenue for the Company from a global marketplace.

We anticipate growing CDR credit sales to $3-5 million by the end of this year, utilizing biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) removal capacity at our carbon capture and sequestration (“CCS”) assets that is not already claimed in Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) markets.

We estimate long-term sales of this new co-product could exceed $30 million per year or more from the Gevo North Dakota (“GevoND”) site, even before synthetic aviation fuel (“SAF”) is produced and before we expand the use of our CCS site.

The durable CDR market is global and expected to grow. According to third party research of this market2, the second quarter was the highest recorded volume of CDR credit sales recorded and has now accumulated over $10 billion in sales, reflecting nearly 40 million tons of CO2 removal.

We are exploring growth options to bring third party CO2 volumes to our CCS site, where we have leases granting us rights to an estimated 1 million tons per year of pore space, which we believe is capable of sequestering carbon for over one thousand years. We would expect to market the CDR credits generated from additional carbon capture in the future.

During the second quarter, we sold over $1 million worth of CDR credits.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (“CFPC”) sales from low-carbon ethanol with CCS and renewable natural gas (“RNG”) have also begun, contributing approximately $21 million combined to our net income and Adjusted EBITDA1 during the six months ended June 30, 2025.

We are leveraging our specialized capabilities to further reduce the carbon intensity of our low-carbon ethanol with CCS and RNG production facilities, and we expect to continue generating, collecting cash from customers of credits and applying it to our cost of goods sold (“COGS”), thereby causing a reduction in COGS. We treat this credit sale as a co-product credit. During the second quarter, we recognized the COGS benefit for the five months that we have owned GevoND. Going forward, we expect this credit to exceed $10 million per quarter through the end of 2029, when the credit expires, unless further extended by legislation.

Cash from CFPC sales is expected to help us reinvest in site improvements to optimize GevoND and help us fund pre-construction development costs for our portfolio of SAF projects.

Low-carbon fuels, including low-carbon ethanol, carbon capture and co-products, and RNG contributed to income from operations and Adjusted EBITDA1 from the sales of drop-in energy products and associated environmental attributes.

Low-carbon ethanol and co-product operations contributed approximately $18 million to our income from operations and $7 million to our Adjusted EBITDA1 (for a total of $26 million including the impact of CFPC sales) during the six months ended June 30, 2025, excluding the month of January prior to closing our acquisition of these assets, from production of 28 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol, 93,000 tons of feed and 8 million pounds of distillers corn oil co-products.

In the long term, we expect the primary drivers of this contribution to our income from operations and Adjusted EBITDA1 to be consistent operations (volume of low-carbon ethanol and co-products), as well as prevailing market prices of corn and ethanol, which we economically hedge through commodity-based derivative transactions to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations.

We believe this segment will continue to generate durable cash flow due to its competitive advantages, including:

Our wholly owned, onsite CCS currently provides our low-carbon ethanol with an industry-leading carbon intensity score, giving us an advantage when selling to LCFS markets.

We currently produce approximately 2 million gallons per year of corn fiber ethanol, which qualifies that portion of volume for a cellulosic D3 RIN and a near zero carbon intensity on that volume.

Gevo’s RNG facility (“GevoRNG”) contributed approximately $2 million to our income from operations and $3 million to Adjusted EBITDA1 (or a total of $5 million including CFPC sales) during the six months ended June 30, 2025, from approximately 172 thousand MMBtu of RNG production.

Other Recent Transactions:

In May, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our subsidiary Agri-Energy, LLC to A.E. Innovation, LLC (“A.E.”) for $7 million. The transaction includes Agri’s 18-million-gallon-per-year ethanol-production facility located in Luverne, Minnesota and is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to the procurement of financing by A.E. and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Following the sale, we will retain the ownership of certain equipment at the facility, including isobutanol fermentation capacity and some of the vacant land.

Additionally, after the second quarter, we closed on a refinancing in July related to GevoRNG, resulting in the release of approximately $30 million of restricted cash on our balance sheet after reserves and transaction costs.

Our Renewable Jet Fuel Platform Positions Gevo For Long-Term, Reproducible Growth.

The Market Opportunity: U.S. jet fuel consumption is expected to grow by more than 2 billion gallons per year in the next decade according to data from U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”)3. To meet this growing jet fuel demand and balance domestic ethanol supply, we believe dozens of ATJ SAF facilities need to be deployed in the next decade in the US alone, utilizing 3.5 billion gallons of ethanol and producing over 2 billion gallons of cash-cost-of-production competitive, domestic jet fuel, while attracting billions of dollars of investment to local, agricultural communities.

Standardized Plant Designs: Given our extensive history and experience with SAF, and to continue our leadership role in this market, we have developed standardized plant designs, including ATJ-30 and ATJ-60, to convert low-carbon ethanol to SAF. We believe GevoND provides an attractive potential location for ATJ-30, due to our hundreds of acres of undeveloped land, our existing CCS, and our production of low-cost, low-CI ethanol. For the ATJ-60 facility, we remain engaged with the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office on the path to closing the $1.63 billion loan guarantee to construct our facility in South Dakota and are matching our rate of development spend with this financing timeline.

Long-Term Growth Strategy: As we demonstrate the business systems of ATJ-30 and ATJ-60, we expect further growth by developing our SAF platform and proprietary systems, using several models as needed, such as build-own-operate, joint venture, or licensing models. We recognize the enormous market opportunity for our plant designs, systems, and technology given the 180 existing brownfield ethanol locations in the United States, plus additional greenfield locations in the U.S. and globally.

Extensive Intellectual Property Portfolio and Strategic Partnerships: To facilitate this growth, we have developed an extensive intellectual property portfolio around our SAF platform, Ethanol-to-Olefins (“ETO”) technology and Verity carbon tracking software. Our portfolio includes over 300 patents, many of which were issued in the past few years during development of our ATJ-30 and ATJ-60 designs.

2025 Second Quarter Financial Highlights

Ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $126.9 million.

Combined operating revenue, interest and investment income was $44.7 million for the second quarter.

Income from operations of $5.8 million for the second quarter.

Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 of $17.3 million for the second quarter.

GevoND generated income from operations of $17.1 million, and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 of $24.2 million for the second quarter.

GevoRNG generated income from operations of $1.5 million, and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 of $2.6 million for the second quarter.

Net income per share of $0.01 for the second quarter.

Management Comment

“This was a landmark quarter for us,” commented Dr. Patrick Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our results are delivering on the targets we said we would achieve this year, even sooner than we expected. We said we would grow recurring Adjusted EBITDA, and it has begun—real cash flow, not one-time, not speculative. It’s coming from running our GevoND operations efficiently, capturing carbon, and selling voluntary carbon credits as CDRs and CFPCs, in addition to ethanol, protein, corn oil, and RNG sales. All of this sets the stage for growth of SAF production, more liquid fuel production, more CDRs and more CFPCs.”

“I really like these results regarding carbon sales. It’s outstanding that companies are willing to step up and pay for what they believe in--carbon reduction. It’s a new product; and for us, it’s a co-product. Our fuel manufacturing systems are designed end-to-end to abate carbon. The result is that we can manufacture cost-competitive renewable liquid fuels, while abating carbon. What I like about our plans for growth even more is the potential for rural economic growth, the additional production of protein and feed for the food chain, and the potential increased profit for the farmers who supply us. It’s good for America and for Gevo,” continued Dr. Gruber.

Dr. Gruber added: “Building on this base of profitability and our extensive history with SAF, we are positioning ourselves for future reproducible growth. We’re engineering ATJ-30, getting ready for ATJ-60, which needs to be financed, and setting ourselves up to develop this system in the U.S. and globally. The world is going to need more jet fuel. Collectively we believe the path ahead is to make jet fuel from renewables that abate the carbon footprint, which can compete on a cost basis with petro-jet fuel. We believe Gevo is positioned to meet the growing world demand for jet fuel with SAF. That’s the vision. SAF done right is a cost-effective, scalable platform for fulfilling growing jet fuel demand, supporting agriculture for future generations, and building real American energy independence.”

Leke Agiri, Gevo’s Chief Financial Officer, commented: “We achieved positive net income and positive Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, marking a major financial milestone and delivering on what we said we would do. This reflects the tangible value created by our GevoND and GevoRNG business segments, along with the monetization of the CFPC.”

Mr. Agiri continued: “Our CFPC production is booked each quarter as a reduction in COGS as we produce and earn this credit. In addition, our sales of these credits have been backed by a tax insurance policy to mitigate residual risk associated with transferring these credits to buyers, which we view as low risk to begin with. In short, the growth we have reported this quarter represents a step-change for us.”

Further Details on the Clean Fuel Production Credit

Also known as the Section 45Z tax credit, the CFPC was an extension of previous domestic biofuel incentives and took effect in 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. It was subsequently extended further in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, through 2029. Historically, similar credits called the Blenders Tax Credit have been extended by legislation to continue to promote U.S. domestic agriculture and biofuel production. As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 7, 2025, we initially sold $22 million of these generated credits to a bank. This bank has a right of first offer (subject to certain conditions) to purchase substantially all of the remaining credits we expect to generate in 2025. In addition, the market demand for similar investment and production tax credits is approximately $30 billion4 according to third party research of this market, and we expect to sell the full amount of our capacity each year.

2025 Second Quarter Financial Results

Operating revenue. During the three months ended June 30, 2025, operating revenue increased by $38.2 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to $37.2 million in revenue from GevoND, and $0.9 million in revenue from the sale of isooctane and others.

Cost of production. Cost of production increased $13.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to production costs related to GevoND operation, partially offset by $20.8 million 45Z tax credit booked, net of transaction costs. The 45Z tax credit, designed to incentivize the production of SAF, allowed us to lower overall production costs, while maintaining production levels.

Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to $4.8 million depreciation related to GevoND, partially offset by a $2.5 million reduction of depreciation related to assets fully depreciated at our Luverne, Minnesota facility.

Research and development expense. Research and development expenses decreased $0.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to decreased consulting expenses.

General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense decreased $0.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation, partially offset by $1.2 million higher insurance costs, professional and consulting services and computer and software costs.

Project development costs. Project development costs are primarily related to our Alcohol-to-Jet Projects and Verity, which consist primarily of employee expenses, preliminary engineering costs, and technical consulting fees. Project development costs decreased $6.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to a $3.3 million decrease in consulting and professional services fees, as well as the timing of $3.5 million reimbursement received from the USDA program during the second quarter.

Income (loss) from operations. The Company’s loss from operations decreased by $29.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. This improvement was primarily driven by increased revenues from GevoND, lower cost of production due to the recognition of the 45Z tax credit, a reduction in project development expenses, and decreased general and administrative expenses.

Interest expense. Interest expense increased $3.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the debt used to acquire GevoND and a higher interest rate on our remarketed RNG bonds.

Interest and investment income. Interest and investment income decreased $2.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the acquisition of GevoND and to fund our capital projects and operating costs, resulting in a lower balance of cash equivalent investments during the three months ended June 30, 2025.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

This press release contains a financial measure that does not comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), including non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, allocated intercompany expenses for shared service functions, and non-cash stock-based compensation from GAAP loss from operations. Management believes this measure is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management’s internal comparisons to Gevo’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. In addition, Gevo believes this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it allows for greater transparency into the indicators used by management as a basis for its financial and operational decision making. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Gevo’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided below.

Australia currently imports around seven billion litres of jet fuel per year, with 70 per cent coming from China, Malaysia, and Singapore; China alone accounts for 25 per cent of the total.

“If we don’t move quickly to seize this opportunity, we run a real risk that the future will be made in Singapore, not Australia,” he said, as reported by The Australian Financial Review, which also notes that Singapore can produce around one billion litres of biofuel annually.

“We want to use our feedstock here to produce fuels here, power our industry here and capture the economic and security benefits here.

“We can’t afford to default to what we’ve been historically pretty good at in Australia – exporting our raw commodities for others to process. Doing this, we simply export the opportunity to others.”

According to Forshaw, while the global trade environment has been favourable for Australia’s fuel supply, that may no longer be a reliable assumption.

“Cross-border supply chains grew during times when the benefits of globalisation were understood. Their resilience is being increasingly challenged by growing nationalism, protectionist trade policies and security challenges,” he said.

“Fuel underpins energy and transport, and powers our wider economies – literally.”

Airbus and Qantas earlier this year jointly invested $15 million into a climate-focused venture capital fund, Climate Tech Partners (CTP), which will work with corporate backers to develop solutions targeted at specific industry needs.

The money will form a new vehicle alongside CTP’s main fund and will prioritise the development of SAF, feedstock development, and other related technologies.

It marks the latest step in Qantas and Airbus’ wider US$200 million joint initiative launched in 2022, aimed at fast-tracking SAF production, with Qantas in 2023 also calling for SAF blending mandates.

NBAA recently joined with three other associations to voice the business aviation community’s strong support for comments submitted by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition on proposed revisions to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) renewable fuels standards and policies to enhance production, investment and market opportunities for SAF in the U.S.

In an Aug. 8 letter to EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin, stakeholders emphasized the need to prioritize SAF development pathways and production as part of the agency’s Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program Standards for 2026 and 2027 and in other related programs.

“The business aviation sector is an incubator for American innovation, securing U.S. global aviation leadership while propelling industry commitment to improved efficiency,” the letter stated. “The business aviation industry has continually invested in the development of innovative products, procedures, and policies, including development and proliferation of [SAF].”

Stewart D’Leon, CAM, NBAA director of environmental and technical operations, cited the groups’ support to “correct the structural disadvantage” between production of renewable jet fuel and renewable diesel. The EPA has proposed assigning both fuels a renewable identification number equivalence of 1.6 to incentivize greater production capacity for SAF.

“This is another mechanism by which our industry can signal to producers that we want more SAF,” he added. “It places these opportunities on the same playing field.”

With new SAF production facilities due to come online soon, signatories also encouraged the EPA and the Trump administration to stimulate additional, private sector investment in renewable fuels production; embrace additional feedstocks, consistent with the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit; and removing bureaucratic barriers to incentivize domestic SAF production.

“SAF is an American innovation benefiting U.S. farmers, fuel producers, and communities across the nation,” the letter continued. “American innovators in our private sector have developed novel ways to convert crops, plants, biomass, captured gases, waste, and even recycled cooking oil into jet fuel. Combining conventional jet fuel with SAF allows America’s aviation industry to meet growing demand, enhance domestic energy security, and create market opportunities for American industries.”

The letter further supports the SAF Coalition’s recommendations to create pathways for renewable jet fuel derived from corn ethanol and renewable biomass, biogenic gases and other gases of non-biological origin, and other measures to stimulate SAF production.

“This letter demonstrates how the entire aviation community has come together to support this technology,” D’Leon added. “These suggestions are another avenue toward helping to mainstream this fuel and to achieve our industry’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

The first phase begins now with the selection of ten farming families to grow macaúba.
He noted that the company has 1.8 million seedlings ready for distribution to farmers.
The plan is to select farmers in the second half of this year and start planting in early 2026.
Acelen hired FGV Europe, the international arm of Fundação Getulio Vargas, to assess the feasibility of working with partner farmers.","Acelen Renováveis, the renewable energy arm of Mubadala Capital, is selecting small and medium-sized farmers to plant macaúba in a sustainable farming program. The company estimates it will invest R$900 million—including R$174 million of its own capital—in incentives for third-party cultivation of the oil-rich palm.

The company’s overall project, budgeted at $3 billion, calls for planting 180,000 hectares of macaúba and producing 1 billion liters per year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) in Mataripe, Bahia, where it will build a biorefinery.

CEO Luiz de Mendonça estimates that at least 20% of the planted area—36,000 hectares—will be cultivated by small and medium-sized farmers. The first phase begins now with the selection of ten farming families to grow macaúba. Priority is being given to producers with degraded pastureland in municipalities near Montes Claros, northern Minas Gerais, home to Acelen’s Agripark, the company’s agri-industrial innovation center.

“We see northern Minas Gerais and southern Bahia as the most favorable areas for cultivation. We started in Montes Claros because of its proximity to the Agripark,” Mr. Mendonça said. He noted that the company has 1.8 million seedlings ready for distribution to farmers.

In addition to seedlings, participating farmers will receive training, technical support, and financial assistance. “We also want to show that macaúba forests can be integrated with other crops, such as cocoa,” Mr. Mendonça said.

According to Victor Barra, Acelen Renováveis’ agribusiness director, the company will purchase all macaúba produced by its partners at market prices.

The plan is to select farmers in the second half of this year and start planting in early 2026. Because macaúba takes four years to begin producing, farmers will receive a stipend during that period—estimated at the equivalent of 20 minimum wages per year for 10 hectares planted.

Acelen hired FGV Europe, the international arm of Fundação Getulio Vargas, to assess the feasibility of working with partner farmers. The study found that producers need to plant at least 10 hectares for the operation to be profitable. Annual income from 10 hectares is estimated at 44 minimum wages per year, or R$5,000 a month, according to Cleber Guarany, an associate director at FGV Europe. “From the 14th year, earnings could reach 60 minimum wages per year. It’s an attractive return, considering that the average monthly income for family farmers is R$1,200 in Bahia and R$1,800 in Minas Gerais,” Mr. Guarany said.

Mr. Barra of Acelen added that earnings could be higher depending on advances in the crop’s genetic improvement. “We’re starting with seedlings from natural groves, but we have partnerships with more than 20 universities in Brazil to improve macaúba yields,” he said.

Regarding the Mataripe biorefinery, Mr. Mendonça said the company has obtained its first construction permit and expects to begin building in early 2026, with completion slated for 2028.

In May, Acelen began planting macaúba on its own farm in Cachoeira, Bahia—200 hectares of a planned 1,500 hectares that will receive 800,000 seedlings. In July, Acelen Renováveis issued R$500 million in private commercial notes through HSBC under the National Treasury’s EcoInvest program. Mr. Mendonça said the company may join the next EcoInvest auction with another lender.

Mitchell",,,,,https://www.afslaw.com/perspectives/alerts/hard-days-night-renewable-energy-incentives,"Termination of Various Other Credits OBBBA terminates early various other clean energy tax credits.
Foreign Entity of Concern Rules OBBBA imposes greater FEOC restrictions on the production of renewable energy in the United States.
Thus, understanding an energy producer’s supply chain and contractual ties to FEOCs is critical to ensuring eligibility for certain energy tax credits.
Key Definitions Under the FEOC Rules At the heart of the FEOC rules is the concept of the “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE).
Material Assistance From a PFE Material assistance from a PFE is another critical factor that can jeopardize a project’s eligibility for energy tax credits.","Modification of Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U)[1]

OBBBA retains the zero-emission nuclear power production credit for existing nuclear facilities through December 31, 2032. OBBBA, as discussed below, also enacted new “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules, which may limit taxpayers’ access to the credit in certain circumstances.

Termination and Restrictions on Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 45Y) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E)

OBBBA terminates the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit for wind and solar energy property placed in service after December 31, 2027. However, such placed-in-service requirement does not apply to property that begins construction within one year after the enactment of OBBBA (i.e., by July 4, 2026). The credit for technologies other than wind and solar begins to phase out in 2034 as follows: 75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034, 50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035, and 0% credit for facilities beginning construction after December 31, 2035. Additionally, as discussed below, OBBBA’s FEOC limitations apply to restrict access to the credit in certain circumstances.

Phase-Out and Restrictions on Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

OBBBA terminates the advanced manufacturing production credit for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. Additionally, effective for eligible components sold after December 31, 2026, a person will not be treated as having sold an eligible component that is integrated (a primary component) into another eligible component (a secondary component) unless 65% of the direct material cost to produce the secondary component within the same manufacturing facility is attributable to primary components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Extension and Modification of Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

OBBBA extends the period for which the clean fuel production credit can be claimed by two years, until December 31, 2029. However, with respect to fuel produced after December 31, 2025, OBBBA (1) reduces the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1/gallon, (2) limits the credit to fuel that is exclusively derived from a feedstock that was produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and (3) modifies the calculation of the emissions rate, which is used in determining the credit amount. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Restrictions on Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

While OBBBA does not modify the expiration of the carbon oxide sequestration credit, OBBBA increases the amount of the Section 45Q tax credit for captured carbon oxides used in either enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects or for other specified commercial purposes from a current rate of $60 per metric ton to $85 per metric ton, the same amount available for captured carbon oxides disposed of in secure geological storage. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025. Additionally, as discussed below, the credit is subject to OBBBA’s FEOC limitations.

Phase-Out of Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

OBBBA phases out Section 45V early. Under OBBBA, clean hydrogen facilities must begin construction by December 31, 2027, as opposed to December 31, 2032, as previously contemplated under the IRA. However, OBBBA does not apply the FEOC limitations to Section 45V.

Termination of Various Other Credits

OBBBA terminates early various other clean energy tax credits. For vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, OBBBA terminates Section 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), Section 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicles), and Section 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles). Further, for property placed in service and expenditures made, respectively, after December 31, 2025, OBBBA terminates Section 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) and Section 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit). Additionally, for property placed in service, property beginning construction, and property acquired, respectively, after June 30, 2026, OBBBA terminates Section 30C (Charging/Alternative Fuel Refueling Property), Section 179D (Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings), and Section 45L (New Energy Efficient Homes).

The various changes above may create additional pressure for taxpayers intending to claim energy incentives to accelerate expenditures or begin construction on projects much sooner than originally planned.

Foreign Entity of Concern Rules

OBBBA imposes greater FEOC restrictions on the production of renewable energy in the United States. Under OBBBA, FEOC rules disqualify certain energy projects from access to certain energy tax credits if the project is either owned or controlled by a disqualified foreign entity or person tied to China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran (each a Covered Nation) or if the project receives certain material assistance or supply chain inputs from such foreign entities or persons. Thus, understanding an energy producer’s supply chain and contractual ties to FEOCs is critical to ensuring eligibility for certain energy tax credits.

Key Definitions Under the FEOC Rules

At the heart of the FEOC rules is the concept of the “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE). A PFE is defined as either a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (FIE).

Specified Foreign Entity (SFE)

SFEs are defined as any of the following: (1) foreign terrorist organizations designated by the US Secretary of State, (2) specially designated nationals and blocked persons on the US Department of Treasury’s OFAC list, (3) Chinese military companies operating in the United States, (4) entities on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act list, (5) certain Chinese battery manufacturers identified in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2024, (6) the governments of a Covered Nation (or any instrumentality thereof), (7) any entity incorporated (or maintaining a qualified business unit or principal place of business) in a Covered Nation, or (8) a citizen or national of a Covered Nation. In addition, any entity (whether a US entity or otherwise) that is “controlled” (generally meaning more than 50% owned, directly or indirectly) by a legal entity incorporated in a Covered Nation, a national or citizen of a Covered Nation, or a Covered Nation (or instrumentality thereof), is an SFE.

Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE)

FIEs generally are entities that are determined to be under too much control or influence from an SFE. OBBBA uses two approaches to defining FIEs.

FIE – Statutory Test First, OBBBA statutorily lays out several contractual relationships that will render an entity a FIE: (1) an SFE owns at least 25% of the entity (by vote or value), (2) multiple SFEs together own at least 40% of the entity (by vote or value), (3) at least 15% of the entity’s original issued debt is held by one or more SFEs, or (4) an SFE has the authority —directly or indirectly — to appoint a covered officer, such as a board member or officer.

FIE – Effective Control Test Second, OBBBA introduces a much broader “effective control” test, which provides that if the entity makes a payment to an SFE under a contract or arrangement that gives the SFE (or a related entity) “effective control” over a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or eligible component — including the extraction, processing, or recycling of critical minerals — then such entity is a FIE. OBBBA requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to publish guidance on the definition and application of the “effective control” test, and until such point, certain statutory rules apply for purposes of determining effective control.

Material Assistance From a PFE

Material assistance from a PFE is another critical factor that can jeopardize a project’s eligibility for energy tax credits. OBBBA establishes a cost ratio mechanism to measure material assistance with respect to each project: the material assistance cost ratio (MACR). As noted in the chart below, the material assistance rules apply only to clean electricity production credits, clean electricity investment credits, and advanced manufacturing production credits.

For the clean electricity production credit (Section 45Y) and the clean electricity investment credit (Section 48E), the MACR is calculated by taking the total direct costs of all manufactured products and subcomponents incorporated into the facility, subtracting the costs attributable to PFEs, and dividing by the total direct costs. If the MACR is less than certain statutorily set thresholds, the project is deemed to have received material assistance from a PFE. For the advanced manufacturing production credit (Section 45X), only the direct material costs for eligible components are counted for purposes of calculating the MACR, which is calculated in the same manner noted above.

Projects must meet or exceed certain statutorily set MACR thresholds, which vary depending on the technology and the year in which construction begins. For example, some facilities must meet a 40% threshold in 2026, with the requirement rising to 60% or more in later years. The Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026, to help clarify these MACR threshold requirements. Until such point, IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications can be used by taxpayers to demonstrate compliance with MACR percentage thresholds.

Summary of Tax Credits Limited by FEOC Rules

If a taxpayer meets the definition of a PFE due to its ownership structure or contracts with certain foreign entities, or receives material assistance from a PFE, depending upon the type of tax credit at issue, the taxpayer may not be eligible to claim the credit. The following chart provides an overview of how the FEOC rules limit access to the tax credits discussed above.

As a result of the FEOC rules, any renewable energy project or manufacturing of eligible components will require an extensive FEOC analysis to determine tax credit eligibility. Moreover, strategics, private equity funds, or tax credit syndicators purchasing tax credits under Section 6418 will now need to conduct extensive diligence of the tax credit seller’s capital and organizational structure, and supply-chain structure, to ensure FEOC compliance is satisfied, and credits are properly transferable.

Further Guidance Needed on FEOC Rules

Although Congress attempted to refine the FEOC rules as OBBBA was enacted, there remain significant areas where Treasury and the IRS are expected to provide further guidance. For example, the scope of what constitutes “effective control” in the context of payments to FIEs is not fully defined, and the statute directs the Treasury and the IRS to issue rules to prevent entities from circumventing the restrictions through contracts or other arrangements. Additionally, the material assistance rules require the development of safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026, to clarify the percentage of costs attributable to PFEs. Until then, taxpayers must rely on interim guidance and supplier certifications, which may not address all practical scenarios.

Beginning of Construction Guidance

For many of the energy tax credits discussed in this alert, eligibility to claim such credits will turn on the precise moment a project is considered to have “begun construction.” The IRS, through a series of notices, has long applied two primary tests to determine when a project has begun construction: the five percent safe harbor and the physical work test. Although the details of those tests fall outside the scope of this update, it is important to note that in 2022 the Service confirmed that the analytical framework set out in those notices remains valid when evaluating projects for energy tax credit purposes. In certain parts of OBBBA, Congress formally incorporated the existing IRS beginning of construction notices, but only for the limited purpose of administering the statute’s FEOC provisions.

However, on July 7, 2025, the Trump Administration issued an Executive Order directing the Treasury Department to publish guidance on the “beginning of construction” rules, which would prevent developers from relying on perceived “loopholes” in the current beginning of construction guidance. Because this Executive Order could materially alter how and how quickly projects qualify for the array of federal energy credits discussed herein, sponsors, investors, and other stakeholders should re-examine their beginning of construction strategies and documentation in real time.

The company sent a letter to the Sugarloaf Twp.
Sugarloaf Twp.
From its Akron plant, Alterra shipped out 23,895 pounds of waste in 2021, but shipments increased to 172,653 three years later.
The NRDC, however, said in an issue brief in March that it’s misleading to consider pyrolysis as recycling.","Alterra Energy ended its proposed plans to build a plastics recycling plant in Sugarloaf Twp.

The company sent a letter to the Sugarloaf Twp. Board of Supervisors on Friday stating its no longer able to pursue developing land at 42 Tomhicken Rd.

“Additionally, the landowner now believes the property’s value is significantly elevated due to its proximity to a proposed transmission line and indicated that he intends to market to a data center project,” according to the letter. “We had been operating under mutually understood expectations related to a lease arrangement; however, the landowner has recently shifted to a purchase-only requirement, which makes the site unworkable within our current development model and timeline.”

Omar Terrie Alterra, Head of Public Affairs for Alterra, confirmed details Monday.

“We are still looking at areas in the Hazleton and Sugarloaf and are committed to trying to come to Northeast Pennsylvania,” Terrie said. “My development team is looking anywhere and everywhere, but doesn’t have a specific location. We are dedicated to Northeast PA.”

The Akron,Ohio-based company planned to truck in discarded plastic from the tri-state area, melt it down and ship it back out via train.

Sugarloaf Twp. Manager Liz Tolan said Alterra never submitted an application with the township.

“They (Alterra) attended one Board of Supervisors meeting several months ago to introduce their company to the board and attendees, and they were scheduled to be on the agenda this month to give an update on where they were with their project, and to answer any questions from residents in attendance,” Tolan said Monday. “They have since withdrawn their request to be on the agenda as they could not secure their parcel in question and therefore will not be developing in Sugarloaf.”

In June, grassroots organizers Annie Vinatieri and Josephine Gingerich, Health Advocacy Outreach Coordinator, educated residents during a town hall meeting about Alterra’s plans, potential health effects and how to get involved.

Using a process called pyrolysis, Alterra planned to heat shredded plastic to 800 to 1,000 degrees to “produce circular synthetic oil for the manufacturing of new plastics and other valuable products.”

Alterra said its Sugarloaf plant annually would have emitted 5.6 tons of hazardous air pollutants, 11.1 tons of particulate matter and 44.4 tons of volatile organic compounds.

From its Akron plant, Alterra shipped out 23,895 pounds of waste in 2021, but shipments increased to 172,653 three years later.

Before the plant, originally proposed by a company called VadXX, opened in 2014, Akron donated land for the facility in return for a share of revenues.

This May, when the plant sought to renew its permits, people packed a hearing, and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency extended the time for people to submit comments, which the agency is still reviewing.

The Natural Resources Defense Council lists more than 25 hazardous air pollutants that can be released from pyrolysis plants in addition to carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide.

Only 10 chemical recycling facilities like it existed nationwide, and nearly all were in the pilot or demonstration stages, according to a July 2024 report for the Ohio River Valley Institute, a valley that has two pyrolysis plants, including Alterra’s original site in Akron.

Chemical and petroleum industries want to demonstrate that the plants can improve low recycling rates for plastic and ensure future demand as the rise of electric vehicles and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions reduces the future use of petroleum as fuel.

Chevron Phillips Chemical and Neste, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel, have invested in Alterra.

The NRDC, however, said in an issue brief in March that it’s misleading to consider pyrolysis as recycling.

“Pyrolysis actually can’t recycle much, if any plastic,” the NRDC said, citing a government report that found between 0.1% and 6% of plastic waste entering a pyrolysis plant becomes new plastic. “What it mostly produces instead is dirty fuels.”

From economic and environmental perspectives, the NRDC said it is preferable to make new plastic from virgin materials rather than pyrolysis.

“It’s a false solution to the climate crisis perpetuating the burning of fuels, perpetuating the manufacturing of plastics,” Sandy Field of Save our Susquehanna, a group that defeated a pyrolysis plant that had been proposed by Encina Development Group in Point Twp. Northumberland County and has continued to oppose the technology’s use elsewhere, especially in environmental justice communities where a majority of residents have low incomes or are from minority groups. “We did live without plastics in the olden days. It’s possible.”",https://www.standardspeaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HZS-L-plastics-0628-18.jpg?w=1024&h=703,N,,2025-08-11 17:56:29.580859

The project is situated in Palos de la Frontera, within the Huelva province, and represents a total investment of approximately €1.2 billion. Its location offers strategic advantages, being adjacent to Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park, enabling strong operational synergies and streamlined logistics.

The upcoming plant is designed to deliver an impressive annual output capacity of 500,000 tonnes of sustainable fuels. Among its primary products will be SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and HVO100 (renewable diesel), both of which play a critical role in reducing the carbon footprint of transportation and aviation. Importantly, the feedstock for production will come from agricultural residues and used cooking oils, promoting circular economy principles and reducing reliance on fossil-based raw materials.

From an environmental perspective, the plant integrates advanced, eco-friendly technologies aimed at minimising its impact on the surrounding ecosystem. One of the standout features is its commitment to operating exclusively with recycled water, significantly reducing freshwater consumption. Furthermore, the facility is engineered to cut CO2 emissions by 75% compared to conventional biofuel plants. This reduction translates to avoiding nearly 3 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually—a major contribution toward Europe’s decarbonisation goals.

The scale, innovation, and sustainability embedded in this project make it a landmark development for Spain’s renewable energy landscape. It underscores the nation’s ambition to position itself as a leader in clean fuel technologies and green energy production. For Cobra IS, this venture further solidifies its role as a key driver in the transition toward low-carbon transportation solutions across Europe.

This milestone also aligns with VINCI Group’s broader presence and financial footprint in Spain. In 2024, the company generated a total revenue of €3.8 billion in the country. Of this, Cobra IS accounted for €3.2 billion, VINCI Energies for €0.3 billion, and VINCI Construction for another €0.3 billion. The new biofuel plant contract adds to VINCI’s growing portfolio of sustainable infrastructure projects in Spain, further enhancing its strategic position in the European renewable energy sector.

By combining substantial investment, cutting-edge technologies, and a strong commitment to sustainability, the project at Palos de la Frontera is poised to become a benchmark for future biofuel plants worldwide.

The plant at the heart of the story fired up in 2016, turning waste oils and animal fats into what the industry calls sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. It supplied millions of gallons annually to United Airlines and JetBlue Airways—until production ground to a halt in April when all 35 employees were laid off. World Energy, the Boston-based owner, had billed the Paramount facility as a springboard toward a second, larger site in Houston. Chief Executive Gene Gebolys now says the Los Angeles-area closure is a “reset.” Air Products, once slated to lead a $2 billion expansion, pulled out in February, citing unfavorable commercial conditions. United Airlines has since confirmed that it ended its SAF purchase agreement with World Energy “a few years ago.” In a separate statement, JetBlue called World Energy “a valued partner” and said cooperation on future volumes will continue.

Why this matters for eco-minded travelers

Aviation accounts for 2.5 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, and traffic is projected to more than double by 2050. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) wants carriers to hit net-zero emissions by mid-century, a target that requires 118 billion gallons of SAF every year—more than 300 times today’s worldwide output. For consumers, the Paramount shutdown removes one of the few verifiable sources of green jet fuel in North America. It also highlights the gap between headline-grabbing airline pledges and on-the-ground production capacity:

SAF is forecast to cover only 0.7 percent of global jet-fuel demand this year, up from 0.3 percent in 2024, according to IATA.

Air passenger demand, by contrast, is expected to rise 6 percent during the same period.

A Reuters review found airlines have announced 165 SAF projects in the past 12 years, but only 36 have delivered any fuel. Another 23 have been abandoned, 27 delayed or placed on indefinite hold, and 31 have yet to produce a single gallon.

If every project still on the drawing board reached full capacity, worldwide supply would expand by 12 billion gallons—barely 10 percent of what is needed for the 2050 goal.

The Cost Conundrum and European Regulations

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced through the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) method—used by Paramount—costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel. Airlines argue that major oil companies are hesitant to increase production at these prices, while some refiners claim that demand is too weak for significant investment. As a result, travelers may bear the financial burden; if SAF remains expensive, airlines could implement ticket surcharges or raise base fares. New European Union regulations mandate airlines to blend at least 2 percent SAF into every flight starting in 2025, increasing to 6 percent by 2030 and 70 percent by 2050. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that the 2025 mandate alone will add $2.9 billion to airlines' annual fuel and compliance costs, likely impacting transatlantic fares.

Challenges in the Global Pipeline

Beyond Paramount, several high-profile projects illustrate the challenges in the sector. SGP BioEnergy, based in New York, initially planned to open the world's largest SAF complex in Panama this year, but construction has been postponed to 2027 due to lukewarm airline support and the possibility of pivoting to renewable diesel for trucks and ships. Meanwhile, British start-up Velocys has spent 15 years trying to commercialize Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts municipal waste and forestry byproducts into jet fuel. Although pilot quantities have been produced, none of its proposed plants—in Oklahoma, Mississippi, or Immingham, England—have been completed. The English site has received £27 million in government grants since 2022, along with an additional £3 million in July, yet the location remains an empty field today.

What can travelers expect in the near term?

Because HEFA relies on limited feedstocks—used cooking oil and animal fats—the aviation industry agrees it will not meet long-term demand. Yet most near-term projects still hinge on that process. Unless alternative pathways mature quickly, airlines may struggle to obtain enough fuel to satisfy upcoming mandates or their own public climate targets.

Tips for travelers

Ask before you book. Some carriers let you purchase SAF credits or contribute to offset schemes. Verify whether the program funds physical fuel production or merely accounting certificates.

Check the route. Airports in California, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden currently see the most consistent SAF deliveries, albeit in small volumes. Choosing flights that pass through these hubs marginally increases the odds that a portion of your ticket goes toward greener fuel.

Mind the aircraft type. Newer planes such as the Airbus A320neo, A220, and Boeing 787 burn up to 25 percent less fuel than previous generations, providing an immediate emissions benefit independent of SAF availability.

Consider nonstop flights. Takeoffs are fuel-intensive; shaving a connection often lowers total emissions even if the nonstop ticket costs slightly more.

Pack light. Every pound in the overhead bin demands extra fuel. One carry-on instead of two makes a difference on short-haul routes.

The closure of the Paramount refinery underscores a harsh reality: the sustainable jet-fuel revolution is moving far slower than travel demand or airline marketing would suggest. As travelers, our choices—selecting efficient aircraft, supporting credible SAF programs, and advocating for transparent progress—remain pivotal. But for the moment, the greenest decision may still be the oldest one: fly less or make every trip count.",https://jetsetterguide.com/sites/default/files/2025-06/AdobeStock_426079297_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2025-08-11 17:56:37.646720

In reality, the interested parties have been in discussions for years, even as the process itself has been delayed by political machinations.","Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has signed into law a government decree mandating the privatization of TAP Air Portugal. The government aims to divest a 49.9% stake, including a 44.9% stake to one or more investors, and a 5% stake earmarked for the employees. The Portuguese government is looking to recoup its Covid-era investment in the carrier, which amounts to about $3.7 billion (€3.2 billion).

Interested parties will have 60 days to prequalify, after which they will be given 90 days to submit non-binding proposals for the acquisition of up to a 44.9% stake in the airline. Numerous airline groups have already expressed interest in becoming shareholders of the airline, including the Lufthansa Group, Air France-KLM, and IAG. There is also speculation that Non-EU airlines could become parties to the process as well.

An Important Step Forward In The Process

The process to privatize TAP began in 2023, but was paused following the collapse of Portugal's center-right minority government in March. The new coalition government, which returned to office in May, has made privatization a priority and the Council of Ministers approved a decree-law last month to initiate formal privatization proceedings. That decree has now been signed into law by the country's president.

The state has also made clear what it expects from the process. It is looking for a strategic partner that will preserve the TAP brand, grow the airline's fleet, maintain and grow the existing route network to Portuguese-speaking countries, and invest in local sustainable aviation fuel production projects. The investors must also maintain operations from Lisbon’s Humberto Delgado Airport (LIS), as well as Portugal's secondary airports, such as Porto and Faro.

The Portuguese government has said that it expects bids from ""numerous interested parties,"" including non-EU airlines. It has also structured the flag carrier’s sale model to allow an airline to partner with other airlines, investment funds, and private investors to submit a joint bid. President de Sousa has expressed his pleasure with the process thus far:

“There are more interested parties than we thought, which means it’s an interesting business. It’s not just the classic ones, but others as well. That’s a good sign. Ideally, we will see TAP integrated into a larger group within a year, with a greater capacity to generate synergies and positive value.""

What Are Potential Investors Purchasing?

TAP is not the only airline on the Iberian Peninsula that is looking for strategic partners. Spanish carrier Air Europa has long been exploring potential partnerships to strengthen its financial position. However, all three of the large European airline groups ultimately ended negotiations with Globalia, Air Europa’s parent company, and it is Turkish Airlines that is the last one standing with a binding offer.

TAP is a very different proposition, as interested investors stand to acquire a stake in one of the top 20 European airlines, based on passenger count and fleet size. A member of Star Alliance, TAP carried 16 million passengers in 2024, delivering a net income of $62.3 million (€53.7 million) on record revenue of $4.9 billion (€4.2 billion). The mainline carrier operates an all-Airbus fleet of 80 aircraft, with a further 22 on order (see table below). Its regional subsidiary, TAP Express, operates a further 19 Embraer E190/195s.

According to data from Cirium, in the first half of 2025, TAP operated 100 routes involving 89 different airports. It served 88 destinations from its main base in Lisbon and a further 12 from Porto. For potential investors, one of the airline’s main strengths is its extensive network to Brazil, where it serves 14 different destinations. But equally appealing will be its geographical position at the western edge of Europe, as well as the rapid growth of its North American network, where it now has 11 destinations.

With the Portuguese president having signed the decree into law, the privatization process has now been officially started. In reality, the interested parties have been in discussions for years, even as the process itself has been delayed by political machinations.

In the upcoming months, the sale of the minority stake will be structured into four phases, as follows:

Pre-qualification: All interested parties have 60 days to formally express their intention to proceed with the carrier and qualify for the proposal process.

Proposal submissions: All qualified parties will be required to submit a detailed proposal during the course of Q4, with an emphasis on how their organization will ""foster synergies"" with TAP.

Binding offers: Viable proposals will be short-listed (likely to 2–3 participants at most), and will be asked to submit binding offers after due diligence processes.

Data from Cirium’s EmeraldSky tool shows that more efficient seating arrangements can significantly reduce aircraft carbon emissions, offering a quick alternative for airlines to meet their net-zero by 2050 commitment.

While increasing seat density might not appeal to passengers on the face of it, such measures can reduce personal carbon emissions. Smart seating solutions can mean that comfort is not noticeably impacted.

How seat density impacts airline CO2 emissions

Cirium’s analysis shows that some airlines have already achieved reductions in CO2 emissions per available seat-kilometre (ASK) by redistributing the fixed space inside the cabin more efficiently.

Once an aircraft is airborne, its fuel consumption is largely fixed. The more seats available to share the fuel load, the lower the per-passenger emissions.

The notion that higher seat density in the cabin can reduce the personal carbon footprint of each passenger is not new. Previous studies conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) have shown that airlines operating the same aircraft on the same route can make their flights more sustainable by adding seats.

An ICCT study published in 2018, examining the transatlantic market, found that:

“Aircraft fuel burn was found to be the most important driver of fuel efficiency overall, explaining almost 40% of the variation in airline fuel efficiency across carriers, followed by seating density, which accounted for one-third of the variation. Freight share and passenger load factors were relatively less important.”

Cebu Pacific reduces carbon emissions by 25% with denser seating on A330-900neo

Cirirum cites one outstanding example of possible environmental gains in Cebu Pacific’s A330-900neo. The airline’s cabin configuration accommodates 459 seats—138 more than the global average for this aircraft type.

Despite operating the same aircraft, on the same route, with the same engines as other carriers, Cebu Pacific has seen a 25% reduction in its environmental footprint, simply by carrying more passengers.

Rethinking aircraft efficiency: Opportunities and trade-offs

Sustainability in aviation is often associated with new technologies, with their associated long research and development timelines, and the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

But new types of propulsion for large commercial jets are still on the drawing board. SAF supplies are woefully low, still under 1% of the global fuel demand, and with few signs of significant increases in the short term.

However, airlines can take immediate steps to fly more sustainably by rearranging their cabins. The question remains whether the airlines’ customers will value greener flights over greater legroom.

In recent years, airlines have been adding more premium space to their aircraft, responding to customer preferences.

The cabin layout decision will hinge on each airline’s brand positioning. It is easier for budget airlines to arrange the cabin space for the lowest individual carbon footprint than it would be for a full-service carrier.

In the end, customers will decide. Airlines will need to balance the stated desire for sustainability with the actions of their customers at the time of booking. If passengers continue to prioritise their comfort over their carbon footprint, then airlines will design their cabins accordingly.

From a sustainability perspective, however, the results are clear: emissions performance is not just driven by the type of aircraft an airline operates but by how it is configured.

Cirium’s data suggests that smarter seating arrangements can make a significant difference in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule.
Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.
Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.","In 2019, Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, hailed its new contract with green jet fuel producer World Energy as an example for the aviation industry to follow in its drive to cut emissions.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers' pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy's plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

""Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases"" overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. ""People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.""

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United's fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy ""a few years ago"", without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a ""valued partner"" since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy's struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry's plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

NO CLEAR PATHWAY

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry's claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector's faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialised, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

Of the remaining projects, 23 have been abandoned, 27 are delayed or on indefinite hold, 31 have yet to produce any fuel, and 4 are SAF credit deals, where no physical fuel is delivered.

For the other 44 projects, Reuters was unable to find any public updates since their initial announcements.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That's about 10% of what's needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn't producing enough fuel.

""These guys are the cause of the problem, and they've got to start playing their part,"" said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

""I'd like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,"" Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

PARAMOUNT 'RESET'

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy's partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What's more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry's long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

'EXERCISE IN FUTILITY'

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

""This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,"" said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

NEW TECHNOLOGY

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys's English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Li Qiao (The Conversation) ... But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

...

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change. READ MORE

BY Susanne Retka Schill

While there may be only one ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) pathway registered with EPA to generate D4 RINs right now—LanzaJet’s facility in Soperton, Georgia—experts speaking in Omaha at the International Fuel Ethanol Workshop & Expo this June all said they expect ETJ to become a viable source of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the future. The goals are substantial. In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge calls for 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050. Based on announcements, 2025 SAF production is expected to reach 660 million gallons globally, according to Azadeh Rohani, senior consultant with Worley Consulting. The International Air Transport Association projects 120 billion gallons of SAF will be needed annually to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

With 850,000 flights operated using SAF since 2011, Tim Hughes, project director with the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative, says the aviation industry is moving forward in decarbonizing its fuel.

Other data collected by the Air Transport Action Group indicates that globally:

• $45 billion dollars have been committed by airlines to date in forward purchase agreements for SAF;

• 69 airports are regularly supplied with SAF;

• 50 airlines have committed to 2030 SAF goals ranging from 5-30%, with most committed to 10%.

• 20 million metric tons of SAF uptake by 2030 could be possible under proposed and committed policies.

Eight SAF technology pathways and three coprocessing pathways have been tested and approved by ASTM, Hughes says, with the HEFA pathway being the most prominent right now. “But we’re also looking at alcohol-to-jet. And, we know that in laboratories we can take any type of carbon source and produce a fuel out of it. Some are more complicated than others, and some require a lot of energy in order to make [them] work.” CAAFI’s technical committee, made up of companies like Boeing, Airbus, GE and Pratt & Whitney, look closely at any new fuel, he says, to make sure it performs at high altitudes, is stable and safe, and works in all different engine types around the world.

ETJ Opportunities

“Ethanol-to-jet can be competitive compared to HEFA, the main process at the moment for SAF, keeping in mind the limitations we see with HEFA feedstock availability,” says Worley Consulting’s Rohani.

The HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) process uses fats, oils and greases to manufacture SAF using the petroleum refining process with specialized catalysts.

The ethanol-to-jet process, also catalytically driven, involves the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, followed by oligomerization to link the smaller chains together, which are then saturated with hydrogen in a hydrogenation step and, finally, fractionated to separate the SAF from the byproducts of renewable diesel and renewable naphtha.

ETJ compares favorably to HEFA in terms of carbon intensity reduction and lands slightly higher in cost of production, Rohani says. (See accompanying chart, “Technologies: Typical CI and COP for SAF”) When comparing soybean oil, the main HEFA feedstock, to corn, the SAF yield per acre of corn is five to six times greater than the SAF yield from an acre of soybeans, Rohani adds, another point in corn ethanol’s favor.

Looking at the cost of production for ETJ, ethanol feedstock is the largest component, followed by capital cost. Revenue projections, Rohani says, indicate ETJ can be profitable, but only if incentives are added to the jet and byproducts price. (See the accompanying “Economics” illustration.) In one analysis, the cost of production comes to $5.80, while the potential revenue, including incentives, is $6.20. “The numbers support profitability and competitiveness of the ethanol-to-jet pathway, which gives us some comfort about investing in this process,” she says.

ETJ, however, will only be profitable if the ethanol feedstock and ETJ process meet the carbon reduction thresholds prescribed in the various incentive programs. “Those solutions are really dependent on a specific case,” Rohani says. Carbon capture and sequestration of the CO2 from fermenters offers the biggest opportunity for CI reduction—around 30%. Integrating CCS with cogeneration offers another 20-30% reduction. Using low-carbon hydrogen, low-carbon power and capturing carbon in the ETJ process itself offer smaller CI reductions. “The steps you take to reduce carbon intensity gives you higher [45Z] credits per gallon.” In the example she gave in her FEW presentation, the total CI reductions could receive $1.10 in 45Z credits. Note: after the FEW, changes were made to the 45Z biofuels tax credit when the OBBB Act was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on July 4.

Sofia Cabrera, SAF price reporter for S&P Global Commodity Insights, projects that in the short- and medium-term, HEFA technology is going to predominate. “We are also seeing ETJ gaining some space in the mid- to short-term, but we forecast that in the long term, the three main technologies, HEFA, ETJ and e-SAF (power-to-liquid) are going to gain the same market share.”

Mostly Policy Driven

Airlines are, in part, turning to SAF in response to customers and investors pushing for more sustainable fuels, Cabrera says, “but SAF demand is driven primarily by policy.” Globally, governments take two approaches. One focuses on carbon intensity and greenhouse gas reduction with various incentives. In the other approach, governments mandate blending volumes. Then there are book-and-claim programs being developed, alongside other voluntary carbon reduction frameworks promoted by international aviation organizations like IATA and CORSIA.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU mandate began this year, requiring 2% blends, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The mandate is layered on top of the Renewable Energy Directive (REDIII). The challenge, Cabrera says, is that individual EU members are taking different approaches, with Germany and Denmark looking at CI while others are focused on blending obligations. European regulations also include feedstock requirements.

In Asia, China, Thailand, South Korea and Japan have mandated SAF blending levels. In South America, Brazil has its Fuel for the Future program, Chile has a Road Map for SAF and Columbia is developing a program. “Many countries are putting a lot of effort into pushing this industry forward,” Cabrera says.

In the U.S., prior to the recent enhancements to the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit, and amid shifting dynamics of oilseed and waste fats, markets had paused some HEFA and renewable diesel projects, Cabrera says. “Other policies like the LCFS in California or the purchase credit for SAF in Illinois haven’t been sufficient to compensate for the amount of uncertainty in the market.” Time will tell whether the enhancements to 45Z will be enough to turn things around.

When asked which were more effective, incentives or mandates, carrots or sticks, Kristine Klavers, managing director at EcoEngineers, says that in Europe, the penalties are so big that “the money will be there. But we see so much more activity here in the U.S. in investments to get incentives, and if we look back in history, incentives have been more effective than penalties.”

Unlocking Incentives

Klavers cautions that prospective SAF producers need to contact compliance consultants like EcoEngineers, early in their development process. “You don’t know how many calls I get from companies saying, ‘I have my technology and engineering completed, I have financing, I’m ready. Can I get a credit?’” But unlike established biofuels, where compliance details wait until the end, SAF specifications and regulations need to be considered from the beginning. SAF needs to first meet ASTM specifications, she explains. ETJ has an approved ASTM pathway with non-specific requirements that can be challenging to navigate.

Getting approval using a different process can take years. Then, the fuel itself has to meet ASTM specifications. ASTM isn’t a regulation, she adds, “it’s a specification created by engine manufacturers. They’re not going to let anything through unless they’re 100% certain that their airplanes are safe using the fuel.”

Then, SAF must meet the requirements for the targeted market. “There is only one fuel, but many, many markets, and each and every country is trying to create their own regulation,” Klavers says. “If you want to go to Europe, you have to have at least 50% reduction in the carbon intensity score. But if you’re building a new plant and you want to go to Europe with your SAF, you have to be at least a 65% reduction. So, that’s just your entrance ticket.” The European market, which has blending mandates being phased in, also has layers of regulations in overlapping directives, regulations on allowable feedstocks, plus differences among countries in how they individually apply the regulations.

In the U.S., the first step is to get a Renewable Fuel Standard pathway approved to be able to generate D4 RINs. There is one ETJ pathway approved already, Klavers adds, but it is plant and feedstock specific. For others, “you better come to a company like ours and file a petition to go to the government and ask for a pathway.”

State credits can be stacked on top of the RINs value, but each state’s program differs slightly. And, even after the passage of OBBB, it is yet to be determined just how the 45Z production tax credit will operate. In Canada, British Columbia has had its own low carbon fuel standard in place for a few years, plus the nationwide Clean Fuel Regulations are getting underway.

In the Q&A after their presentations, the speakers were asked bluntly: Does ethanol-to-jet stand on its own from a profitability point of view, without all the stackable credits?

Rohani replied no. “That’s a definite answer, and that’s part of the challenge for the future,” she said. The cost of production, at the moment, is higher than the revenue that you could get without the incentives. Maybe in the future—the technologies are getting mature fast and there will be advances. The price of utilities, the price of feedstock, all of those would have a contribution, but without those incentives, at the moment, it’s not profitable.”

The current uncertainty around U.S. policies has dampened progress, Cabrera says. “Some projects we were expecting to take off in the next two years, we now expect to move to eight or 10 years.” The policy uncertainty is expected to be short term, however, and doesn’t mean SAF development is stopping, she says. “SAF is still very nascent, and everyone is trying to move forward. That is great, but even the fuel needs some fuel, and that will come from policy, in my opinion.”

The letter warns that failure to act swiftly risks jeopardising the UK’s Net Zero targets and putting over £8 billion of private sector investment at risk.

The letter, co-written by Chair and former Secretary of State Chris Huhne and Chief Executive Charlotte Morton OBE, has been signed by over 95 industry representatives and businesses, including one of the UK’s biggest trade unions, the GMB, and each of Great Britain’s and Northern Ireland’s gas distribution networks. The signatories call on Ed Miliband to confirm that biomethane will be treated as a net zero fuel within the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) to fully recognise its value within our net zero ambitions, and to unlock global investment in this primed and ready to grow green sector.

Commenting on the letter, ADBA Chair Chris Huhne said “The UK biogas industry is being unfairly penalised under the current rules of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Biomethane – an often carbon negative technology – is treated the same as climate-wrecking fossil gas. It makes no sense, and it’s holding back investment in the infrastructure we need to reach net zero.”

Andy Prendergast, National Secretary of the GMB, said of the union’s support for the letter: “The gas network not only heats and powers millions of homes and businesses, it also supports hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs. Recognising green gases like biomethane as Net Zero fuels under the UK Emissions Trading Scheme not only gives us a path towards net zero, it also provides a way to protect those livelihoods whilst building a viable export industry. We need to seize this opportunity with both hands.”

The letter highlights the important role biomethane could play in net zero if ETS recognition is granted, particularly in the hard-to-decarbonise areas such as chemicals and manufacturing sectors.

It states. “[Biomethane] supports rural economies, displaces fossil fuels, and cuts methane emissions. […] It also plays a critical role in decarbonising high-value industrial sectors that are essential to the UK’s national security and economic resilience.”

Through this open letter, ADBA and the biogas industry call on the Secretary of State to:

Confirm that biomethane injected into the UK’s gas grid will be eligible under the UK ETS as a net zero fuel in the same way as sustainable aviation fuel

Ensure UK ETS rules fully reflect biomethane’s full value

Set out a clear timeline for implementation to give the market confidence,

They conclude: “Developers and investors urgently need clarity and confirmation that the full net zero value of biomethane will be recognised. Further delays threaten to stall a sector that is ready to scale and deliver.”

“This is an immediate opportunity to unlock growth, accelerate decarbonisation, and bring forward billions in private investment. We urge you to act now.”",https://envirotecmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/biogas-plants-and-sunset-1200px.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 12:57:07.919413

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel.
Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story.","The federal spending law passed in early July 2025, often called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly reduces federal funding for efforts to create renewable or sustainable types of fuel that can power aircraft over long distances while decreasing the damage aviation does to the global climate.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources — such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops – turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July 2025 reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research, and investment from governments, manufacturers and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/681845/original/file-20250723-56-swckd3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C456%2C5472%2C2736&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-11 12:57:16.116048

Brazil: USD 2.114/Gallon

Belgium: USD 2.036/Gallon

The current prices reflect the material’s critical role in high-performance industries such as aviation and air freight, where regulatory shifts, supply dynamics, and operational demands continue to support a stable or rising global price trend.

Key Regional Price Trends and Market Drivers:

USA

Jet fuel prices in the United States reached USD 2.102/Gallon in June 2025. The decline was attributed to soft spot buying amid deteriorating demand and uncertainty stemming from new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These developments adversely impacted air freight and business travel, pushing refiners to lower prices to offload inventories.

United Kingdom

In the UK, jet fuel prices settled at USD 2.036/Gallon in Q2 2025, influenced by the introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending mandate. Although the mandate was modest, it introduced notable cost implications, with refiners and suppliers adjusting pricing structures to accommodate SAF-related costs.

Japan

Japan recorded jet fuel prices of USD 2.057/Gallon in the second quarter of 2025, with conventional jet fuel prices staying firm due to stable kerosene crack spreads and limited SAF integration. Most airlines continued to depend on imported jet fuel or more affordable foreign SAF alternatives, resulting in steady market conditions.

Brazil

Jet fuel prices in Brazil reached USD 2.114/Gallon in June 2025, following Petrobras’s decision to cut average prices to distributors. This move, combined with a drop in domestic airline fuel expenditures, supported carrier margins, especially after early-quarter pressures from currency depreciation and volatile oil prices.

Belgium

Belgium jet fuel prices stood at USD 2.036/Gallon in Q2 2025. The implementation of EU-mandated SAF blending raised procurement costs slightly, particularly for international carriers. Additionally, planned refinery maintenance constrained local supply, contributing to modest upward pricing pressure.

Jet Fuel Industry Overview:

The global jet fuel market reached a value of USD 176.7 Billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to USD 470.5 Billion by 2033, expanding at a CAGR of 10.20% during 2025–2033. This strong growth outlook underscores the critical importance of jet fuel in powering commercial aviation, air cargo operations, and defense fleets worldwide. As air travel demand rebounds and international connectivity strengthens, fuel consumption across key global routes is expected to rise steadily.

The market is driven by several factors, including the resurgence of international tourism, expansion of airline fleets, and ongoing modernization of aviation infrastructure. Additionally, the increasing integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in line with decarbonization targets, regulatory mandates promoting cleaner alternatives, and steady growth in emerging market air traffic are key contributors to the industry’s upward trajectory.

Recent Market Trends and Industry Analysis:

The recovery in international and domestic air travel remains a key driver of jet fuel demand, with passenger volumes rising sharply. Airlines are reinstating routes and increasing flight frequencies, leading to greater aviation turbine fuel (ATF) consumption. Refineries are adjusting output ratios to prioritize jet fuel, as growing tourism, business travel, and cargo movements push fleet utilization to new highs. The expansion of budget airlines and long-haul operations by Middle Eastern carriers further supports this surge.

In addition to this, geopolitical tensions and increased defense spending have bolstered military aviation fuel demand. Frequent military exercises, surveillance operations, and humanitarian missions have kept defense fleets active across North America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, offering a stable demand base less affected by seasonal or environmental regulations. Simultaneously, the continued boom in e-commerce is driving up air freight operations, with global logistics firms increasing cargo flights and sustaining high fuel draw at refueling hubs.

United Airlines' once-celebrated partnership with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producer World Energy has ended, marking another setback for the airline industry's green ambitions, according to a Reuters report. The closure of World Energy's Paramount refinery in April and stalled plans for a Houston facility highlight broader challenges in scaling SAF production, with only 36 of 165 announced airline SAF projects operational globally.

SAF Adoption Falls Short of Industry Goals

Data from the IndexBox platform shows that SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of global jet fuel demand, far below the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) 2050 net-zero target requiring a 300-fold production increase. While airlines like United and JetBlue had touted early SAF commitments, Reuters found that 23 projects have been abandoned and 27 are delayed indefinitely.

Systemic Challenges Plague Production

World Energy CEO Gene Gebolys accused airlines of ""disingenuous"" press releases overstating SAF commitments, though he acknowledged some carriers made genuine efforts. The Paramount refinery, which produced SAF from used cooking oil and animal fat, ceased operations after partner Air Products withdrew from a $2 billion expansion amid financial challenges. Most operational SAF projects rely on limited-supply feedstocks, with only one using alternative Fischer-Tropsch technology.

Regulatory Pressure Mounts

New EU mandates requiring 2% SAF usage by 2025 could cost airlines $2.9 billion annually, IATA estimates. Meanwhile, U.S. projects face uncertainty as SGP BioEnergy delayed its Panama SAF plant to 2027, citing waning airline interest.

The project aims to produce up to 100 million tonnes of SAF annually using organic feedstocks such as crop residues, wood, and plant waste.

Current SAF production largely relies on used cooking oil, palm oil waste, and low-grade vegetable oils - sources with limited supply due to competition with food.

According to Meika Syahbana Rusli, Director of IPB’s Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Centre (SBRC), Indonesia can supply as much as 500 million tonnes of biomass annually - five times Airbus’ needs. Most of the supply will come from empty palm fruit bunches in Sumatra and Kalimantan, and large volumes of rice straw in Java. However, challenges remain in collection due to weak infrastructure, the absence of a clear legal framework, and limited large-scale processing technology.

Indonesia’s biomass output and consumption, particularly wood pellets and woodchips, are rising. While this trend presents new business opportunities, it also raises concerns over the growing risk of deforestation. Environmental watchdog Auriga Nusantara reports nearly 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared between 2020 and 2024 for biomass production, threatening habitats of endangered species such as the Sumatran and Bornean orangutans.

Taking to X, he wrote that the production is set to “begin soon as per ICAO’s CORSIA standards with an annual capacity of 3 crore litres.”

“With more such facilities coming up in the country, we are well on the path to meet the target of 1 per cent SAF blending in all international flights by 2027 and cut our aviation carbon footprint,” he said in the X post.

He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this “milestone”.

“I believe it is a milestone under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi ji towards India’s commitment to sustainable aviation,” he added.

In 2014, the ethanol blending was just 1.53 per cent. By 2022, India achieved 10 per cent blending, five months ahead of schedule. The original target of 20 per cent blending (E20) by 2030 was advanced to 2025 and has already been achieved in the current Ethanol Supply Year.

Ethanol production has surged dramatically, growing from 38 crore litres in 2014 to 661.1 crore litres by June 2025.

This remarkable growth has helped reduce the country’s dependence on imported crude oil, leading to a significant saving of Rs 1.36 lakh crore in foreign exchange.

E20 blending in petrol was introduced by the Centre to reduce the country’s oil import cost, energy security, lower carbon emissions and better air quality.

India however has no plans to mandate the blending of ethanol with diesel. The issue of blending ethanol with diesel is still at an experimental stage.

Notably, at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to an ambitious five-part “Panchamrit” pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion metric tonnes by 2030.

India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070.

Limonite staining, a mustard-like spot, is also common to see on Lake Superior agates, Mark said.
All of the Lake Superior agates sold at The Rock and Art Shop are found within a 30-mile radius of St.","ST. CLOUD — Mark Christensen remembers working a construction job in 2005 when a friend climbed a roof and came down with his pockets filled with agates.

That moment sparked something in Christensen, who's now a full-fledged ""rockhound"" — an amateur geologist.

His wedding ring is filled with amethyst, a deep purple variant of quartz. He has two other rings, one set with a fire agate and another with an eyeball agate. He wears an an agate-beaded bracelet, and a necklace featuring an agate.

Mark and his wife, Sara Christensen, opened The Rock and Art Shop near downtown St. Cloud in February 2024. It's a true labor of love and a part-time job, too. Sara is a full-time audiologist at the VA Medical Center, and Mark owns Christensen Painting.

""It's much more than a passion than our other jobs that we work,"" Mark said.

While Mark has been collecting rocks and minerals for more than two decades, Sara said her interest developed more recently.

""Since opening the shop, I mean, I've really learned a lot, so I've really fallen in love with it, just learning about all the minerals you can find in our region, locally, as well as all over the world,"" Sara said.

Mark and Sara, along with their two daughters, often walk along the Mississippi River, searching for agates and other treasures, or taking rockhounding trips across the state.

One of the most precious rocks to find locally is Lake Superior agates, the state's official gem. And contrary to its name, Lake Superior agates can be found throughout Central Minnesota.

""This is actually a really good area to find them. You'll find them on gravel roads, corn fields, along the river, all right here,"" Sara said.

The distinctive red, orange and yellow colors of Lake Superior agates come from iron oxidation, according to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Formed by ancient lava eruptions near Lake Superior and carried south by glaciers, they range in size from marbles to larger than baseballs.

Mark's most prized Lake Superior agate is just over a pound, although he's found some as big as 5 pounds, he said.

""It's such an arbitrary number, but anything over that 16-ounce mark, people are willing to pay a lot more for because that's like a benchmark,"" Mark said. ""Whenever you can beat that, it's like what they call a 'once in a lifetime stone.'""

If you're on the lookout for a Lake Superior agate, the Christensens offered some advice.

A Lake Superior agate typically has a waxy finish with translucent banding, a reddish husk and pitting, Sara said. Limonite staining, a mustard-like spot, is also common to see on Lake Superior agates, Mark said.

All of the Lake Superior agates sold at The Rock and Art Shop are found within a 30-mile radius of St. Cloud.

And while Lake Superior agates are highly sought after, there are other prized gems and rocks you can find in Minnesota, including jasper, banded chert, hematite (found near the Brainerd area) and amethyst, Sara said.

The Rock and Art Shop's offerings go well beyond rocks, gems and minerals found in Minnesota.

That's, in part, because the Christensens always carve out time for a rockhounding stop when they travel, Mark said. Their travels have included searching for agates on California beaches, several unsuccessful trips to South Dakota in hopes of finding a Fairburn agate and a trip to Arizona for fire agates.

The store's agate offerings span the globe — from the Yangtze River in China to Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Malawi, Mexico and Morocco. There are also domestic agates from Arizona, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota and Wyoming.

The Rock and Art Shop also sells fossils, minerals, polished gemstones, slabs and more. Some offerings include amethyst, Arizona thunder eggs, celestite, geodes, jasper, Michigan copper, obsidian, petrified wood, turquoise and much, much more.

There's also a UV room to display yooperlites, which are fluorescent rocks that typically have a reddish-orange hue.

""They're all the rage,"" Mark said.

The Rock and Art Shop also offers a lapidary (the art of polishing stones) shop and studio, classes including wire-wrapping and copper plating. Their store has also hosted kid-friendly events such as a fossil dig, Sara said.

""Our goal is to just add more of the education side of things. Offer more classes and events; that seems to be the draw for people,"" Sara said. ""Working with more artists or other people that want to come in and teach their craft, and then I really want to focus on kids' events and teach them about geology things.""

Their efforts have also included educating adults by holding free, walk-in identification days.

""You get a lot more people coming to look for education versus just coming to buy stuff, which is awesome,"" Mark said. ""That's what we're really trying to be, a tool for our community.""

PARAMOUNT, California (Reuters) -In 2019, Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, hailed its new contract with green jet fuel producer World Energy as an example for the aviation industry to follow in its drive to cut emissions.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers' pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy's plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

""Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases"" overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. ""People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.""

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United's fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy ""a few years ago"", without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a ""valued partner"" since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy's struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry's plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

NO CLEAR PATHWAY

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry's claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector's faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialised, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

Of the remaining projects, 23 have been abandoned, 27 are delayed or on indefinite hold, 31 have yet to produce any fuel, and 4 are SAF credit deals, where no physical fuel is delivered.

For the other 44 projects, Reuters was unable to find any public updates since their initial announcements.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That's about 10% of what's needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn't producing enough fuel.

""These guys are the cause of the problem, and they've got to start playing their part,"" said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

""I'd like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,"" Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

PARAMOUNT 'RESET'

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy's partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What's more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry's long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

'EXERCISE IN FUTILITY'

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

""This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,"" said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

NEW TECHNOLOGY

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF.
The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.
“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production.","On the occasion of World Biodiesel Day, MOL Group highlights a recent milestone in its energy transition journey. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been successfully produced for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery during a pilot project to process biocomponent, as well as a significant volume of renewable diesel HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil). This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These underscore the company’s technological readiness and strategic commitment to alternative fuel development in meeting EU climate targets and enhancing regional energy security.

The successful pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was implemented in cooperation with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor of the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit, with the aim of testing the co-processing of 5% POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent – a by-product of palm oil production) with fossil feedstocks. During the pilot, 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) standard for sustainable biofuels.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties. During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14 analysis) was carried out by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF. HVO was produced using oil from cashew nut shells and the biocomponent produced this way was processed together with crude oil. In case of SAF, partially refined cooking oil was processed with the traditional raw material. The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

MOL Group had been using the co-processing method at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for years: the process reduces the emissions of traditional fuels by mixing plant residues, as the bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously directly during production.

Renewable fuels play a key role in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already a key player in both the Hungarian and regional biofuel markets, with hydrotreated vegetable oil produced from waste, i.e., renewable feedstock, being among the most climate-friendly fuel options, and ranks among the pioneers in Europe when it comes to the production of aviation biofuels.

“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production. This readiness underscores our strategic commitment to sustainable mobility—whether in road or air transport. For us, becoming a complex mobility service provider means offering an increasingly diverse range of fuels, thus creating all the necessary conditions for a smart energy transition for our customers. We are already playing a leading role in this process in the region, and we are determined to maintain this position through continued investments and innovation.” – said Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President, Fuels at MOL Group.

MOL Group is continuously researching and developing new possibilities for the production and use of biofuels. In partnership with Budapest Airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Supply Llc., MOL Group launched commercial testing of SAF in 2022 in Hungary. Building on this, the company now sells SAF as part of its regular operations in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, in quantities equivalent to approximately 14 kilotons of biocomponents.

SAF can only be produced from classic renewable feedstocks (such as materials of vegetable origin) or waste, but it should meet the same technical and environmental specifications as conventional kerosene. Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The current and projected global supply of SAF falls significantly short of demand, as reflected in prices. This is why MOL Group’s developments are of strategic importance, both from a climate protection and supply security perspective.",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mol-group.png,N,,2025-08-11 06:56:15.458072

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount’s closure was a “reset” because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule.
Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.
Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.","PARAMOUNT, California - In 2019, Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, hailed its new contract with green jet fuel producer World Energy as an example for the aviation industry to follow in its drive to cut emissions.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers’ pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy’s plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

“Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases” overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. “People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.”

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United’s fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy “a few years ago”, without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a “valued partner” since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy’s struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry’s plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

No clear pathway

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry’s claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector’s faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialized, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That’s about 10% of what’s needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn’t producing enough fuel.

“These guys are the cause of the problem, and they’ve got to start playing their part,” said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

“I’d like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,” Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

Paramount ‘reset’

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy’s partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount’s closure was a “reset” because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What’s more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry’s long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

‘Exercise in futility’

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

“This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,” said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry’s green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It’s already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world’s largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama’s energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

“We’re only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,” he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

“That’s how you build this industry. Without that, it’s an exercise in futility, quite frankly,” he said. “The airlines could do a lot more.”

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia’s Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston’s plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang’s current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

New technology

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

The challenges for Velocys began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys’s English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Now in its ninth year, the increasingly influential list has become an industry bellwether for where airline innovation is heading and what’s worth backing.

This year, the airline group – which includes British Airways and Iberia – is placing its biggest bets on AI and climate tech. The startups are drawn from 11 countries and, for the first time, split into two streams.

New for 2025 is a “Discover” track for early-stage startups, particularly those in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy transition tech. These 15 companies will participate in a six-month mentoring program to prepare them for possible future deployment.

It runs alongside the more commercially focused ""Deploy"" track, which offers 12-week proofs of concept directly with IAG operating companies.

The IAGi Accelerator is the group’s flagship innovation program, fast-tracking collaboration with startups across six focus areas including AI, robotics, sustainability, and next-gen computing.

Speaking exclusively to Skift, Nisha Basson-Mugnier, IAG’s innovation principal, explained the new dual strategy: “We saw the opportunity to engage with early-stage deep-tech startups in a better way.

The CCUS Hub partners include ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India, JSW Steel, Hyundai Steel Company, BHP, Chevron, and Mitsui & Co.

The study will examine opportunities for shared CO2 capture, transport and storage infrastructure, aiming to reduce costs compared to individual projects. Each partner will be involved in at least one hub, comprising centralised capture, transport, and storage facilities.

“With more than 1 billion tonnes of production a year in Asia coming from blast furnace capacity that is relatively early in its production life, it’s important for industry to decarbonise existing steelmaking assets,” said Dr Ben Ellis, Vice President Marketing Sustainability at BHP.

Running until the end of 2026, the study will set out preliminary plans for each hub, including cost estimates, construction timelines, and potential commercialisation pathways.

Steel production accounts for around 7% of global CO2 emissions annually, with demand projected to rise 30% by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum. JSW Group’s targets align with this challenge.

“We aim to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity in steelmaking by 42% by 2030 from a base year of 2005 and achieve net neutral carbon emissions by 2050,” said Prabodha Acharya, Chief Sustainability Officer at JSW Group.

However, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) notes that capture rates remain low at the world’s only commercial-scale CCUS facility for gas-based steel production.

The Al Reyadah plant in the UAE captured less than 20% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2020 and 2021, and 26% in 2022 after its owner EMSTEEL switched to nuclear and solar power for electricity.

EMSTEEL and Masdar are now pursuing alternative decarbonisation pathways, including green hydrogen, following the launch of its DRI-EAF pilot project last year.

“Green hydrogen is an essential element in advancing national and global decarbonisation efforts and we are proud to be at the forefront of that endeavour,” said Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Masdar CEO.

IEEFA warns that a broader industry shift towards DRI technologies could sideline CCUS in steelmaking, as happened in power generation, where projects such as the UK’s £1bn CCS programme and the US Kemper plant were cancelled after policy shifts and cost overruns, leaving few operational facilities.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2022/12/shutterstock_1624978153.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 06:56:50.777670

In the not-so-distant past, Suneet Singal was known as a standout figure in the world of real estate, an industry where ambition towers as high as the buildings he helped finance. Nowadays, he can be found discussing clean energy strategies with entrepreneurs or collaborating with engineers on biomass infrastructure. His pivot from concrete to carbon strategy represents a striking evolution, but for Singal, it’s simply the logical next step in a career driven by value creation. Only now, the value he seeks isn’t just financial, it’s environmental, commercial, and generational.

As nations around the world scramble to meet emissions targets, balance energy security, and maintain economic competitiveness, he has positioned himself as a key advisor and voice of reason in a sector too often caught between idealism and inertia. Singal is not interested in greenwashing or ungrounded optimism. He’s interested in solutions, especially the ones that generate both profit and progress.

Given his real estate background, where asset management, risk, and return are deeply intertwined, Singal brings a fiscally conservative lens to climate innovation. “It’s not a zero-sum game between economic strength and environmental stewardship. With the right strategies and incentives, the two can reinforce each other. We can meet domestic needs and create products that serve global markets. It’s not about abandoning values, it’s about elevating them. Competition, innovation, and independence should be the cornerstones of leadership in this space,” he explains.

That philosophy is taking shape across several verticals. In the Southern U.S., for instance, Singal is involved in projects leveraging the region’s abundant biomass and cutting-edge carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) infrastructure. According to industry reports, the U.S. Gulf Coast is on track to become a CCS leader, with more than 80 million metric tons of annual capacity in development. These hubs don’t just store emissions — they enable large-scale industrial decarbonization and could unlock export-ready carbon solutions in a rapidly evolving energy marketplace.

But Singal’s model of leadership doesn’t stop at state lines. He champions commercial partnerships that allow U.S.-based technologies to meet sustainability needs across international markets. These aren’t philanthropic ventures; they’re built around shared commercial interests. The idea is simple: if advanced biofuels or clean hydrogen can be produced at scale using American expertise, they can serve global demand while driving value at home.

He’s particularly focused on market pathways that allow companies to deploy U.S. feedstocks and processing technology through strategically located facilities, whether domestically or abroad. These kinds of efforts reduce supply chain volatility and allow private firms to meet growing international sustainability standards on competitive terms.

Clean hydrogen, for instance, is rapidly gaining momentum in the energy sector. In the U.S., initiatives like the Hydrogen Shot aim to dramatically reduce production costs and expand availability. Singal sees a direct role for private innovators in scaling these technologies — not just in producing them, but in aligning infrastructure, investment, and supply chain capacity for long-term impact.

Singal’s role in these ecosystems is not that of a public official or lobbyist, but of a translator, someone who can bridge policy, capital, and industrial know-how. He speaks the language of markets as fluently as that of environmental science. His background allows him to see beyond short-term incentives and understand how lasting infrastructure must be structured to drive results and attract capital.

That’s why he’s cautious about overly relying on subsidies or temporary tax relief. “If your business model only works because of handouts, it’s not a business, it’s a liability,” he says. “We need to build systems that are cost-competitive and resilient to external factors. That’s what buyers want, and it’s what responsible entrepreneurship demands.”

True to his private-sector roots, Singal is a staunch advocate for U.S.-based production. But he also believes American products must be globally relevant. “Serving international markets from a domestic base isn’t just smart, it’s strategic. When we export real solutions, we shape global trends, create jobs, and keep capital circulating inside our economy.”

This pragmatic approach is resonating with business leaders across multiple sectors, especially those looking to align growth with sustainability without losing sight of cost discipline. Singal often consults with executives exploring how to make sustainability work for their bottom lines. His message is consistent: decarbonization doesn’t have to mean deindustrialization. With smart policy frameworks and entrepreneurial leadership, the U.S. can lead the next generation of energy and infrastructure technologies.

This thinking is particularly relevant in the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector, a space Singal is deeply involved in. As airlines face increasing pressure to reduce emissions, the challenge lies in building a cost-effective, scalable supply of sustainable fuel. Singal’s work is focused on unlocking that potential by leveraging U.S. feedstocks such as agricultural residues and woody biomass, and refining them either domestically or through select global processing hubs. The result is a more reliable, politically stable supply chain that meets international standards without compromising competitiveness.

At the core of Singal’s philosophy is a belief in alignment between market opportunity and sustainability, between growth and responsibility. He rejects the notion that environmentally conscious business must come at the expense of fiscal discipline or national strength. He is also attentive to how critical energy assets are structured, with a preference for domestic control and transparent investment models.

“We should be exporting our capabilities and leadership, not our control. Climate progress isn’t about compliance, it’s about direction. If we want to shape the future, we need to lead it on our terms,” he says.

Singal’s influence continues to grow as businesses seek practical roadmaps for navigating the green transition. His ability to bring clarity to complex systems and connect industrial ambition with environmental responsibility makes him a valuable advisor to executives and stakeholders looking for more than slogans. His model is based on mutual value: the private sector drives innovation, markets reward impact, and industries transition without losing their edge.

There’s something deeply American about Singal’s story. His career trajectory perfectly encompasses both the American Dream and a thirst for making the world a better place. His work doesn’t make headlines every day, but it’s shaping how governments and businesses alike think about the green transition, not as a burden, but as an opportunity for U.S. strength and global cooperation.

“The next decade will determine who leads the global economy, and it won’t just be about output, but about purpose. America has the tools: capital, technology, and talent. If we lead with intention, the results will follow. This is a moment not just for innovation, but for leadership that lasts.” He concluded.",https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1592-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 06:57:07.797860

Despite modest profitability gains in 2025—projected net profits of $36.6 billion and a 3.6% margin—the sector remains trapped in a cycle of thin margins, volatile costs, and systemic fragility. This is not a temporary setback but a structural collapse driven by three interlocking forces: profitability erosion, labor instability, and infrastructure fragility. For investors, the implications are clear: the era of aviation as a reliable growth engine is over. The time to reallocate capital to resilient alternatives—rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms—is now.

The Structural Decline of Aviation

The aviation sector's struggles are rooted in its inability to adapt to a post-pandemic world. While passenger numbers are surging (5.2 billion in 2025), the cost of serving these customers is rising faster. Labor costs alone are projected to grow by 7.6% in 2025, driven by a 4% increase in the global workforce to 3.3 million employees. Airlines are paying premiums to attract and retain pilots, mechanics, and cabin crew, with wages rising 10–15% annually in key markets. Meanwhile, fuel costs—though down 4.8% due to lower oil prices—still account for 26.4% of operating expenses, and compliance with carbon offset programs (CORSIA) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates will add $4.8 billion to industry costs in 2025.

Infrastructure bottlenecks compound these issues. Airports are struggling to modernize aging systems, while supply chain disruptions for aircraft parts have pushed lead times to over a year. Airbus's A350 production is capped at six units per month, and the industry's reliance on rare earth elements for electrification efforts creates new vulnerabilities. Geopolitical risks—ranging from U.S. trade policy shifts to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East—add further uncertainty.

The Workforce Crisis: A Talent Drain and Retention Quagmire

The aviation workforce is in turmoil. The IATA Global Skills Survey highlights a critical shortage of pilots and technicians, with training bottlenecks delaying hiring by 18–24 months. Airlines are caught in a vicious cycle: higher wages to attract talent erode margins, while automation and AI adoption risk displing workers. For example, AI-driven cockpit assistance and single-pilot operations are already under scrutiny by pilot unions, who fear safety compromises. Meanwhile, the rise of space tourism and defense aerospace is siphoning talent away from traditional aviation, exacerbating the ""brain drain.""

Labor costs are no longer a line item but a strategic liability. Low-cost carriers, which once thrived on razor-thin margins, are now grappling with a 20% projected shortfall in maintenance technicians by 2028. Full-service airlines are not immune; their focus on premium services and crew welfare has led to a 6.7% rise in labor costs, outpacing revenue growth. The result? A sector where even modest profitability gains are offset by rising operational fragility.

Infrastructure Fragility: A System on the Brink

The aviation industry's infrastructure is a patchwork of outdated systems and unmet modernization needs. Air traffic control (ATC) systems in the U.S., India, and parts of Africa remain decades behind global standards, contributing to delays and safety risks. The 2024 FAA Reauthorization allocated $105.5 billion to modernize ATC, but progress is glacial. Meanwhile, the integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and AI-driven logistics is stymied by regulatory inertia and incompatible legacy systems.

Environmental regulations add another layer of complexity. The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation mandate—requiring a 70% SAF blend by 2050—has pushed airlines into uncharted financial territory. SAF costs are 2–3 times higher than conventional jet fuel, and production capacity remains insufficient. Airlines are caught between regulatory compliance and shareholder expectations, with many forced to pass costs to consumers through higher ticket prices.

The Case for Sector Rotation: Resilient Alternatives

As aviation's structural weaknesses crystallize, investors must pivot to sectors poised to benefit from the post-aviation travel shift. Three areas stand out: rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms.

1. Rail: The Digital Renaissance of Connectivity

The global digital railway market is projected to grow from $83.74 billion in 2024 to $230.60 billion by 2034, driven by AI, IoT, and 5G integration. Governments in Asia Pacific—led by India, China, and South Korea—are investing heavily in smart infrastructure, with digital rail systems enhancing freight logistics and passenger mobility. For example, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) reported a 100-basis-point improvement in its operating ratio to 59.0% in Q2 2025, driven by higher freight volumes and core pricing gains. Its free cash flow of $1.105 billion year-to-date underscores the sector's resilience.

2. Regional Logistics: The Urbanization-Driven Boom

Urbanization and e-commerce are fueling demand for regional logistics networks. In Asia Pacific, where 60% of the global population growth is concentrated, companies are leveraging AI and IoT to optimize last-mile delivery. The region's logistics sector is expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2030, outpacing global averages. Investors should target firms with exposure to smart warehousing, drone delivery, and cross-border e-commerce platforms.

3. Digital Travel Platforms: The Integrated Future of Mobility

Digital travel platforms are emerging as undervalued beneficiaries of the aviation sector's decline. As airlines face fare volatility and operational inefficiencies, travelers are increasingly relying on integrated platforms that combine rail, regional air, and digital services. These platforms, which leverage AI for route optimization and real-time booking, are projected to capture 30% of the global travel market by 2030.

Conclusion: A Strategic Reallocation Imperative

The aviation industry's perfect storm—structural decline, labor instability, and infrastructure fragility—demands immediate portfolio reallocation. Investors who cling to airlines risk being caught in a sector where even modest gains are offset by systemic risks. By contrast, rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms offer a path to resilience, growth, and long-term value creation.

As disruptions challenge global supply chains, air freight emerges as a critical enabler of continuity and efficiency.

This article outlines six major forces behind the expansion of international air freight, each contributing to its rising demand and shaping the future of global logistics.

1. E-commerce Expansion Is Boosting Air Freight Demand

Online shopping continues to grow at double-digit rates worldwide, changing how consumers order and how businesses deliver. With mobile commerce rising and platforms becoming more global, buyers now expect orders within days—even when shipped internationally. This shift has pushed businesses to make air freight central to their fulfillment approach.

For instance, Amazon Air has reshaped India's e-commerce delivery by operating the only dedicated air cargo fleet in the country, currently using two aircraft to transport tens of thousands of packages daily. Since its 2023 launch connecting four major cities, it has expanded to serve 12 cities via air and multimodal air-rail networks, covering over 100 origin-destination pairs. Amazon Air significantly boosts next-day delivery with over 99% on-time performance, overcoming India’s logistical challenges through precise overnight operations, enhancing delivery speed, reliability, and scale ahead of events like Prime Day.

Similarly, in March 2025, CEVA Logistics launched a direct air charter between Wuxi and Chicago to meet growing e-commerce demand, increasing trans-Pacific capacity and shortening delivery times for online retailers. Retailers, DTC brands, and global marketplaces are using air cargo to meet fast delivery expectations and provide consistent service. Fulfillment centers are being located near major airports to support this.

Key Drivers:

Retailers are also offering premium delivery options that rely heavily on air transport, as more customers are willing to pay for guaranteed speed. As e-commerce reaches deeper into emerging markets, air freight will continue to play a vital role in expanding reach and meeting service standards.

2. Global Trade Growth Is Lifting International Air Cargo

Cross-border trade continues to fuel economic activity, and its recovery is driving up air freight volumes. As companies expand their sourcing and sales internationally, they’re leaning more on fast, dependable shipping solutions.

In June 2025, global air cargo demand grew modestly by 0.8% year-on-year, driven by a 9.0% surge in Asia-Pacific amid trade tensions and military conflicts impacting other regions. Capacity rose 1.7%, but load factor declined to 45.5%. North America and the Middle East saw notable demand drops (-8.3% and -3.2%, respectively), while Europe had minimal growth (0.8%). Key trade lanes like Europe-Asia (+10.6%) expanded, contrasting with declines on Asia-North America (-4.8%). Lower jet fuel prices and global manufacturing recovery underpin mixed regional performance.

Air freight remains especially important in sectors where delays aren’t an option. Pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and precision equipment all require fast, secure, and compliant delivery.

Key Drivers:

Increased global trade activity

Multi-region supply chain expansion

Fast delivery needs in regulated or high-value industries

Use of air cargo for urgent or just-in-time shipments

Multinational manufacturers are using air freight to avoid production delays caused by late components. In complex supply chains, quick shipping ensures smooth operations—especially during peak seasons or amid policy changes.

3. Fleet Expansion and Route Optimization Support Growth

Modernization of cargo fleets is helping the air freight sector keep pace with demand. Airlines are adding wide-body freighters and upgrading aircraft for better efficiency and cargo space. These investments give operators more flexibility along busy routes.

For instance, between March 2024 and March 2025, Amazon Air expanded its U.S. fleet’s cargo capabilities, with a 14% increase in weight capacity and a 12.9% rise in volume. The fleet now includes ten Airbus A330-300 freighters, seven of which joined within the last year. These widebody jets surpass the Boeing 767-300s—Amazon’s second-largest aircraft—in carrying capacity, offering 17% more in tonnage and 6% more in volume. Widebody aircraft now account for more than 75% of Amazon’s domestic available ton-miles, a sharp rise from figures reported three years earlier.

Passenger airlines are also using cargo space on long-haul flights, allowing for extra volume without deploying dedicated freighters. This approach has been key during peak demand or lower passenger traffic.

Key Drivers:

Larger freighter fleets on major trade lanes

Increased use of cargo holds in passenger aircraft

Upgraded airport cargo terminals and logistics hubs

Smarter routing and AI-based network planning

Airport investments are improving infrastructure, from cold storage and automation to customs pre-clearance. In May 2025, AISATS opened a new logistics park at Bengaluru Airport featuring cold chain capabilities, automated handling, and integrated customs systems. These updates reduce delays and boost capacity, making air freight more dependable.

4. Technology Is Reshaping Air Freight Operations

Digital tools are improving every stage of the air freight process. Carriers and logistics firms are adopting automation, predictive models, and real-time tracking to give customers better visibility and control.

Today’s shippers expect to monitor shipments end-to-end, receive live updates on delays, and track environmental conditions like temperature or vibration. This is especially crucial in sectors like biotech, electronics, and aerospace.

In June 2025, Etihad Cargo rolled out SmartTrack, a sensor-based tracking platform offering real-time shipment data, condition monitoring, and improved oversight. Similarly, cargo.one introduced AI-powered automation and unified workflows to streamline air freight quoting for forwarders in July 2025. It automates shipment data extraction, rate collection, and consolidates all rates—including ad hoc and manual airline rates—into a single platform. A central queue enhances team collaboration, syncing quotes with TMS for faster processing and higher conversion. These innovations boost efficiency by eliminating manual tasks, allowing focus on customer relationships and strategic activities.

Key Drivers:

Use of IoT, GPS, and smart containers

Airbus Australia’s chief representative, Stephen Forshaw, said a mandate of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent on the use of sustainable fuels by aircraft would kickstart a local biofuels industry, cut emissions and reduce the country’s heavy reliance on imported fuel.

Over the past decade, Australia has doubled its dependence on imported jet fuel to more than 7 billion litres, more than one quarter of which comes from Chinese refineries. China, Malaysia and Singapore account for 70 per cent of imports of the fuel, Department of Climate Change and Energy data show.

Low-carbon fuels are derived from renewable or sustainable sources such as feedstocks and waste products and can be “dropped in” as a direct replacement for fossil fuels without major capital outlays or equipment upgrades.

Australia exports a huge proportion of the products required to make clean fuels – such as sugarcane, canola and tallow – but is a global laggard in their development and has no existing operational projects. Singapore, by contrast, has the capacity to produce more than 1 billion litres of biofuel.

Forshaw said the introduction of a 1-2 per cent mandate would provide the signal needed for investors to commit to new local sustainable aviation fuel projects and help safeguard Australia’s long-term fuel supply. The 2 per cent figure is higher than that previously suggested by industry.

“If we don’t move quickly to seize this opportunity, we run a real risk that the future will be made in Singapore, not Australia,” he said. “We want to use our feedstock here to produce fuels here, power our industry here and capture the economic and security benefits here.

“We can’t afford to default to what we’ve been historically pretty good at in Australia – exporting our raw commodities for others to process. Doing this, we simply export the opportunity to others.”

Defence experts sounded the alarm about Australia’s fuel supply levels as recently as June, when US bombing of Iran prompted fears the Middle Eastern nation would close access to a key trading route – and access to critical supplies of oil.

Under protocols laid down by the International Energy Agency, nations should hold at least 90 days of oil stocks in reserve. These “IEA days” include fuel on ships bound for Australia as well as that stored domestically.

According to the most recent government data, in May Australia had 48 days of imported oil coverage and only 17 days worth of jet fuel supplies.

Forshaw will tell a major industry conference on Tuesday that Australia can no longer depend on a “benign” trade environment for its future fuel imports.

“Cross-border supply chains grew during times when the benefits of globalisation were understood. Their resilience is being increasingly challenged by growing nationalism, protectionist trade policies and security challenges,” he said.

“Fuel underpins energy and transport, and powers our wider economies – literally.”

In July, government green bank the Clean Energy Finance Corporation said fuel security risks could become “particularly pertinent” for Australia’s defence forces, which will be reliant on liquid fuels for many decades.

The corporation also said Australia’s failure to develop a biofuel industry would put its net-zero targets out of reach in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and long-haul trucking.

The Albanese government is set to reveal a new 2035 target for reducing carbon emissions in coming weeks. The Climate Change Authority, which is advising on the target, has previously sought feedback on a goal in the range of 65 to 75 per cent on 2005 levels.

A target in such a range would require a significant uplift from the existing 2030 target of a 43 per cent – including from the aviation and heavy transport sectors.

A government spokesman said Labor had invested $250 million in the low-carbon liquid fuel industry through its Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

Airbus is an investor in a SAF project near Townsville called Jet Zero. Forshaw said well-designed production tax credits would help narrow the gap between the price of SAF and that of traditional jet fuel – which is a key barrier to the industry’s development.

“We can’t ask governments to support endlessly, and we have to be realistic that funds are scarce, so measures need to be well-targeted and designed to encourage the private sector to invest,” he said.",https://acapmag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1372488167-4.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 22:56:44.140053

Hingga Juli 2025, penjualan sudah menjangkau 143 SPBU dengan total volume 4.700 kiloliter.

Corporate Secretary Pertamina Patra Niaga, Heppy Wulansari, mengatakan target distribusi tahun ini adalah 150 SPBU.

“Untuk lingkungan yang lebih sehat, kami terus mengupayakan penyebaran outlet di seluruh Jawa dan mendorong tercapainya 150 SPBU sampai akhir tahun,” ujarnya dalam acara Energi & Mining Editor Society (E2S) Retret 2025 di Bogor, Sabtu (9/8/2025), bertema bertema “Collaboration to Advance The ESDM Sector”.

DOK. E2S Pertamina memperluas distribusi Pertamax Green 95 untuk mendorong energi bersih di seluruh Indonesia. Hal ini disampaikan Corporate Secretary Pertamina Patra Niaga, Heppy Wulansari pada acara Energi & Mining Editor Society (E2S) Retret 2025 di Bogor, Sabtu (9/8/2025).

Menurut Heppy, fokus distribusi saat ini masih di wilayah Jawa karena pasokan bioetanol mudah diperoleh dari pabrik pengolahan di Mojokerto.

“Kalau di luar Jawa, akan bisa kita kembangkan,” kata dia.

Pengembangan energi ramah lingkungan juga menyasar sektor penerbangan. Pertamina Patra Niaga menyiapkan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berbahan baku minyak goreng bekas atau used cooking oil (UCO).

“Ke depan, Pertamina mendorong terbentuknya ekosistem nasional untuk pengumpulan UCO sebagai bahan baku SAF. Dengan langkah tersebut, Indonesia diharapkan mampu menjadi pusat produksi SAF untuk kawasan ASEAN,” jelas Heppy.

Selain itu, Pertamina Patra Niaga mengembangkan konsep Green Energy Station (GES) sebagai solusi terpadu energi ramah lingkungan sekaligus pengembangan bisnis non-bahan bakar.

Konsep ini mencakup pemanfaatan energi mandiri ramah lingkungan dengan atap PLTS, layanan ekosistem kendaraan listrik melalui SPKLU dan SPBKLU, digitalisasi layanan SPBU lewat aplikasi MyPertamina, hingga fasilitas non-fuel retail seperti Bright Store, kafe, dan Auto Care.

“Saat ini sudah ada 442 GES, 14 SPKLU, dan 43 SPBKLU,” kata Heppy.
