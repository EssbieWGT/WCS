2025-03-05 06:11:59+00:00,U.S. Department of State,US objects to SAF recommendation at ICAO meeting | Ethanol Producer Magazine,"The United States strongly objects to a recommendation on ""sustainable"" aviation fuels made during the 13th triennial meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP). This recommendation to the ICAO Council on multi-cropping, the practice of growing two or more crops on the same land, for sustainable aviation fuels, would unfairly penalize U.S. farmers and significantly benefit Brazil over the rest of the world.The U.S. government believes this proposal is premature and lacks sufficient technical or scientific justification. Despite these issues, CAEP adopted the recommendation, harming U.S. farmers and the aviation industry, while increasing incentives for deforestation of threatened tropical forests.",US Policy,US,1,1,Press Release,,https://ethanolproducer.com/articles/us-objects-to-saf-recommendation-at-icao-meeting,00:02.5
