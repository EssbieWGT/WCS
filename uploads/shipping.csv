This initiative, primarily advocated by European nations and Brazil, aims to generate up to $15 billion annually to combat climate change, as the IMO estimates that maritime activity contributes to 3% of climate change. However, the proposal has faced strong opposition from U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.

Trump has threatened retaliatory measures against countries supporting the tax and plans to withhold U.S. funding to the U.N. if the tax is enacted. He labeled the proposal as a “global green new scam tax,” arguing that it would significantly increase costs for American consumers without receiving approval from their elected representatives—echoing the historical grievance of “taxation without representation.” The editorial suggests that the proposed tax could hinder global commerce and burden American consumers with higher prices.

While the U.N. has paused the proposal for now, the editorial warns that it will be reconsidered next year.

His legislation would also prohibit voluntary U.S. contributions to the U.N. if a carbon tax is imposed.

Pfluger argues that his proposed bill would effectively neutralize the global carbon tax by cutting off U.S. funding to any U.N. agency that seeks to impose taxes on American citizens or businesses. The editorial concludes by urging Congress to pass his legislation following the end of the government shutdown, framing it as a necessary measure to protect Americans from overreach by U.N. bureaucrats.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-01 20:56:56.471365

That rises by about 45% to roughly $315 per tonne from Jan. 1, 2026, reflecting the shift to full compliance.

Using an assumed EUA price of €85.02, compliance costs per tonne of fuel burned increase to about $315 for high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO), $319 for VLSFO and $324 for low-sulphur marine gasoil ((LS)MGO), compared with roughly $217–$224 previously.

Average VLSFO prices in the EMEA region stood at about $464.50 per tonne at the end of 2025. Under the regulation, ships above 5,000 gross tonnes calling at EU ports are required to pay for emissions on a per-voyage basis. Actual compliance costs can vary depending on voyage patterns, including cases where only one EU port is involved.

Emissions generated during a calendar year are covered by the purchase and surrender of EU allowances (EUAs), with surrender due by September of the following year. As a result, emissions produced in 2025 are settled in September 2026 at the 70% compliance rate, while emissions generated in 2026 will be settled in September 2027 at the full 100% rate.

The expansion also brings updated emission factors used to calculate the number of EUAs required per tonne of fuel burned. From 2026 onwards, factors rise to 3.163 for HSFO, 3.200 for VLSFO and 3.255 for (LS)MGO, compared with lower levels used in 2024 and 2025.

The extended timeframe signals a clear shift from norm-setting to delivery. It reflects the IMO’s determination to ensure that the global rules it develops are not only agreed at international level, but are implemented, enforced and embedded into the daily operations of the maritime sector. The theme will culminate in World Maritime Day celebrations on the final Thursday of September each year.

At its core, the theme places emphasis on implementation. “From Policy to Practice” speaks directly to the long-standing challenge of translating international maritime conventions into effective national legislation, operational compliance and enforcement. While IMO instruments form one of the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks in global governance, their impact depends on how consistently they are applied by Member States.

The phrase “Powering” reflects the practical mechanisms behind this transition. Through technical assistance, capacity-building, training and technical cooperation, the IMO and its partners support countries in strengthening maritime administrations, port State control systems and regulatory oversight. This targeted support is designed to convert legal commitments into measurable results.

“Maritime Excellence” defines the end goal. It points to a shipping industry that is safe, secure, efficient and environmentally responsible, operating in line with the highest international standards. Excellence, in this context, is not static. It requires continuous improvement, innovation and accountability across the entire maritime value chain.

For more than 70 years, the IMO has overseen the development of international conventions, codes, guidelines and recommendations that govern global shipping. However, assessments under the IMO Member State Audit Scheme have consistently highlighted gaps in national legislation, implementation and enforcement. These findings underline the importance of moving beyond ratification towards sustained regulatory effectiveness.

By placing global attention on implementation over a two-year period, the 2026–2027 theme aims to accelerate national action and strengthen compliance with IMO instruments. It reinforces the idea that international maritime governance only delivers value when policies are applied consistently, monitored rigorously and supported by capable institutions.

The theme also aligns closely with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supporting goals on resilient infrastructure, climate action, protection of marine ecosystems and international partnerships. It underscores the central role of maritime governance in achieving sustainable development outcomes in an interconnected global economy.

For Africa, where many coastal and island states continue to balance expanding maritime opportunities with capacity constraints, the theme is particularly timely. As African ports, shipping services and blue economy ambitions grow, effective implementation of maritime standards will be critical. The continent’s maritime future will depend not only on adopting global rules, but on building the institutions, skills and partnerships needed to make them work in practice.

LNG — The Tailored Transitional Look

If marine fuels had a little black dress, LNG would be it. Globally recognizable, easy to style, and adaptable to many settings, LNG remains the go to for shipowners wanting to stay on trend. But 2026 is shaping up as a renewed season for this transitional classic, supported by real infrastructure and fleet deployment data.

A major design pivot is underway: global LNG supply continues to expand through projects in Qatar, the U.S. and Australia, keeping the fuel widely available at bunkering hubs worldwide. The existing fleet of dual‑fuel LNG ships is large and growing, and classification society analyses confirm that LNG will still dominate transitional fuel orders in 2026 because it reduces key emissions compared with traditional bunker fuels.

The runway isn’t without critique as LNG’s methane emissions profile complicates its long‑term carbon story, but ports from Rotterdam to Singapore to China’s Yangtze Delta have serious LNG deliveries baked into their 2026 bunkering plans, keeping the look practical and present. Design houses are pairing LNG with bio‑LNG where they can, giving it a sustainable accessory vibe without overstatement.

Methanol — Clean Minimalist with Momentum

Methanol sails into 2026 as the minimalist staple of sustainable marine propulsion. It’s technically mature, relatively low-risk, and getting styled into fleets that need a drop-in fuel with scalable availability. For operators, the appeal is straightforward: no radical redesigns, just clean-burning flexibility. DNV places methanol near the top of its alternative fuel readiness index, and ABS, BV, and Lloyd’s Register all offer class notations and safety guidelines for methanol-fueled ships.

Infrastructure continues to thread globally. Singapore and Rotterdam anchor the look, while Hamburg and Busan build out refueling couture. The China Classification Society (CCS) named methanol one of four core sustainable fuels in its 2025 Sustainable Fuel Development Report. Meanwhile, producers like Proman and Methanex are expanding global supply with terminals in Canada, Trinidad, the U.S. Gulf, and Oman and new demand points emerging in Duqm, Santos, and along Australia’s southeast coast.

Methanol isn’t a runway novelty anymore. It’s being cut into deep-sea container service, shortsea feeders, bulkers, and product tankers. Regulatory clarity, rising port access, and a maturing fuel value chain make it one of the most ready-to-wear looks in the 2026 decarbonization lineup.

Wind Propulsion: Vintage Comeback, Modern Twist

Call it the Greta effect, or just the return of a classic but in 2026, wind is billowing back into the marine propulsion wardrobe. Once dismissed as too retro, sails and their high-tech cousins are now walking tall on the carbon-neutral runway. From rotor sails to suction wings to sky-kites, the silhouette is streamlined and the impact is aerodynamic. You can thank high fuel prices, tight CII grades, and IMO deadlines for turning this breeze into a business model.

Wind propulsion is also backed by global policy discussion. The International Windship Association (IWSA) is working with IMO groups to ensure wind’s contribution can be recognized in emissions frameworks showing that wind’s not just a pet project but part of mainstream decarbonization policy.

In 2026, wind tech will be part of real operational wardrobes, layered with other propulsion looks. It helps cut fuel costs and emissions, brings practical benefits where geography and weather cooperate, and carries institutional support that makes it more than just a runway filler.

🤔 What’s Warm: Ready-To-Wear and Boutique

Biofuels — The World Tour Remix (2026 Edition)

Forget fringe couture. In 2026, biofuel blends will be a global staple that operators don’t just talk about but actually don at major hubs. Singapore’s bunker market has already shown that marine bio‑bunker volumes are real and scaling. In 2024, Singapore sold about 880,000 metric tons of biofuel blends, significantly more than the previous year and a clear signal that blends are market‑ready rather than future fantasy. This milestone suggests that in 2026, biofuel blends will stay in heavy rotation at key ports where regulations and supply coincide.

While overall global volumes remain a fraction of total bunkers, biofuel blends have been delivered on all continents, according to white‑paper assessments of actual bunkering activity. That means ships calling at multiple continents are likely to see blended fuels available along their trade routes next year in hubs attuned to decarbonization policies.

At the same time, some markets such as Asia Pacific may see slower than meteoric adoption in 2026 because demand indicators have softened recently, but the trend is steady, not fading. Observers in Singapore report a slowdown in year‑on‑year blend uptake in late 2025, pointing to steady but not explosive volume demand in 2026 compared with 2024/2025 peaks.

Ammonia Steps Onto the 2026 Runway

Ammonia enters 2026 like a bold couture piece that’s almost ready to wear. According to the IMO’s Readiness of Low and Zero‑Carbon Marine Fuels and Technology white paper, ammonia is one of the few zero‑carbon fuels with technical potential to power large ships at deep‑sea scale. The IMO study paints a picture of ammonia transitioning from theoretically interesting to selective real‑world deployment as regulated design frameworks, bunkering discussions, and safety protocols come into sharper focus ahead of wider adoption.

What makes ammonia’s silhouette striking for 2026 is that international maritime rules are evolving to permit its use as a fuel. Interim guidelines and amendments agreed by the IMO’s Maritime Safety Committee will allow ammonia cargo ships to use part of their cargo as fuel, with changes to codes entering force in 2026, enabling owners to purpose‑build or retrofit vessels with ammonia propulsion systems under a recognized global framework.

Fleet‑fashion watchers should expect the first ammonia‑ready and ammonia‑fueled shipments to enter service in 2026 and 2027. While the total number remains small relative to mainstream fuels, ammonia carriers and large bulkers designed for ammonia combustion are on order and under development, with engines and bunkering strategies maturing as part of the global alternative fuel runway.

Hydrogen’s Haute Promise Still Needs Tailoring

Hydrogen is the future couture concept that many designers admire but few are ready to wear off the rack in 2026. Classification societies and technical roadmaps identify hydrogen as a low‑carbon fuel option that could help shipping hit ambitious greenhouse gas targets, particularly if paired with fuel cells or hybrid electric systems. But the infrastructure to produce, store and distribute hydrogen worldwide is not yet ready for mainstream ocean service.

Fuel cells and hydrogen engines are technically valid and under research, but hydrogen’s wide‑scale adoption requires a global bunkering network and ports with safe supply practices, which are unlikely to be in place in 2026. Work with IMO and class societies continues, but for now hydrogen remains a showpiece component for demonstration projects or very specific short‑sea applications rather than full global deployment.

Electric’s Having a Moment (Inland)

Electric propulsion, in both battery and hybrid styles, is becoming a star in the capsule collection for 2026. While long‑haul deep sea electrification isn’t yet practical, electric systems are in active use across short‑sea and inland markets, ferries and hybrid coastal craft, with over 1,000 battery‑equipped vessels already registered globally and more on order.

Classification societies and international standards recognize electric propulsion as ready for broad application in its niche segments, and IMO policy discussions increasingly consider shore power and hybrid systems as part of decarbonization pathways. Battery hybrids are not just chic accessories but functionally transformative in regions where charging infrastructure is available. By 2026 we’ll see electric fashion walk the route on ferries, coastal RoPax, and ferries tied to port grids in Europe and Asia.

The big reveal came in 2025 when Incat Tasmania rolled out the world’s largest fully-electric vessel, a 130-meter catamaran designed for high-speed regional service, showcasing what a forty-megawatt-hour battery and a clean hull can actually do when dressed for success.

However, expert Eirik Ovrum from DNV, a Norwegian industrial risk management provider, highlights challenges in advancing fuel supply chains and technology development. Although the testing of innovative technologies is yielding positive outcomes, the speed of progress remains inadequate to achieve broader sustainability goals.

A key area of focus is the adoption of biofuels, such as biodiesel and bio-liquefied natural gas (LNG), which offer substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels. While the demand for these low-GHG fuels is ramping up globally, the supply remains constrained. Ovrum underscores the importance of ramping up production to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) emissions reduction targets for 2030, 2040, and the aspirational goal of net-zero by 2050. He notes that certain types of biodiesel and bio-LNG can achieve anywhere from a 50% reduction to near-zero emissions, allowing shipowners to avoid carbon dioxide (CO2) pricing imposed by the IMO. However, uncertainties regarding production costs and the potential market for biowaste in other sectors complicate forecasts for the future of these fuels.

Onboard carbon capture systems (CCS) are another promising technology that is still in testing phases. Ovrum points out that one of the main challenges with CCS is minimizing the additional energy required to capture CO2 and ensuring the purity of the captured gas, as impurities present significant challenges in the CCS value chain.

Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) also hold potential for enhancing energy efficiency without relying on low-GHG fuels or CCS. While DNV is in the process of verifying energy savings for vessels equipped with WAPS, the effectiveness of the technology can vary widely from ship to ship, necessitating further development for practical implementation.

Despite these challenges, Ovrum expresses optimism, noting ongoing innovations in testing and regulatory proposals to improve access to biodiesel and bio-LNG. Enhanced models like book-and-claim chains could streamline the acquisition of these fuels. Additionally, several pilot projects for CCS are being tested on operational ships, demonstrating promising advancements. For example, Solvang’s Clipper Eris has been testing an onboard CCS for over six months, and systems have been operational on the container vessel Ever Top since 2024.

Ovrum emphasizes the technical progress and large-scale testing that could validate CO2 reduction technologies. DNV is actively engaged in developing the CCS supply chain, collaborating on over ten joint industry projects aimed at addressing key challenges in capture, transportation, and storage of CO2.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-31 20:56:50.847504

Containing no carbon, ammonia eliminates CO₂ emissions during combustion when properly managed.
According to the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario, ammonia could fuel 45% of shipping energy demand by mid-century.
Additionally, air lubrication systems inject micro-bubbles beneath hulls, creating friction-reducing layers that decrease fuel consumption by 5-15%.
Data as collective intelligence We believe maritime decarbonization represents fundamentally a data challenge as much as a technology challenge.","The maritime industry now faces a pressing challenge: decarbonization. According to the International Maritime Organization’s 2024 Fourth Greenhouse Gas Study, the global merchant fleet accounts for approximately 3% of worldwide CO₂ emissions—roughly 1 billion tons annually. In response, the IMO’s revised strategy mandates achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050, with intermediate targets requiring at least 40% reduction by 2030.

These realities therefore demand a shift from incremental efficiency improvements to transformative action based on alternative fuels, operational optimization, and data-driven decision-making.

Carbon neutrality in shipping rarely emerges from voluntary action alone. Rather, it results from converging pressures—regulatory, financial, and reputational. The IMO’s 2023 revised strategy represents the most ambitious decarbonization timeline in maritime history, requiring at least 20% GHG reduction by 2030 and 70% by 2040 compared to 2008 baselines.

Market-driven forces amplify regulatory mandates. For instance, the Poseidon Principles, adopted by financial institutions representing $185 billion in shipping portfolios, now require climate alignment assessments for financing. Moreover, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria increasingly determine access to capital, with investors scrutinizing emissions performance alongside traditional financial metrics. Meanwhile, the Sea Cargo Charter commits cargo owners to transparent emissions reporting, thereby creating competitive pressure on carriers to demonstrate verifiable reductions.

Regional regulations add immediate compliance urgency.

The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) extended to maritime transport in 2024, requiring shipping companies to surrender allowances for CO₂ emissions from EU port voyages. Similarly, the Fuel EU Maritime regulation establishes progressively stringent greenhouse gas intensity limits, declining to 80% reduction by 2050. When combined with Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) ratings—which directly influence valuations and insurance premiums—these frameworks collectively create powerful economic incentives for decarbonization.

A compelling example is Maersk Line’s commitment to net-zero by 2040—ten years ahead of IMO goals. Achieving this required ordering methanol-capable vessels at 30% premium costs and establishing renewable methanol offtake agreements. Consequently, the company’s strategy illustrates how ambitious corporate targets can accelerate infrastructure development and technology adoption beyond regulatory minimums, demonstrating leadership in maritime decarbonization.

Achieving carbon neutrality requires moving beyond fossil fuels. Yet, no single alternative currently offers the energy density, handling characteristics, global availability, and cost competitiveness of heavy fuel oil. Therefore, the maritime industry faces a portfolio of potential solutions, each with distinct advantages and limitations across ship types and trade routes.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) represents the most mature option, with approximately 300 LNG-fueled ships operating globally. LNG reduces CO₂ emissions by 20% compared to conventional fuels while virtually eliminating sulfur oxides. However, methane slip during combustion—methane being 28-36 times more potent than CO₂ as a greenhouse gas—significantly compromises lifecycle benefits. Accordingly, DNV’s Maritime Forecast positions LNG as transitional rather than ultimate solution.

Methanol emerges as particularly promising for medium-term decarbonization. Green methanol produced from renewable electricity and captured CO₂ achieves near-zero lifecycle emissions. The fuel remains liquid at ambient conditions, which in turn simplifies storage compared to cryogenic options. Maersk’s orders for methanol-capable craft reflect confidence in this pathway, though renewable methanol production remains insufficient for large-scale adoption.

Ammonia represents a potentially transformative long-term solution for deep-sea shipping. Containing no carbon, ammonia eliminates CO₂ emissions during combustion when properly managed. According to the IEA’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario, ammonia could fuel 45% of shipping energy demand by mid-century. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain: toxicity requires enhanced safety protocols, energy density is lower than conventional fuels, and combustion generates nitrous oxide requiring mitigation systems.

NYK Line and IHI Corporation’s 2024 ammonia-fueled tugboat trials demonstrated the first commercial-scale ammonia combustion in marine applications. In addition, the craft incorporated advanced safety monitoring and dual-fuel backup capability.

Biofuels and e-fuels offer drop-in compatibility with existing engines, potentially accelerating adoption. Yet, sustainable feedstock availability remains limited relative to maritime fuel demand. Furthermore, e-fuels require substantial renewable electricity—approximately 3-4 times the final fuel’s energy content. This creates cost challenges and competition with direct electrification of other transport sectors.

The fundamental reality is that no single fuel addresses all requirements. Consequently, short-sea shipping may adopt battery-electric propulsion; medium-range vessels might utilize methanol; and long-distance carriers could require synthetic fuels. This fragmentation multiplies infrastructure investment requirements and complicates global standardization.

Beyond fuel substitution, substantial emissions reductions derive from operational optimization and technological innovation. These approaches offer immediate implementation potential without waiting for new fuel infrastructure. Moreover, CII and EEXI regulations create compliance imperatives driving efficiency measure adoption across existing fleets.

Hydrodynamic optimization represents an accessible emissions reduction. Advanced computational fluid dynamics enables hull refinements reducing resistance by 5-10%. Additionally, air lubrication systems inject micro-bubbles beneath hulls, creating friction-reducing layers that decrease fuel consumption by 5-15%. Together, these improvements can reduce a ship’s emissions by 20-30% without fundamental propulsion changes.

Weather routing optimization leverages meteorological forecasting and oceanographic modeling to identify fuel-efficient passages. In this context, modern algorithms balance voyage duration against consumption, while accounting for wave heights, current patterns, and wind conditions. Consequently, studies document 3-8% fuel savings through optimized routing compared to great-circle navigation.

Predictive maintenance powered by artificial intelligence transforms traditional time-based schedules into condition-based interventions. By continuously monitoring engine parameters and performance indicators, operators can detect performance degradation early. Research demonstrates 4-7% consumption reductions through predictive maintenance compared to conventional practices.

Wärtsilä’s 2023 implementation of AI-powered voyage optimization across 50 container ships achieved remarkable results. Over twelve months, the fleet averaged 6.2% fuel consumption reduction and 8,400 tons CO₂ equivalent decrease. Moreover, economic savings exceeded $3.2 million, demonstrating environmental and financial alignment through intelligent optimization.

Wind-assisted propulsion technologies experience a renaissance through modern engineering. Rotor sails, rigid wing sails, and kite systems harness wind energy, supplementing mechanical propulsion. The International Windship Association reports that wind assistance reduces consumption by 10-30% depending on ship type and routes.

Despite technological feasibility, formidable economic barriers impede rapid decarbonization. The capital-intensive nature of shipping, long asset lifecycles, and fragmented ownership create inertia, which resists transformation. Understanding these impediments is therefore essential for designing effective interventions.

Vessel acquisition costs represent the most visible barrier. Alternative-fuel capable craft command 15-35% premiums over conventional designs. For large container vessels costing $150-200 million, premiums translate to an additional $25-60 million investment. Consequently, many operators—particularly small and medium companies—lack capital access without supportive financing.

Fuel cost uncertainties compound investment risks. New fuels like renewable ammonia and synthetic options currently cost 2-4 times conventional marine fuels. Shipowners making 20-30 year decisions confront trajectories that could render their fleet economically uncompetitive. As a result, this uncertainty paralyzes decision-making for operators lacking financial reserves.

Infrastructure requirements extend beyond the craft. Bunkering for these fuels requires specialized storage, transfer equipment, and safety systems. Moreover, the chicken-and-egg dilemma – vessels won’t order without bunkering availability, ports won’t invest without demand – delays ecosystem development. Breaking this impasse therefore requires coordinated public-private investment.

DFDS announced in 2023 that retrofitting existing craft would cost more than new construction while providing shorter lifespans. Consequently, the company committed to methanol-capable newbuilds while operating conventional ships until scheduled retirement. This pragmatic approach acknowledges retrofit limitations while advancing fleet decarbonization within economic constraints.

International competition creates carbon leakage risks. Stringent regulations may incentivize cargo routing through less-regulated jurisdictions. Accordingly, the OECD warns that asymmetric regulations could shift rather than reduce global emissions. This dynamic necessitates internationally coordinated policies preventing regulatory arbitrage.

Financing mechanisms must evolve to support decarbonization at required scales. The Climate Bonds Initiative estimates shipping requires $1-1.4 trillion investment by 2050. Hence, public development banks and multilateral institutions must provide concessional financing, thereby de-risking early investments. Additionally, carbon pricing generating transition support revenues could create self-funding frameworks.

Carbon neutrality depends fundamentally on comprehensive emissions quantification and operational optimization. In particular, data-driven decision-making transforms abstract commitments into measurable actions. Digital monitoring provides visibility, analytics, and predictive capabilities, which are essential for navigating regulatory landscapes while optimizing performance.

Regulatory compliance increasingly demands granular emissions reporting. The EU’s Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) regulation requires detailed fuel consumption and emissions data. Meanwhile, CII ratings—assigning craft grades A through E—directly influence valuations, insurance premiums, and chartering preferences. Therefore, maintaining favorable ratings requires continuous monitoring that exceeds traditional practices.

Real-time emissions monitoring enables proactive management rather than retrospective reporting. Modern platforms integrate AIS data tracking movements, fuel consumption sensors, and meteorological data. This synthesis calculates emissions with voyage-level granularity, thus identifying high-consumption segments for targeted improvements.

Predictive analytics transform historical performance into forward-looking guidance. Machine learning algorithms analyze relationships between speed, loading, weather, and consumption to recommend optimal parameters.

Moreover, these systems account for craft-specific characteristics—hull fouling, engine efficiency, trim optimization—thereby delivering personalized recommendations. Studies demonstrate that data-driven optimization reduces emissions 8-15% compared to conventional operations.

Sinay’s real-time monitoring solutions

Our implementation with a European short-sea operator demonstrated practical benefits of comprehensive digital monitoring. Specifically, the company deployed our integrated platform across 18 vessels, combining real-time emissions tracking with metocean analytics and route optimization. Over 18 months, the fleet achieved 11.3% average fuel consumption reduction, with a corresponding emissions decrease of approximately 14,800 tons CO₂ equivalent. Additionally, the system identified that speed reductions during specific weather conditions yielded disproportionate gains. Furthermore, automated regulatory reporting reduced administrative burden by 65%, allowing personnel reallocation to strategic sustainability initiatives.

The metocean analytics advantage

Our platform provides sophisticated environmental intelligence supporting route optimization and operational planning. High-resolution ocean current modeling, wave forecasting, and wind pattern prediction enable identification of fuel-efficient passages while accounting for performance characteristics. In addition, integration with emissions monitoring creates closed-loop optimization—recommended routes generate performance data that refines future predictions, continuously improving accuracy.

Data as collective intelligence

We believe maritime decarbonization represents fundamentally a data challenge as much as a technology challenge. Physical solutions largely exist; however, the persistent gap lies in systematic deployment guided by comprehensive performance visibility. Our platform democratizes access to sophisticated analytics, thereby enabling operators of all sizes to make evidence-based decarbonization decisions. This approach accelerates the transition through measurable, verifiable actions rather than aspirational commitments alone.",https://sinay.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/carbon-neutral-shipping.png,N,,2026-01-01 15:56:27.935769

One of the biggest challenges facing maritime transport is moving towards decarbonization. To this end, in September 2025, the Panama Canal Authority launched the Net Zero Quota program. The initiative seeks to boost energy efficiency and promote the use of low-emission fuels in Neopanamax vessels.

Decarbonization with Net Zero Quota

During the first 11 months of the Panama Canal’s 2024-2025 fiscal year, which ends on September 30, 2025, 11,019 ships transited the canal. Of that total, 72.4% were Panamax vessels. The remaining 27.6% were Neopanamax.

In this context, the Panama Canal Authority indicated that, as of October 3, 2025, program participants will be able to access a weekly preferential quota. The mechanism operates through the transit reservation system. It also guarantees passage within 24 hours, just-in-time arrival service, and the option to exchange or replace vessels.

According to a report by ECLAC, in its first phase, the program will be open to ships with dual-fuel engines. These are vessels capable of operating with energies whose carbon intensity, measured under the “well-to-wake” approach, is equal to or less than 75 gCO₂e/MJ.

These energies include liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, and ammonia. The measure thus seeks to recognize early investments in low-carbon technologies.

Panama Canal

The Net Zero Quota program is part of the Panama Canal’s sustainability strategy. The goal is clear: to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In this way, the canal reinforces its long-term climate agenda.

The initiative complements the efforts of the International Maritime Organization. In particular, those related to the development of a sustainable fuel certification system. This mechanism will standardize the measurement of greenhouse gas intensity used by ships.

With this system, the canal will be able to verify the suitability of vessels interested in programs such as Net Zero Quota. This strengthens its role as a laboratory for environmental innovation in global maritime trade.

At the same time, the economy showed greater dynamism. In the six months ending June 30, 2025, estimated GDP growth was 4.4%. A year earlier, it had been 2.0%.

A consortium of Japanese companies has revealed an astonishing development

The consortium of companies, namely Japan Engine Corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Yanmar Power Solutions, announced recently that they have completed onland trials for a maritime hydrogen engine that could potentially reshape the shipping industry. Japan relies heavily on the maritime industry for trade, as the nation is essentially an island with no immediate neighbors nearby.

The problem with that is the fact that the maritime industry produces vast amounts of emissions, as the huge container vessels pump out industrial-scale greenhouse gases. This has led the energy companies of the world to contemplate how to rework the engine used on ships to run on something other than diesel.

Japan is reshaping the marine engine industry with the astonishing new engine specifically designed to run on hydrogen

The consortium of companies announced that they have successfully completed the land-based trials for the new engine that will be able to run on both diesel and hydrogen, drastically reducing the emissions produced by the maritime industry. The testing was done at Japan Engine Corporation’s headquarters using a newly installed liquefied hydrogen fuel supply system.

The consortium plans to reach out to shipbuilding companies in the new year

Japan Engine Corporation has noted that, following the successful initial testing, the company will reach out to shipbuilding companies to facilitate real-world trials of the new hydrogen engines in 2026. The planned trials form part of a broader initiative by the government known as the Green Innovation Fund Projects / “Next-Generation Ship Development” initiative.

This specific project is called the Development of Marine Hydrogen Engine and MHFS, and will see Kawasaki supplying a liquefied hydrogen fuel system capable of storing and gasifying liquid hydrogen, which will then be fed to the engine at both high and low pressure.

This will allow for the evaluation of the system across several engine types, including but not limited to:

Low-speed two-stroke main propulsion models

Four-stroke auxiliary engines

Four-stroke generator engines for use in electric propulsion

With the world facing the uncomfortable reality that emissions are a top priority that needs to be addressed, the EU has awarded funding for several hydrogen projects under its NetZero program, pointing to the fact that the sector is changing for the better, according to some.

A pioneering project

The plant, located in Ramme (western Jutland), was driven by the collaboration between Topsoe, Skovgaard Energy, Vestas, and the Danish public program EUDP. Unlike conventional facilities designed to operate at constant load, this plant adjusts its green ammonia production in real-time according to the fluctuations of available wind and solar energy.

Total flexibility: synchronizes water electrolysis (to obtain green hydrogen) with ammonia synthesis, avoiding the need to oversize batteries or hydrogen tanks.

Practical efficiency: when the wind blows strong, it harnesses the renewable surplus; when production decreases, it reduces its activity without compromising the stability of the chemical process.

Relevance of green ammonia

Green ammonia has been identified for years as a key energy vector to decarbonize sectors that are difficult to electrify:

Agricultural fertilizers.

Maritime transport.

Intensive industrial processes.

The challenge was not the concept, but the execution. This project demonstrates that industrial chemistry can be flexible and operate without fossil backup, changing the landscape of the energy transition.

Local and strategic impact

The CEO of Skovgaard Energy emphasized the impact on innovation, employment, and development in a rural area, recalling that the energy transition also involves creating value in the territories.

Beyond the technical advancement, the plant reinforces European energy autonomy:

Green ammonia can be produced locally.

It is easily stored and transported, without the complexities of pure hydrogen.

In a context of geopolitical tensions and volatile energy prices, having renewable synthetic fuels produced at home becomes a strategic issue.

Advantages of the dynamic model

The approach opens the door to smaller, distributed, and territorially connected plants, instead of centralized megaprojects:

Production close to consumption.

Less transportation and losses.

Greater energy resilience.

In the short term, it can facilitate the use of green ammonia as maritime fuel in European ports, reducing emissions on key trade routes. In the medium term, it promises to transform the fertilizer industry, responsible for a significant portion of agricultural emissions.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/12/amoniaco-verde.webp,N,,2025-12-31 07:57:02.084235

— Viktor, you've worked extensively with heavy fuel oil and know how to handle it safely.
Heavy fuel oil, or HFO, is a high-sulfur residual oil.
Fuel systems are also changed or adapted: pipelines, pumps, fuel preparation and filtration systems, separators.","Russia and Canada have notified the International Maritime Organization (IMO) that they will not join the voluntary ban on the use and transport of heavy fuel oil (HFO) in the Arctic. According to analysts, Canada's decision is likely temporary until the formal adoption of the relevant agreement, while Russia intends to use heavy fuel oil for at least another five years.

""The refusal to join the ban shows how painful the transition remains for parts of the fleet. However, this is temporary: environmental requirements will only become stricter, and sooner or later shipping companies will have to adapt,"" comments Viktor Genkulov, a marine engineer and ship mechanic with the international company SIFSERVICE L.T.D. Viktor works on the operation and modernization of marine power plants, including projects to reduce emissions and transition vessels to more environmentally friendly fuels. This year, he joined the Expert Commission of the ""Ukrainian Quality Mark. Best Products and Services of the Year"" Award, evaluating companies in marine engineering, ship systems repair and maintenance, power plants, and yachts.

In this interview, the expert discusses current environmental challenges in shipping, the transition from heavy fuel oil (HFO) to cleaner alternatives, and how these measures help maintain shipping sustainability even during wartime.

— Viktor, you've worked extensively with heavy fuel oil and know how to handle it safely. What makes HFO dangerous, and why are we moving away from it now?

Heavy fuel oil, or HFO, is a high-sulfur residual oil. It's cheap, which is why it's been commonly used on most large commercial vessels. The fuel contains high amounts of sulfur and, when burned, releases sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and large quantities of soot—black carbon. This carbon settles on snow and ice, accelerating their melting, which is especially dangerous for the Arctic. Additionally, in case of an HFO spill, it's virtually impossible to remove from the water surface—in cold conditions, the fuel becomes thick and viscous, creating a serious threat to ecosystems.

More environmentally friendly alternatives include low-emission fuels like liquefied natural gas or marine diesel fuel with low sulfur content. They significantly reduce emissions while maintaining vessel efficiency.

— Recent events show that countries are still resisting the HFO ban in the Arctic. What's actually required in practice for this transition to become widespread and safe?

First and foremost, the vessels themselves and the infrastructure need to be ready. For many ships, especially older ones, this means dry dock repairs, replacement or modernization of equipment, recertification, and bringing all systems into compliance with international requirements.

Installing new equipment takes time and additional resources—not just for installation, but also for maintenance, crew training, and scheduled operations. Moreover, the entire process is accompanied by strict inspections and extensive paperwork confirming the vessel's safety and compliance with national and international requirements.

So in practice, the main challenges arise in the engineering side and project management. Funding, of course, also plays a role, but it usually follows from technical and organizational tasks: modernization, certification, and operational control.

— You work on dry dock repairs, engine, and machinery restoration. Which systems on a vessel typically need to be modernized when switching to alternative fuel?

In practice, the main propulsion plant and diesel generators most often require modernization, because they're the ones burning fuel and incurring daily costs. Fuel systems are also changed or adapted: pipelines, pumps, fuel preparation and filtration systems, separators. All of this requires structural changes, additional safety systems, and sometimes backup mechanisms.

If we're talking about more innovative solutions, like sails or wind devices, this adds weight and load to the vessel, requiring lightweight materials and additional maintenance. Such technologies are usually cost-effective on large ships where the additional weight isn't critical.

— Another IMO environmental initiative—limiting sulfur content in marine fuel to 0.5%—came into effect in 2020. After that, many vessels began installing scrubbers—exhaust gas cleaning devices. You've also been involved in their installation: what are the main advantages of these systems, and is it really feasible to install them on older vessels?

A scrubber reduces sulfur dioxide emissions and other harmful substances, helping the vessel comply with modern environmental standards. It's a very good alternative for vessels that, for technical or economic reasons, can't yet switch to alternative fuel, since taking the entire such fleet out of operation all at once is impossible.

Scrubbers come in different types—open-loop and closed-loop, hybrid, inline, and external—which makes it possible to select a solution for a specific vessel and its technical characteristics. As for older vessels, scrubber installation is possible, but you need to adapt the fuel system, pipelines, pumps, fuel filtration and separation systems, and provide additional safety measures. It's quite a labor-intensive process that requires time and, most importantly, investment. On average, retrofitting one vessel costs several hundred thousand to a million dollars, depending on the vessel's size and type.

— Many worry about the high cost of transitioning to cleaner fuel. How quickly do such measures pay off in practice? Are there examples where investments in environmental sustainability actually paid for themselves?

Payback depends on the type of vessel, scale of modernization, and chosen technologies. Simple measures, such as installing monitoring instruments and enhanced fuel consumption control, usually show results immediately—savings are noticeable from the first voyages.

More serious investments, such as installing scrubbers, dual-fuel engines, or systems like sails and solar panels, require time and capital investment, but such modernizations gradually pay for themselves through fuel savings and reduced emissions penalties.

Even relatively small reductions in fuel consumption through scrubber installation or hybrid systems eventually produce a noticeable economic effect: on large vessels and long voyages, these savings accumulate and allow investments to be recouped within several years. In the long term, such solutions simultaneously reduce emissions and increase overall vessel operational efficiency.

— You serve on the Commission of the National ""Ukrainian Quality Mark"" Award and evaluate colleagues' projects, checking engineering safety, compliance with international standards, and other criteria. What solutions in ship operations do you consider most promising for reliability and environmental sustainability?

I like initiatives using digital systems on vessels. For example, modern solutions allow automatic monitoring of fuel levels, including heavy HFO. Previously, a mechanic had to walk around each tank and check everything manually; now sensors collect data in real time and display it on screens in the engine room or navigation bridge. If something goes wrong, an alarm sounds and the crew can quickly take action. This helps prevent fuel overflow, detect leaks or hull damage in time—especially important when working with HFO—and significantly reduces the risk of errors due to fatigue or inattention.

Of course, mechanics continue to monitor equipment, but the workload becomes more manageable, and the response to unforeseen situations is faster and more accurate, which directly improves the safety and environmental performance of vessel operations. I think in the future, such digital systems will be integrated into all vessels.

— Viktor, you're one of the few Ukrainian marine engineers who've managed to continue working on international contracts during the war. What do you think is especially important today for marine engineers and mechanics so that international shipping remains environmentally sustainable even during a crisis?

First of all, it's important not to treat environmental concerns as a secondary issue. It's engineers and mechanics who are responsible for how a vessel consumes fuel, how cleaning systems work, and how promptly leaks and deviations are detected. Even simple things—accurate fuel accounting, functioning sensors, proper operation of monitoring systems—already reduce environmental risks.

The war has shown that any savings on monitoring and maintenance can lead to serious consequences—both environmental and technical. Therefore, the role of engineers today is to maintain professional standards, implement digital solutions, keep environmental systems operational, and prepare for a gradual transition to cleaner technologies. I'm confident this transition is inevitable: even those countries that haven't yet joined the heavy fuel ban and other environmental initiatives will eventually be forced to take this step—under pressure from technology, economics, and responsibility for the future of the maritime industry.",https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4638917/viktor-genkulov.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 21:56:27.887570

The Fuel EU regulations have now been in force for a full year, penalties are already being incurred and the deadline for payment is fast approaching. According to Gard, despite the fact that the BIMCO FuelEU clause was published in February 2025, many parties are still negotiating clauses to cover responsibility for compliance, and the BIMCO clause is often subject to significant amendment or negotiation.

Biofuel Usage and Management

The most common method of compliance is blending fossil fuels with biofuels to bring the fuel within the FuelEU limits. A good Biofuels clause should address everything from the time and cost of preparing bunker tanks to fuel certification, testing, handling and the vessel's performance with these new fuels. BIMCO is currently drafting a Biofuels Clause. There can be tension between owners and charterers over when biofuels should be used. Owners will want biofuels to be used promptly as they can have a shorter shelf life than fossil fuels. Charterers may buy biofuels in advance according to availability but may also wish to delay the use for when voyages come within the remit of the FuelEU regulations. Parties should also agree on what is to happen to biofuels left on board on re-delivery and how any payment for those is to be calculated and made.

Reporting and Data Verification

The parties will want to agree on how regularly owners provide information to charterers about the vessel's emissions and potential FuelEU exposure. Charterers may wish to check the accuracy of owners' calculations. As charterers have been seen to request even daily updates and reports, Owners should ensure whatever is agreed is achievable. Any calculation will always be verified by the administering authority and any payments can be adjusted then. For short term charters, owners would likely want to make sure they have adequate funds on re-delivery and in advance of the payment deadline.

Liability and Payment Structures

The majority of clauses provide that charterers will reimburse owners for any FuelEU penalties owners calculate. However, some variations include charterers instead paying for a supply of biofuels sufficient to provide a surplus. Owners may want payment as soon as the cost of emissions are calculated, or on completion of the voyage. Charterers may want to delay until payment actually falls due, which could be well over a year later. It is easier for owners to ensure payment is made while the vessel remains on charter.

Handling Compliance Surpluses

One area where parties have reached greater clarity is what to do when charterers redeliver with a positive compliance balance. Whilst the BIMCO clause provided that owners would pay a lumpsum per tonne of positive compliance, there are now companies which provide market indices for FuelEU surplus which parties agree to refer to. There is also the issue of when owners should pay any sums due for surpluses.

The Multiplier Penalty Challenge

Where a vessel fails to meet the targeted FuelEU reduction in two or more consecutive years, an additional 10% multiplier penalty is added to the vessel's penalty each time. The issue of who should pay the additional 10% penalty does not come with a clear answer. Perhaps the easiest fix for owners is when owners incur a penalty in a given year, to expressly agree in the following charter, that the ship cannot earn a penalty in that first year as that will incur a multiplier.

Pooling and Brokers

Various brokers have emerged in the market offering services which identify pools and arrange the pooling agreements at a cost. Provision should always be made in the charter for who is to remain responsible for any broker's fee. Many of the owners with the larger fleets have devised strategies where they will pool their credits earned internally amongst their own fleet.

Voyage Charters and Suspension Clauses

Under a voyage charter, it remains with owners to devise their own strategy on FuelEU and seek to calculate in advance exposure and add this to the freight. For now, the position is that FuelEU costs are not currently reflected in the freight rates. The BIMCO FuelEU clause entitles owners to suspend performance where timely payment of any penalty has not been made to owners. Many charterers delete owners' right to suspend performance stating that it is disproportionate. A middle ground may be therefore to amend owners' right to suspend to performance only when a certain penalty threshold has been met.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2025-12-30 23:56:34.925730

Despite this, and despite the fact that the BIMCO FuelEU clause was published in February 2025, many parties are still negotiating clauses to cover responsibility for compliance, and the BIMCO clause is often subject to significant amendment or negotiation.

With that in mind, we want to highlight some issues which we have seen arise, the key points that any FuelEU clause needs to cover, and some of the possible solutions that can be considered. All the points that follow arise from our experience assisting our Members with the FuelEU requirements.

Blending biofuels: risks and responsibilities

In our experience, the most common method of compliance is blending fossil fuels with biofuels to bring the fuel within the FuelEU limits. This raises issues of compatibility, stability and other potential technical problems. Some owners and charterers can be so absorbed in the discussion of FuelEU penalties, that they overlook a key point: if they agree to use new fuels, the charterparty should include provisions for handling those fuels – unless it already does. A good Biofuels clause should address everything from the time and cost of preparing bunker tanks to fuel certification, testing, handling and the vessel’s performance with these new fuels. BIMCO is currently drafting a Biofuels Clause, so that may be an option once published, but until then parties will need to consider their own solution to the potential risks and issues that biofuels raise.

There can be tension between owners and charterers over when biofuels should be used. Owners will want biofuels to be used promptly as they can have a shorter shelf life than fossil fuels and there are potential microbial issues when biofuels are left in the bunker tanks for prolonged periods. Charterers may buy biofuels in advance according to availability but may also wish to delay the use for when voyages come within the remit of the FuelEU regulations.

Parties should also agree on what is to happen to biofuels left on board on re-delivery (bearing in mind that they may not have much shelf life left) and how any payment for those is to be calculated and made.

Notification of emissions

The parties will want to agree on how regularly owners provide information to charterers about the vessel’s emissions and potential FuelEU exposure. Charterers will want to keep track of their emissions for their own governance and to ensure they recover those costs from parties down the chain. For this reason, charterers may wish to check the accuracy of owners’ calculations, and the parties can agree when the data is provided to allow this. An owner should ensure that whatever it agreed with charterers is aligned with owners’ technical managers, as they will likely have the relevant documents and calculations. As charterers have been seen to request even daily updates and reports, Owners should ensure whatever is agreed is achievable, not overly onerous and does not incur additional expense. It may also be worth bearing in mind that the shorter the timescales of data, the more difficult it will be for owners to ensure accuracy and avoid the need for possible revision.

Where owners are asked to submit information to third parties or comply with charterers’ internal reporting systems, they should always check exactly what that may involve. This helps avoid disputes over potential reporting breaches, which in turn could impact whether owners can request payment.

Whilst ideally there would be agreement on how reporting is done and whom calculations are checked by (and at whose cost), the parties should remember that any calculation will always be verified by the administering authority (the same authority as under the MRV / EU ETS scheme) and any payments can be adjusted then. For short term charters, owners would likely want to make sure they have adequate funds on re-delivery and in advance of the payment deadline. Some charterers press for figures to be final/binding, which is understandable, but many owners find that difficult to agree. If interim figures are agreed to be final, this should apply to both parties so that the risk of adjustments does not only flow in one direction.

Excluded emissions

Apart from the multiplier (see below), parties generally find it fairly easy to agree which FuelEU emissions should remain owners’ responsibility – such as emissions during off-hire periods or when unrelated to charterers’ orders/activity. Whilst it is understandable that charterers wish to avoid liability for emissions during off-hire periods, these periods are often the subject of dispute. It may therefore be worth ensuring that any off-hire carve-out only applies when both owners and charterers have agreed on the off-hire period.

The same logic would apply where charterers seek to avoid liability for periods where the vessel is underperforming. Vessel underperformance is also often the subject of dispute, and so if owners are willing to make a concession for underperformance periods, it may be worth making it clear that those underperformance periods must be firstly agreed by owners and charterers.

Penalty payment

The majority of clauses provide that charterers will reimburse owners for any FuelEU penalties owners calculate. However, some variations that we have seen include charterers instead pay for a supply of biofuels sufficient to provide a surplus that will cover the calculated penalty, with the cost based on an agreed date from an agreed index.

This can work if owners are able to source and consume adequate biofuels to ensure compliance with the regulation. Problems arise if biofuels are unavailable or if the vessel is not certain to engage in FuelEU trade during the relevant period. In that case, owners would be liable to pay a penalty but would only be able to claim the marginal cost of biofuels from charterers, which is likely less than the penalty.

Timing of paying penalties

Owners do not normally grant charterers credit under a time charterparty – hire must be paid in advance, as is fuel on delivery. When should charterers pay for penalties that are incurred because their orders give rise to FuelEU liabilities? Owners may want payment as soon as the cost of emissions are calculated, or on completion of the voyage. Charterers may want to delay until payment actually falls due, which could be well over a year later. How much credit owners extend is a matter of agreement, but it’s worth bearing in mind that the charterers may well be in funds to cover the penalty from the time of completing the voyage (because it was included in the freight they earned or because they recover from sub-charterers on completion of the voyage).

It is also easier for owners to ensure payment is made while the vessel remains on charter. Once the vessel has been re-delivered the charterers’ duty to pay the penalties can remain, but it is more difficult for owners to enforce. Owners that are happy with the charterers’ creditworthiness may allow penalties to be paid shortly before they fall due – as long as the charterparty continues to run, but with any amount in the final/partial year at the time of re-delivery.

There can also be hybrid solutions. Owners may allow charterers to pay the penalty shortly before owners must remit the funds, as long as the amount is less than an agreed sum, with any excess to be paid when it is incurred. In this way owners cap the credit extended to charterers.

Balances due on redelivery

One area where we have seen parties reach greater clarity is what to do when charterers redeliver with a positive compliance balance. If charterers do not wish to pool the credit they will likely want owners will refund the credit, so that owners take it over for pooling/banking. Whilst the BIMCO clause provided that owners would pay a lumpsum per tonne of positive compliance, at a figure to be agreed and inserted into the clause, there are now companies which provide market indices for FuelEU surplus which parties agree to refer to. If the surplus value is to be taken from one of these market indices, it should be clarified when the surplus value is to be taken. Would owners pay for a surplus at the market index rate when the bunkers were bought or when the surplus was earned or when the vessel is redelivered?

There is also the issue of when owners should pay any sums due for surpluses. Would it be on redelivery, or at the time when owners receive payment themselves (e.g. from the next charterer or by pooling). If charterers want owners to extend credit for the payment of penalties that they incur, should owners request similar time to recover and remit credit balances to charterers?

The multiplier

Where a vessel fails to meet the targeted FuelEU reduction in two or more consecutive years, an additional 10% ‘multiplier’ penalty is added to the vessel’s penalty each time. The issue of who should pay the additional 10% penalty does not come with a clear answer.

That is, where charterer A incurs a penalty, pays it and redelivers in Year 1 and charterer B subsequently charters the vessel and incurs a penalty in Year 2, the penalty will be 10% higher in Year 2. Should charterer A pay it, because it would not have arisen without their orders? Should the extra 10% fall on owners rather than charterer B? Should charterer B pay the extra 10% as it was their orders that caused it?

Whilst the BIMCO clause requires charterer A to pay a lumpsum to cover the penalty, agreeing in advance on an amount that would adequately cover 10% of an unknown future penalty is challenging. Perhaps the easiest fix for owners is when owners incur a penalty in a given year, to expressly agree in the following charter, that the ship cannot earn a penalty in that first year as that will incur a ‘multiplier’. If that is agreed, subsequent charterers incurring a penalty would be a breach of contract and owners could seek to claim any multiplier. Of course, including such a restriction would make the vessel less attractive to charterers, so presumably the rate of hire earned would be lower than without it. If this cannot be agreed, owners need to at least be aware that the multiplier cost may rest with owners – unless owners devise a way to avoid it, by for example, paying the marginal cost of biofuel to avoid a second year of deficit.

Pooling

When FuelEU was introduced, there was some uncertainty around how pooling would work and how the pooling schemes would be arranged. As perhaps expected, various brokers have emerged in the market offering services which identify pools and arrange the pooling agreements at a cost. Provision should always be made in the charter for who is to remain responsible for any brokers’ fee and entitling owners to object to any pooling should there be reasonable grounds.

Many of the owners with the larger fleets have devised strategies where they will pool their credits earned internally amongst their own fleet. Where that is the case, owners need to ensure they are retaining the right to pool credits earned, as standard clauses give charterers the right to control credits earned and decide on pooling.

Voyage charters

Under a voyage charter, it remains with owners to devise their own strategy on FuelEU and seek to calculate in advance exposure and add this to the freight. It remains to be seen whether any of the freight indices, which set out the established freight rates for different ships and voyages, will be amended to include these FuelEU costs. For now, the position is that FuelEU costs are not currently reflected in the freight rates.

Other clause considerations

The BIMCO FuelEU clause entitles owners to suspend performance where timely payment of any penalty has not been made to owners. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this has been one of the clauses which has been most frequently removed. Many charterers delete owners’ right to suspend performance stating that it is disproportionate as it could be exercised when only minor sums are due. A middle ground may be therefore to amend owners’ right to suspend to performance only when a certain penalty threshold (e.g. USD 50,000) has been met.

Understanding hydrogen as a fuel Hydrogen has long been known for its high energy content per unit of weight.
At the FPS H2 Barge 2 launch event, FPS CEO Richard Klatten said, “We have established something new in the shipping world.
This is our first Flagships project and second vessel, and hydrogen is becoming a standard in the industry already, especially in the inland vessel industry.
This vessel will feature hydrogen fuel cells and electric propulsion, enabling up to 36 hours of continuous operation in port waters.","On May 25, 2023, the first hydrogen-powered inland container ship, H2 Barge 1, set sail in the Rotterdam waters, Netherlands. Retrofitted at Holland Shipyards Group in Werkendam, this hydrogen-electric barge now transports containers for Nike between the Port of Rotterdam, Port of Antwerp, and the distribution center in Meerhout. As a zero-emission vessel, the only substances it emits are humid air and water.

This initiative is part of broader efforts by Future Proof Shipping (FPS) and various European projects aimed at promoting zero-emission transport solutions for inland waterways. It signals a shift toward cleaner maritime operations, though the shipping industry, a lot like aviation, remains one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize.

The industry, responsible for around 3% of global CO₂ emissions, relies heavily on fossil fuels due to its massive energy demands and long operational ranges. However, unlike aviation, ships have more space to store fuel, making hydrogen’s low volumetric energy density less of a barrier to adoption.

Understanding hydrogen as a fuel

Hydrogen has long been known for its high energy content per unit of weight. When used in a fuel cell, hydrogen combines with oxygen to produce electricity, with water as the only byproduct. This simple reaction makes hydrogen an attractive option for reducing carbon emissions. Yet, producing and storing hydrogen presents its own set of challenges.

Today, hydrogen is produced in several ways. The most sustainable method is through electrolysis, where electricity—ideally generated from renewable sources—splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. This method, known as green hydrogen, is gaining interest as renewable energy costs drop. According to the International Energy Agency, green hydrogen production could expand significantly over the next decade as renewable energy costs decline. Hydrogen could ramp up from less than 1% of energy used in shipping today to 19% in 2050.

Storage and transportation add another layer of complexity. Compressed or liquefied hydrogen requires specialized infrastructure because its small molecules can easily leak.

Hydrogen in shipping becomes reality

Following the launch of H2 Barge 1, a second prototype, H2 Barge 2, completed its first trials in March 2024 and is now operating emission-free along the busy Rhine shipping route between Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Duisburg, Germany.

Originally built as a traditional diesel-powered containership, H2 Barge 2 was stripped of all combustion engines and fossil fuel tanks in 2023 during its retrofit at Holland Shipyards Group in Werkendam. Now, its new propulsion system features six PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell modules, providing a total capacity of 1.2 MW hydrogen storage tanks, battery packs, and an electric drive train installed below deck.

This innovative vessel, with a cargo that can carry the equivalent of 190 20-foot shipping containers and the ability to accommodate a push barge, promises to slash CO₂ emissions by 3,000 tonnes annually.

At the FPS H2 Barge 2 launch event, FPS CEO Richard Klatten said, “We have established something new in the shipping world. This is our first Flagships project and second vessel, and hydrogen is becoming a standard in the industry already, especially in the inland vessel industry. We were the crazy ones who did it. We have established something no one thought possible five years ago.”

While FPS did not disclose details on the technology behind the H2 Barges, he told in an interview after the launch event, “We try to be technically agnostic and constantly aim to find the best solutions for the vessels we are working with.”

One major challenge to overcome is cost. “If you look at sustainability, you must work with vessels that are already in the market—there are 5,000 inland vessels from port of Rotterdam alone. Most of those vessels are privately owned, and a lot of capex is needed,” Klatten said. But he expects more investors to come onboard.

Hydrogen-powered vessels: The future standard

No longer confined to a handful of experimental projects, hydrogen-powered shipping is now spreading worldwide. One of the latest projects to hit headlines was developed in Lithuania. Shipbuilders Baltic Workboats Ltd and Western Baltija Shipbuilding recently launched a 42-meter-long hydrogen fuel cell-powered tanker with a 400 m³ capacity (about 1/16th the capacity of the H2 Barge 2) designed to collect ship waste at the Port of Klaipéda. This vessel will feature hydrogen fuel cells and electric propulsion, enabling up to 36 hours of continuous operation in port waters. It is being built with a budget of approximately €11.7 million and is set for delivery in late 2025.

But maritime companies are also investing in commercial passenger vessels. In July, 2024, a 70-foot catamaran, capable of carrying up to 75 passengers, MV Sea Change, began offering free rides between Pier 41 and the downtown San Francisco Ferry Terminal, as part of a six-month pilot program to demonstrate the viability of hydrogen fuel-cell technology in maritime transport.

Sea Change operated on a hydrogen fuel-cell system, producing electricity through an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen—emitting only water vapor. Uniquely, some of this water was condensed and remineralized for drinking, making it the only vessel where passengers could “drink the emissions.” The ferry had a 250-kilogram hydrogen fuel capacity, allowing it to travel 300 nautical miles and operate for up to two days before refueling.

What’s next for hydrogen in maritime transport?

Hydrogen-powered vessels are still in their early stages of development, and while the fuel itself might be expensive compared to conventional fuels like diesel, technological advancements are driving down the costs. The growing demand for green hydrogen could lead to economies of scale that reduce its price, making it more competitive with fossil fuels.",,N,,2025-12-30 17:56:32.987074

Expectations were high for the 2025 Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meetings.

IMO states advanced a flat-rate carbon levy, Greek shipowners anticipated an agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) measures, and regulators set a timetable to finalise the IMO Net-Zero Framework and its measure at an extraordinary October session.

By year-end, the framework was incomplete and politically exposed.

Ahead of MEPC 83 in April, momentum built behind a levy on shipping emissions. Nearly 50 IMO member states backed a proposal to charge commercial vessels a flat fee for each tonne of carbon emitted, with proceeds flowing into a fund managed by IMO, and sought a Marpol amendment based on a carbon levy.

The Greek shipping community saw MEPC 83 as a chance to pursue a universal, rather than regional, GHG emissions-reduction regime. The Greek Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy referred to “realistic mid-term measures” and reiterated a preference for IMO-led decarbonisation. The Union of Greek Shipowners reported confidence that IMO would approve a global maritime GHG emissions pricing mechanism to promote ’greener’ shipping.

MEPC 83 delivered only partial alignment with these expectations.

IMO advanced its global net-zero framework by dropping its consensus practice and moving to a vote on key elements, including the GHG fuel intensity trajectory, described as crucial for aligning international and regional regulations. Negotiations were shaped by regional blocs and took place without the United States at the table.

Intertanko, representing tanker interests, warned operators preparing for the FuelEU Maritime regulation could see their efforts undermined by “unrealistic targets” beyond what owners were working towards. Intertanko managing director Tim Wilkins criticised the exclusion of non-governmental organisations from closed-door talks, saying this “ignored the vital contribution the industry makes by bringing technical, practical and real-world analysis and information into the rule-making process”.

Attention then moved to the extraordinary MEPC session in October, where the revised Marpol Annex VI text incorporating the Net-Zero Framework was expected to be adopted. By mid-2025, concerns over the draft grew.

WinGD chief executive Dominik Schneiter said his company “bet on the wrong horse” and warned that, without clarity on rewards for sustainable fuels, LNG and paying to pollute looked like the best options.

ABS chairman and chief executive Christopher Wiernicki called LNG and biofuels “mission-critical to any success” and suggested IMO “needs to take a timeout” on the framework.

The political context around the October meeting deteriorated: US Secretaries Marco Rubio, Chris Wright and Sean Duffy, acting under President Trump, warned countries backing the framework of “port fees, sanctions, investigations, visa restrictions on crews and other penalties”.

On the eve of the vote, US President Trump posted on X that he was “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global carbon tax”.

A positive vote would have led to the adoption of what was described as the first global tax on shipping emissions, with entry into force by March 2027, but the timetable was postponed.

The year closed with political division and concern over the incentives embedded in the framework.

According to the Wall Street Journal, nuclear propulsion is no longer viewed solely as the domain of military vessels but is increasingly seen as a viable zero-emissions solution for commercial maritime transport.

The renewed interest follows the publication of a new Nuclear-Powered Ship Safety Manual by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), developed with the support of the MIT Maritime Consortium. Founding members of the consortium include Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp., HD Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering, Delos Navigation Ltd., and the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), alongside members such as Foresight Group, Navios Maritime Partners LP, the Singapore Maritime Institute and Dorian LPG.

According to the MIT research cited by the Wall Street Journal, next-generation nuclear reactors are significantly smaller and safer than those currently used in a limited number of US and Russian naval vessels, submarines and icebreakers. These reactors, produced by companies such as Westinghouse and Babcock & Wilcox, are awaiting certification from regulatory authorities for potential use in commercial shipping.

The study, funded by some of the world’s largest shipowners, shipyards and classification societies, aims to promote nuclear-powered commercial shipping by providing guidance on ship design and safe operation.

Advantages and Economic Impact

One of the main advantages of nuclear-powered vessels is dramatically lower operating costs, as they would not require refuelling throughout their estimated 25-year lifespan. Fuel currently accounts for nearly half of a ship’s operating expenses. Nuclear propulsion also produces no carbon emissions, making it a potential pathway to large-scale decarbonisation of the shipping industry.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Capital Maritime & Trading chairman Evangelos Marinakis said nuclear-powered commercial shipping could deliver substantial benefits across the sector, from shipping companies to shipyards and regulators. Capital provided MIT researchers with the design of the container ship Manzanillo Express, enabling them to develop and test a computational model of a vessel retrofitted with nuclear propulsion.

Challenges and Safety Concerns

Despite the benefits, challenges remain. The cost of building a nuclear-powered ship is estimated to be four times higher than that of a conventional vessel, though this could be largely offset by fuel savings over its lifetime. Regulatory uncertainty is another major hurdle, as there is currently no global framework governing the operation of nuclear-powered commercial ships or their access to ports and territorial waters.

Classification societies and major maritime nations, including Japan, Greece, the United Kingdom, France and China, are discussing the port infrastructure required to accommodate such vessels. A recent memorandum of understanding between the United States and the United Kingdom also предусматриes the exploration of nuclear maritime applications and the creation of a transatlantic shipping corridor at a safe distance from other sea lanes.

Public acceptance remains a key obstacle, as concerns over safety persist. New reactors use uranium enriched to just 4%, compared with more than 90% in older designs, significantly reducing the risk of contamination. MIT researchers tested the retrofitted Manzanillo Express model under extreme simulated conditions, including sinking, flooding, severe weather, power loss and fire, concluding that the design met safety standards without radioactive leakage.

Professor Themistoklis Sapsis, director of MIT’s Center for Ocean Engineering, said the study demonstrated that integrating a microreactor into a conventional ship is both technically and economically feasible.

Looking Ahead

The MIT study concludes that the first nuclear-powered container ships could be launched within the next decade. However, issues such as emergency response frameworks, crew training, port security and the safe decommissioning of ships and reactors must be resolved.

In the United States, President Donald Trump has expressed support for reviving the domestic shipbuilding industry, with officials suggesting nuclear-powered vessels could play a role. Other proposed applications include floating power generation platforms, desalination units, port-based nuclear power systems and even nuclear-powered floating data centres for artificial intelligence.

ABS chief executive Christopher Wiernicki said energy-producing ports could emerge within the next 10 years, followed by nuclear-powered cargo ships, adding that ABS is already working on certification standards for such vessels.",https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/nuclear.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 02:57:11.898377

With GoodFuels B15, FincoEnergies provides shipowners with a practical, reliable drop-in solution at a time when the need for concrete decarbonization measures continues to grow. Now that the regulatory framework for higher FAME blends has been clarified, FincoEnergies provides inland and coastal shipping companies with a tangible step towards more sustainable operations they can take today.

The regulatory landscape for inland shipping is changing

From January onwards, REDIII raises the sustainability requirements for the Dutch maritime sector, increasing the urgency for practical decarbonization options. Shipowners are expected to demonstrate real and measurable CO₂ reductions, yet uncertainty around FAME blends above 7% previously created hesitation, even as demand for accessible and effective alternatives continued to rise.

That uncertainty has now been resolved. Recent European guidance (ES-TRIN and CESNI-EUROMOT) confirms that higher FAME blends are fully permitted in PRE-CCR, CCR I, and CCR II engines, without additional emission testing, provided that engine manufacturer requirements are met. Dutch authorities have also clarified that the Fuel Quality Directive’s (FQD) 10% FAME limit does not apply to the inland shipping sector, since vessels do not operate on EN590 road diesel. This removes a key barrier, making GoodFuels B15 a straightforward next step.

GoodFuels B15: practical, scalable and impactful

GoodFuels B15 is a drop-in biofuel blend that delivers measurable CO₂ reduction while fitting seamlessly into existing vessel operations. Fully aligned with the needs of the inland shipping sector, the blend meets the specifications defined by Koninklijke Binnenvaart Nederland (KBN), ensuring it matches day-to-day practice on board. GoodFuels B15 builds on FincoEnergies’ extensive experience with sustainable marine fuels and insights from its B15 inland shipping trial, which shows strong, stable performance in real-world conditions.

Bas Goedegebuure, responsible for inland shipping at FincoEnergies, said, “With GoodFuels B15, we offer shipowners a sustainable biofuel blend that performs as they expect: stable throughout the year, truly sustainable and fully compatible with their existing engines and operations. It’s a concrete step towards decarbonization they can take today, without complexity or disruption.”

GoodFuels B15 key benefits:

15% FAME and 85% regular diesel

Parameters meet EN590 diesel expectations

Very low SMG value to prevent gelling and clogging in colder conditions

Filter Blocking Tendency (FBT) testing for additional assurance

Drop-in properties with no infrastructure or engine modifications required

Truly sustainable; produced from feedstocks that are 100% certified as waste or residue, with no negative land-use impact like deforestation and no competition with food production.

GoodFuels B15 provides shipowners with a practical, ready-to-use sustainability solution simple, scalable and available today.

Built on collaboration

GoodFuels B15 was developed through close collaboration between FincoEnergies and Argent Energy. As one of Europe’s leading producers of waste-based biodiesel, Argent Energy contributed deep feedstock expertise and technical knowledge. FincoEnergies leveraged its long-standing experience in sustainable marine fuels and operational understanding of the inland marine sector. Together, these strengths resulted in a stable, reliable and high-quality FAME blend that meets the technical expectations of Dutch shipowners.

Jan Jaap Rodenburg, chief commercial officer at Argent Energy, said, “Our collaboration with FincoEnergies brought together the best of both worlds: our expertise in producing high-quality waste-based biodiesel and their deep understanding of the inland marine sector has resulted in a B15 blend that is technically robust, operationally reliable, and fully aligned with shipowners’ expectations.”

Ready for today’s operations

GoodFuels B15 is now available to the Dutch maritime industry, utilizing a bunkering process identical to that of regular diesel. The FAME blend is already available at Oliehandel Terlouw, along with higher FAME blends up to B30 for shipowners aiming for even more CO₂ reduction.

Decarbonizing the industry together

FincoEnergies believes that true decarbonization is only possible when the entire sector collaborates. Its mission is to make the transport and logistics chain climate-neutral step by step, with solutions that can be applied immediately in daily operations. The company works towards a future in which shipowners, shippers and logistics partners have easy access to reliable, affordable and impactful CO₂ reduction solutions.

Ricardo will lead the study, in collaboration with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority, and subcontractor with Maritime & Logistics Consulting Group, S.A.

As part of the study, Ricardo will:

Confirm feasible fuel options and operational implications to define realistic pathways for transitioning trans-oceanic container shipping to zero- or near-zero-emission energy sources.

Evaluate the business case for the corridor. This will consider capital costs of alternative-fuel vessels compared to conventional ships, the fuel price differential between zero/near-zero and fossil fuels, and operating costs linked to compliance with regulatory schemes such as the IMO Net-Zero Framework, FuelEU Maritime, and the EU ETS.

Identify enabling policy and financial interventions and initiatives that could help bridge cost gaps and accelerate deployment, and measures to strengthen the emerging zero-emission fuel supply chain.

Green shipping corridors are specific routes where vessels use low-emission propulsion. Ricard, who has led a number of such studies to date, welcomes the study and the significance that this could have on global shipping.

Ricardo’s Associate Director for Transport Policy, Alexi Pons, said: “The Panama–Algeciras green shipping corridor is not only significant because of its trans-oceanic distance, but also because it connects two major global bunker hubs with strong potential to become green hubs. Developing green shipping infrastructure along this route could deliver transformative benefits for both regions. We’re very excited to be working with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority and the EU on this project.”

The results of the study are expected to be delivered by April 2026.

The development comes amid a significant boom in the maritime transport sector, which the Cabinet noted has increased international confidence in Egypt’s regional and global role as a transit hub.

The infographics detailed international recognition of Egypt’s port development, noting that the country climbed four spots in the UNCTAD Shipping Connectivity Index to reach 19th place in the third quarter of 2025.

This marked an improvement from 23rd place in the same period in 2024. Egypt also ranked 23rd globally in the World Economic Forum’s 2024 Ports Efficiency Index. Additionally, the World Bank ranked Port Said first regionally and third globally in the 2024 Container Terminal Performance Index, while Lloyd's Register listed both Port Said and Alexandria among the top 100 ports worldwide for 2025.

In a record-breaking development, Ain Sokhna Port entered the Guinness World Records for the deepest man-made harbor basin on land, reaching a depth of 19 meters.

Despite regional challenges, port traffic showed marked growth in 2024. Cargo handling capacity increased 5.2% to 183 million tons, up from 174 million tons in 2023, while cargo throughput rose 16% to 210 million tons. Ship calls increased by 12.5% to reach 16,200, and container throughput rose 7.1% to 9 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs).

The government has successfully attracted six of the world’s largest shipping lines and seven major operators. Furthermore, an Egyptian-Italian Ro-Ro shipping line now operates between the ports of Damietta and Trieste, further integrating Egypt into European trade routes.

Egypt invested 129 billion Egyptian pounds (EGP) in seaport development between 2014 and 2024, focusing on several key strategic hubs. At Alexandria Port, the EGP 7 billion ""Tahya Misr"" multi-purpose terminal was constructed with a capacity of 12 million to 15 million tons, supported by new transport axes and a modern grain logistics station at berth 3/85.

Meanwhile, East Port Said completed 8.4 kilometers of quays, with an additional 6.2 kilometers currently underway. Notably, the Suez Canal Container Terminal performed the first green fuel refueling operation for ships in Africa and the Middle East in August 2023.

The development plan also extended to the Red Sea and Damietta. Upgrades to Nuweiba and Safaga ports included new warehouses and heavy truck yards totaling nearly EGP 140 million.

At Ain Sokhna, five basins were dredged to a 19-meter depth alongside the construction of 18 kilometers of quays and 30 kilometers of railway lines. Finally, Damietta Port established a new multi-purpose terminal and significant barrier expansions, with a total investment for these projects reaching EGP 4.8 billion.",https://sis.gov.eg//media/705557/605124543-1438123951691354-3357298854046081326-n.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 14:56:45.273438

It allows for shipowners to adapt to the regulation in an environment of scarce availability of alternative fuels.

The EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation has been in force since the beginning of 2025. The aim of the regulation is to cut European maritime greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by encouraging renewable and low-carbon fuel use.

The regulation applies to all ships of 5000 gross t and over calling at EU ports, regardless of their flag. At the end of 2025, shipowners must show that the carbon intensity of the fuel used during the year has reduced by 2%. In time, the required reduction will increase incrementally until it reaches 80% by 2050. Non-compliance results in fines based on GHG emissions.

The good news for gas-powered shipowners is that running ships on LNG mostly covers the emission cuts needed during the first years of the regulation. This is because LNG’s lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions are 20% lower than traditional maritime fuels such as marine gas oil (MGO). However, many other shipowners face concerns about fleet lifespan and compatibility, as well as the availability of alternative fuels as supplies and bunker locations remain limited.

Luckily, the FuelEU Maritime regulation allows shipping companies to voluntarily pool emissions between vessels to support compliance efforts. In this framework, vessels with surplus compliance can offset the GHG intensity requirements of other vessels by sharing compliance.

Emissions may be pooled among two or more ships verified by the same body, including ships managed by different companies, provided certain conditions are met. One requirement is that the total pooled compliance must remain positive; pooling cannot result in a greater deficit after emissions are combined.

To sum up, pooling enables shipowners who have the ability to reduce emissions to also lower emissions on behalf of those who are unable. This benefits everyone – including compliance generators and off-takers as well as the climate.

Bio-LNG use enables generous emission reductions

Pooling can also be offered as a service. This means that the pool of vessels is managed by a third party that ensures that the pool is in balance and all ships within the pool are allocated the right amount of emission reductions required by the regulation at the end of the year. For instance, Nordic energy company, Gasum, offers pooling as a service to all ships calling at EU ports. In Gasum’s pool, designated vessels run on bio-LNG in order to generate compliance on behalf of under-compliant vessels.

Gasum has partnered with shipping companies such as Viking Line and Wallenius Sol to use their LNG-powered vessels as compliance generators in Gasum’s pool by switching the vessels to using bio-LNG.

Transport sector eyeing limited renewable fuel resources

The FuelEU Maritime package is not the only regulatory development shaking up the maritime sector in the coming years. Although decisions were postponed in October 2025, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) still has its own strategy and ambitious targets for reducing maritime emissions globally, with a horizon towards 2028 for the first cuts and a net-zero emission target in 2050.

With continuously tightening regulations, as well as increasing demand for low-emission transports from end customers, demand for biofuels is set to increase dramatically in the maritime sector in coming years. In addition, aviation and land transport are also vying for globally limited renewable fuel resources.

Combining all these factors together, experts estimate that there might be a significant shortage of biofuels and other alternative fuels from 2030 onwards. Faced with this challenge, Gasum has been developing a comprehensive biogas value chain and LNG infrastructure to meet the needs of customers going forward.

Peace of mind with secured bio-LNG availability

Although biofuel availability might limit the capacity and scalability of commercial FuelEU Maritime pools, once a shipowner has signed on to a third-party’s pool, measures can be put in place to guarantee peace of mind. For example, Gasum ensures that customers are always compliant at the end of the verification period – even if this means paying a penalty on behalf of the customer.

For now, pooling is the right answer for shipping companies wanting an easy and reliable way to fulfil the requirements of the regulation. However, during the course of the next 20 years, as the regulation tightens, shipowners need to think about what their strategy will be to tackle the 80% reduction in emissions demanded by 2050.

Under the agreement, the two logistics giants will jointly use 8,900 metric tons of a lower-carbon biofuel, a move expected to cut about 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for ocean freight shipped through DHL’s GoGreen Plus and CMA CGM’s ACT+ programs. The estimated cuts accounts for emissions across the fuel’s entire lifecycle—from production to consumption.

The two companies will use the biofuel UCOME, which stands for used cooking oil methyl ester, as an alternative to traditional fuels. The second-generation biofuel is produced by recycling used cooking oil, instead of growing new crops for fuel.

The joint decarbonization initiative is aimed at helping both companies reach their net-zero GHG emissions targets by 2050.

This initiative is expected to have a trickle-down effect for the European carriers’ customers, enabling them to cut the carbon footprint of their international supply chains.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus service enables customers to select sustainable marine fuel options for their transport, which the company says make room for reductions of up to 80 percent GHG emissions compared to conventional maritime fuel.

“This collaboration marks another milestone in our mission towards low-carbon supply chains,” said Casper Ellerbaek, head of global ocean freight at DHL Global Forwarding, in a statement. “By leveraging sustainable marine fuels, we help our customers achieve their climate goals and drive real progress toward decarbonization.”

CMA CGM’s ACT+ program similarly gives shippers a chance to cut emissions by paying a premium price. The program enables customers to reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments by 10 percent to as much as 83 percent, using low-carbon fuels such as waste-derived biofuels.

As part of the partnership, the French ocean carrier said it would physically bunker the biofuel across its fleet, ensuring that emission reductions correspond to DHL’s “book and claim” approach.

Under book and claim, the buyer books a specific quantity of sustainable fuel at the time of purchase and then claims the emissions reduction toward their sustainability targets. As a result, the buyer owns the environmental benefits without physically possessing the fuel.

“Our partnership with DHL demonstrates how collaboration can accelerate the shift to low-carbon shipping,” said Olivier Nivoix, executive vice president of shipping at CMA CGM Group, in a statement.

According to Nivoix, CMA CGM has cut the carbon intensity of its shipping activities by 57 percent since 2008 due to its heavy investments in alternative fuels and dual-fuel vessels. By 2029, CMA CGM expects its dual-fuel fleet to reach 162 vessels, including 24 powered by methanol.

With the partnership in place, both companies say they will explore more opportunities to scale up lower-carbon fuel usage and develop additional collaborative approaches to decarbonize international supply chains.

CMA CGM has started similar partnerships with shippers in recent years, including a year-long deal with Nike to help the athleticwear giant decarbonize its ocean freight. Through May 2024, Nike transported 36 percent of volume shipped via CMA CGM on one of their vessels using sustainable biofuel. Through the year, Nike reduced their CO2 emissions by 25,000 tons.

The container shipping company has also partnered with Fruit of the Loom, helping the underwear brand cut CO2 emissions by nearly 3,000 tons from January 2023 to March 2024.

In the evolving landscape of maritime decarbonization, few subjects are as timely or arguably as misunderstood as wind-assisted propulsion. Yet the shipping industry finds itself at a decisive moment, driven by regulatory tightening, customer expectations for greener supply chains, and an urgent need to manage escalating fuel costs. Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS), and wingsails in particular, are no longer speculative technologies. They are proven, available, and scalable solutions ready to meet the moment, writes Dr. Lee Kindberg, previously Head of Environment and Sustainability for AP Moller-Maersk (Maersk) in North America, and now a board member at WAPS manufacturer, OceanWings.

Most global shipping companies have long-term multi-faceted strategies to reduce both carbon footprint and other environmental impacts, and for example, container vessels have made significant improvements in efficiency (transport work) since 2005. Their tactics have evolved over the 20+ years since customers initially approached container shipping companies to find ways to measure, report and reduce the carbon footprint of their shipments. In this sector, much of the ""low hanging fruit"" has already been harvested. This includes larger vessels, a variety of energy efficiency retrofits and technologies, and operational changes like slow steaming.

In the last few years shipping companies have built vessels designed from the beginning to operate on cleaner fuels like LNG and methanol at high efficiency and low carbon footprint. They have implemented IT approaches to optimize routing, speeds, drafts and other criteria. Now with IMO’s new performance criteria and reporting, and with the EU’s FuelEU Maritime and Emissions Trading System, more sophisticated engine modifications and data systems are in the works, as are new low carbon fuels and operational measures like just-in-time arrival and shore power.

Reduce Fuel & Carbon

Technologies and operational approaches that reduce fuel consumption also reduce environmental impacts. This is especially true for decarbonization, since fuel savings and low carbon fuels translate directly into reduced greenhouse gases. Wind-assisted propulsion systems reduce the fuel required for voyages and can be retrofitted to existing vessels or installed on new builds. WAPS have the potential for some of the largest savings available to ship owners and operators.

Current and emerging regulations, regional fuel taxes, and carbon prices increase fuel costs for shipowners and operators. New technologies like wingsails are delivering significant fuel savings: as much as 35% in recent real-world fuel studies with OceanWings. As vessels adopt more costly low carbon fuels, achieving fuel savings becomes even more important. The more expensive the fuel, the more money the ship owner can save, and the faster the investment payback. The Canopée vessel’s two-year operational results demonstrated consistent fuel savings of up to 2.2 tonnes per day per wingsail, and 99% wingsail uptime. These are not theoretical models but validated data from daily commercial use, establishing wind propulsion as one of the most effective tools available today.

Any addition of a major new technology requires a change in thinking, in planning and in operational execution. Vessel performance with wingsails can be enhanced with better understanding and use of wind patterns, waves, draft and routing. New training is needed for mariners, shore personnel and Coast Guard. New or modified data systems will also be needed, and experience sharing will become essential as more vessels adopt technologies like wind-assisted propulsion systems.

Demo Tech to Fast Track Adoption

Establishing credibility is a very important factor in the early days of a technology’s introduction. One powerful way that ports, governments and other entities can encourage adoption of new technologies is by establishing technology demonstration programs. A structured technology demonstration program can accelerate adoption by bringing together stakeholders, vessel operators and technology providers, and assisting them in finding financing, technical support and interpretation and communications of the results.

Incentives programs such as those based on the Environmental Ship Index (ESI) and other regional and port programs can also be very impactful. These incentives may include small or larger monetary incentives, recognition of innovation and results, technology demonstration support grants, or ways to assemble collaborative groups to spread both risk and knowledge in early development phases. The new ESI 2.0 is expected to recognize innovative technologies, and new IMO regulations are structured to reward those who innovate or simply use less fuel.

Early movers do need additional support and flexibility. For later stages programs can become more standardized or integrated into regular incentive structures to encourage those second and third movers. In some cases, it actually takes regulation to get the more conservative stakeholders to take action. Any new technology also brings new challenges in safety standards, risk management and insurance. A process to put all these together promptly can facilitate implementation and avoid delays or unplanned costs. Again, this is particularly important at the first mover stage.

Class Developments

Classification societies are instrumental in bridging the gap between innovation and commercial deployment, and it's encouraging to see many WAPS companies making steady progress through constructive engagement with these bodies. Without formal recognition from class, even the most promising technologies can stall. That is why the recent Type Approval Design Certificate (TADC) awarded to OceanWings by DNV represents a key milestone for the WAPS sector.

This certification confirms that the design of the rigid OceanWings system, in both its tiltable and fixed configurations, meets DNV’s rigorous technical and regulatory standards for safety, reliability, and operation. It provides shipowners, yards, and flag states with a streamlined path to implementation. It removes ambiguity, simplifies documentation, and de-risks decision-making for those looking to integrate wind power into their fleets.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/copyright-jifmar-166678.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:57:35.803480

This approach combines the IMO protocol of Resolution MEPC.402(83) for methane slip measurements with an interim procedure for engine load monitoring until international standards are established and integrated into the EU framework. Operators may also apply the same interim solution under EU MRV/ETS.

Why verified methane slip matters

Methane slip from internal combustion engines increases the vessel’s overall CO2-equivalent (CO2eq) emissions. Given that according to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) methane has 25 times the global warming potential (GWP) of CO2, methane slip emissions significantly impact a vessel’s greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. Slip levels depend heavily on the engine’s load, with lower loads generally resulting in higher slip.

High methane slip can erode the GHG advantage of LNG compared to conventional liquid fuels. Engine designers and manufacturers work on reducing methane slip through advanced combustion technologies and after-treatment solutions. However, default methane slip factors (Cslip) used under FEUM are based solely on engine type and may not reflect the improvements achieved through upgrades or optimization.

As FEUM thresholds tighten over the next decade, verified actual methane slip factors can significantly lower penalty exposure and generate compliance surplus. For example, applying actual methane slip emission factors to a 90,000 DWT LNG carrier—with a dual-fuel diesel-electric propulsion system using Otto-cycle medium-speed engines and an emission abatement system achieving a 50% methane slip reduction—could generate over EUR 500,000 annually through pooling arrangements.

Measurement protocol: Test bed and onboard (IMO MEPC.402(83))

Methane slip measurements and calculations—conducted on a test-bed or onboard—must follow IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83) and include the 10% mode point or the lowest mode point at which gas fuel would be used.

Onboard measurements following protocol set out in MEPC.402(83):

Acceptable for an Individual Engine or for an Engine Group represented by the Parent Engine.

Not acceptable for an Engine Family without further justification.

Test-bed measurements following protocol set out in MEPC.402(83):

May be accepted for an Engine Family.

Use of THC as a proxy for methane:

If direct methane measurement is not performed, measurements of total hydrocarbons (THC) performed according to MEPC.402(83) or the NOx Technical Code 2008 (NTC as amended) may be used as a proxy. In that case, the THC measurements should include a 10% mode point or the lowest mode point at which gas fuel would be used.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1972988039.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 05:56:54.098753

By establishing a stable maritime transport route for low-carbon ammonia, MOL and JERA aim to support the early formation of a full-scale ammonia value chain that links production, international transport, and end use in power generation.
When used as a fuel, ammonia does not emit carbon dioxide during combustion, making it an attractive option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
As countries and industries intensify efforts to reduce emissions, demand for low-carbon ammonia is expected to grow substantially across multiple sectors.
Ammonia transport requires advanced vessel design, strict safety standards, and highly trained crews—areas in which MOL already has extensive experience.","Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. (MOL) has announced that it has entered into two Heads of Agreements with JERA Co., Inc. for the time charter of two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) specifically designed to transport ammonia. These agreements represent an important step toward the realization of Japan’s first commercial-scale, low-carbon ammonia transportation project. Under the proposed arrangements, the vessels will carry low-carbon ammonia produced at the Blue Point Complex in Louisiana, United States—an industrial facility in which JERA has invested—to JERA’s Hekinan Thermal Power Station, located in Hekinan City, Aichi Prefecture.

This initiative marks a significant milestone for Japan’s energy transition. By establishing a stable maritime transport route for low-carbon ammonia, MOL and JERA aim to support the early formation of a full-scale ammonia value chain that links production, international transport, and end use in power generation. Discussions between the two companies on cooperation in fuel ammonia transportation have been ongoing since November 2022, and the newly signed Heads of Agreements build on these earlier dialogues. The intent is to move beyond feasibility studies and toward a commercially viable supply chain capable of supporting Japan’s decarbonization ambitions.

Ammonia has traditionally been used as a key raw material in the manufacture of fertilizers and a wide range of chemical products. In recent years, however, it has gained increasing attention as a next-generation clean energy carrier. When used as a fuel, ammonia does not emit carbon dioxide during combustion, making it an attractive option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to its potential role as a fuel for thermal power plants and marine vessels, ammonia is also viewed as an efficient carrier for hydrogen, further enhancing its strategic importance in a low-carbon energy system. As countries and industries intensify efforts to reduce emissions, demand for low-carbon ammonia is expected to grow substantially across multiple sectors.

Within this context, MOL has positioned environmental and sustainability initiatives as a central pillar of its long-term management strategy. Under its management plan, “BLUE ACTION 2035,” the MOL Group has committed to addressing environmental challenges while maintaining competitiveness in global shipping and logistics. Furthermore, through its “MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2,” the company has set a clear objective of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Developing and operating a robust ammonia value chain is seen as a key pathway toward achieving this goal.

By actively participating in large-scale ammonia transport projects, MOL seeks not only to support emerging demand for ammonia as a fuel, but also to strengthen its expertise in the safe and reliable handling of this substance. Ammonia transport requires advanced vessel design, strict safety standards, and highly trained crews—areas in which MOL already has extensive experience. The company plans to leverage this know-how to ensure stable, secure, and efficient maritime transport solutions as global demand for low-carbon fuels increases.

Drawing on its position as one of the world’s largest shipping companies, MOL will continue to expand its portfolio of social infrastructure businesses, technologies, and services centered on marine transportation. Through these efforts, the group aims to respond to the evolving needs of its customers while contributing to global decarbonization. Ultimately, MOL envisions itself as a global social infrastructure company that supports everyday life from the oceans, helps secure a sustainable and prosperous future, and delivers long-term value to all stakeholders.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-29 03:57:08.076910

This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions.","The maritime industry is at the beginning of a major trans- formation. Driven by a continuously evolving regulatory environment, intensifying commercial pressure, and a gen- eral global shift towards reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the transition to net zero is taking shape.

In this context, the Net-Zero Guide (the Guide) provides a structured, practical framework to support shipowners, operators, and managers in developing cost-effective com- pliance strategies while maintaining long-term resilience. The Guide focuses on actionable measures to align fleet operations, investments, and value-chain partnerships with evolving regulatory and market expectations.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and regional bodies such as the European Union (EU) have introduced ambitious decarbonization targets, including net-zero emissions by 2050. This is being underpinned by regulatory frameworks, which are reshaping the industry’s strategic pri- orities. This is currently most prominent in the EU, where the Emissions Trading System (ETS) was extended to shipping in 2024, and the FuelEU Maritime regulation implemented in 2025, promoting the use of low-GHG fuels.

The IMO is attempting to introduce similar legislation on a global scale through the Net-Zero Framework (NZF). While this was approved by members in April 2025, an extraordi- nary session of the IMO’s MEPC in October 2025 decided to delay its adoption by adjourning the meeting for one year. As a result, the earliest potential entry into force is now 1 March 2028.

Maritime decarbonization is being propelled by other influential forces, including pressure from financial institu- tions, expectations from cargo owners, and the growing importance of corporate ESG commitments. While these forces work in different ways, they all make environmental performance a critical determinant for securing access to capital, maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring long- term commercial viability.

Given the ongoing fragmentation and rapid evolution of regulatory and commercial frameworks, compliance require- ments are becoming increasingly complex and costly. This

is particularly challenging for small and medium-sized en- terprises (SMEs), which must navigate overlapping require- ments across jurisdictions and develop holistic strategies that integrate technology adaptation, value-chain transfor- mation, and responsiveness to shifting market dynamics.

As these demands intensify, shipping companies must shift from reactive compliance to proactive transformation. This means developing strategies where regulatory alignment, strategic innovation, and operational performance advance in parallel.

A phased approach to fleet decarbonization is essen- tial, and shipping companies should develop a strategic approach across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. The Guide recommends a three-step framework to help shipping companies translate decarbonization objectives into executable actions across their fleets:

1.Assessment

•Conduct a detailed evaluation of the fleet’s current emissions profile, benchmarking vessel performance against applicable decarbonization frameworks.

•Identify exposure to regulatory requirements across short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons.

•Determine technical and operational gaps, assessing where efficiency upgrades, fuel transitions, or process improvements are required.

2.Strategic planning

•Develop a fleet-wide decarbonization roadmap that integrates operational measures and technical upgrades within a unified planning horizon.

•Prioritize operational measures such as speed optimization, weather routing, and trim and ballast management to deliver near-term efficiency gains.

•Plan technical upgrades – including energy-saving devices, hull coatings, engine retrofits, and alternative-fuel readiness – through a structured cost-benefit assessment.

•Align fleet renewal and retrofit plans with technology readiness, shipyard availability, and regulatory milestones to avoid stranded assets.

3.Implementation and monitoring

•Execute identified measures through a phased programme supported by clear timelines, key performance indicators, and governance structures.

•Employ digital tools and fleet performance monitoring systems to track fuel consumption, emissions, and compliance status in real time.

•Institutionalize a continuous feedback process to refine strategies as regulations and technologies evolve.

The assessment stage establishes a factual baseline and en- ables companies to prioritize resources effectively, ensuring regulatory compliance and informed decisions. Translating this to a robust strategic plan positions companies to meet compliance milestones while preserving commercial flexi- bility and investment efficiency. Once these strategies are executed, embedding data-driven monitoring and adaptive governance enables shipping companies to maintain align- ment with dynamic regulatory environments while building internal capability and resilience.

But decarbonization extends beyond technology, and organizational transformation across the value chain is equally important for the implementation of new technolo- gies and systems.

To manage this transition in an optimal way, maintain safety, and ensure readiness for emerging regulatory frameworks, a structural approach incorporating effective change man- agement and capacity building is key, allowing companies to balance short-term operational efficiency with long-term decarbonization readiness. Marrying this with an effective operational strategy ensures compliance, enhances prof- itability, and prepares companies for future low- and zero- carbon operations.

The Guide proposes an organizational roadmap, in three key domains, which can incorporate all of these elements, ensuring long-term compliance and competitiveness:

1.Fleet renewal and retrofit strategy

•Pursue a dual-pathway approach that combines newbuild programmes incorporating zero- and near-zero (ZNZ) fuel systems with targeted retrofits to extend the operational life of existing assets.

•Engage early with shipyards, designers, and technology suppliers to ensure vessel designs are fuel-ready, accommodating methanol, ammonia or hydrogen systems as infrastructure matures.

•Implement retrofitting programmes to upgrade propulsion systems, install energy-saving devices, and integrate digital monitoring capabilities.

•Coordinate fleet renewal with regulatory checkpoints (2030–2040–2050) and evolving market signals to optimize capital deployment and minimize stranded- asset risk.

2.Fleet operational strategy to net zero

•Optimize vessel operations across the fleet through data- driven voyage planning, fuel management, and emissions monitoring.

•Deploy operational optimization techniques – such as slow steaming, weather routing, port call optimization, and trim and draft optimization – to deliver measurable efficiency gains.

•Adopt phased fuel transition strategies, beginning with drop-in biofuels and progressing to ZNZ fuels such

as green methanol, ammonia, or hydrogen, based on infrastructure readiness.

•Leverage digital platforms for real-time performance tracking and integration of environmental metrics into commercial decisions.

3.Manage change to overcome implementation challenges

•Apply structured Management of Change (MoC) frameworks to address the organizational, technical, and safety implications of adopting new fuels and technologies.

•Strengthen cross-departmental coordination between technical, commercial, and operational teams to ensure consistent implementation of decarbonization measures.

•Invest in crew and shore-based competence development, particularly in fuel handling, safety, and digital systems operation.

•Embed digitalization and cybersecurity as core enablers of compliance, ensuring data integrity and transparency across reporting and performance systems.

To complement internal efforts, external facing practices are equally essential. This should include alignment with external stakeholders across regulatory bodies, commercial partners, and the broader value chain, helping stakeholders to scale decarbonization efforts and unlock commercial value.

Shipping executives should focus on the following strategic priorities, integrating technical, operational, and commer- cial perspectives:

•Embed decarbonization into core business strategy, linking compliance objectives with fleet investment, financing, and chartering models.

•Adopt a lifecycle perspective on fleet management, balancing renewal, retrofit, and operational optimization within a unified investment framework.

•Leverage partnerships across the value chain – including fuel suppliers, ports, financiers, and technology providers – to accelerate innovation and manage risk.

•Invest in digitalization and data governance to enhance performance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term operational efficiency.

•Build organizational capability through structured competence development and robust change management processes that support sustainable growth.

With the regulatory and market environment evolving rapidly, shipping companies must adopt a dynamic, iterative approach to strategic planning. Advances in fuels, propul- sion systems, energy-efficiency technologies, and digitalization continue to unlock new opportunities for emissions

reduction and operational performance. To stay aligned with shifting conditions, structured review cycles, supported by robust data frameworks and performance indicators, are essential for validating strategy effectiveness. Ongoing engagement in policy development and industry forums will help ensure companies remain responsive to future regulatory thresholds and market expectations.

Strategic navigation toward net zero

The decarbonization of global shipping is both a regulatory necessity and a strategic opportunity. Companies that act early – combining robust compliance frameworks with innovation, operational excellence, and collaborative value-chain engagement – will not only meet emerging net-zero requirements but also secure long-term competitiveness in a rapidly transforming maritime economy.

This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions. By integrating internal best practices with external part- nerships and continuous review, companies can build resilience, unlock commercial opportunities, and lead the maritime sector’s green transformation.

European and Asian markets are beginning to factor shipping emissions into procurement decisions, and cargo owners are under pressure to decarbonise their supply chains.
As LNG vessels become more common and alternative fuels edge closer to viability, the question for African ports will be how quickly isolated milestones become routine practice.","On the 26th of December, as cargo operations resumed along Kenya’s Indian Ocean shoreline, a Norwegian-flagged vessel eased into berth number one at the Port of Mombasa after an 11-day voyage from Singapore.

The ship, Höegh Australis, is powered almost entirely by liquefied natural gas, making it the first LNG-fuelled vessel ever to dock at an East African port. Its arrival marked a technical milestone for Kenya Ports Authority and a symbolic moment for a region whose trade arteries have long depended on some of the world’s most carbon-intensive fuels.

The Höegh Australis is a roll-on, roll-off vehicle carrier measuring 200 meters in length and nearly 38 metres across, with space for more than 9,300 vehicles spread over 16 decks. On this call, it discharged 824 vehicles and accessories destined for Kenya and neighboring landlocked markets that rely on Mombasa as their primary maritime gateway, including Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and parts of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The scale of the vessel alone would be notable in any port. That it arrived running on 98 per cent LNG, using conventional bunker fuel only during engine start-up and limited manoeuvres, is what set this visit apart.

LNG-powered ships require different handling protocols, specialized safety procedures and crews familiar with advanced navigation and propulsion systems. The successful berthing demonstrated that Mombasa can meet these demands, an important signal to global shipping lines assessing which African ports are ready for the next phase of maritime transport.

International shipping is under pressure to change; The sector accounts for roughly three per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Maritime Organisation, and new IMO regulations require deep cuts in sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Heavy fuel oil, the industry’s traditional mainstay, is among the dirtiest fuels in commercial use.

LNG does not eliminate emissions, but it reduces sulphur oxides and particulate matter almost entirely, cuts nitrogen oxides by up to 85 per cent and lowers carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 20 per cent compared to conventional marine fuels. For port cities such as Mombasa, Lagos and Durban, where shipping emissions mix with urban pollution, these reductions translate directly into cleaner air.

Globally, more than 1,200 LNG-capable vessels are now in operation or on order, a number that has more than doubled over the past five years. African ports, however, have lagged in accommodating them. South Africa’s Durban and Ngqura ports have invested in shore-side efficiency and cleaner equipment but have yet to see regular LNG vessel calls.

In West Africa, Nigeria has explored LNG bunkering given its gas reserves, yet infrastructure development has been slow. North African ports such as Tangier Med have moved faster on efficiency and automation, but LNG adoption remains limited. Against this backdrop, Mombasa’s ability to receive Höegh Australis places it among a small group of African ports demonstrating readiness for lower-emission shipping.

The ship itself reflects how the industry is hedging its future. Built just a year ago, Höegh Australis is designed to be ammonia-ready, meaning it can be converted to run on zero-carbon fuels once safety standards, supply chains and port infrastructure catch up.

Ammonia-fuelled vessels have begun limited service in parts of Asia and Europe, but costs remain high and global bunkering networks are fragmented. For now, LNG serves as a bridge fuel, allowing shipping companies to meet tightening regulations while buying time for truly carbon-free options to mature.

For Kenya, the implications extend beyond environmental credentials. The Port of Mombasa handles more than 30 million tonnes of cargo annually and supports trade flows worth billions of dollars across East and Central Africa. Shipping efficiency affects everything from vehicle prices in Kampala to food costs in Kigali.

LNG-powered vessels are typically newer, larger and more fuel-efficient, enabling carriers to move more cargo per voyage at lower operating costs. Over time, this can translate into more competitive freight rates and more reliable services for African importers and exporters.

Kenya Ports Authority has framed the call within its Green Port Policy, which aligns with national clean energy objectives and Kenya’s broader climate commitments. In recent years, KPA has invested in electric rubber-tyred gantry cranes, energy-efficient lighting and digital traffic management to reduce congestion and emissions within the port.

According to KPA data, operational efficiency improvements have already cut vessel waiting times by more than 30 per cent over the past decade, reducing fuel burn at anchorage. Accommodating LNG vessels builds on these gains, shifting part of the emissions reduction upstream to the ships themselves.

Across Africa, ports are grappling with how to modernise under fiscal constraints while trade volumes continue to grow. The African Development Bank estimates that the continent needs more than $100 billion in port and logistics investment over the next decade to keep pace with demand. Sustainability is no longer a side consideration in that calculus.

European and Asian markets are beginning to factor shipping emissions into procurement decisions, and cargo owners are under pressure to decarbonise their supply chains. Ports that cannot service cleaner vessels risk being bypassed.

The arrival of Höegh Australis does not resolve these challenges, nor does it place Mombasa at the forefront of zero-carbon shipping. What it does show is that parts of Africa’s maritime system are beginning to adapt in step with global change rather than after it.

As LNG vessels become more common and alternative fuels edge closer to viability, the question for African ports will be how quickly isolated milestones become routine practice. On a quiet December morning in Mombasa, that transition moved from theory to steel, fuel lines and a ship safely alongside the quay.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-27-122541.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 18:56:27.366143

The research draws on contributions from national institutions such as the Agence Nationale des Ports, Tanger Med Special Agency, the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen), and the Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN), alongside international partners including PROBLUE and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility. Together, these actors explore how Morocco’s ports can evolve from traditional trade gateways into engines of a new clean-energy economy.

Why Shipping and Hydrogen Are Changing Everything

International shipping is under growing pressure to cut emissions. Responsible for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gases, the sector is now subject to firm climate rules set by the International Maritime Organization, which aims for net-zero emissions by or around 2050. In parallel, the European Union has extended its carbon market to shipping and introduced fuel rules that favor low-carbon alternatives. These policies are expected to make fossil fuels steadily more expensive while pushing shipowners toward new fuels. Green hydrogen, converted into ammonia or methanol, is widely seen as one of the few viable options to decarbonize long-distance shipping, as well as other hard-to-abate sectors such as fertilizers, steel, and aviation.

Morocco’s Natural Advantage in Green Hydrogen

The report argues that Morocco is exceptionally well placed to benefit from this shift. Its strong solar and wind resources allow it to produce renewable electricity at very low cost, which is the main driver of green hydrogen prices. Morocco is also close to Europe, which is expected to become the world’s largest importer of green hydrogen, and it has a long coastline with multiple ports open to global trade. These factors together give Morocco a structural advantage over many competitors. However, the study stresses that cheap production alone is not enough. The success of green hydrogen depends on the full value chain, including storage, transport, port handling, and reliable demand from ships and industry.

Four Ports, Four Different Strengths

To understand how this value chain could work in practice, the report assesses four port locations. Tanger Med, at the Strait of Gibraltar, stands out as Morocco’s main bunkering hub. Its position on major shipping routes means it can supply green fuels not only to ships calling at the port, but also to vessels passing through the Mediterranean and Atlantic corridors. However, limited space makes large-scale hydrogen production there difficult. Mohammedia, near Casablanca, has a different advantage: nearby salt caverns that could be used for low-cost hydrogen storage, helping stabilize supply across the system. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco’s largest industrial port, already handles large volumes of ammonia and is closely linked to fertilizer and steel production, making it ideal for domestic hydrogen use. Tan-Tan, in southern Morocco, emerges as the most promising production site thanks to excellent renewable resources and available land, even though it would require major new investments and skills development.

A Connected System and the Role of Policy

Rather than developing each port in isolation, the report proposes an integrated “Lighthouse Scenario.” In this vision, green hydrogen would be produced at scale near Tan-Tan, transported by pipeline to Mohammedia for storage, distributed to Jorf Lasfar for industry, and supplied to Tanger Med for ship bunkering and exports. This coordinated approach could significantly reduce costs compared to fragmented development. Still, green fuels remain much more expensive than fossil fuels today. Closing this gap will require strong policy support, including international carbon pricing, clear national safety rules, shared infrastructure, concessional finance, and early pilot projects such as a green bunkering trial at Tanger Med.

Gateway to Green Energy presents Morocco’s ports as more than logistical assets. With the right coordination and regulation, they could become strategic hubs linking renewable energy, global trade, and industrial transformation, allowing Morocco to turn climate action into long-term economic opportunity.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/24_12_2025_10_03_33_5222196.png?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-12-28 00:12:09.950381
