The goal, he explained, is to foster operational and financial efficiency while improving service delivery for cruise and cargo partners alike.
“The regulatory tsunami of IMO 2027 and the EU Emissions Trading System is both a challenge and an opportunity,” Telemaque said.
Telemaque explained that the initiative is not a “sustainability campaign” but a strategic business platform designed to align environmental necessity with economic opportunity.
He told Antigua.news that cruise lines are under pressure to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, a costly shift made more difficult by the limited availability of viable alternatives.","Port Manager Darwin Telemaque, who also serves as Chairman of the Port Management Association of the Caribbean (PMAC), has unveiled a bold new framework designed to redefine how cruise lines and Caribbean ports work together in the era of decarbonization and environmental accountability

Delivering his remarks at the just concluded conference in Miami, under the theme “A Joint Development Pathway: A New Framework for Partnership Between Cruise Lines and Caribbean Ports,” Telemaque described a strategic shift from competition to collaboration — a “shared pathway” built on transparency, green infrastructure, and measurable climate progress.

Telemaque said that PMAC, which now represents 22 ports across 21 Caribbean states, must become the central hub for maritime governance and innovation in the region. The goal, he explained, is to foster operational and financial efficiency while improving service delivery for cruise and cargo partners alike.

He emphasized that the maritime landscape has shifted dramatically under new International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations — particularly the 2027 global carbon pricing framework — and urged regional ports to act collectively rather than individually.

“The regulatory tsunami of IMO 2027 and the EU Emissions Trading System is both a challenge and an opportunity,” Telemaque said.

“It’s time for ports and cruise lines to align on a unified decarbonization strategy that turns compliance costs into commercial value.”

A centerpiece of Telemaque’s address was the Inclusive GreenPort Resilience Infrastructure & Decarbonization (InGRED) Programme — a multi-billion-dollar regional platform to transform Caribbean ports from traditional gateways into next-generation energy and data hubs.

Telemaque explained that the initiative is not a “sustainability campaign” but a strategic business platform designed to align environmental necessity with economic opportunity.

Highlighting the importance of accountability, Telemaque presented PMAC’s AI-powered MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) platform — a real-time digital system tracking vessel emissions, energy consumption, and carbon reduction progress.

“This is not a promise; it’s a working system,” he noted. “It transforms PMAC from a traditional association into a strategic, data-driven partner that cruise lines can trust.”

Meanwhile Telemaque said cruise executives responded enthusiastically to discussions on the Joint Development Pathway, describing it as a timely and collaborative approach to the major challenges created by the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

He told Antigua.news that cruise lines are under pressure to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, a costly shift made more difficult by the limited availability of viable alternatives.

The proposed framework, he said, aims to help both ports and ship owners jointly navigate this transition by developing essential infrastructure such as shore power systems, new fuel options, and regional logistics networks to support the change.

For Antigua, Telemaque noted that cruise lines have reaffirmed their need for expanded port services, including provisioning, shore power, LNG bunkering, blended biofuels, regular fuel supply, waste removal (with potential for waste-to-energy conversion), and hull-cleaning technology — all critical to meeting the evolving environmental and operational standards of the global cruise industry.",https://antigua.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Multi-Template-Whiteboard-13-1-e1762978296837.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 15:56:36.029942

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez spoke at one of the first side events at the United Nations climate negotiations this week on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The side event discussed the shipping industry’s efforts to slash carbon pollution by cutting back on fossil fuels.

Maritime nations were about to adopt the first global carbon fee on shipping last month at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates the international industry. They had already agreed on the regulations in April, so adopting them was widely expected to be a formality.

But after much pressure from U.S. President Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates postponed the decision for a year. Trump said then that the U.S. “will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Plan to slash emissions postponed

The regulations — or “Net-Zero Framework” — would have set a marine fuel standard that decreases the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from shipping fuels over time. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. That makes them a significant cause of climate change. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told the Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations skipping the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn’t judge the IMO for October’s setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given “how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don’t think the IMO stops there, because we don’t,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early to go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states [and] sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Hopes for future shipping fee remain

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez’s opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,” it is “equally important to take a cool-headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

“We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition,” he said. “We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.”

Shipping can go pollution free, said Andrew Forrest of Fortescue, the Australian green technology, energy and metals company, during the IMO side event.

“We’re not woke, we’re not green,” Forrest said. “We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e26837/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4059x2131+0+288/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2F28%2Fbcb9ed1840da80ce878478ebb5cb%2Fc206320dbda6494eb5340f660c52e5e6.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:56:29.349852

Uncertainty has dominated shipping over the past decade, from the 2016 Hanjin bankruptcy to Covid. This year was no exception. Will 2026 prove calmer for shipping? As the head of an international freight forwarding company for 25 years, I am in a unique position to foresee developments in shipping and offer trends I believe will dominate next year.

Geopolitical Events

Geopolitical events have affected shipping this year, and in 2026, there are several developments worth watching.

The “Red Sea crisis” of ships attacked in the Red Sea by Yemen-based Houthi rebels has been ongoing since the 10/7 Hamas attacks on Israel. The attacks continued throughout 2025. Ships have re-routed around Africa, rather than through the Red Sea. With a ceasefire, shipping will again become quicker.

Pay attention to tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as any military conflict between the countries could shut the Strait of Hormuz, used to deliver oil and roil shipping.

Tensions with Russia are also a threat. The war in Ukraine has affected commodities such as grain and oil. There was some progress toward a deal to protect Black Sea ships, but only an end to the war will bring safety to ships in the Black Sea.

U.S. Trade Policy

U.S. tariffs imposed on foreign nations have dominated shipping. As the Trump administration imposed tariffs on allies and foes, shipping became more expensive for many. A big question for 2026 is whether these tariffs will continue or end if trade deals are reached with countries. The end of the so-called de minimis exemption signaled a large cost increase on shippers.

In April, the Trump administration announced it would impose a new penalty for Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports, starting in October 2025. The policy assesses fees against Chinese-made vessels calling U.S. ports—another cost that will be passed to shippers in 2026. The U.S. is trying to reduce China’s shipbuilding dominance.

Tariffs also drive uncertainty. Small to mid-size importers and businesses will likely be most affected, meaning many small to mid-size companies would go under or be acquired if tariffs remain. If the U.S. economy experiences a recession in 2026, Trump could pare back tariffs to stimulate the economy.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI advancement is the major story of 2025. Companies have joined the race for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and developed tools that have been rolled out by companies, including in shipping and logistics. There are questions about whether AI is ready to replace humans. In 2026, AI will see further advancements and be further applied to shipping, whether for customs enforcement or document compliance.

Shipping Consolidation

Over the past decade, shipping companies have consolidated into “alliances” to pool resources, build resilience and increase profitability. In 2025, a major change occurred as Maersk and MSC’s 2M Alliance ended in February. Maersk partnered with Hapag-Lloyd in a new Gemini Cooperation alliance. Other alliances such as the Ocean Alliance between CMA CGM, Cosco, OOCL and Evergreen remain.

In 2026—a decade since the Hanjin bankruptcy—shippers will likely re-evaluate whether the alliances work. Transformations in alliances would impact rates, schedule reliability and deliverability.

Cleaner Ships And Sustainability

In 2025, shipping and logistics made progress on a clean-emissions deal as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a fuel-emissions framework. The IMO’s “Net-Zero Framework” has faced opposition from the U.S. and others, risking the proposed October 2025 adoption date. In 2026, pressure will likely remain on the largest economies to reach a shipping emissions deal. China has emerged as a key party in the fight against climate change, and China’s shipping industry will likely be part of any solution.

Sustainability has become a key part of shipping companies’ strategic plans, and much progress has come from the private sector rather than world governments. That is likely to continue and increase the pressure on the U.S. and others.

Automation Of Shipping Vessels

Autonomous ships are now a reality for an increasing number of shipping companies. The IMO is developing a regulatory framework for governing autonomous ships. In 2022, the MV Yara Birkeland became the world’s first autonomous cargo ship in service, transporting fertilizer.

In 2026, more autonomous ships are likely to enter service. With advances in AI, these ships are likely to be safer, more efficient and smarter. The U.S. Navy is even considering commissioning autonomous vessels for maritime transport. Whether the shipping industry will embrace autonomous technology or push back due to worker concerns is unknown.

Another Inventory Imbalance

Following the Covid pandemic, there was an inventory imbalance with too much inventory being front-loaded and container ships being empty. Carriers cancelled routes, which resulted in higher prices. Based on my industry knowledge, the opposite is happening. Inventory levels for businesses are depleted. Businesses will need to replenish inventory, which would increase costs on businesses already facing higher, across-the-board costs. Companies’ sales will likely decrease if higher costs from tariffs and other issues prevent them from sending inventory.

These higher costs should initially arise during the fourth quarter of 2025, with the full effects visible by the first quarter. That could force the U.S. government to re-evaluate its tariff position. The Federal Reserve may also intervene, but it remains to be seen whether interest rates will be changed due to inflationary pressures.

A Calmer 2026

I see the uncertainty in shipping personally. Customers have faced more expensive shipping costs, more regulatory hurdles and uncertainty throughout 2025. I see a lot of potential for 2026. Breakthroughs in technology and emissions standards, as well as positive developments in geopolitical events, offer hope for a calmer shipping and logistics industry after a volatile decade. Let’s hope for calmer seas in 2026.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/69122107f4c541276aad9bcf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-12 11:57:45.211451

Furthermore, there are risks to energy infrastructure arising from vulnerabilities in the digital world: as energy systems have become increasingly electrified, integrated and connected, their vulnerability to cyberattacks has increased.

Against this background, governments face a difficult balancing act as they seek to manage potential trade-offs while trying to align as far as possible the goals of energy security, energy transitions, supply chain security, affordability and industrial policy.

The approaches they take and the results they achieve will have a critical bearing on the outlook for energy.

When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once – a situation that calls for the same spirit and focus that governments showed when they created the IEA after the 1973 oil shock.

…said Fatih Birol, Executive Director, IEA.

Shipping activity increased by almost 30% in the 2015 to 2024 period. Thanks in large part to efficiency gains, oil demand rose by much less, just under 5% to 5 mb/d in 2024. In the CPS, projected changes in patterns of trade mean that growth in shipping activity slows, but shipping tonne-kilometres still rise by a further 15% by 2035, and oil demand increases by another 3%.

Although turnover in the shipping fleet remains gradual, more LNG-powered ships enter the fleet, and the fuel mix adjusts to meet the requirements of FuelEU maritime regulation in the European Union. As a result, the share of oil in shipping drops from more than 90% in 2024 to around 80% in 2035, and the share of LNG rises to nearly 15%. Some energy efficiency technologies that offer a positive return on investment are introduced for new ships. This leads to a 4% decline in shipping energy use per tonne-kilometre by 2035 in the CPS.

The new systems, PILOT (Platform for Insightful LOw-emission Transitions) and POWER (Performance evaluation for Operational characteristics, Weather & aging Effect and fuel consumption Review), enable shipowners to adopt data-driven approaches to decarbonization as the maritime industry faces increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.

KR said the launch comes as the European Union’s greenhouse gas regulations – the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), and FuelEU Maritime – are already in force, while the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework remains under discussion.

The uncertain regulatory environment has prompted ship operators to seek practical tools to evaluate emission-reduction options based on both technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness.

“The shipping industry is facing the dual challenge of establishing practical emission-reduction strategies while improving operational efficiency under a changing regulatory environment,” KR chairman and chief executive officer Lee Hyungchul said in an emailed press release.

“PILOT and POWER embody KR’s accumulated expertise and data-driven analytical capabilities, providing shipowners intelligence that enables informed decisions and promotes the sustainable development of the maritime sector,” he said.

PILOT allows users to design and assess customized greenhouse gas reduction scenarios using each vessel’s technical specifications and operational data.

The platform automatically calculates vessel-specific emissions and compliance costs based on data reported to the IMO and the EU, while analyzing the cost-benefit of introducing energy-saving devices and alternative fuels. It also supports the development of long-term emission strategies by simulating future regulatory scenarios.

POWER provides ship operators with real-time insights into vessel performance and fuel efficiency.

By analyzing Automatic Identification System data alongside weather and ocean conditions, POWER helps identify operational inefficiencies and supports the development of optimized voyage strategies.

Both KR-PILOT and KR-POWER are now available through the organization’s integrated digital service platform, KR-DAON.",https://portcalls.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Korean-Register-Pilot-Power-.png,N,,2025-11-12 11:57:57.988402

Shipping alliances restructured significantly in February 2025. The Ocean Alliance now leads with the largest fleet and strongest orderbooks, while MSC maintains the second-largest capacity while operating independently. The Gemini Cooperation emerges as a new powerhouse with a hub-focused network as the Premier Alliance remains much smaller, offering targeted direct-port services through February 2030.

Since February 2025, the container shipping industry has undergone significant restructuring among the major ocean carrier alliances.

Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have formed a new partnership known as the Gemini Cooperation, marking a major realignment in global carrier synergies. Meanwhile, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Yang Ming, and HMM—the remaining members of the former THE Alliance—have continued their collaboration under the new name Premium Alliance, while the Ocean Alliance, comprising CMA CGM, Evergreen, COSCO, and its subsidiary OOCL, has remained unchanged.

At the same time, MSC, the world’s largest ocean carrier in terms of TEU capacity, has opted to operate independently, pursuing a standalone strategy that has drawn considerable attention across the industry.

As a result, the new alliances, as well as MSC, are now defining the rules of global shipping.

While the box carriers do not deploy their entire vessel fleets within their respective alliance services, it is worth examining the total TEU capacities of each alliance, as this provides a broader picture of the market dynamics and the potential strength of each partnership.

Ocean Alliance Dominates with Largest Fleet and Orders

The Ocean Alliance is now the most dominant container alliance, with a total capacity of over 9.5 million TEUs. Both CMA CGM and COSCO, the most powerful members of the partnership, have strong orderbooks and are expected to receive around 3 million TEUs combined in the coming months and years.

In particular, CMA CGM has commissioned around 130 new buildings totalling over 1.7 million TEUs, COSCO is set to receive more than 80 vessels with a combined capacity of approximately 1.2 million TEUs, while Evergreen’s orderbook includes over 40 box ships with a total capacity of about 660,000 TEUs. The vast fleet, along with their established network—since the Ocean Alliance has been active since 2017—positions it well to retain a leading role in the market.

MSC Expands Capacity Despite Going Solo

Although operating independently, MSC has developed its fleet to a level that makes it the second-largest shipping player, with container ships capable of moving more than 7 million TEUs.

MSC’s strong fleet has been the backbone of its strategic decision to remain independent, allowing the company to be flexible and offer over 1,500 direct port combinations, providing clients with a wide range of choices. It is also important to note that MSC has by far the strongest orderbook among its competitors, expecting to receive more than 2.1 million TEUs in the near future.

Gemini Cooperation Backed by Hub-Focused Network

Gemini is emerging as a new powerhouse in the industry, following the decision of Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd to join forces and form an alliance with a combined capacity of over 7 million TEUs.

The Gemini Cooperation is supported by Maersk’s extensive port and terminal network, operated through Maersk’s subsidiary APM Terminals, and has chosen a hub-focused network approach in contrast to MSC’s direct-connection strategy.

Both Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have relatively smaller orderbooks compared to the other major container lines, with approximately 810,000 and 390,000 TEUs respectively.

Smaller Premier Alliance Set to Operate Through 2030

ONE, HMM and Yang Ming have decided to continue their collaboration, forming a shipping group – the Premier Alliance – with a combined capacity of around 3.8 million TEUs—significantly smaller compared to their competitors in terms of total capacity.

This tripartite alliance provides end-to-end direct port container services to customers across both the Transpacific and Asia–Europe trades, with their agreement set to last until February 2030.

The combined orderbook of the three companies barely exceeds 1 million TEUs with ONE leading the pack having ordered more than 50 vessels featuring an overall container capacity of over 630,000 TEUs, while HMM and Yang Ming have ordered 16 and 18 ships with around 190,000 and 240,000 TEUs respectively.",https://www.czapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0b107625-db75-452e-a4ab-e5e80e5501b1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:58:06.386616

However, older vessels and the parallel fleet continue generating substantial profits, which explains why secondhand vessels command prices disproportionate to their age.” Bahri Week: Shipping at Crossroads This year’s Bahri Week demonstrated that shipping stands at a crucial crossroads.

As one participant noted about Dubai and the region: “The region is experiencing a resurrection, becoming an increasingly important crossroads for global trade and shipping.” This year’s Bahri Week proved that shipping is at a crucial crossroads.
Industry leaders are calling for realism in the green transition, peace for trade to flourish, and investments to secure the future of the maritime economy.","Hundreds of executives and entrepreneurs from the global shipping world gathered in Dubai over the past few days, where on Saturday, November 8, Bahri Week officially began—an event lasting five to six days that has evolved into one of the most important annual events in the tanker sector.

Approximately 5,000 visitors are estimated to have traveled to Dubai for the event, which many call the “Posidonia of tankers,” comparing it to the major Greek shipping exhibition held every two years in Athens.

Of particular interest during this year’s Bahri Week was the Capital Link Forum, held on Tuesday, with the participation of leading figures in international shipping: Evangelos Marinakis, founder and chairman of Capital Maritime & Trading; Ahmed Ali Alsubaey, CEO of Bahri Group; Lois Zabrocky, CEO of International Seaways; and George Prokopiou, founder of Dynacom Tankers Management.

Evangelos Marinakis’s proposal caused a sensation among the discussion participants—and was applauded by the audience—calling for a temporary lifting of sanctions for a period, aimed at enabling the disposal of many old vessels belonging to the so-called “shadow tanker fleet,” which poses a serious threat to the environment.

The IMO Regulation Postponement

The first topic of discussion was the one-year postponement of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) vote regarding the new framework for zero emissions balance.

The moderator asked whether this represents “a steady stance” or “a restart from zero” aimed at formulating a new proposal.

Evangelos Marinakis focused on the failure of international organizations to arrive at implementable solutions:

“We have our views. They may be different. It is not a matter of disagreement. It is a matter of how each of us perceives our responsibilities and what we need to do as leaders in our industry. Because of the number of ships we operate and the volume of cargo we transport. Over the past ten years, there have been a lot of discussions within the IMO, the committees of the Greek Shipowners Association, Norwegian Shipowners Association, European Associations, and with our classification societies regarding efforts to reduce emissions. But the problem begins when disagreements lead us to find compromises. So at the end of the day, the compromise reached allows us to continue using our vessels but we will be penalized with taxes that the European countries will be receiving. So, in this way, we do not solve our environmental problem. It is like paying someone to die happier. It does not make sense. Mr. Prokopiou has consistently advocated for slow steaming, which produces a result: reduced emissions. The only increase is in transportation time, but we see a benefit to the environment. This is a matter of fact. Being penalized with high taxation for vessel use does not solve the problem.”

Mr. Marinakis added:

“They resorted to this measure because they could not agree on the basics in the first place. This is the reality. Another reality is Mr. Trump’s election. From the beginning, he has been radical regarding green discussions and transitions. By campaigning for countries not to vote for this taxation, we saw some European countries—Greece and Cyprus—change their position at the last minute, resulting in postponement. What I think we should do is compromise but agree on measures that will have an immediate effect on our environment. We have at least a year ahead to engage in constructive discussions and find a solution. That is how I see it from my point of view. Having seen these regulations and deadlines, we invested a lot—not in $10,000 ‘LNG ready’ certificates, but in proper LNG dual-fuel vessels, over 30 ships. We have paid a significant premium. And this is now delayed. But when the LNG market stabilizes and new production comes online, LNG prices will be lower. It will make sense to consume LNG irrespective of the emission reductions. This is my view on your question.”

Industry Realism & Green Transition

George Prokopiou was clear about his position: “I was convinced this would not pass because it is absurd to penalize someone for not using fuels that don’t exist. How can you penalize somebody for something that does not exist?”

He went on to explain the financial implications: “A Suezmax costs $75-80 million, yet during its lifespan, the vessel would incur $240 million in penalties—three times the ship’s value on top of the initial cost. Nobody can bear such costs except the consumer, which will increase inflation and poverty while reducing living standards.”

He emphasized the industry’s limited role in global pollution: “Shipping is responsible for only 2.5% of world pollution. Why don’t we focus on what causes the other 97.5% first?”

Prokopiou stressed that shipowners are being unfairly targeted: “We are not engine builders or shipyards. We are the taxi drivers—the users, not the fuel makers. The refineries and energy companies produce the fuel. The surest way to discredit an organization is to issue rules that cannot be implemented.”

He expressed confusion about certain countries’ positions: “I cannot understand why the Norwegians and other northern countries favor this net zero framework so strongly. I have yet to receive a satisfactory explanation.”

Emphasizing the practical approach of family companies, he concluded: “We are a family company. We strive for excellence and care about leaving a better environment for our children and grandchildren, but we must pursue what is possible, not just what is desirable.”

Lois Zabrocky emphasized that the industry has already demonstrated its commitment: “Looking at the order book, we’re talking about over $70 billion in real investment. The industry is not reluctant—we’re stepping up and doing our duty. However, we need the technology to be ready for us. Once fees are collected, there must be effective utilization of these funds, which currently lacks a clear framework.”

She expressed confidence in the industry’s ability to adapt, though with realistic expectations: “We’re accustomed to overcoming obstacles—delivering oil and containers despite every challenge thrown at us. I believe we will decarbonize, but it will take longer than idealists anticipate.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey emphasized the industry’s proactive approach: “Regardless of regulations, we will invest in the safest possible vessels using the best available technology. Nobody wants to invest in what was available five years ago—we want what’s available today, and we do this without mandates because we genuinely care about this blue planet. My hope is that future negotiations will not produce rules that appear environmentally friendly but are actually environmentally damaging. Shipping has always been at the forefront of pushing toward cleaner and safer operations. When we meet with regulators, we need something practical and achievable that allows us to demonstrate our genuine commitment to environmental protection.”

Call to Scrap the Dark Fleet

Marinakis specifically addressed the creation of the so-called “shadow fleet,” a result of geopolitical tensions:

“I would like to make another point. This starts from geopolitics, because of the wars between Ukraine and Russia, conflicts in the Middle East in the past involving Iran, and the situation in Venezuela with its sanctions. Previously, we talked about net zero. All the discussion is about keeping our seas clean. There have been a lot of discussions, legislation, and expenses from all of us in order to maintain our seas clean. At the same time we have politicians discuss sanctions and also talking about peace. When I entered the conference room, there was a discussion with Anil Sharma regarding the dark fleet and sanctioned fleet. We have allowed all this time over 1,500 ships to operate—876 are already sanctioned. They don’t have insurance, proper crews, and adequate maintenance. We have seen also many incidents and accidents in the past 12 months involving these vessels in the Suez Canal, the Baltic, and collisions in Singapore. As an industry, we need to urge the US administration and Europe to immediately grant permission for these sanctioned vessels to be scrapped without further delay. India can receive vessels for scrap because they have not sanctioned these vessels.”

Mr. Marinakis continued:

“Owners cannot be paid to scrap their vessels, because they are sanctioned and alternative payment methods must be found. If we immediately obtain a waiver for the next 2-3 months at least to reduce this sanctioned dark fleet, it will help a lot the industry while significantly reducing unlawful trade. We spend time, effort, and money on issues with minimal impact on pollution. At the same time we allow fundamental problems to persist. It doesn’t make sense. We must make a concerted effort to send a strong message to provide this waiver immediately, so that we can eliminate this fleet. I don’t need to add anything more. Of course we like peace. We want peace. And at the end of the day, we look forward to peace.”

Dark Fleet Scrapping Projections

When asked about potential scrapping if sanctions were lifted, Marinakis estimated:

“At least 25% will proceed with scrapping, as many ships can barely operate. These vessels are used for trade with significant risk. Anil is the appropriate person to address this question, but from our observations, at least 25%—which represents many ships—will be scrapped. This will create a significant market impact.”

Dr. Anil Sharma commented: “It will be a way out for them. I think definitely if the licenses are given, there will be a flood of ships that are coming in because some of them are indeed unsafe and face insurance issues”.

When asked about the time frame, Marinakis added: “The time limit will help this. They will know they have three months and they will go for it.”

Prokopiou also stressed that it is important to “put a time limit within the next three months” as an incentive.

The Call for Peace

George Prokopiou emphasized the fundamental connection between peace and prosperity: “The best way to improve living standards is peace. When peace prevails, trade flourishes, and 90% of globalization occurs through shipping. Geopolitics remains one of the most unpredictable factors—nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. But if we must bet on something, we should bet on peace, not war.”

Prokopiou also challenged the terminology used for sanctioned vessels: “The term ‘dark fleet’ is misleading. It’s not dark—it’s a parallel fleet operating at different cost levels. Instead of penalizing Russia, we’re effectively providing them with cheaper transportation.”

Lois Zabrocky stressed the importance of free trade: “We thrive in an environment of open and free trade. Protectionism and tariff walls are not optimal scenarios for our industry. The Trump administration appears to believe that applying significant pressure can create peace.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey underscored the essential nature of shipping: “Without open and free trade, there is no long-term sustainability for any business. I always emphasize, particularly to the ladies in the audience, that without shipping there’s no shopping. We need to convince even protectionists that free trade must prosper again as it did in the past. I believe we’re approaching that point.”

Middle East Investment Opportunities

The discussion extended to the future of the United Arab Emirates and the broader Middle East region.

Marinakis expressed optimism about regional stability:

“Over the past 40 years, the region has experienced numerous wars—Iraq, Iran, the Kuwait invasion, and ongoing troubles in Syria and Lebanon. With such instability, it has been difficult to invest more or do things that we have seen recently. But the situation is now stabilizing. The threat from Iraq has diminished, Iran also has not been as aggressive as in the past. Solutions have been found in Syria and the surrounding region. Now is the time to expand and make real investments that were maybe postponed in previous years. This region has all the fundamentals necessary for much more investment and infrastructure progress. We are happy to be here, to do repeat business with friends and partners and to increase our activities in the region.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey highlighted the region’s strategic importance: “The Arabian Gulf has always been central to shipping, from the Silk Road to the Spice Route. Today it continues to serve as a crucial crossroads. If geopolitical conditions improve, we will witness a renaissance for the region. As the second fastest-growing economy after India and China, the Middle East sits at the intersection of global economies. That’s why I’m confident shipping will return strongly to this region.”

George Prokopiou noted the ongoing transformation: “Something very special is happening in this region in terms of investments.”

He also advocated for pragmatic energy solutions: “We shouldn’t fear oil—it will remain relevant. Carbon capture technology offers the solution. Capturing 50% of emissions would be sufficient. We have the infrastructure, refining capacity, and distribution networks. We should utilize them while making energy affordable globally.”

Lois Zabrocky observed market dynamics: “OPEC is beginning to reclaim market share, and regional countries are working intensively to achieve peace—a critical and valuable role.”

Newbuilding Market Outlook

The panel concluded with discussions about vessel orders and market conditions.

Marinakis acknowledged his position:

“Regarding newbuilding risks, we may be the wrong people to ask, as we have 100 vessels on order. We are obliged to be optimistic. And we are optimistic by nature, and we believe in the market. There are a lot of needs, more stability, and growth opportunities. As far as the newbuildings are concerned, the industry needs these vessels. If we have also significant progress with the dark fleet issue and scrapping of vessels delayed by market conditions and illegal trade, there is room to accommodate newbuildings. We are quite optimistic. We live in an inflationary environment where prices do not seem to go down. All costs have increased, and I do not see any immediate price reductions. We are optimistic that ships are needed for growth. Additionally, our new vessel orders are significantly more economical. This benefits both the environment and emissions reduction. Answering your question, yes, we are optimistic. We expect prices to remain high for a significant amount of time.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey offered a succinct philosophy: “Donald Trump says ‘drill, baby, drill.’ I say ‘build, baby, build.’ When regulations change, you need ships on order.”

Lois Zabrocky described International Seaways’ strategy: “We’ve renewed our MR fleet while selling older vessels and taking delivery of new LR1s. We recently purchased a secondhand VLCC. While new vessels are preferable, we’re constantly working to upgrade our fleet through various means.”

George Prokopiou acknowledged the complexity of market predictions: “This is the most difficult question, and certainty is impossible. Shipyards are fully booked through 2029. Predicting conditions four years ahead requires exceptional foresight. A financial crisis could disrupt everything, particularly if tariffs backfire.”

He emphasized efficiency gains: “Every newer vessel is more efficient. Fuel represents our largest expense, so a 30-35% reduction is significantly advantageous. However, older vessels and the parallel fleet continue generating substantial profits, which explains why secondhand vessels command prices disproportionate to their age.”

This year’s Bahri Week demonstrated that shipping stands at a crucial crossroads. Industry leaders are calling for pragmatic approaches to the green transition, peace to enable trade prosperity, and strategic investments to secure the maritime economy’s future.

As leaders and delegates from around the world have gathered in Belém, Brazil, for the COP30 to engage in climate talks, the Industrial Transition Accelerator (ITA) and Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) announced that clean industry is entering a new phase of momentum, with 1,001 commercial-scale projects now recorded across all stages of development. This marks strong growth across multiple sectors and regions despite ongoing geopolitical headwinds.

New data published in MPP’s Global Project Tracker, supported by the ITA, reveals 144 commercial-scale projects worldwide have now reached final investment decision (FID). Of these, 82 are operational and 62 have secured funding, spanning the most energy-intensive sectors: aluminium, cement, chemicals, fuels for aviation and shipping and steel.

In shipping, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) target of 5% clean fuel uptake by 2030 has spurred a wave of new ammonia and methanol projects from Singapore to Brazil, projects expected to accelerate once the IMO finalizes its net-zero framework.

Progress in the ammonia and methanol industries are especially significant, as both are expected to drive down the cost of clean hydrogen production. As prices fall, clean fertiliser could soon undercut conventional ‘grey’ production – a shift with major implications for food and energy security in import-dependent countries such as India and Brazil.

These same investments are also laying the groundwork for a broader clean hydrogen economy that will underpin industrial competitiveness worldwide. However, while existing and anticipated policies are driving demand in fuels, it remains limited in other sectors.

It’s taken nearly a decade to reach this point. With a record number of operational and under construction plants across all sectors, clean industry is no longer a vision for the future, it is a burgeoning opportunity we can speed up today. […]

…said Faustine Delasalle, Mission Possible Partnership CEO and Executive Director of Industrial Transition Accelerator

Policy action will determine who captures the opportunity

The evidence is clear: there is profit potential in clean industry, but the pace of financing depends on stronger demand-side policy. Governments that create predictable demand signals for clean materials, chemicals, and fuels will unlock the next wave of projects and secure their industrial futures.

The ITA’s work on demand-side policy in Europe highlights this opportunity: by creating lead markets for clean materials and fuels, the EU could revive its flagging industries and boost its pipeline of projects, which represents more than €100 billion in investment potential.

Such measures would strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security while adding only marginally to the cost of consumer goods, far less than inflation caused by volatility from fossil fuel-intensive production.

[…] Building on the leadership of many companies around the world, governments and investors have a unique opportunity to turn today’s plans into plants, which together will make up tomorrow’s global clean industrial economy. Those who demonstrate strategic foresight and unwavering commitment to the clean industrial transition stand to reap its benefits.

What is the IMO Net-Zero Framework?

The NZF implements the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy, which targets net-zero emissions from international shipping by around 2050. It proposes:

A global fuel standard limiting GHG fuel intensity; and

A pricing and reward mechanism to promote low- and zero-emission fuels.

Regional measures continue to advance

While IMO discussions are delayed, regional regulations are moving ahead. The EU ETS, UK ETS, and FuelEU Maritime are already in force, imposing monitoring, reporting, and financial obligations on ships trading up Europe. These regional systems—especially within the EU—are expected to expand further, and most NNPC members already fall within their scope.

The delay increases uncertainty in the regulatory landscape. Without a global IMO framework, regional initiatives will continue to define compliance requirements.

The need for greener fuels has been gaining traction due to stricter impending environmental rules in international shipping.

In April, the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee approved net-zero regulations for global shipping during its 83rd session. The framework represents the IMO's regulatory response to the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050.

A key extraordinary session of the IMO's MEPC in October, however, decided to delay the ratification of the framework, including the adoption of new requirements on GHG fuel intensity, in combination with a pricing and reward mechanism, for one year.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $483.73/metric ton in Singapore in September, according to the bunker cost calculator from Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The event, held in a ballroom that buzzed with anticipation, was more than just a meeting—it was a rallying cry for a new era in U.S. energy policy and a pointed critique of what attendees described as the dangers of environmental overreach. The summit’s opening remarks, delivered by AFPI’s vice chair of energy and environment, Oliver McPherson-Smith, set the tone: ""Around the world, governments are abusing an increasingly thin patina of environmentalism to push policies that further and further encroach on the freedoms of everyday citizens."" According to Inside Climate News, this sort of rhetoric is nothing new for AFPI, a think tank founded in 2021 in the wake of Donald Trump’s loss to Joe Biden.

AFPI has long criticized what it sees as ""apocalyptic rhetoric"" from the Biden administration, arguing that climate concerns have been used as a justification for sweeping government expansion. But for those gathered at the summit, Trump’s return to office was heralded as a kind of salvation—a chance to recommit to what they call the “American model” of energy and environmental policy. McPherson-Smith’s message was clear: ""Under the ‘America First’ leadership of President Trump, our nation is once again returning to, recommitting and advancing the American model of energy and environment.""

AFPI’s campaign director, Ted Ellis, described the summit as a forum for ""leading experts in energy policy to discuss the most pressing issues on today’s energy landscape: affordability, reliability, and energy independence."" The event featured a star lineup, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. Both officials highlighted the administration’s recent efforts to fight what they view as anti-energy and anti-prosperity policies, including a high-profile intervention on the world stage.

One of the most consequential moves came in October, when the U.S. played a pivotal role in blocking a global carbon tax framework at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The proposed rules would have capped greenhouse gas emissions from shipping vessels, requiring those that exceeded limits to purchase carbon credits or pay extra fees. As reported by Inside Climate News, a draft of the framework was initially approved in April 2025 by 63 countries, with only 16 voting against and 24 abstentions. But after months of pressure from the Trump administration—including threats of tariffs, visa restrictions, sanctions, and additional port fees—support for the framework shifted dramatically. In October, with the backing of the U.S. and other nations, Saudi Arabia introduced a proposal to postpone the framework until October 2026. This time, 57 countries voted for postponement and 49 against, with 21 abstentions. ""I will tell you that the ‘it’s going to happen’ crowd were very disappointed,"" Wright said at the AFPI summit. ""That’s because of your support, your belief, your commitment to this stuff … and helping to elect President Trump and the cabinet he picked.""

AFPI’s influence on the Trump administration’s energy agenda is unmistakable. The think tank’s 2022 policy book, “The America First Agenda,” calls for the modernization of cornerstone environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act, to spur economic growth. AFPI has also pushed for ending what it calls ""outsized subsidies"" for renewable energies and has labeled the Inflation Reduction Act a threat to national security. In May 2025, the organization claimed that the Trump administration had enacted or advanced over 86 percent of its agenda in the first 100 days of Trump’s second term.

Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act""—which mandates lease sales for oil and gas drilling while slashing incentives for wind and solar development—was described by critics as a major win for the fossil fuel industry. The administration is also seeking to reverse the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health, a key legal basis for regulating emissions. According to Inside Climate News, companies can now simply email the EPA to request exemptions from Clean Air Act regulations that limit toxic emissions from facilities like coal-fired power plants.

AFPI’s reach extends deep into Trump’s inner circle. Brooke Rollins, now agriculture secretary, is the co-founder and former president and CEO of AFPI, despite having little professional background in agricultural policy. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, and McPherson-Smith himself (who previously served as executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council) all have ties to AFPI. The New York Times has reported that AFPI’s connections to the fossil fuel industry date back to its founding, with Texas oil tycoon Tim Dunn playing a key role in its creation.

Meanwhile, in New York, the battle over energy policy has taken a dramatic turn. As reported by The Hill, the federal government in April 2025 ordered a work-stop on the $5 billion Empire Wind offshore wind farm project off Long Island, only to reverse the decision a month later. This move fueled speculation about a political deal between Governor Kathy Hochul and the White House, possibly trading support for new natural gas pipelines in exchange for restarting Empire Wind.

Two long-dormant pipeline projects—the 23.5-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) Pipeline and the 125-mile Constitution Pipeline—were revived in 2025, with both re-filing for state permits. Yet New York state law effectively bans new fossil fuel infrastructure, and Hochul has been careful to state that “New York will work with the [Trump] administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law.”

New York is widely considered one of the most anti-fossil fuel states in the country. The state banned oil and gas drilling in 2014, closed all coal-fired power plants, and rejected every natural gas pipeline proposed—until now. The 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act set aggressive targets: 100 percent electric vehicle sales by 2035, an emissions-free electricity grid by 2040, and a net-zero economy by 2050. Hochul doubled down in 2023 with the All-Electric Building Act, banning natural gas hookups for new buildings starting in 2026. In late 2024, she expanded the fracking ban and signed the Climate Change Superfund Act, imposing a $3 billion annual tax on oil and gas companies beginning in 2026.

The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) had previously denied water permits for the NESE and Constitution pipelines multiple times. But in November 2025, the DEC surprised many by approving the NESE pipeline, despite highlighting its inconsistency with statewide greenhouse gas emission limits. At the same time, the DEC remanded the Constitution Pipeline’s application back to its sponsor and federal regulators, ending hopes for a quick approval.

Critics argue that New York’s anti-fossil fuel policies not only affect the state but have ripple effects across the region and the nation. By blocking pipelines, New York restricts natural gas flow to New England, impacting regional energy prices and reliability. Its aggressive climate policies, they say, interfere with interstate commerce and the national economy. As Paul Tice, a senior fellow at the National Center for Energy Analytics, wrote in The Hill, ""It’s time for the Trump administration to start suing to finally establish federal supremacy for American energy policy.""

Why green methanol matters

Shipping moves around 90 per cent of global trade and contributes nearly 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) targeting net zero by 2050, the industry faces a complex transition to alternative green fuels.

Green methanol — produced from organic waste (bio-methanol) or by combining green hydrogen and captured CO2 (e-methanol) — offers a promising solution. However, widespread adoption is constrained by limited supply, infrastructure gaps, high retrofitting costs and regulatory uncertainty.

Methanol-handling capabilities are currently limited to a small number of ports, and green methanol remains in short supply. Supporting infrastructure — such as pipelines, storage tanks and refuelling stations — is also underdeveloped.

Despite these challenges, decarbonising shipping could accelerate renewable energy investment and unlock economic opportunities for Australia.

Our response

From feasibility to future-ready

This pre-feasibility study explores how green methanol can be transported, stored and used as fuel for short-sea vessels. It focuses on methanol produced by the proposed Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) demonstration plant near Port Augusta, South Australia.

SM1 aims to produce approximately 7,500 tonnes per annum of e-methanol using renewable energy, electrolysis-derived hydrogen and captured industrial CO2.

Led by Vast Renewables through its Hyfuel Solar Refinery subsidiary, the project is exploring the technical, infrastructure, regulatory and commercial readiness required to adopt green methanol in maritime operations.

While the initial focus is on Australian short-sea vessels, the long-term vision is to expand supply to Singapore and beyond through larger-scale projects in Western Australia and the Americas.

The results

Fuelling the future without fossil fuels

The project is being delivered in multiple phases, each addressing a key area of readiness:

Technical readiness has defined standards and design options for methanol-ready engines and storage facilities.

Infrastructure readiness has evaluated port, transport and storage capabilities.

Regulatory readiness has examined policy settings and calculate lifecycle emissions reductions.

Commercial readiness has explored market dynamics, competitor activity and viable business models.

Knowledge sharing will ensure insights are shared with port users in Australia and Singapore to support uptake and strengthen international collaboration.

By identifying barriers and opportunities in the rollout of green methanol for short-sea vessels, the project aims to help reduce costs and accelerate adoption. The study supports increased uptake through cross-border value chains and stakeholder engagement.

Ultimately, demonstrating the viability of Australian-produced green methanol will build industry confidence and improve supply chain readiness.

Strengthened collaboration between Australian and Singaporean ports will further drive investment and support the transition to low emissions maritime fuel.

The United Nations climate negotiations, COP30, had just kicked off on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, and one side event drew a crowd of so-called ""maritime enthusiasts"" eager to hear what was next for the ships that keep global trade afloat. The spotlight was on Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), who addressed the future of shipping’s role in the fight against climate change.

Dominguez’s message was both determined and realistic. Despite a major setback just weeks earlier—when the United States, led by President Donald Trump, and Saudi Arabia blocked a long-anticipated set of new rules aimed at slashing shipping emissions—he insisted that efforts to decarbonize the industry are far from over. ""Don’t think the IMO stops there, because we don’t,"" Dominguez told the gathered crowd, according to the Associated Press. ""We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.""

It’s a complicated moment for the shipping industry, which has quietly become a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. According to the AP, shipping now accounts for about 3% of global emissions, a figure that has grown steadily over the past decade as international trade has boomed. Most of the world’s ships still burn heavy fuel oil, a dirty and carbon-intensive energy source, and with the average large vessel lasting up to 25 years, any shift away from fossil fuels will require both immediate action and long-term investment.

The regulations that were set to be adopted in October 2025 would have marked a historic first: a global carbon fee on shipping. The plan, known as the ""Net-Zero Framework,"" would have set a marine fuel standard to gradually decrease the amount of greenhouse gases that ships are allowed to emit. It also included a pricing system, imposing a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted above allowable limits. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, was among those pushing for the new rules. The expectation was that adoption would be a mere formality, following an agreement reached in April.

But that expectation was dashed after intense lobbying from President Trump, Saudi Arabia, and a handful of other countries. Trump, never one to mince words, declared that the United States ""will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping."" The result was a year-long postponement, with the decision now pushed to 2026. It was a blow for many nations who had hoped to celebrate the agreement at COP30, and it left a sense of disappointment hanging over the climate talks.

Yet, if Dominguez felt frustration, he didn’t show it. Instead, he struck a conciliatory tone, refusing to blame the U.S. or any other country for the delay. ""There’s no reason to be upset given how volatile the world is right now,"" he said, according to the AP. He emphasized that the IMO is still making progress on the framework for a shipping carbon fee and remains committed to engaging all member states and sectors in the decarbonization effort. ""I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,"" he explained. ""Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.""

The absence of the United States from COP30 was notable. According to the AP, the U.S. was one of just four countries not present at the conference, along with San Marino, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. This absence underscored the challenges facing global climate diplomacy, particularly when major emitters and economic powers are not at the table.

Other nations, however, remain undeterred. Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, the climate envoy for the Netherlands, delivered a keynote address immediately following Dominguez’s remarks. He acknowledged the disappointment many felt after last month’s setback in London, where the regulations were supposed to be adopted. Still, he urged a pragmatic approach. ""While the delay in many ways caused a ‘sense of failure,’ it is equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month,"" he said. ""We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition. We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.""

For advocates of rapid change, the stakes are high. With ships built to last a quarter-century, every year of delay means more vessels locked into a carbon-heavy future. The International Chamber of Shipping, representing a vast majority of the world’s merchant fleet, has stressed the importance of acting now. The organization’s support for the regulations signals that much of the industry is ready—or at least willing—to embrace change, provided there’s a level playing field and clear rules.

Industry leaders like Andrew Forrest, founder of the Australian green technology company Fortescue, are already moving ahead. Speaking at the IMO side event, Forrest cut through the political noise. ""We’re not woke, we’re not green,"" he said. ""We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels."" Forrest’s blunt approach reflects a growing sentiment among some in the sector: that the transition away from fossil fuels is not just about environmental virtue, but about business sense and technological opportunity.

This pragmatic streak is echoed by many maritime nations and their representatives, who see the proposed regulations as both necessary for the planet and inevitable for the industry. The hope, as articulated by Prince Jaime and others, is that the extra year will be used to build broader consensus and address the concerns that led to the postponement. That includes finding ways to ensure the transition is just and equitable, particularly for developing nations and smaller shipping companies that may struggle with the costs of compliance.

Still, the path ahead is anything but certain. The political landscape remains volatile, as Dominguez acknowledged, and the shipping industry is notoriously complex, with a web of national interests, regulatory regimes, and economic pressures. Yet, the momentum for change appears to be building, even if progress is slower than many had hoped. As Dominguez put it, ""We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.""

With the world watching and the clock ticking on climate action, the next year will be critical for the future of shipping—and, by extension, for the global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Whether the industry can chart a course toward decarbonization will depend on the willingness of nations to bridge divides, the resolve of industry leaders to invest in cleaner technologies, and the ability of the IMO to keep the conversation—and the campaign—moving forward.

For now, the sense in Belem is one of cautious optimism. The setback may have delayed the journey, but few doubt that the destination remains the same: a shipping industry that pulls its weight in the fight against climate change.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-11-12 11:59:55.533493

Navigating to a Greener Future

Hong Kong Maritime Week (HKMW) 2025 is set to be the premier event in the international maritime calendar, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong's status as a prime global maritime capital.

HKMW is organised by the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board, with Hong Kong Maritime Museum and Invest Hong Kong as co-organisers. This landmark convention also owes much to the collaboration of industry leaders, government agencies, and professional associations nationally and overseas.

The week-long celebration will bring together stakeholders from across the world to discuss trends, innovations, and the future of the maritime industry. The event reflects Hong Kong's unique position bridging East and West, and its commitment to driving growth, sustainability, and excellence in shipping and port operations.

During a packed week from 16 to 22 November 2025, more than 50 individual conferences, seminars, forums, networking events, educational workshops, and community engagement activities will take place across Hong Kong - Asia's most dynamic city. These events reflect the intent of the organisers to create a highly diverse platform catering to the needs and interests of all members of the broad maritime-related ecosystem.

In curating the programme, emphasis has been placed on green shipping, decarbonisation, and the adoption of sustainable practices to address global environmental challenges. With the maritime industry undergoing rapid digital transformation, other key topics at this year's gathering will highlight smart shipping and the integration of digital technologies in port management.

Why Hong Kong?

Despite the temporary hiatus at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the finalisation of its Net-Zero Framework, the shipping industry is forging ahead in its quest to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. HKMW 2025 recognises this central concern of the industry and is ideally placed to address it.

HKMW 2025, will be the first truly international maritime event of scale since the vote to adopt the IMO Net-Zero Framework was deferred in October. It will be the first time and place to gain some sense of the favoured way forward from various experts, industry leaders and government officials on hand at many of the conferences and networking occasions.

For those professionals involved in the energy and bunkering industries, there has never been a more opportune time to attend HKMW. This year's convention plays out against the background of the ongoing realisation of Hong Kong's extraordinary ambition to develop into a leading green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub.

The pathway to green maritime fuel bunkering and trading

In November 2024, the Government of Hong Kong SAR promulgated its Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering. The first LNG bunkering exercise was completed within three months in early 2025, and there are solid plans for the first green methanol bunkering operation in the near future.

To drive through Hong Kong's transition to a green maritime fuel bunkering centre as efficiently and expeditiously as possible, the Government is offering financial incentives for encouraging pioneer companies to start green maritime fuel bunkering businesses in Hong Kong as soon as possible.

The Hong Kong Marine Department, meanwhile, provides one-stop services, with staunch support and clear guidelines offered to companies interested in setting up green maritime fuel bunkering businesses in Hong Kong.

With the growing demand for green marine fuel bunkering, and the Chinese Mainland's capacity to become a major producer of green maritime fuels, experts are predicting that the region will be a leading force for the supply of green energy for years to come. Hong Kong's commitment to developing a dependable and high quality green marine fuel bunkering centre with a regulatory framework aligned with international standards, means the city is able to build trust and encourage major corporations to invest in shipping's clean future.

Yemen's Houthi movement has indicated a halt to attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, warning they could resume operations if Israel restarts its Gaza offensive.

As per an undated letter circulating on social media, Houthi chief of staff Yusuf Hassan al-Madani warned the group could resume strikes and a shipping ban if Gaza is attacked again.

""We are closely monitoring developments and declare that if the enemy resumes its aggression against Gaza, we will return to our military operations deep within the Zionist entity, and we will reinstate the ban on Israeli navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" the letter reads.

The move signals a potential pause in the Houthi offensive that has disrupted global trade routes through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since late 2023.

This has forced ships to take the longer route around Africa instead of the shorter Suez Canal route, leading to increased global bunker consumption.

Over the weekend, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced that a CMA CGM ship had become the largest container ship to transit the Suez Canal in two years, signalling a gradual return of traffic after Red Sea disruptions.

However, questions remain over how quickly vessels will return, and whether the Houthis can be trusted to maintain the cease in attacks.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_c5627b22e01090c2edd535ca8d1d33e9.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 21:00:46.630364

The tenth conference in this series, which had the theme “Tanker Shipping Negotiates Challenging Market Headwinds’ was dominated by market uncertainties, caused primarily by geopolitical factors.

Conference editor, Clive Woodbridge, said: “During the morning session the word ‘uncertainty’ was heard so many times I lost count! There is no doubt that external factors are having a great impact on tanker shipping right now, with new tariffs and port charges, sanctions, the trade tensions between the USA and China, conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, the IMO’s pause on net zero regulations and the fast pace of technological change all coming into the mix. Rarely if ever have tanker shipping executives had to make strategic decisions against a backdrop of such volatility and unpredictability.”

This year’s keynote speakers were HE Sheikh Khaled Al Sabah, Acting CEO of Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) and Dr Ibrahim Al Nadhari, CEO of ASYAD Shipping & Drydocks. Sheikh Khaled noted the fast pace of change driven by geopolitics, particularly highlighting the impact of sanctions and the presence of the so called ‘dark fleet’. But positively, he stressed the continued importance of tanker shipping as the “backbone of oil supply chains.”

Geopolitics was one of a number of factors that Dr Al Nadhairi said were keeping him awake at night, along with operational disruptions, insurance premiums, regulatory compliance and market volatility. His overall message was that there is a clear need to balance operational actions today with long term strategic planning. “This is key to navigating uncertainties and sustaining profitability in a volatile market,” he added.

Other panelists in the first session of the conference, which focussed on sustainable strategies to combat uncertainties, included Abdul Bari Alzubaidi, Senior Vice President, Ship Management, ADNOC Logistics & Services; Ali Abouda, Group Financial Officer, Gulf Navigation Holdings; Nafeesa Moloobhoy, Managing Director, Moloobhoy Group of Companies; Navin Kumar, Director, Drewry Maritime Research; Bard Poulsson, Senior Vice President, Lockton; Captain Ankara Arora, Global Market Leader, Tankers, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore; and Dipak Karki, Managing Director, DK2.

Abdul Bari stressed the need for a long-term commitment to decarbonisation but said there was a need to strike a balance with commercial day-to-day business requirements. Ali Abouda made the point that, “You can no longer separate geopolitics from shipping profit and loss forecasting,” echoed by Navin Kumar who argued that “Geopolitics is now driving tanker earnings more than market fundamentals.” He presented the audience with a ‘World Uncertainties Index’ which not surprisingly had risen sharply, almost off the scale, during 2025.

Session 2 in the afternoon, was expertly moderated by Ali Shehab, Global Director of Special Projects at DNV, who was joined on stage by Richard De Vries, Vice President, Business Development, Lloyds Register; Han Ning, General Manager, ShipBid.Net; Captain Gargan Dhillon, CEO (Dubai), West of England P&I Club; Katherine Yakunchenkova; General Manager, Al Safina Security; Captain Onur Yildrim, Marine General Manager, Advanced Polymer Coatings; Alexandra Burke, CEO, K2 Bunker Fuel Supply; Roger Harfouch, Sales Director, Marlink Communications; Captain Vikas Pandey, Founder and CEO of Shipfinex; and Ramee Rashid, Director, Seamaster Maritime Group.

Collectively these panelists discussed how best to boost operational efficiency while maintaining a focus on green shipping. Alexandra Burke argued that the bunker sector can no longer afford to separate profitability from environmental accountability and urged collaboration between stakeholders to reshape bunker trades for a sustainable market future.

Han Ning said she believed market volatility can create both risk and opportunities for tanker shipping. “Crises should be seen as being an opportunity to strengthen market position, build flexibility and capitalise on global shipping trade dynamics,” she suggested.

Gagan Dhillon stressed the need for companies to embrace insurance strategies. This he said would “help mitigate the financial impact of operational disruptions, while supporting long term planning for fleet renewal and green investments.”",,N,,2025-11-11 19:56:14.107013

Did you know that 80% of international trade and the goods we use in our everyday lives travel by sea from port to port? These goods generate 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, so reducing these emissions is critically urgent to protect our climate, oceans, economy, and human health. Of the 50 ports around the world that ship the most, 42 are located around cities, where they generate jobs and support local and national economies.

Despite their economic importance, ports pose dilemmas for the environment. Maritime air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases are serious contributors to global GHG emissions, with projection of the shipping industry is projected to grow on average at 2.1% annually for the next four years. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set robust goals to curb GHG emissions from international shipping so as to align with the Paris Agreement. The IMO aims for a reduction of 20%, by 2030 and 70% by 2040 in relation to former 2008 levels. Can a 100% reduction by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions in ports around the world really happen?

Seaport operations are categorized into two main areas.

Land logistics encompass cargo handling, storage, customs processing, and inland transportation.

Maritime logistics include vessel traffic management, berth allocation, cargo loading and unloading, and fuel and maintenance services.

The implementation of effective reduction measures in maritime operations, especially at seaports as significant contributors, is essential. As our CleanTechnica colleague, Michael Barnard, has outlined, ports are embroiled problems related to their function to anchor heavy industry that depends on steady, cheap power. But they also host ships that idle on diesel engines burning through thousands of liters of fuel while tied to the quay.

For years the solution to both problems was more fossil generation. Now smart port solutions can enhance efficiency and transparency.

What Innovations are Making Ports More Sustainable?

There are lots of options for ports around the world to decarbonize.

Adoption of alternative fuels: A range of alternative fuels, including LNG, biofuels, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia, is possible for ports. Yet liquid fuels alone cannot meet long-term climate targets or the local air-quality standards that port cities are now enforcing. Batteries are the next step, not for crossing oceans yet, but for what happens close to shore.

Renewable energy: Electric vessels exhibit far lower total cost of ownership compared to diesel-powered counterparts. The transition to river-going and near-shore electric shipping is underway in Europe, China, Brazil, and Canada. Battery electric ships (BES) are now traversing waterways across the globe.

Electrification of port operations: Significant emissions at ports arise from vessels docked at berth. Ground vehicles and equipment consume about 15% of port energy yet are responsible for up to 30% of particulate emissions. Electrification of these assets promises an immediate emissions reduction of over 90%.

Energy management systems: Port electrification, logistics, microgrids, renewable energies, energy storages, and port automation are all part of the big picture of energy management systems. Different smart port founding perspectives play a decisive role in technology approaches to building a port energy management system including optimizing algorithms for energy consumption, balancing demand and energy production, and comprehensively integrating renewable energy.

AI-driven analytics: Emily Newton writes in Global Trade how visual and analytical replica react instantly to incoming information, displaying vessel positions, cargo handling activity, and weather conditions. Such situational awareness moves from human observation or delayed reports to a comprehensive view of timely port operations. Ship tracking becomes more precise, navigational safety is sharpened, and emergency preparedness is elevated through realistic, AI-generated simulation exercises, Newton explains.

Blockchain-based emissions tracking: The Institute of Supply Chain Management defines blockchain as, essentially, a digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data is secure, transparent, and immutable. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potential solution to address the imperative need for enhancing security, transparency, and efficiency in the maritime industry, where increasing reliance on digital systems and data prevails. Blockchain technology, with its promise of decentralized, secure, and transparent record-keeping, has found a good fit in the maritime trade sector.

Ports Across The World That Are Working To Decarbonize

World Resources International has compiled a list of several ports across the world that are making concerted efforts toward a net zero emissions future.

The Port of Barcelona is already installing shore power for both container ships and passenger ferries, drawing on 100% renewable electricity. The port is also investing in electric straddle carriers for moving containers as part of its broader efforts to halve carbon emissions by 2030 (relative to 2017).

Norway signed a memorandum of understanding to promote sustainable maritime transport, including port decarbonization. This agreement looks to initiate low-carbon supply chains to create a green maritime corridor between the two countries.

The Port of Trelleborg in Sweden is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2040 and exploring green fuel options. It is also establishing “green corridors,” which aim to create low-emission transportation routes with partner ports.

In China, the Port of Shanghai has developed a workplan to boost the transition toward alternative maritime fuels. This will increase the supply of liquefied natural gas, methanol and ammonia for vessel refueling (known as bunkering). A maritime decarbonization center is planned to help coordinate efforts in the transition toward alternative fuels.

Rotterdam, Netherlands has set out a clear goal to become the green shipping hub of Europe.

Many smaller ports including Walvis Bay in Namibia, have begun to pilot the production of green hydrogen.

Of course, the pathway to decarbonization of ports around the world takes specific steps, which the WRI outlines as:

Analysis on the economic case for action based on the current and projected future state of progress in vessel decarbonization and fuel choices;

Analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with various alternative fuel options, including electrification, biofuel strategies that minimize suboptimal land use, ammonia, methanol and hydrogen, for land-side and water-side equipment and vessels;

A roadmap for fuel development and cost/benefit analysis for the conversion of systems; and,

Guidance and detailed case studies from ports that have started the transition exploring what has worked and why.

Final Thoughts

Ports across the world have grasped the fact that dedicated climate action is necessary across the transportation sector and beyond. Ports are a site where climate action wins will benefit human and ocean health while supporting global and local economies and sustainable growth.

Due to the interconnectivity of seaports across countries and their role in facilitating trade between diverse regions and continents, policies must be formulated and endorsed on a large scale, necessitating collaboration among authorities. Port climate activists must continue to work against a backdrop of political turmoil and shifting fiscal climates.

Efforts to decarbonize ports offer a flexible and practical opportunity to mitigate climate change, act on health risks, and stimulate sustainable development.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Port-of-Barcelona.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 14:00:40.304862

As the EU’s greenhouse gas regulations, EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, are already in force, the delay in the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) adoption of its Net-Zero Framework has heightened uncertainty over future global regulatory developments.

Amid this complex landscape, shipping companies are seeking solutions that can help them evaluate various emission-reduction options and operational strategies based on objective data, while considering both cost and regulatory risks. Developed in response to these industry needs, KR’s new platforms enable efficient and data-driven decision-making for sustainable fleet management.

PILOT allows users to design and assess customized greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction scenarios using each vessel’s technical specifications and operational data. The platform automatically calculates vessel-specific emissions and compliance costs based on actual emission data reported to the IMO and the EU, while evaluating the cost-effectiveness and reduction potential of introducing energy-saving devices (ESDs) and alternative fuels to recommend the most viable strategies. It also supports the establishment of mid- to long-term plans by simulating possible future regulatory developments.

Meanwhile, POWER visualizes ship performance and fuel efficiency by analyzing data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) along with weather and ocean condition information. This helps ship operators easily understand their vessels’ current operational status and identify areas for improvement, enabling them to formulate optimal, data-driven voyage strategies.

Shubhangi Mathur New Delhi

India’s green hydrogen production target of five million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) is likely to be delayed by two years to 2032 due to global policy uncertainties around greenhouse gas emissions, said Santosh Sarangi, secretary at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) on Tuesday.

Revising earlier targets, the country now aims to produce three mmtpa of green hydrogen by 2030, said Sarangi on the sidelines of the International Conference on Green Hydrogen.

The Indian government launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) in January 2023 with the aim to become a global hub for production and export of green hydrogen, setting a target of producing 5 mmtpa of green hydrogen by 2030.

Sarangi cited the policy uncertainties in Europe and the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) decision to defer its net-zero framework (NZF) by a year as the prime factors for the decision of revising the country's target.

Export-oriented Indian companies are likely to recalibrate green hydrogen production targets while other domestic firms are expected to begin projects soon, he added.

“Companies like Greenko, ACME, Sembcorp have been actively scouting for partnerships and they have been relatively successful. We expect these companies to take final investment decisions (FIDs) and start projects quickly,” Sarangi said.

The major headwind faced by India’s green hydrogen programme remains the delay in implementation of European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III mandate. According to the said mandate, the European Union aims to achieve a minimum of 42.5 per cent of renewable energy in its final energy consumption by 2030.

Sarangi said while the larger group has adopted the RED III mandate, member countries are yet to come up with legislation for implementation in sectors such as industries and transportation, creating uncertainty related to off-take of the fuel.

India sees Europe as a major export destination for green hydrogen and its derivatives such as green ammonia and green methanol.

Demand for green hydrogen from the shipping industry also lacks clarity amid the recent one-year deferral by the IMO on net-zero emissions framework. Green hydrogen derivatives are zero-emission fuels for powering ships and are considered key to decarbonising the shipping sector.

Of the total production of five million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, around 1.5 mt is expected to be consumed locally, said Sarangi, adding domestic demand would be sustained by refineries and the fertiliser sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown.
Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions.
The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — The head of the International Maritime Organization said Monday he's continuing to “advocate and campaign” for global regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels, despite the United States and Saudi Arabia blocking new rules last month.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez spoke at one of the first side events at the United Nations climate negotiations beginning this week on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The side event discussed the shipping industry's efforts to slash carbon pollution by cutting back on fossil fuels.

Maritime nations were set to adopt the first global carbon fee on shipping last month at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates the international industry. They had already agreed on the regulations in April, so adopting them was widely expected to be a formality.

But after much pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year. Trump said then that the U.S. “will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Plan to slash emissions postponed

The regulations — or “Net-Zero Framework” — would have set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told The Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations missing the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn't judge the IMO for October's setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given ""how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don't think the IMO stops there, because we don't,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early too go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Hopes for future shipping fee remain

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez's opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,"" it is “equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

“We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition,” he said. “We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.”

Shipping can go pollution free, said Andrew Forrest of Fortescue, the Australian green technology, energy and metals company, during the IMO side event.

“We’re not woke, we’re not green,"" Forrest said. ""We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels.”

In an October 2025 feature in Ship & Boat, members of Jiangnan Shipbuilding Group detail how fourth-generation small modular reactors (SMRs) could transform marine propulsion, positioning nuclear power as a clean, safe, and economically viable solution for deep-sea shipping.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) back in April took a decisive step toward establishing a legally binding framework to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by around 2050. Approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee during its 83rd session (MEPC 83), the IMO Net-Zero Framework becomes the world’s first sector-wide regime combining mandatory emissions limits and GHG pricing, setting a precedent for all heavy-transport industries.

Under the framework, formally set for adoption in October 2025 and expected to enter into force by 2027, ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, responsible for 85% of international shipping emissions, will face binding requirements. These include a global fuel-intensity standard using a well-to-wake lifecycle calculation and a global economic mechanism requiring ships that exceed their GHG thresholds to acquire “remedial units” or contribute to the new IMO Net-Zero Fund.

China: Nuclear Propulsion for the Net-Zero Era

In the published paper in Ship & Boat, Jiangnan Shipbuilding Group’s Hu Keyi and Wang Bing argue that while fuels like green ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen will play vital roles, nuclear energy, free of lifecycle carbon emissions and capable of decade-long fuel cycles, offers unmatched endurance for large ocean-going vessels.

They note that fourth-generation SMR designs drastically enhance safety by reducing power density, enabling passive cooling, and minimizing radiation risk. The progress of these compact reactors, they write, “makes nuclear power a feasible propulsion option for large commercial vessels.”

The paper reviews three main reactor families, pressurized-water (PWR), sodium-cooled fast (SFR), and lead-bismuth cooled (LFR), before turning to molten-salt reactors (MSRs) and particularly thorium-based solid-fuel MSRs (TMSRs). These designs operate at atmospheric pressure, possess strong negative temperature coefficients, and virtually eliminate meltdown risk. Solid-fuel TMSRs combine fluoride-salt cooling with coated-particle fuel, inheriting safety traits from gas-cooled and liquid-metal reactors while achieving thermal efficiencies above 45%.

China’s Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) program, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has already achieved stable operation of its TMSR-LF1 liquid-fuel test reactor, marking the world’s only operating thorium MSR as of 2025. A companion solid-fuel design (TMSR-SF) has completed engineering design and awaits deployment.

Applications for Large Commercial Ships

Hu’s team models nuclear integration for three vessel types:

Suezmax oil tanker: Equipped with two 70MW lead-bismuth SMRs producing 25MWe each, designed for a ten-year refueling interval

14,000TEU container ship: Powered by a 200 MW TMSR delivering ≈ 50MWe via a supercritical CO₂ Brayton cycle, offering 45-50% thermal efficiency and inherent safety through sealed modular replacement every ten years

Floating power platform: A 112m barge hosting four 50MW high-temperature gas-cooled reactors generating 70 MWe to supply ports or AI-driven data-center “computing platforms”

All designs emphasize modular construction, passive cooling, and robust radiation shielding, reflecting a shift from military to civilian nuclear marine systems.

While capital costs and insurance challenges remain steep, the authors argue that long-term fuel savings and government-backed financing could offset initial hurdles. Beyond commercial shipping, marine nuclear power could secure offshore energy independence, enable hydrogen production, and power deep-sea and polar operations.

As fourth-generation SMRs mature and international safety frameworks evolve, nuclear propulsion may soon underpin a new era of zero-carbon, high-endurance ocean transport, anchoring the next stage of the global blue economy.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-11/JiangnanShipyard.jpeg?h=8c7c3f37&itok=v9WTr1zC,N,,2025-11-11 08:03:37.817935

In mid-October, IMO member states voted to delay the Net-Zero Framework’s adoption by a year due to strong US opposition, prompting doubts over the global regulator piece’s future fate.

“This outcome opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries,” Wartsila President and CEO Hakan Agnevall said in the company’s latest quarterly report.

The uncertainty comes as the EU has already implemented its own emissions trading system for shipping, while China is signaling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping operations and potentially influencing ship technology choices, according to the company.

Marine business outlook

Despite the regulatory challenges, Wartsila expects the demand environment for its marine business to improve over the next 12 months as shipping companies turn optimistic over future demand.

“Marine market sentiment has improved recently following a slow start to the year, supported by trade agreements between major economies, and the resilience in global trade,” Agnevall said.

The company said demand for alternative-fuel-capable ships has remained strong, representing 48% of contracted capacity so far in 2025, indicating that a large portion of shipowners have continued to prepare for a lower-carbon future despite regulatory uncertainties.

While new ship ordering activity has slowed compared to what Agnevall described as “extraordinary levels” in 2024, it remains above the 10-year average, with particularly healthy activity in Wartsila’s key segments.

“The impact on shipping demand has been uneven across segments, and growth in seaborne trade has moderated,” Agnevall said, pointing to factors such as ongoing uncertainty around trade policies, elevated newbuild prices and softer demand in some shipping segments that have negatively affected new ship orders this year.

Technology response

Wartsila emphasized its readiness to support various decarbonization pathways amid the evolving regulatory landscape, positioning itself as a provider of flexible solutions for shipowners navigating uncertain requirements.

“We are helping our customers navigate the transition by optimising fuel efficiency and de-risking the future through fuel flexibility, leveraging hybrid solutions, alternative fuels, and carbon capture,” Agnevall said.

Sustainable marine energy has remained much more expensive than conventional, oil-based bunker fuels, and some shipping professionals have said companies should invest in energy-efficiency measures for now to cut fuel expenses before investing in certain alternative fuels due to persistent regulatory uncertainty.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $11.80/Gj in Singapore in September, compared with $14.13/Gj for LNG, $16.88/Gj for B24 biobunker fuel with 24% used cooking oil methyl ester and $46.28/Gj for 100% sustainable methanol, according to the bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab) from Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Wartsila said its overall order intake increased 5% year over year to Eur5.88 billion ($6.86 billion) over January-September, with organic growth at 8%. The order book at the end of the period rose 14% to Eur8.6 billion.

The company’s comparable operating result increased 18% to Eur573 million, representing 11.7% of net sales, up from 10.5% in the same period last year.",,N,,2025-11-11 08:03:43.523492

The decision has attracted criticism from environmental and industry groups, including the Clean Shipping Coalition and the International Chamber of Shipping, which had urged the IMO to maintain momentum toward decarbonising the maritime sector.

This disappointment is understandable. The IMO’s strategy to achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050 underpins much of the industry’s decarbonisation efforts. Yet, the committee faces significant headwinds ranging from political pressure from the U.S. government, to concerns about market readiness and the need for fair, globally applicable standards. The delay underscores a broader truth: meeting the 2050 net-zero target will require coordinated commitment from governments, shipping companies, cargo owners and consumers alike.

The postponement also comes against a backdrop of deepening geopolitical and economic tensions. Trade disputes among major economies including the United States, China and the European Union have disrupted supply chains through tariffs, reciprocal port fees and shifting global alliances. These developments have forced companies to reconfigure logistics networks, raising operational costs that ultimately trickle down to consumers through higher prices.

In this context, the idea of a global carbon pricing system for shipping does seem increasingly relevant. With the IMO framework on hold, attention is shifting toward the European Union’s Maritime Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which requires shipping companies to monitor, report and pay for their greenhouse gas emissions. The EU’s approach may offer a commercial pathway for compliance while keeping pressure on the industry to accelerate decarbonisation.

Meanwhile, the sector continues to advance its fleet modernisation efforts. According to Alphaliner data, as of October 2025, about 72% of new vessel orders are designed to operate on alternative fuels which is a clear shift away from conventional fuel use among larger ships. While this transition helps mitigate environmental and regulatory risks, it also introduces new challenges. Compliance with diverse regional regulations, limited availability of zero-and near-zero-emission fuels, and the need for supporting infrastructure development are all likely to increase costs across the supply chain, adding further inflationary pressures.

Despite these challenges, momentum continues to build. The Getting to Zero Coalition reported more than 60 green shipping corridor initiatives worldwide at the end of 2024, providing testbeds for regulatory, commercial and operational innovation. These initiatives could help create clearer pathways for adopting alternative fuel technologies and achieving net-zero emissions across the maritime sector by 2050.

While the industry has made notable progress through decades of negotiation toward a comprehensive strategic framework, sustained collaboration and policy alignment will be essential, as the environmental and economic costs of inaction far outweigh the challenges of transition. The IMO’s twelve-month pause, therefore, is not merely a setback, rather an opportunity to come together and pave a way forward. The coming year will be crucial for refining the framework, balancing political and commercial realities, and ensuring that the maritime industry, which is responsible for more than 80% of global trade, charts a credible and equitable course toward a net-zero future.",https://www.thedcn.com.au/hubfs/Net%20Zero%202050_Shutterstock_2261424697.png,N,,2025-11-11 05:01:11.642609

For air lubrication to fulfil its potential, performance claims must be validated independently and across the full operating envelope.","Alex Routledge, CEO of Armada Technologies, writes for Splash today.

Shipping stands at a complex moment in its decarbonisation journey. The IMO’s overall strategy for reaching net zero remains in place, even as the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework has been delayed. In practice, this pause at the global level seems set to be offset by faster-moving regional measures that will increase commercial and compliance pressure on shipowners. Together they create a landscape where the pressure to act is rising, but certainty about what works remains elusive.

In that context, clean technologies occupy a critical but challenging space. They are essential to decarbonisation, yet their credibility rests on proof that they can deliver beyond trials and into day-to-day operation. There is still pressure to act, but any actions must be measured, proven and practical.

For any system claiming to cut fuel use or emissions, what matters most is how it performs in the real world: in different sea states, across varied vessel types, at a range of speeds and on a variety of trades. Without that depth of validation, even promising innovations risk becoming stalled at the pilot stage. The next phase of clean-technology progress will be defined not by how many solutions are available, but by how consistently they deliver under the full range of conditions that define operations at sea.

Nowhere is this tension more visible than in the field of air lubrication. Two decades of development have only produced approximately 600 systems installed or on order worldwide – progress, but not the kind expected of a proven decarbonisation technology. The question is no longer whether air lubrication works in theory, but why it has yet to convince shipowners at scale and in practice.

Shipowners’ perception of air lubrication stems directly from their experience with first-generation systems. Operators have encountered technology that promises much and may deliver satisfactory performance but only in specific, ‘ideal’ conditions. Beyond these narrowly defined parameters, the same complex mechanical systems demand significant power consumption from compressors that erode net savings, add costs and impose maintenance burdens.

These experiences have left shipowners rightly focused on one question above all others: can the technology sustain performance and deliver measurable benefits in every condition that vessels encounter?

Some second-generation air lubrication technologies tackle these questions and challenges but from a fundamentally different approach. Newer systems can eliminate compressors entirely. For example, our passive air lubrication system (PALS) generates a fine air-water mixture passively through clever utilisation of vessel motion and hydrodynamic flow. In doing so, we remove one of the main power consumption vectors for the technology, increasing the net savings potential.

More broadly, the physics behind this results in air lubrication technology that is applicable to a fundamentally wider section of the global fleet, including finer form vessels, vessels operating in challenging weather conditions and at slower speeds where first-generation systems cannot justify their cost and are operationally compromised.

After twenty years of development, the question is no longer whether air lubrication works in theory, but how it proves its value in practice. For air lubrication to fulfil its potential, performance claims must be validated independently and across the full operating envelope. Shipowners are right to expect this level of scrutiny. They should ask what facilities conducted the testing, how results were measured, who validated them, and whether the data represents the complete range of conditions rather than selected highlights.

With this transparency, shipowners and charterers also have the opportunity to reassess currently rigid payback period requirements and, where possible, afford energy efficiency technology (EET) manufacturers more flexibility. Too often, EET makers have been pushed to make the numbers fit narrow project economics, while the split incentive between owners and charterers further complicates investment decisions. Meeting in the middle – with clearer data, realistic ROI expectations, and shared accountability – can be another lever to unlocking meaningful progress on efficiency and emissions.

The air lubrication sector, and the wider clean-technology landscape it sits within, now faces a simple but decisive test: whether transparency becomes the new measure of competitiveness. In this, shipowners have a decisive role to play. Progress will depend on how technologies are chosen, tested and challenged. Every purchasing decision sends a signal: that evidence matters more than claims, that independent validation is a condition of investment, and that the industry will reward those who prove performance across the full spectrum of conditions that ships experience at sea.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/LNG-Generic.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 02:56:10.063732

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez spoke at one of the first side events at the United Nations climate negotiations beginning this week on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The side event discussed the shipping industry's efforts to slash carbon pollution by cutting back on fossil fuels.

Maritime nations were set to adopt the first global carbon fee on shipping last month at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates the international industry. They had already agreed on the regulations in April, so adopting them was widely expected to be a formality.

But after much pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year. Trump said then that the U.S. “will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The regulations — or “Net-Zero Framework” — would have set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told The Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations missing the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn't judge the IMO for October's setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given ""how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don't think the IMO stops there, because we don't,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early too go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez's opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,"" it is “equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

“We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition,” he said. “We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.”

Shipping can go pollution free, said Andrew Forrest of Fortescue, the Australian green technology, energy and metals company, during the IMO side event.

“We’re not woke, we’re not green,"" Forrest said. ""We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels.”

“We help reduce emissions, unlock investment, and enable commercial pathways for maritime electrification at scale,” Mr Glanville said.
Those attending the Port Electrification conference are expected to learn how ports across Australia plan to decarbonise their operations and support their tenants via electrification.
“Ports can play a critical enabling role as the host sites for these activities,” Mr Glanville said.
From a global perspective, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is advocating and promoting electrification of ports to decarbonise shipping.","PORTS are going beyond being logistics hubs and are increasingly part of efforts to decarbonise infrastructure, Oceon Energy founder Jordan Glanville is to tell the Port Electrification Australia conference in Sydney this week.

Mr Glanville told DCN ahead of the conference that ports could significantly reduce emissions via the use of low carbon or renewable onshore power.

Melbourne-based Oceon is building integrated systems to support this transition, with Electrified Ocean Networks (EONs) to connect vessels, ports and energy markets into a coordinated energy system.

“We help reduce emissions, unlock investment, and enable commercial pathways for maritime electrification at scale,” Mr Glanville said.

Mr Glanville is a naval architect with two decades of experience in the maritime and energy sectors.

Those attending the Port Electrification conference are expected to learn how ports across Australia plan to decarbonise their operations and support their tenants via electrification.

In one example, Port of Brisbane announced earlier this year that its industrial estate had an embedded network to supply 100% renewable power to customers, either through onsite generation, storage, or via a power purchase agreement (PPA).

Mr Glanville told DCN that:

StraitLink has implemented shore power in Melbourne and Burnie.

There are active plans for cruise ship shore power at Glebe Island.

Several other ports have committed to electrifying parts of their own fleets and facilities.

He said major port tenants, tug operators, stevedores and logistics providers have publicly stated decarbonisation goals and are assessing or trialling electrification.

The next step is expected to be turning intent into delivery and developing the infrastructure, energy systems and commercial models.

“Ports can play a critical enabling role as the host sites for these activities,” Mr Glanville said.

Another electrification advocate, Climate Energy Finance (CEF) director Tim Buckley, said it was time for permanent solutions to fossil fuels.

He is speaking to the conference about the work of CEF as an independent research centre, which partners with government and the private sector to accelerate the net zero transition.

From a global perspective, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is advocating and promoting electrification of ports to decarbonise shipping.

The IMO's GreenVoyage2050 program is supporting pilot projects for ferry electrification in countries like Türkiye, India, Indonesia and Viet Nam.

Norway is a global leader in electrifying its harbour ferries, having launched the world's first fully electric ferry, the MF Ampere, in 2015.

Supported by government policy and abundant renewable energy, Norway has rapidly transitioned its ferry fleet to electric or hybrid-electric technology, which significantly reduces emissions and operating costs.

Singapore is also moving in this direction by electrifying harbour craft.

Earlier this year, then chief executive (maritime and ports) at Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, Teo Eng Dih, announced a technical reference guide as “a critical step towards developing a safe, robust, and interoperable charging infrastructure for electric harbour craft”.",,N,,2025-11-10 22:00:11.073841

This declaration came amidst recent setbacks where new rules for a carbon fee on shipping were blocked by the United States and Saudi Arabia during a key meeting last month.

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO Secretary-General, made these remarks at the United Nations climate negotiations, which are taking place near the Brazilian Amazon. He emphasized the importance of transitioning the shipping industry toward cleaner practices and reducing carbon emissions, despite facing resistance from powerful nations.

During a scheduled vote to adopt a “Net-Zero Framework” aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping fuels, delegates were anticipating a formal approval. The framework would have implemented a marine fuel standard that gradually reduces allowable emissions and established a pricing system, including a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of emissions exceeding set limits. However, after intense lobbying from U.S. officials, particularly during the Trump administration, the decision was postponed for another year, citing the regulations as a “global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The shipping sector is responsible for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a figure that has risen amid increasing trade activities. With large vessels having an operational lifespan of about 25 years, immediate investments and changes are required to achieve significant emissions reductions. The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, has been strong in its advocacy for these regulations.

Despite the hurdles faced, Dominguez expressed optimism about future progress. He stated that the IMO is undeterred and will continue to work towards establishing a fee on carbon emissions to facilitate the industry’s decarbonization. He encouraged collaboration among member states and emphasized a proactive approach to engage all stakeholders essential to this transition.

In a reaction to the setback, Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, acknowledged the disappointment surrounding the delay but urged a rational approach to the situation. He highlighted the importance of maintaining focus on the merits of the regulations and ensuring equitable transitions while collaborating effectively to remove barriers to adoption next year.

During the event, Andrew Forrest, a representative from an Australian green technology firm, asserted that a pollution-free shipping industry is achievable. He claimed that their approach is grounded in pragmatism rather than ideology, signaling a shift away from fossil fuels is both necessary and possible.

Dominguez’s assurances and the continued urgency from various nations reflect a shared goal of addressing the environmental impact of maritime activities and achieving a sustainable future for the shipping industry.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/International-Maritime-Organization-Head-Advocates-for-Fossil-Fuel-Regulation-in.com2F042Fe52Fccdb74ee78d4fc650e9d67e343fb2Fc206320dbda6494eb534.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 21:02:49.577091

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told The Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations missing the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn't judge the IMO for October's setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given ""how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don't think the IMO stops there, because we don't,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early too go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez's opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,"" it is “equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

“We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition,” he said. “We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.”

Shipping can go pollution free, said Andrew Forrest of Fortescue, the Australian green technology, energy and metals company, during the IMO side event.

“We’re not woke, we’re not green,"" Forrest said. ""We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels.”

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totaled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages. Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations’ standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization, voted to postpone for one year a decision that would have helped to set global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

“With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a ‘wait-and-see’ approach now seems the most likely outcome,” said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine’s vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80% of global trade. The industry accounts for about 3% of climate-warming greenhouse gases, a percentage poised to climb without curbs.

Major container shipping lines like Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd said they will move forward with efforts to cut carbon emissions from their ships.

More than 70% of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15% for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at 9%, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about 1%, he said.",,N,,2025-11-10 19:56:18.485483

“Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.
It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport,” stated Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.
Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at T&E, stated: “The plan clearly acknowledges the important role of e-fuels in decarbonising aviation and shipping.
An eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project, launching by year’s end alongside committed Member States, aims to mobilize at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.","The European Commission launched its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan last week, setting an ambitious roadmap to transform the aviation and waterborne transport sectors through renewable and low-carbon fuels. The plan seeks to mobilize at least €2.9 billion by the end of 2027 to address what officials describe as an urgent need to scale up alternative fuel production.

The stakes are significant. To meet targets established under the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, the EU will need approximately 20 million tonnes of sustainable alternative fuels by 2035, requiring an estimated €100 billion in market investments.

“Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future. It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport,” stated Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The plan’s short-term measures include €2 billion from InvestEU to remove investment barriers, €300 million through the European Hydrogen Bank for hydrogen production supporting sustainable aviation and maritime fuels, and hundreds of millions more through the Innovation Fund for specific fuel projects.

Industry response has been mixed, with stakeholders praising the framework while emphasizing the need for rapid implementation. Jim Corbett, Environmental Director for Europe at the World Shipping Council, called the plan “a promising first step” but stressed that “the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.”

The World Shipping Council pointed to its own research showing the maritime sector alone could uptake 14.4 million tonnes of oil equivalent of renewable fuels by 2035—representing roughly 70 percent of the Commission’s combined target for aviation and maritime—if proper investment conditions materialize. The organization emphasized that over €150 billion has already been invested in dual-fuel ships ready to run on zero or near-zero fuels by 2030, but these investments will only translate into emissions reductions if renewable fuels become competitively priced.

SEA-LNG welcomed the plan’s recognition of methane-based pathways, including LNG, bio-methane and e-methane. Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer at SEA-LNG, noted that “policymakers increasingly recognise the need to balance competitiveness with sustainability and to focus on proven practical and realistic solutions that deliver towards decarbonisation today”.

However, environmental groups warned about timing. Transport & Environment acknowledged promising steps to boost e-fuels production but cautioned that action is needed by 2026. Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at T&E, stated: “The plan clearly acknowledges the important role of e-fuels in decarbonising aviation and shipping. For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels.”

The plan is structured around three pillars: a strategic framework identifying investment needs, financing actions with short and medium-term impact to unlock investments, and an external dimension facilitating global production while ensuring fair competition for EU businesses.

In the medium term, the Commission plans to establish an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to provide revenue certainty and de-risk investments. An eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project, launching by year’s end alongside committed Member States, aims to mobilize at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

The STIP follows the IMO’s October failure to adopt a global carbon pricing system for shipping. Member states postponed the Net-Zero Framework vote to October 2026 due to pressure from the Trump Administration and petro-states. The delay pushes enforcement to decade’s end, leaving the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), combined with the FuelEU Maritime, as the only major carbon-pricing regime for global shipping, reinforcing Europe’s role as de facto climate regulator.

As Europe positions itself to lead the global maritime energy transition, the consensus among industry stakeholders is clear: ambitious targets require equally ambitious and swift implementation to bridge the gap between renewable fuel production capacity and the sector’s decarbonization goals.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-11T050025Z_666471803_RC2G9V9UXH5H_RTRMADP_3_SHIPPING-EMISSIONS-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 18:56:08.626314

The successful 42nd edition of Europort concluded following four intense days of conferences, networking, award ceremonies and high-powered panel discussions that assessed how global forces are reshaping the industry and creating new opportunities. Welcoming over 23,000 visitors from 87 countries, the sold-out exhibition featured 1,100 exhibitors and 13 national pavilions.

Europort officially opened on Tuesday 4 November during an energetic Opening Summit that drew parallels between the turbulent 1920s and today, encouraging industry to find creative ways to navigate the challenges of our age. In an inspiring keynote, Marja van Bijsterveldt, Special Envoy for the Dutch Maritime Industry highlighted the power of reinvention, as part of a session which set the tone for the collaboration and innovation that would take centre stage in the week ahead.

In one example, Damen introduced its latest innovation in cargo vessel design – the Combi Freighter CF-5000 ICE: a new, scalable series of ice-class ships. In another, the world’s first ‘Circular Route’ proved a popular addition to proceedings. Featuring 15 maritime companies, the route showcased real-world examples of circularity and its role in promoting sustainable growth.

“Circularity isn’t just good for the planet,” said Marjolein Boer, Founder of the Maritime Sisters and co-organiser of the Circular Route. “It increases our strategic autonomy and creates commercial advantages. By reducing reliance on scarce materials, we lower costs, unlock new business models, and future-proof our industry.”

Sustainability and energy transition remained high on the agenda, despite the pause put on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework at the Marine Environment Protection Committee in October. Discussions at a Maritime Technology Forum (MTF) event ran through a comprehensive set of new guidelines covering risk assessments for alternative fuels. Championing a harmonised and practical approach, the guidelines aim to bridge the gap between safety assurance and decarbonisation.

The importance of collaboration was a recurring theme throughout. During an exhibition visit, Dutch caretaker Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management, Robert Tieman, praised the event’s scale and role in connecting global maritime stakeholders. The Minister also emphasised the role of governments in fostering conditions where businesses can thrive while maintaining focus on sustainability goals.

“We have to keep an eye on our objectives, but also ensure regulations support, rather than hinder, innovation,” Tieman noted, calling for a balanced approach to red tape and a level playing field for all market participants.

Echoing calls for enhanced collaboration, Petra de Groene, Programme Director, Business, Climate, Port and Grid Congestion, Municipality of Rotterdam, commented, “As a crucial hub, the maritime sector is hugely important for Rotterdam – and for future innovation, collaboration is a key element. The city of Rotterdam aims to stimulate cooperation by bringing partners together, including here at Europort where technology companies and other stakeholders can meet.”

On Friday 7 November, the #YoungEuroport events celebrated the next generation and addressed the need to attract talent to the sector. The programme invited students and young professionals to connect with peers and industry leaders, pitch ideas and participate in debates as they explored what the maritime industry has to offer. The final day also concluded the SAFETY4SEA Europort Awards, which recognised organisations and individuals for their outstanding contributions to smarter, greener shipping and nurturing the next generation of maritime professionals.

“This year’s Europort radiated energy and global connection,” said Raymond Siliakus, Europort Director at Rotterdam Ahoy. “In a time of geopolitical tension, it’s inspiring to see so many people from around the world come together to think in opportunities rather than contradictions. That spirit of collaboration is exactly what drives our industry forward.”",,N,,2025-11-10 21:02:56.984544

In a recent interview, Olivi told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, that Trafigura would shift to multiple types of alternatives to conventional, oil-based marine fuels on its decarbonization pathway.
“We are fuel agnostic … we will be kind of playing the fuel mix depending on what regional regulations dictate,” Olivi said.
“The IMO decision delays the implementation of a global framework, but there are still regional frameworks out there.
“A lot of people see it as potentially a very cheap fuel in the years to come,” Olivi said.","Trafigura has envisaged various types of marine fuels in its bunker mix amid a fragmented regulatory landscape, Global Head of Shipping Andrea Olivi said, after the International Maritime Organization failed to adopt a global emissions regulatory framework.

One of the world’s largest trading houses, Trafigura has about 400 tankers, dry bulk carriers and gas carriers on time charters to transport energy and commodity products for its own operations and external clients.

The company has aimed to reduce the greenhouse gas emission intensity of its shipping operations by 25% by the end of the 2030 financial year (October 2029-September 2030) from a 2019 IMO baseline, with a 23% cut already achieved in FY 2024.

In a recent interview, Olivi told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, that Trafigura would shift to multiple types of alternatives to conventional, oil-based marine fuels on its decarbonization pathway.

“If you ask me to describe the Trafigura fleet in five to seven years’ time, I am sure that we will have dual-fuel LNG vessels, as we will have dual-fuel ammonia vessels and dual-fuel methanol vessels,” the executive said.

Aside from already operating ships capable of running on LNG, LPG, ethane, methanol and biofuels, Trafigura is due to take delivery of four mid-sized gas carriers installed with ammonia propulsion technology from HD Hyundai Mipo in 2028.

“We are fuel agnostic … we will be kind of playing the fuel mix depending on what regional regulations dictate,” Olivi said.

IMO delay

In mid-October, IMO member states voted to delay the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework by a year amid strong US opposition, prompting doubts over whether the UN agency could push ahead with the regulation.

The framework is designed to narrow the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels by placing a cost on maritime GHGs globally from 2028, which many industry participants, including Trafigura, believe would be crucial to accelerate the industry’s low-carbon transition.

September’s monthly average bunker cost for 0.5%-sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $11.19/gigajoule in Rotterdam compared with $45.08/Gj for green ammonia delivered to Northwest Europe on a cargo basis, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab). But ammonia’s premium would shrink by 14% to $29.08/Gj for ships in intra-EU trades when the EU’s Emissions Trading System was taken into account.

“The IMO decision delays the implementation of a global framework, but there are still regional frameworks out there. Think about Europe with EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime,” Olivi said. “I think what we will see now in the next six to 12, 18 months is the emergence of more regional measures.”

The EU has extended its ETS to cover maritime transportation since 2024 and introduced the FuelEU rules on marine energy’s GHG intensity from this January, while analysts said the UK, Turkey, some African countries and China might usher in similar regulations.

“[Instead of] a global approach, we will probably see a bilateral or at times multilateral approach between several different countries that agree to apply the same framework,” Olivi said.

“It’s just been delayed from a global point of view. But regionally, I think you will still see a lot of countries implementing new measures going forward.”

Following the IMO delay, Singapore — home to the world’s largest bunker hub — agreed to establish green corridors with China and South Korea that could lead to more use of low-carbon fuels on trade routes between those countries.

“I don’t think we’re stopping. It’s slowing down, and it requires perhaps a small tweak to the strategy, but I think the decarbonization story is still there,” Olivi added.

Fuel choices

In full-year 2024, Trafigura reported 639,923 metric tons of CO2-equivalent of Scope 1 GHGs from its shipping and chartering operations, or nearly 35% of the group total.

The company has planned to power its ammonia-capable gas carriers with low-carbon ammonia for decarbonization, and Olivi stressed its project does not depend on the IMO regulation.

“It doesn’t really affect the investment case, because we were planning to trade the vessels within regions where you already have a framework,” he said.

For conventional ships, Trafigura would turn to biofuels to reduce their carbon footprint while evaluating whether they can be retrofitted to run on alternative fuels at the age of five or 10 years, Olivi added.

While the executive has highlighted ammonia and biofuels as part of Trafigura’s fuel strategy, LNG remains widely viewed as the most commercially viable option in the near term.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for LNG was $14.02/gigajoule in Rotterdam in September, lower than $15.13/Gj for 0.1%-sulfur marine gasoil even when the ETS was not taken into account, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator.

“A lot of people see it as potentially a very cheap fuel in the years to come,” Olivi said. “I think the biggest challenge is the LNG bunkering infrastructure.”

The LNG-capable fleet is projected to grow from 653 ships at the end of 2024 to at least 1,368 by 2028, while the number of LNG refueling barges is expected to rise from 68 to 121, according to DNV’s order book data.",,N,,2025-11-10 18:56:14.954055

Full Conference Call Transcript

Thomas Lister: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, afternoon, or evening to all of you joining us today. I'll pass the call over to George. Global Ship Lease's focus continues to be on optionality. As geopolitical and trade policy uncertainty continue to be a major factor throughout the third quarter.

George Youroukos: As we have seen in recent weeks with the IMO Net Zero framework, USTR, and China port fees, all of which were deferred at the eleventh hour or later, even policies that are proposed without even fully coming into effect are having far-reaching real-world implications. All of these real and potential factors are contributing to two major effects, both of which play to our advantage. Number one, making supply chains less efficient, which means that more ships are needed to transport a given quantity of cargo. Number two, increasing the value of flexible midsize and smaller container ships, such as those in our fleet.

Now, on the IMO deferment, this occurs particularly to the benefit of older conventionally fueled vessels that are now likely to have a longer economic life. Taken together with aggregate growth in global containerized trade, these factors are contributing to a situation where there's essentially zero idle capacity for the vessel size segments in which we operate. Thus, we continue to see strong interest in chartering our vessels, typically on a multiyear basis. Through the first nine months of 2025, we added $778 million in contracted revenues with full contract coverage for the remainder of 2025, 96% coverage for 2026, and 74% coverage for 2027.

This offers us stability and certainty at a time where both are generally in short supply. Our progress in securing additional charter coverage, adding to our revenue backlog, and fortifying our balance sheet has enabled us to achieve strong credit ratings across the board, including an investment-grade rating on our U.S. private placement notes. These same factors, notably including a clutch of recently agreed long-term charters, have put us in a position to once again increase our supplemental dividend, bringing our overall dividend to $2.5 per share on an annualized basis. That's a 19% increase being announced today.

But if you look at where our dividend was just over a year ago, which was $1.50 annualized, the total increase is 67%, all done on a non-speculative basis on the back of real contracted revenues and without compromising our ability to establish a fortress balance sheet and position Global Ship Lease, Inc. for opportunistic fleet renewal at the right time. With everything going on in the world, both Global Ship Lease, Inc. and our customers are acutely aware that many of our assumptions and understandings can be turned upside down one second to the next.

In this environment, we are simultaneously locking in the high value and forward visibility that comes from time charter contracts with top-tier global liners while also making sure that we have the strategic and financial flexibility to respond to the challenges and the opportunities of a fast-changing world and a cyclical industry. In this way, we are maximizing Global Ship Lease, Inc.'s optionality and putting ourselves in the position to protect and generate shareholder value no matter what is waiting around the corner. Now with that, I will turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas Lister: Thank you, George. Hello again, everyone. And please turn to Slide five to see our diversified charter portfolio. As of September 30, we have over $1.9 billion in forward contracted revenues, with 2.5 years of remaining contract cover. Through the first nine months of 2025, we added 38 charters, including extension options exercised for almost $780 million in contracted revenues, of which about $380 million were added in the third quarter. Slide six is where we discuss our dynamic capital allocation policy. With the inherent cyclicality of our industry, we consider it essential to look at the big picture in order to remain on the front foot, manage risk, and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.

As George mentioned, this has only become more important in the current environment. Optionality remains key as we navigate this environment and tackle our priorities. Among other things, these include returning capital to our shareholders through our just upsized $2.5 per share annualized dividend and strengthening our balance sheet. To that end, we've continued to delever to grow equity value and to increase our financial resilience and cash reserves to manage the various geopolitical challenges and uncertainties that confront the industry with growing frequency.

And, of course, we need cash on hand to cover CapEx requirements and to seize the right investment opportunities as and when they arise, especially as we've observed on various occasions because the best such opportunities tend to crop up when capital is otherwise scarce. We're proud to have made Global Ship Lease, Inc. a stable and liquid platform that allows investors to participate in the industry with us managing and mitigating the risks of the down cycle and negative volatility while maximizing access to super returns in the up cycle. Turning to slide seven. This slide shows the cyclicality of our industry and how we have managed it.

We want to emphasize our history of disciplined capital allocation regarding investments, buying ships during downturns where asset prices are depressed, or structuring deals such that downsides are limited and upsides are substantial. This also shows that it is at and near the bottom of cycles where the opportunities for outsized value are to be captured. I'll now pass the call to Tassos to discuss our financials.

Tassos Psaropoulos: Thank you, Tom. Slide eight shows our financial highlights for the first nine months of 2025. I would like to emphasize a few key takeaways. Earnings and cash flow are up compared to the first nine months of 2024. Our cash position is $562 million, of which $72 million is restricted. The remainder ensures that we can fully cover our covenants, work at capital needs, and manage the potential financial implications of geopolitical issues, which seem to be arising with increasing frequency and sharpness. It also provides dry powder both for CapEx to keep our existing fleet commercially relevant and for disciplined investments in fleet renewal if and when the right opportunities emerge.

And, of course, importantly, it supports payment of our expanded dividend. Earlier this year, we completed an $85 million refinancing that pushed our weighted average maturity to 4.7 years and brought our blended cost of debt to 4.34%. We also realized a $28.3 million gain from the sale of three older vessels. Our strong credit ratings were affirmed. We have $33 million remaining under our opportunistic share buyback program, and we continue to delever and build equity value. Slide nine now shows our ongoing process to repeat the resilience, derisk our balance sheet, and grow equity value. The graph on the left shows our progress in reducing our outstanding debt.

From $950 million at the end of 2022, we are on track to be under $700 million at the end of this year, even as we have acquired ships and put leverage on. The graph on the right is the more telling perspective as our financial leverage has reached 2.5 times. We have come a long way since the days of eight-plus times leverage. Slide 10, the left graph shows our cost of debt, which we have lowered to a blended 4.34%, down from over 6% in 2020. We have continually reduced our margin even as soft has risen materially.

And the graph on the right shows our very competitive breakeven rates where interest rate reductions have more or less offset OpEx inflation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom to discuss the market and our fleet. Thanks, Tassos.

Thomas Lister: Slide 11 reiterates our emphasis on midsize and smaller container ships between 2,010 TEU. These vessels are the backbone of global trade, and not dependent upon any one trade or country, and are extremely flexible. This stands in contrast to the very big ships that tend to dominate the headlines in the media but which are more restricted in where they can go due to their size requiring specialized port infrastructure and deepwater, not to mention huge cargo volumes to fill them. This keeps the very big ships largely confined to the main lane trades between China and the U.S. or Northern Europe, which as I'll get to in a minute, have been disrupted in recent quarters.

The flexibility our fleet offers is a key point that we reiterate because it matters a great deal, particularly in this current environment of heightened uncertainty and shifting trade patterns. Our fleet plays an increasingly vital role as trade routes and supply chains have become fragmented by a wide variety of factors that we'll discuss on the coming slides. On Slide 12, we break down the impact we've seen from the ongoing disruption in the Red Sea, prior to which approximately 20% of global containerized trade volumes transited that bottleneck.

Since then, about 10% of effective capacity has been absorbed as ships have been forced to reroute around the Cape Of Good Hope, which in turn has driven up charter rates. While it is difficult to predict how long these particular conditions will last, we and the industry more broadly are looking to see a sustained period of safety and stability before transiting goods through there again, as seafarer safety is key. If and when the Red Sea does reopen for safe transit, there would be a period of costly and complex rerouting and reshaping of networks for the liner companies.

This suggests that there will need to be a reasonably high industry-wide comfort level before we would expect to see large-scale rerouting via the Red Sea and Suez. But it's certainly something to keep an eye on. On Slide 13, we discuss tariffs and how 2019 under the first Trump administration could be instructive in how we might expect things to continue to play out moving forward. Following the 2019 tariffs, there was reduced trade between the U.S. and China, which had a negative impact on larger containerships used for those mainland trades. While as for midsized and smaller container ships, there was, perhaps counterintuitively, an uplift in demand following the tariffs.

As trade routes shifted and more emphasis was placed on intra-Asian trades where midsized and smaller ships predominate. Regional trade volumes increased, the supply chain diversified, and midsized and smaller containerships were the beneficiaries. Put bluntly, if you're providing capacity to the containerized supply chain as we are, increased disruption, complexity, and inefficiency in the supply chain tends to be a good thing and supportive of earnings. Slide 14 is where we discuss the latest developments or non-developments, if you prefer, on the regulatory front. Namely, USTR Fees and the Reciprocal China port fees caused quite a lot of agitation, vessel redeployments, and uncertainty as the industry sorted out how to adjust.

In the case of USTR, that played out with several months of forward notice, as the regulations which were announced in February modified in April and implemented in October. Meanwhile, in the China port fee situation, several months' worth of disruption and strategizing were forced into a memorable few days in October with measures announced on a Friday and implemented the following Tuesday. Even with both measures now apparently suspended after only negligible periods of enforcement, the industry was given yet another sharp reminder of the value of maintaining flexibility. Meanwhile, the long-anticipated net zero framework at the IMO, which had been due to be adopted in October, was deferred at the eleventh hour by one year.

This deferral will likely extend the lives of older ships and lift the commercial relevance and earnings for conventionally fueled ships such as those in the Global Ship Lease, Inc. fleet. Our view has long been that in a period of pronounced regulatory uncertainty, there are clear advantages to investing in midlife tonnage and being smart followers when it comes to the adoption of new fuels and propulsion technologies. We cover supply-side dynamics and scrapping trends on Slide 15. As ships continue to transit around the Cape Of Good Hope, and supply chains remain both fragmented and subject to continuous reshuffling, idle capacity and scrapping levels have remained close to zero. In that context, scarcity value is real.

And the liners continue to show an interest and, in fact, a need to charter in scarce tonnage in an uncertain freight environment as the risk of being short on capacity and the value of network optionality override concerns about fleet optimization and the maximization of efficiency. Slide 16 shows the order book. Here, we want to highlight that although the overall order book is meaningful and has grown over the past few years, the segments in which Global Ship Lease, Inc. focused are seeing far less growth. For ships over 10,000 TEU, a segment upon which Global Ship Lease, Inc. does not focus or participate, the order book to fleet ratio stands at 54%.

However, this stands in sharp contrast to the 32% ratio for all containerships and even more so for the 15% order book to fleet ratio in the segments Global Ship Lease, Inc. does participate in, which are those between 2,010 TEU. Also, with the current order book, if we were to assume that all vessels over 25 years old were scrapped through 2029, which is how long it would take to deliver the current order book, the sub-ten thousand TEU fleet would actually shrink by over 5% in that time frame. While capacity remains tight, we will continue to lock in charter coverage at attractive rates.

However, should the market normalize in the coming years, we would expect to see scrapping activity pick up sharply, meaningfully offsetting the impact of new vessels coming into the market in our size segments. Slide 17 shows the charter market against which I would remind you that our breakeven rate, including operating costs and debt service, is just over $9,100 per vessel per day. With the current market conditions, we have been locking in as much charter coverage as possible and now have forward visibility on €1.92 billion of contracted revenues over 2.5 years of coverage.

Who knows how macro, geopolitical, and industry dynamics will develop going forward, but we're pleased to have built a stable platform in otherwise choppy seas. On that note, I will turn the call back to George on slide 18.

George Youroukos: Thank you, Tom. To summarize, our cash flows are strong, and we continue to build our charter backlog. With almost $2 billion of cover over two and a half years, 2025 fully contracted, marginal open days in 2026, and a significant slice of 2027 already covered. Even as there is a sigh of relief on the current suspension of USTR and China port fees, and some quarters for a deferral of the IMO net zero framework, uncertainty remains pronounced. We're maximizing optionality to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities. Less efficient and more fragmented supply chains are increasing demand for our fleet of flexible midsize and smaller container ships.

We have strengthened our balance sheet and continue to amortize debt to build equity value and resilience through delevering. We have lowered our financial leverage, and our average break-even rates stand at just above $9,500 per day per vessel. And our credit ratings are in great shape. As the existing cash flows and cash cows begin to age out, we're focused on the disciplined and opportunistic renewal of our fleet to ensure that we have the right value-generating assets going forward. And as ever, we're proud of returning capital to shareholders through our dividend, which following the increase announced today stands at an annualized rate of $2.5 per common share, 67% above where it was just eighteen months ago.

With that, we would be very pleased to take your questions.

Operator: And our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.

Liam Dalton Burke: Thank you. Hi, George, Tom, Tassos. How are you today?

George Youroukos: We're well. Thanks, Liam. How are you?

Liam Dalton Burke: Fine. Thank you. It looks like freight rates have sort of bounced off the bottom from the third quarter and are inching up. Are you still seeing a healthy gap between freight rates and charter rates here?

Thomas Lister: Hi, Liam. Short answer, yes. Charter rates continue to move sideways at very healthy levels. So historically, I would say, really quite high and attractive levels. So despite the near-term volatility both up and down in the freight markets, the charter markets are staying steady.

Liam Dalton Burke: Great. And is there any appetite or how are you balancing rates versus duration when you're looking at either renewals or forward charters?

Thomas Lister: Look. We're conscious that these are strange and uncertain times. So, we continue to be focused on a sort of risk-averse basis on midterm and longer charters. And we're happy to take attractive economic rates on as long charters really as we're able to go at the moment. So for different sizes, that means probably sub 5,000 TEU. You're looking at a couple of years that you can fix for. And from, say, six or six and a half thousand TEU up, you're looking at maybe three and possibly even four years in some instances. And that would be our preference to lean into.

Liam Dalton Burke: Great. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, George.

George Youroukos: Our pleasure.

Operator: Again, to ask a question, simply press 1. And our next question comes from the line of Omar Nokta. Thank you.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Hi, George, Tom, Tassos. Thanks for the update. Obviously, things are coming together quite nicely. Pretty solid quarter. You added a good amount of backlog despite all the uncertainty and the strange times that you're just referencing, Tom. Just kind of thinking about the fact that you were able to add so much backlog in the third quarter, $380 million, nearly half of what you did for or sorry, nearly half equal to what you did in the first half. Just want to get a sense from you. Is that on the back of a very sort of maybe active, fast-paced market on the part of charters?

Or is it something unique to Global Ship Lease, Inc. that you were able to accomplish, maybe not necessarily representative of the broader market dynamics?

Thomas Lister: I mean, obviously, we'd take every opportunity to talk up our own book, Omar, but I would say that it's more representative of the market. And if you look back on 2025 year to date, the first quarter was very active. The second quarter was significantly disrupted by Liberation Day. So I would say a lot of chartering activity was effectively put on hold during the second quarter. And that came into the third quarter. So I think probably best to look back on the nine months as a whole as opposed to trying to read too much into individual quarters.

But what I would say is that, in the face of an uncertain environment, and it just seems to get more uncertain every day, the lines see capacity as optionality. Particularly, you know, midsize and smaller container ships that can be moved around pretty much any trade. And we see, as a result, sustained demand for such tonnage, which is what explains the fact that charter rates in the broader market as well as within our fixtures remain at very attractive levels.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Especially, it looks like, you know, for those older vessels we noticed in your fleet list, several of those ships that are in that 2,000, 2,001 built age range have now been extended for, say, three years. You know, those ships are going to be, call it, close to twenty-nine, maybe thirty years when those ships roll off charter. You think obviously, it's going to be a different market perhaps in three years' time, but as you think about what that market looks like, assuming it's still kind of the same, do you think their ships can continue to trade at twenty-nine, 30 years old, or is there an age limit you think for those ships?

George Youroukos: Yep. If I may take this, I will tell you. If the market was exactly the same as it was today, these ships will continue to trade. There's one big differentiation between containers and the other types of ships. There is no extra insurance on the cargo depending on the age of the ship. And why is that? Because container ships have the highest and best record of safety versus other types of ships. I mean, ships sinking or breaking into two, etcetera. The construction of the containers, because of the way they are loaded and discharged, in a direct way. You know, they have to slide the containers into the cargo hold from the gantry crane.

They are super heavy in lightweight, hence, very strong, very well made. Then the fact that the cargo does not come into contact with the cargo hold, meaning it's just boxes that you stack up in, so you're not putting anything like oil that goes and touches the side of the ship, you know, the cargo hold or bulk cargo, which, again, you know, gets in contact with the surface of the cargo hold and deteriorates over time. Make container ships very strong, and hence, there is no extra insurance, which means that the ships can trade easily past the twenty-eight or twenty-nine years if the market is there.

Thomas Lister: And, Omar, just to sort of add yet more texture to that. I think, you know, the US Jones Act vessels that trade, in some instances into the sort of late thirties and occasionally into their forties, are evidence of the fact that technical obsolescence in the containership sector, if you put sort of fuel and propulsion issues to one side for a moment, is not an issue. So that dovetails with what George was just saying. So long story short, if there's economic need, the vessels will, quote unquote, live longer.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, George. That's very helpful. And then maybe just as one final one, Tom, you were talking about the Red Sea. And there's obviously perhaps maybe a growing view that we'll start to see transit pick up again in the near future now that there's a peace deal in Gaza. Still, obviously, a lot of uncertainty there. But, just want to get a sense from you. Are you having discussions with your charters at the moment on how that will look? And is that how does that decision come about? Is that going to be an agreement that you make, or is it going to be them who force it down?

How do you kind of think about the two sides of the ship?

Thomas Lister: Yeah. So first of all, no. It's not something which is currently under discussion. Secondly, it's a sort of multilateral decision that has to be taken because also beyond the charterers and the owners, there are also the insurers, not only of the vessels themselves but of the cargo. So it's a fairly complex web of folk that have to get comfortable with the idea of transiting. And the biggest concern is obviously that of seafarer safety.

But I would say, if we go back to looking at the tonnage that was diverted away from the Red Sea and Suez and around the Cape Of Good Hope, it's predominantly the bigger ships, the larger ships, because it's those ships that are typically deployed on the Asia to Europe legs.

So I would say that the opening or not of the Red Sea is something that will have a proportionally greater impact on bigger ships and less of an impact, which is not to say no impact for sure, but less of an impact on midsize and smaller ships which were not frequent transiters of the Red Sea and Suez in any case, even when, you know, it was a normal environment, up until 2023. So we'll have to see, but I think the dynamics remain comparatively supportive.

Omar Mostafa Nokta: Okay. Great. Thank you, Tom. Thanks, George. I'll pass it back.

George Youroukos: Our pleasure.

Operator: And with no further questions in queue, I will now hand the call back over to Thomas Lister for closing remarks.

Thomas Lister: Well, thank you all very much indeed for joining our 3Q call, and we look forward to reconnecting in the New Year, on the back of our 4Q earnings.

This dual focus on two high-growth, high-margin markets strengthens HyOrc’s positioning as it advances toward its OTCQB uplisting and ongoing SEC reporting process, offering investors exposure to scalable clean-energy growth.

The collaboration will focus initially on a California-based pilot project, where the partners plan to engage with the California Energy Commission (CEC) and other agencies for grant support. The program aims to demonstrate HyOrc’s patented external-combustion powertrain, a zero-emission, multi-fuel system that can operate on hydrogen, natural gas, or renewable fuels - offering freight operators a cost-effective path to decarbonization.

This partnership targets the U.S. freight rail market, which is valued at an estimated $71.8 billion (2025). The sector is under increasing regulatory and competitive pressure to transition its fleet, creating a significant, mandated growth opportunity for zero-emission powertrain retrofits.

""This partnership marks HyOrc’s entry into the North American rail market,” said Andrea Magalini, President of HyOrc. ""Zeltech’s rail expertise and our proven powertrain technology create a strong foundation for clean, scalable freight transport.”

In parallel, HyOrc is advancing its green methanol project in Portugal, based on its proprietary waste-to-methanol technology that converts municipal solid waste into clean fuel. The Portugal facility is expected to include an offtake agreement with a rated international buyer, which is the final step required to enable project financing and deliver long-term, guaranteed revenue visibility. As global shipping transitions to methanol to meet IMO 2030 targets, HyOrc’s projects position the company to serve one of the world’s fastest-growing clean-fuel markets.

Unlike technologies reliant on subsidies, HyOrc’s projects are underpinned by guaranteed demand and contract-based revenues - including methanol sales through long-term offtakes and locomotive retrofits financed directly by freight operators.

""Our technology is validated, audit complete, and SEC reporting transition underway,” added Magalini. ""HyOrc is now focused on disciplined execution and value creation through real, revenue-generating assets.”

There has also been a shift in consumer consciousness surrounding travel-related carbon emissions, which is why cruise and ferry operators are spending millions equipping their fleets with the latest energy-saving and carbon reduction technologies.

These projects include installing equipment such as shore power capability, energy storage and advanced wastewater treatment systems, as well as integrating renewable energy sources (such as solar panels) onboard. Shipowners are also converting engines to run on alternative fuels, including renewable biodiesel, LNG and green methanol, and coating hulls with anti-fouling paints to reduce drag as ships sail through the water. Drydock projects of this kind are certain to increase in number as the evidence to support the effectiveness of decarbonisation technologies grows.

However, these aren’t the only types of upgrade projects taking place at shipyards across the globe. Cruise and ferry brands are also carrying out regular maintenance and refurbishment work on their existing vessels to ensure they offer the same brand standards and high-quality experiences as their newer ships.

With much to do to decarbonise and modernise the existing fleet of ships, repair and refurbishment shipyards around the globe have, so far, had a busy 2025.

Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven, Germany

Ambassador Cruise Line’s Renaissance spent a month in drydock in early 2025 where it was rebranded from former operator Compagnie Française de Croisières, as part of the company’s merger with Ambassador(which has formed the Ambassador Group). The ship also received a number of modernisations, including the retrofitting of a selective catalytic reactor exhaust gas treatment system for emission reduction. The team also used ultra-high-pressure washing to remove damaged areas on the underwater hull before applying a silicone coating on the propellers. Preparations were also made for the installation of a shore power system.

BLRT Grupp Western Shiprepair, Klaipeda, Lithuania

Work has begun to convert the first of two Scandlines ferries to plug-in hybrid vessels. The Danish ferry operator is investing over €31 million ($36.3 million) to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent on the Puttgarden-Rødby route in the Baltic Sea. Western Shiprepair will install five-megawatt battery systems and charging facilities on each ferry. The second conversion is scheduled for December 2025, with the project set for completion in early 2026.

Fincantieri, Trieste, Italy

Three Finnlines ro-pax vessels – sister ships Finnstar, Finnlady and Finnmaid – received numerous upgrades during a drydock in spring 2025. The refurbishment focused on enhancing the cafe and lounge areas with new seating, carpets and colour palette. The team also upgraded the exterior deck on the vessels, which operate on the route between Helsinki, Finland, and Travemünde, Germany.

A&P Falmouth, UK

Saga Cruises’ vessel Spirit of Discovery drydocked at A&P Falmouth in June 2025, following a successful project onboard sister ship Spirit of Adventure in 2024. The two-week drydock was for scheduled maintenance, including hull painting to increase fuel efficiency, as well as a five-year overhaul of the vessel’s two propulsion pods and the bow thrusters. All the ship’s lifeboats and tenders were also serviced and repaired as necessary.

Navantia, Cadiz, Spain

Navantia has refurbishment and repair projects for 13 cruise vessels on its books for 2025, six of which have already been completed. This includes Carnival Cruise Line’s Carnival Miracle and Carnival Valor, and Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas and Allure of the Seas.

The 15-year-old Allure of the Seas underwent a $100 million renovation as part of the cruise line’s Royal Amplified programme and now includes many of the standout features found onboard Royal Caribbean’s newbuild vessels, Icon of the Seas and Utopia of the Seas. On decks five to 17 a team of 150 Bolidt technicians carried out resurfacing of the 4,000-square-metre pool deck using Bolideck Future Teak. The team also refurbished the ship’s 1,950-metre jogging track, sun deck, and 115 balconies, as well as installing soundproofing for a new 800-square-metre extension to the solarium on deck 15.

Meanwhile ship design and engineering company Foreship supported the installation of Ultimate Abyss, a 10-storey dry slide at the aft of the vessel. The company also designed a new steel structure in the forward part of the ship to accommodate additional cabins.

In April 2025, Royal Caribbean International strengthened its relationship with Navantia by signing a strategic framework agreement for future ship modernisation and revitalisation projects. The partnership dates back to 2012 when the Spanish shipyard successfully revitalised two Royal Caribbean ships in Cádiz; since then, Navantia has modernised 45 of the cruise operator’s vessels.

Astilleros de Santander, Spain

HX (Hurtigruten Expeditions) cruise shipSpitsbergen spent February and March 2025 in drydock as part of the expedition cruise line’s €7 million ($8.2 million) renovation programme, which also included sister ship Fram. The latter was refurbished in April 2025 at Astibal Shipyard in Panama.

The ship’s newly built science centre, located on deck six, features interactive screens, flexible lecture space, a small library and dedicated workstations for citizen science activities. The space is also equipped with interpreter systems for multi-language talks to ensure accessibility for international guests.

The project onboard the 150-guest ship also included updated guest spaces and refreshed exteriors with the brand’s indigo blue and sand livery, while crew areas, including cabin bathrooms and dining facilities, were also refurbished.

Grand Bahama Shipyard, Freeport, The Bahamas

In April 2025, Holland America Line’s Oosterdam received several upgrades and enhancements during its two-week drydock at Grand Bahama Shipyard. Technical and interior design upgrades were made to several public areas, which also received new furniture. A new Effy jewellery retail space was created, and the ship’s casino was expanded. More than 20,000 square metres of new carpet were installed in all suites, veranda staterooms and public areas, including the atrium, photo gallery and studio, Rolling Stone Lounge, and Greenhouse Spa & Salon. The Rolling Stone Lounge now features an enhanced bar and new carpet, furnishings, LED lighting and flooring. Selected cabin bathrooms were also fully renovated, while the Sea View and Lido pools received fresh teak decking.

Damen Shiprepair Rotterdam, Netherlands

At the end of April 2025, Damen Shiprepair Rotterdam replaced a 92-ton engine block on Princess Cruises’ 330-metre Regal Princess – a process that is rarely done more than once a decade. The job began mid-voyage, with components stripped while 3,000 guests were still onboard. To extract the engine, parts of the hull and bulkhead were removed, then the block was slid out using skidding beams and a crane. Despite the short lead time and tight drydocking window, the project was completed safely and on schedule by the Damen team.

Conclusion Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology will be tested in a tropical climate.
Therefore, Malaysia’s carbon capture collaboration with Japanese academic and industrial partners marks a significant turning point in the nation’s climate journey.","NOVEMBER 10 — Global warming driven primarily by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO₂) continues to pose one of the most urgent environmental threats of our time. CO₂, the largest contributor, traps heat in the atmosphere, disrupting weather patterns, raising sea levels, and impacting ecosystems and public health globally. Emitted mainly through the burning of fossil fuels for power, transportation, and industrial processes, CO₂ also stems from deforestation, which reduces Earth’s capacity to absorb carbon naturally.

As Malaysia pursues its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the government and key stakeholders are accelerating efforts to integrate transformative technologies into national climate policy. One such technology under active consideration is Direct Air Capture (DAC), a process that removes CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. While Malaysia has advanced its climate agenda through renewable energy, electrification, and sustainable biofuels, these approaches can only reduce emissions by 40 per cent to 50 per cent. To reach full decarbonisation, carbon removal technologies like DAC are essential.

In a major step forward, Malaysia is initiating a multinational collaboration involving local universities, key logistics hubs, a leading Japanese university, and top-tier Japanese firms specialising in climate innovation, green fuels, and carbon capture. This cross-border initiative will pilot a mini DAC prototype system aimed at reducing emissions in high-concentration areas such as international airports and seaports.

Strategic deployment at high-emission zones

Malaysia’s logistics sector including aviation, maritime shipping, and associated ground transport contributes significantly to the country’s carbon footprint. Despite progress in adopting cleaner fuels and efficiency upgrades, emissions remain high due to the sector’s energy-intensive nature. To tackle this challenge, stakeholders are evaluating pilot DAC deployments at strategic sites, with a focus on Malaysia’s busiest international airports and major seaports.

Following initial engagements, private company in Malaysia has agreed to support a pilot project aligning with its sustainability agenda. A virtual agreement has earmarked a location near the aircraft hangar and close to flight take-off zones, an area with nearly a thousand aircraft movements daily as the optimal site for DAC deployment. This placement ensures the prototype unit is exposed to high CO₂ concentrations, maximising its operational effectiveness.

A mini-DAC prototype will capture approximately one kilogram of CO₂ per day, serving as a live demonstration of the technology’s performance under Malaysia’s tropical climate. The captured gas will then be released using waste heat from airport infrastructure, and subsequently liquefied for potential commercial use or conversion into green fuels.

This small-scale deployment will serve multiple purposes: testing energy efficiency, validating environmental performance, and collecting operational data to inform future scale-up.

Importantly, the prototype also demonstrates how DAC technology can be integrated with existing infrastructure and renewable energy sources, accelerating the decarbonisation of transport and logistics hubs.

Economic and policy implications

The initiative is particularly timely as Malaysia prepares to introduce carbon pricing mechanisms, including a national carbon tax expected in 2026. DAC technologies offer not only environmental benefits but also economic opportunities such as generating carbon credits, stimulating green technology industries, and enabling compliance with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards.

The project will also explore commercialisation avenues for the captured CO₂. These include use in synthetic fuels for electricity generation, and other applications in chemicals and advanced materials. Such innovations support the vision of a circular carbon economy, where CO₂ is recycled as a resource rather than treated as waste.

Malaysia’s involvement in DAC development supports global decarbonisation targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). It also complements the country’s own National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and recent government initiatives, including a 1 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending mandate starting in 2027. Hence, DAC will be critical to neutralise residual carbon, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping.

The collaboration also fosters a long-term platform for international research, talent development, and policy innovation. Joint efforts with Japanese university and companies will generate technical knowledge, strengthen Malaysia’s green engineering workforce, and contribute to the development of national guidelines for carbon capture infrastructure.

Our opportunity to lead in South-east Asia

Globally, countries such as Japan and the European Union are already investing in DAC technologies. For Malaysia to realise its ambition of becoming a green technology hub in Asean, it must adopt a proactive policy stance on carbon removal. Incentivising R&D partnerships, supporting pilot programs, and fostering public-private collaboration are key to positioning the nation as a regional leader in climate action.

Without investments in DAC and related technologies, Malaysia may struggle to close the carbon gap and meet its 2050 targets. However, by leveraging its ports, airports, and existing infrastructure especially with access to recycled heat and solar energy the country can create cost-effective DAC solutions suited to local conditions.

Conclusion

Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology will be tested in a tropical climate. Until now, DAC systems which remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere have only been trialled in temperate regions, where seasonal changes influence performance. This new study will evaluate how the technology functions in consistently warm, humid conditions typical of South-east Asia. If successful, the findings could pave the way for wider deployment of DAC across Asean countries and other tropical regions, contributing to global efforts to address climate change.

Therefore, Malaysia’s carbon capture collaboration with Japanese academic and industrial partners marks a significant turning point in the nation’s climate journey. The pilot DAC project offers not just a path to emissions reduction, but a blueprint for integrating science, industry, and policy into a unified strategy for climate resilience.

Although the use of renewable energy has increased and, thus, likely played a part in the decline of imports of fossil fuels, they nonetheless remain high.
As noted, fossil fuel carriers still account for around 20% of all EU Shipping emissions, with the Port of Rotterdam acting as the largest importer of fossil fuels in Europe by sea.
“Transporting fossil fuels around represents a double climate blow.
Ending our dependency on fossil fuels would remove a chunk of shipping emissions, but that leaves over 80% of emissions still to be decarbonised.","European shipping emissions surged last year to their ‘highest’ level since official monitoring began back in 2018, fresh data published by the EU’s Transport & Environment (T&E) shows.

According to the EU MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) system, which measures emissions from ships of 5,000 GT and above calling at European ports, 2024 set a brand-new record with emissions jumping by 13% despite trade volumes remaining flat.

Although the use of renewable energy has increased and, thus, likely played a part in the decline of imports of fossil fuels, they nonetheless remain high. As noted, fossil fuel carriers still account for around 20% of all EU Shipping emissions, with the Port of Rotterdam acting as the largest importer of fossil fuels in Europe by sea.

T&E has also highlighted that the level of transported liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been ballooning since Russia invaded Ukraine, even though data does show a decrease in 2024. On the other hand, emissions from moving crude oil have risen to 2019 highs.

“Transporting fossil fuels around represents a double climate blow. Ending our dependency on fossil fuels would remove a chunk of shipping emissions, but that leaves over 80% of emissions still to be decarbonised. Efficiency and green hydrogen-based fuels will be needed to get to zero,” Agathe Peigney, maritime transport policy officer at T&E, commented.

It is worth noting that the EU has been pushing forward with plans to minimize dependence on fossil fuels and boost investment in clean fuel alternatives, more so since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Just recently, the commission officially adopted the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) to increase investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels for the maritime as well as aviation sector(s). One of the key measures of the plan aims to mobilize up to €2.9 billion for alternative energy sources.

Officials from T&E have further underscored that disruptions in the Red Sea, in particular, have pushed vessels (specifically and by the largest number containerships) to re-route onto longer journeys around the Cape of Good Hope, causing them to sail faster to maintain delivery schedules.

In essence, per the MRV data, operational pressures born out of the Red Sea crisis resulted in more emissions per boxship, a segment that was reportedly the main driver of increased pollution, recording a 46% increase.

As informed, this can potentially be explained by an 18% increase in average distance sailed, a 3% average growth in operational speeds, and an increase in the number of units needed to service longer trade routes.

To add to this, shipping emissions—especially in the EU, which is believed to control around 35% of the worldwide fleet—are “very sensitive” to operational speeds as each 1% increase in speed can result in a 3% growth in emissions.

Among the biggest polluters in the maritime transport industry are some of its largest players. Switzerland’s Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) remains the most polluting company in the EU, T&E’s report suggested, having been responsible for 15.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Beyond the container lines, Italy’s Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).

“Last year’s record pollution shows that even when trade declines, disruption can lead to increased emissions from ships. With the inadequate IMO deal being shelved, the ETS carbon price has never been so crucial,” Peigney remarked.

As disclosed, the Emissions Trading System (ETS) for shipping has been in place for nearly two years. So far, it has proven ‘effective’, with around 99% compliance reported in the first year.

The upcoming review, therefore, could be the ‘perfect chance’ for the EU to maintain its course on maritime climate regulation by ‘bolstering’ and extending the system to make sure all polluters “pay their fair share”, T&E concluded.",https://www.offshore-energy.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/Industrys-first-Maersk-ready-to-convert-existing-containership-to-methanol-dual-fuel-engine-next-year1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1687333112,N,,2025-11-10 07:16:51.292915

Meanwhile, shipping companies are also preparing for the new environmental regulations soon to be introduced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).
AXSMarine personnel stated: “With the IMO net-zero framework vote postponed, the future order market is most likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach.","Data from shipping consultancy AXSMarine shows that in the first 10 months of 2025, vessels using “clean fuels” accounted for 37% of total cargo ship orders, the same as the same period last year. Order volume has not increased due to shipowners’ uncertainty regarding the effective date of global maritime emissions reduction regulations.

AXSMarine data shows that from January to October this year, global ship orders by gross tonnage (GT) totaled 78 million, down from 113 million during the same period last year.

Order volume surged to a 17-year high in 2024 as ships changed course to avoid Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, meaning longer voyages required more ships to maintain transport schedules.

Meanwhile, shipping companies are also preparing for the new environmental regulations soon to be introduced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

AXSMarine data indicates that orders for alternative fuel ships totaled approximately 29 million GT in the first ten months of this year, down from 42 million GT during the same period last year.

However, uncertainty in the shipping market surged again in October: Under pressure from representatives of the United States and Saudi Arabia among IMO member states, the organization voted to postpone the implementation of a controversial resolution for one year. This resolution would have pushed for the establishment of unreasonable global carbon reduction targets and introduced a system of penalties or incentives for compliance with these targets.

AXSMarine personnel stated: “With the IMO net-zero framework vote postponed, the future order market is most likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach. From January to October this year, over 70% of new vessels ordered by container ship and car carrier owners featured alternative fuel capabilities, while bulk carriers and tankers accounted for only 10-15%.”

LNG continues to dominate among alternative fuels, accounting for 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol represents 9%, while ammonia and other fuels collectively make up approximately 1%.

AXSMarine data indicates that methanol’s prominence in container shipping has significantly waned—its share of new orders has plummeted from 48% in 2023 and 18% in 2024 to just 10% in 2025, with fuel supply and costs remaining the primary challenges.",https://www.imarinenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110151345456.png,N,,2025-11-10 07:17:15.309850

The Busan Port Authority (BPA), the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA), the Port of Tacoma (PoT), the Port of Seattle (PoS) and the Ulsan Port Authority (UPA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (Mou) on 5 November, according to Pacific Environment on Thursday (6 November).

Under the MoU, both agree to strengthen cooperation on green shipping corridors, decarbonise maritime shipping and accelerate the adoption of clean marine fuels.

“Pacific Environment applauds the commitment to continuing collaboration between the state of Washington’s ports and Korea,” said Fern Uennatornwaranggoon, Climate Campaign Ports Director at Pacific Environment.

“Electrifying ports and moving ships to zero-emissions reduces the health risks of air pollution for portside communities and port workers. We applaud the ports’ action to protect communities and port workers from toxic pollution and climate change impacts.”

For nearly three years, the NWSA has been working partners on the US-Korea Green Shipping Corridors Project, the goal of which is to study the feasibility of accelerating the transition to zero or net-zero (ZNZ) marine fuels in the trade lanes between the NWSA gateway and the Korean ports of Ulsan and Busan.

The studies are exploring: projected demand for ZNZ fuels; emerging ZNZ fuel supply chains on both ends of the trade lanes and globally; ZNZ fuel storage and bunkering capacities (current and potential future); safety and other regulatory frameworks; and ZNZ costs – including an assessment of the “total cost of ownership” of ZNZ fuels, the estimated price differential compared to existing fuels, and strategies for bridging that gap.

“Pacific Environment applauds Republic of Korea’s leadership and investment in zero-emissions shipping,” said Hyunju Kang, Asia Climate Campaign Director.

“The Republic of Korea has set ambitious targets at the international level, while also committing nationally to green shipping goals. I am proud to partner with Korea to showcase their expertise with maritime decarbonisation and commitment to cleaning up the shipping industry in Korea.”

As major gateway ports in their respective regions, the BPA, NWSA, PoT, PoS and UPA MOU will include: Cooperation and alignment on maritime decarbonisation and in-port emissions reduction schemes and infrastructure improvements; collaboration to support the implementation of green shipping corridors; alignment on the standardisation of low-carbon marine fuel use and bunkering, engaging in capacity building and developing a strategy around industry engagement; partnership on digitisation (data sharing) processes; sharing of green practices, bunkering initiatives, business development opportunities and marketing cooperation; and lastly a pledge to share challenges, best practices and solutions.

The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance.","Adaptation indicators, including the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the Paris Agreement, as well as the NDCs submitted so far for the 2030 period, the Just Transition Work Programme, and the delivery of climate finance, among others, may be discussed during the negotiations.

Observers and negotiators who wished to remain anonymous warned that there are strong diplomatic headwinds that parties should be wary of. It is important to recollect that pressured by the United States, member countries of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), postponed a vote on a strategic plan to move the shipping industry away from the use of fossil fuel and become ‘net-zero’ by 2050.

The US warned of retaliatory restrictions and sanctions against countries that vote in favour of an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) proposal to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, observers said. “Similar fears are there, and there may be pressure on particular parties. That is why COP30 will be diplomatically a very challenging environment,” an observer said.

On Friday, the COP30 Presidency of Brazil sent out its ninth letter to Parties, which sums up what is likely to come up. The letter invites all Parties to help turn gaps into levers.

Drawing from the latest reports, including the Global Tipping Points Report, the letter acknowledges the scale of challenges ahead and the tools to respond as the global community gathers in Belém.

Following the completion of the Paris Rulebook at COP29, the latest edition will be the first COP where the full policy cycle of the Paris Agreement is in motion. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), and the Enhanced Transparency Framework are now active instruments of global climate governance, the letter states.

While it may appear like the stakes are not as high as, say, last year when the New Collective Quantified Goal was on the table for negotiation, thepositions countries take may still send important signals, experts said.

HT reported on November 6 that the Brazilian COP30 and Azerbaijan COP29 Presidencies have released the much-awaited report on the ‘Baku To Belem Roadmap To USD 1.3T’, which documents how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries from all international sources by 2035. But this document will not be negotiated on and remains outside the work of COP30.

“I urge all Parties to use our work under the negotiating agenda as a Mutirão (collective effort) for shifting the Paris policy cycle from design to delivery. COP30 can signal the maturation of the regime – from negotiation to coordinated implementation – anchored in equity, science, and cooperation,” André Corrêa do Lago, COP30 President, wrote in his latest letter.

China may assume a prominent role

Observers believe that China, the largest greenhouse gas emitter, is positioning itself to fill the void created by the US, especially because it also has economic interests in the green transition.

“Earlier this year, at a COP event in April 2025 - the Leaders’ Summit on Climate and Just Transitions, President Xi Jinping made a strong pitch for China to remain committed to global climate goals. Xi criticised ‘major countries’ for their unilateralism, iterating China’s support for international climate cooperation through multilateral governance platforms. Xi has called China a ‘doer’, one that has taken strong action for tangible results,” said Pooja Vijay Ramamurthi, fellow, Centre For Social and Economic Progress. “Second, Xi also called out the protectionist stances of powers of the free circulation of high-quality green products, and promotion of technological innovation and industrial transformation through cooperation. Therefore, given that these are the stances of China at previous climate events, it will certainly take up a leadership role,” she added.

China may call for the continuation of multilateral platforms, encouraging countries to engage in constructive climate negotiations. It will point out its own large-scale, rapid green transitions, positioning itself as a leader whose model can be followed. Rather than keeping a low profile, it is expected that China will portray itself a champion of green transitions, given that other major powers such as the US are backing down.

It will however, as usual, place itself into the Global South camp, calling for solidarity against ramping down coal too soon. This has been reflected in China’s NDCs, which some critics do not find as ambitious as some expected, Ramamurthi noted.

Adaptation likely to be critical for India

HT reported on November 4 that finalising adaptation indicators at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem will be an important issue for India, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said in a briefing. “Adaptation is an important issue at COP30. The adaptation indicators need to be rationalised. It will be a big issue. Indicators must be rationalised, based on national circumstances, finance, technology, capacity, etc,” Yadav said. India’s nationally determined contribution and national adaptation plan is also expected soon. It is likely to present its successful renewable energy transition at COP30. India has achieved one of its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, 5 years in advance. It has crossed its target of installing 50% of its power capacity from non-fossil sources. India is confident of achieving the target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, Pralhad Joshi, minister of new and renewable energy has said.

“The time for promises is now over. COP30 must mark the shift from a bank of commitments to a true bank of actions, where delivery, not declarations, defines progress. Nowhere is this more urgent than in South Asia, a region on the front lines of the climate crisis, from the small island states like Sri Lanka to the mountains of Nepal, and the vulnerable states of India among others. For India, climate action is both a necessity and an opportunity driven by innovation and powered by partnerships. But to succeed, the world must come together through smarter, more inclusive multilateralism that rewards implementation and builds genuine coalitions of the doing,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and special envoy for COP30 representing South Asia.

The COP when 1.5 degree C goal became obsolete

It will be important to look at how Parties respond to various scientific indicators at COP30. Temporary exceedance of the Paris Agreement’s lower limit or the 1.5 degree C goal is now certain, the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap report, indicates. “New scenarios show that limiting warming to 1.5 degree C by 2100 remains technically possible. However, due to the continued delay in deep emission cuts, 1.5 degree C pathways now imply higher temporary exceedance of this temperature target. The magnitude and duration of this overshoot must be limited as much as possible. Each year of delayed action locks in carbon-intensive infrastructure. It results in greater losses for people and ecosystems, higher adaptation costs and a heavier reliance on costly and uncertain carbon dioxide (CO2) removal,” the report has said.

Further, The Global Tipping Points Report 2025, by the University of Exeter and international partners including the Stockholm Resilience Centre, found that widespread mortality of warm-water coral reefs is now underway as the world reaches its first climate tipping point. Forests are also an important issue. Brazil, the host of COP30 officially launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit on Thursday. The TFFF is an initiative that incentivizes the conservation and expansion of tropical forests by making annual payments to Tropical Forest Countries that maintain their standing forest. India will join the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), Brazil’s global initiative to curb deforestation, as an “observer,” Dinesh Bhatia, ambassador of India to Brazil said in his statement on day 2 of the Belem Leaders’ Summit on Friday.

“The Amazon embodies the truth that awaits us in Belém: the future of humanity and the health of the planet are inseparable. The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance. If the Amazon crosses its tipping point, the planet will struggle to recover equilibrium, Lago has said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/09/1600x900/logo/A-tourist-poses-for-a-picture-with-COP30-mascot-in_1762714132075.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 20:56:10.423145

HT reported on November 4 that finalising adaptation indicators at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem will be an important issue for India, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said in a briefing. “Adaptation is an important issue at COP30. The adaptation indicators need to be rationalised. It will be a big issue. Indicators must be rationalised, based on national circumstances, finance, technology, capacity, etc,” Yadav said. India’s nationally determined contribution and national adaptation plan is also expected soon. It is likely to present its successful renewable energy transition at COP30. India has achieved one of its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, 5 years in advance. It has crossed its target of installing 50% of its power capacity from non-fossil sources. India is confident of achieving the target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, Pralhad Joshi, minister of new and renewable energy has said.

“The time for promises is now over. COP30 must mark the shift from a bank of commitments to a true bank of actions, where delivery, not declarations, defines progress. Nowhere is this more urgent than in South Asia, a region on the front lines of the climate crisis, from the small island states like Sri Lanka to the mountains of Nepal, and the vulnerable states of India among others. For India, climate action is both a necessity and an opportunity driven by innovation and powered by partnerships. But to succeed, the world must come together through smarter, more inclusive multilateralism that rewards implementation and builds genuine coalitions of the doing,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and special envoy for COP30 representing South Asia.

The COP when 1.5 degree C goal became obsolete

It will be important to look at how Parties respond to various scientific indicators at COP30. Temporary exceedance of the Paris Agreement’s lower limit or the 1.5 degree C goal is now certain, the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap report, indicates. “New scenarios show that limiting warming to 1.5 degree C by 2100 remains technically possible. However, due to the continued delay in deep emission cuts, 1.5 degree C pathways now imply higher temporary exceedance of this temperature target. The magnitude and duration of this overshoot must be limited as much as possible. Each year of delayed action locks in carbon-intensive infrastructure. It results in greater losses for people and ecosystems, higher adaptation costs and a heavier reliance on costly and uncertain carbon dioxide (CO2) removal,” the report has said.

Further, The Global Tipping Points Report 2025, by the University of Exeter and international partners including the Stockholm Resilience Centre, found that widespread mortality of warm-water coral reefs is now underway as the world reaches its first climate tipping point. Forests are also an important issue. Brazil, the host of COP30 officially launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit on Thursday. The TFFF is an initiative that incentivizes the conservation and expansion of tropical forests by making annual payments to Tropical Forest Countries that maintain their standing forest. India will join the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), Brazil’s global initiative to curb deforestation, as an “observer,” Dinesh Bhatia, ambassador of India to Brazil said in his statement on day 2 of the Belem Leaders’ Summit on Friday.

“The Amazon embodies the truth that awaits us in Belém: the future of humanity and the health of the planet are inseparable. The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance. If the Amazon crosses its tipping point, the planet will struggle to recover equilibrium, Lago has said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/09/1600x900/logo/A-tourist-poses-for-a-picture-with-COP30-mascot-in_1762714132075.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 01:00:32.616208

“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines.
Even if these fuel and emissions savings are slightly less important for IMO compliance in the immediate term, commercially they cannot be overlooked.","“While we support the IMO in getting these vital regulations right, the vote to delay the Net-Zero Framework for a year will make progress more challenging. If global regulatory development breaks down further and the delay extends beyond 12-months, instead of one global framework, shipping could face a potential patchwork of regional emissions schemes with different compliance systems. Without the right support, this fragmentation would delay decision-making and keep current uncertainties around monitoring and reporting unresolved for the people working in shipping.

“The key here will be data management and integration. Whether it’s propulsion systems, voyage planning, onboard workflow, or design processes, the future of ship operations will favor solutions that connect data, technology and people seamlessly. Any regulation or technology that compounds the industry fragmentation will only add to the workload challenge, rather than help operators, seafarers and shoreside staff to support compliance and safe operations.

“The IMO’s decision does create more certainty that FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) will remain front and centre for longer.

“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines. Penalties are robustly enforced and, at €2,400 per ton VLSFO energy equivalent, they are high enough to encourage investment in alternative green fuels. With renewable fuel energy density, availability and cost in mind – this can, in turn, increase demand for efficiency technologies.

“Navigating the regulatory maze is imperative, but the reality is, many technologies already make commercial sense right now. Take wind propulsion, for example. Installations have doubled over the past two years, reflecting how operators now see this as a financially viable solution, regardless of the Net-Zero Framework, and not an experiment. Voyage optimization is another example. What was once a ‘nice to have’ is now a boardroom priority, because the savings on fuel and emissions directly impact competitiveness.

“Our joint simulation project between NAPA, Norsepower, and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Marine & Engineering, for example, has validated the emissions reduction potential of combining wind propulsion with voyage optimization. The study has confirmed that the combination can deliver up to 28% emissions reductions on average. Even if these fuel and emissions savings are slightly less important for IMO compliance in the immediate term, commercially they cannot be overlooked.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:30.454028

Outside of the container lines, Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).
Fossil fuel carriers continue to make up around 20% of all EU shipping emissions, similar to 2018 levels.","EU shipping emissions reached their highest levels last year since the EU introduced mandatory reporting in 2018, T&E’s analysis of official EU MRV data shows. A jump of 13% came despite a downtick in EU-related seaborne trade, with disruption of trade through the Red Sea likely leading to longer routes. Last year’s record emissions levels show how important it is that emissions are priced by the EU, says T&E, which calls for an expansion to smaller vessels.

Container ships were the main drivers of increased emissions with a 46% increase. This is likely explained by an 18% increase in the average distance sailed and 3% average growth in operational speeds, as well as an increase in the number of ships needed to service longer routes. Shipping emissions are very sensitive to operational speeds as each 1% increase in speed can result in a 3% growth in emissions.

Agathe Peigney, maritime transport policy officer at T&E, said: “Last year’s record pollution shows that even when trade declines, disruption can lead to increased emissions from ships. With the inadequate IMO deal being shelved, the ETS carbon price has never been so crucial.”

The ETS for shipping has now been in place for almost two years and is proving effective, with around 99% compliance already in the first year. The upcoming review is a chance for the EU to stay the course on maritime climate regulation by strengthening and extending the system to ensure all polluters pay their fair share, says T&E.

MSC remains the most polluting shipping company in the EU, responsible for 15.6 million tonnes of CO2. Outside of the container lines, Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).

Despite Europe using ever more renewable energy, imports of fossil fuels remain stubbornly high. Fossil fuel carriers continue to make up around 20% of all EU shipping emissions, similar to 2018 levels. Emissions from LNG carriers have been growing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but did decrease in 2024. Emissions from transporting crude oil rose to 2019 highs.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:44.658129

The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.
According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions.
Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory.","The tanker and oil markets are expected to face a different landscape, as a result of the latest policy choices by the US presidency. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “Trump’s second presidency started with a strong push to change US environmental policy. Right at the start, the president put in motion the plan to re-exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which established a framework to encourage domestic energy production and weaken the electric vehicle (EV) mandate. In the months that followed, federal lands and offshore areas previously off-limits to drilling were reopened for leasing, and several LNG export projects were reapproved. The Interior Department cleared new exploration in Alaska’s Arctic zones, while the Bureau of Land Management simplified environmental reviews for oil and gas projects in the western states. Still, several of these actions are facing ongoing legal challenges from environmental groups, and whilst headlines show US crude production reaching record levels this year, the bigger picture is that growth in output is slowing, with production expected to remain largely flat year-on-year in 2026. Companies remain cautious about spending on the back of lower oil prices and expectations of rising oversupply. The oil rig count declined in August to its lowest level in nearly four years, although a modest uptick has been seen since then. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.

According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to roll back rules finalised in 2024 that require carmakers to sell more electric or low-emission cars from model year 2027 onward, with the process well underway. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has begun relaxing fuel efficiency targets. Separately, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” reduced or cancelled several clean-energy incentives introduced under Biden’s “Inflation Reduction Act.” In particular, tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs are no longer available after September 30. While the reversal of these policies is being legally challenged on many fronts, the industry response is already visible. Several automakers have slowed their EV rollout plans. For example, General Motors, the largest US carmaker, recently acknowledged it is scaling back its EV ambitions by slowing production at EV plants and shifting investment toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles in response to the changing regulatory framework and weaker demand”.

“Changes to EV targets are expected to slow the decline in US oil demand. Ernst & Young now expects EVs to account for half of new US car sales by 2038, five years later than initially projected. The decline in US refining runs will also be shallower than previously envisaged, which will have implications for tanker trade. It will reduce US crude export potential, with more barrels retained domestically. At the same time, this will also add an element of support to US crude imports, mainly sourced from the Atlantic Basin. On the products side, stronger runs suggest additional CPP export potential; however, much will depend on underlying domestic demand levels”, the shipbroker said.

Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory. The agency is due to publish its long-term view of energy markets next week, where it will reintroduce the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published in 2019. This scenario reflects only policies already in place, without assuming new measures, announcements, or enhanced targets. The agency will continue publishing its Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which goes one step further and includes both implemented policies and officially announced plans or targets that are likely to be implemented”.

“In the maritime sector, strong US opposition to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) was perhaps the key reason why the final vote on the agreed plan has been delayed by twelve months. In the weeks preceding the vote, the Trump administration warned that nations supporting the NZF could face retaliatory measures, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties. As a result, the industry is now facing an increased level of uncertainty – it is unlikely that the framework will be adopted in its current form next year”, Gibson noted.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:50.547860
