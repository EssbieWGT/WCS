The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, proposed a global carbon tax on the shipping industry.
Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming.
It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act.

Last month, the United Nations attempted to pass the first ever global carbon tax. It won’t be the last.

This would have increased the cost of energy, food, and fuel around the world. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency of the United Nations, proposed a global carbon tax on the shipping industry. This agency would have collected the revenue and then distributed it for such things as rewarding “low-emission ships” and for U.N. income redistribution schemes to “mitigate negative [climate] impacts on vulnerable nations.” I wonder if this is how the U.N. seeks to make up for lost USAID revenue.

This tax is especially egregious because it was a violation of the sovereignty of the U.S. and other nations. A U.N. international body would be imposing a tax on Americans, something that appears to be a first. The tax, according to the State Department, would have increased global shipping costs by over ten percent.

It’s also yet another example of liberal Europe and the U.N. trying to dictate the climate policies of other countries and enrich themselves in the process.

It isn’t enough that EU nations have adopted harmful policies that punish energy use and increase prices for their own citizens. They need to make sure other countries hurt themselves too, including developing countries that need fossil fuels to advance the well-being of their citizens.

Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming. A tax delayed is not a tax canceled.

The IMO tax, though, is far from the only effort to impose climate policies on other countries. This past July, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, issued a nonbinding advisory opinion that reads more like a climate manifesto than an example of logical legal reasoning. It concluded that member states have a duty to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act. Sin or crime?

As a vote over this global carbon tax approached last month, President Trump himself took to Truth Social, calling the proposal a ""global green new scam tax on shipping."" His administration released a statement, warning that the U.S. was considering additional tariffs, visa restrictions, additional port fees, and sanctions on officials from countries that voted for this climate tax. They also encouraged other nations to abandon the deal.

The campaign succeeded. Last month, at the tail end of negotiations, Saudi Arabia abruptly called for a vote to adjourn the IMO meeting for one year without making a decision on the net-zero framework. The proposed delay was voted on immediately and passed with 57 countries in favor and 49 against. (Twenty-one countries abstained from the vote.)

Em Fenton, a senior director at Opportunity Green, a U.K.-based radical environmentalist group said ""The outcome in October is a devastating blow for climate multilateralism."" Good.

I assume that the General Conference and ADCOM—who tend to side with the United Nations on global warming/climate change alarmism—are similarly disappointed.

Good.

While the global shipping industry faces steep challenges in cutting emissions, Patrick Kettschau, managing director of Everllence China, points to China's integrated supply chain — from shipyards to alternative fuel production — as a critical solution.

""While decarbonizing the global shipping industry remains a long-term challenge, China, an indispensable partner in this endeavor, is emerging as a driving force in this transformation,"" he said.

""This is thanks to its strong industrial base, world-leading shipbuilding capacity and growing strength in renewable energy.""

As the world's largest consumer and producer of renewable energy, China plays a pivotal role in the transition. Its position as a strategic hub for international shipping and a major investor in clean technologies has attracted multinational collaboration in recent years, he added.

Everllence, which is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, has been expanding its investment in key technologies, including future fuel engines, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and industrial heat pumps, to support the decarbonization and digital transformation of the global shipping industry, he said.

According to Kettschau, partnerships with Chinese companies have been focusing on developing low and zero carbon engine solutions powered by clean fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and ammonia dual-fuel engines.

""These collaborations are advancing next-generation technologies while driving the integration of innovation, local manufacturing and sustainable growth,"" he said.

The push for greener shipping is reshaping China's energy landscape.

In August, the National Energy Administration formally recognized green liquid fuels, including green ammonia and green methanol, as renewable energy sources, sending a strong signal to the market while aligning with surging global demand.

The global green fuel market, according to market research firm Verified Market Reports, was valued at $70.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $175.1 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.66 percent.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) predicts that by 2050, green methanol demand could hit 190 million metric tons, comprising 42 percent of the shipping fuel mix, while fossil fuels shrink to 15 percent.

Beyond the vessels themselves, Chinese utilities are also targeting the carbon footprint of the shipbuilding process.

State Grid Nantong Power Supply Co recently launched a pilot program to create ""near-zero carbon ""shipyards, implementing precise carbon management across the manufacturing cycle.

By replacing traditional ceramic heating with electromagnetic induction in the welding stage, the project improved heating efficiency by 50 percent and cut power consumption by 60 percent, it said during this year's United Nations climate change conference, or COP30.

In the coating workshop, which accounts for the bulk of energy use, smart temperature controls reduced electricity usage by 30 percent, while further efficiency gains were realized in the assembly stage, where upgrading air compressors cut power use by 40 percent.

The company has also deployed an AI-driven digital energy management platform, allowing shipyards to schedule energy-intensive production during low-cost electricity periods, creating a commercially viable road map for green manufacturing in the heavy industry sector.

Everllence has just unveiled its new, dual-fuel ME-LGIA (liquid gas injection ammonia) engine. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement. It is another concrete step to advance the green transition and toward a climate-neutral future, said Kettschau.

""With more than a century of history in China, strong local production capabilities in collaboration with our Chinese ship engine licensees, and a shared commitment to a sustainable future, Everllence will continue working hand-in-hand with Chinese partners,"" he said.

""We are committed to helping achieve the nation's dual carbon goals and accelerate the global shipping industry's green transition, contributing lasting momentum to the world's shift toward a low-carbon energy and industrial system.""",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202511/25/692508a3a310d68600f2e436.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 20:57:12.692203

“EST-Floattech was an important knowledge partner while developing the project, helping us to achieve the right capacity on board for the sailing profile and contributing ideas about the most suitable charging solution.”

Jansma Shipyard retrofitted barges for ROS and Ofi for their respective E-Pusher projects and Hydromaster supplied 300-kW electric-driven outboard azimuth thrusters for each of Kotug’s E-Pusher tugboats.

“Together, we are enabling ROS to realise a fully sustainable transport chain”

For MNO-e, it supplied two Hydromaster-series 4, L-drive, azimuth thrusters fixed to the transom of the pusher vessel, driven by a vertically mounted variable speed electric motor.

In Q2 2025, Hydromaster said it had received a follow-up order for electric-driven thrusters from Kotug for an even larger E-Pusher design.

“Collaboration is going very well,” said Kotug chief executive Ard-Jan Kooren. “Together, we are enabling ROS to realise a fully sustainable transport chain.”

EST-Floattech chief executive Mark Witjens said, “We believe the energy transition in shipping will only succeed if we help our customers to sail emissions-free.

“The TCF blower reduces emissions” These increases in performance are achieved in a much more compact design than previous turbocharger series.

Turbochargers are constantly evolving. The latest-generation TCRs are made from more advanced materials that enable them to be more efficient and reliable, while also being more powerful and lighter. With lower cost of running in mind, the new materials mean less maintenance and a longer working life.

As Everllence’s ETB model illustrates, turbochargers are specifically designed to match every engine, in this case for EcoEGR applications in which the blower runs continuously in Tier III and Tier II Eco mode. Introduced some six years ago, EcoEGR has since been widely deployed in marine engines in the interests of lower emissions.

The ETB range was designed from the outset to marry up with the EGR system, a breakthrough in engine tuning. Under EGR, fuel consumption and NOx emissions are reduced in large turbocharged diesel engines so that the performance of the engine and blower are re-optimised. Typically, the blower runs continuously in both Tier III and Tier II Eco mode. Real-world tests show a 5% improvement in charging efficiency, a 10% increase in specific airflow and, especially impressive, a 25% gain in charging pressure.

“The TCF blower reduces emissions”

These increases in performance are achieved in a much more compact design than previous turbocharger series. Weight is down by roughly 40% and overall size by 30%.

Radial blower

Everllence’s TCF radial blower, optimised for maximum flow, is designed to function at part load. As tests have proved, a TCF retrofit and engine modification package improved fuel consumption in the relevant operating range by 4.5%. The TCF blower also reduces emissions to help meet regulations such as the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI). The modular construction of the TCF makes for easy installation. In two-stage applications the TCF series works as the low-pressure turbocharger, a configuration that helps reduce the size or number of blowers required in ways that cut costs.

And as demand for retrofits grows, the TCFs are designed for quick and easy replacement because of the modular construction and standard connection dimensions. The range is also known for easy maintenance and extended periods between overhauls.

Heritage

Everllence’s latest designs build on a long heritage. Its first turbochargers were installed some 80 years ago and quickly built up a loyal following for their reliability. Today, they run on 65,000 engines in what amounts to a giant real-world laboratory that underpins a constant improvement.

The TCP range, for instance, is a product of that mindset, enabling output increases of about 20% that operators can exploit in their own way. Everllence explained: “That translates to increased power at a similar cost, or a smaller engine, or fewer cylinders for the same output.”

The numbers tell the story. Current one-stage blowers typically deliver pressure ratios of well above 5.0, while the TCPs achieve stable operating points as high as 6.7. These figures result from a complete reworking of the aerodynamic stages on the compressor and turbine sides. In other numbers, overall efficiency levels are improved by about 70%, dynamic behaviour in the form of the rotor moment of inertia is down by 25%, and specific engine costs by 20%. Maximum permissible temperature is 650-750C. And in the interests of ease of installation, the TCPs are plug-and-play because the flange connections are the same as existing turbochargers. The range is suitable for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol, as well as conventional fuels.

Blowers are some of the hardest-working items in the engineroom and even the most robust turbochargers can suffer failures. Everllence offers its PrimeServ 24/7 year-round troubleshooting service. Technicians are always available to deal with questions from the engineroom and get the blowers back up and working. In the worst case, OEM spare parts are only 24-hours away. Everllence prides itself on rapid deliveries and that is useful when downtime costs US$22,000 a day and often much more. With strategically placed hubs around the world, PrimeServ’s technicians can adjust on the spot if a ship misses a routine maintenance stop because of a changed route.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/184/TCF_turbocharger_on_left_MAN_ESwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-24 16:56:45.420514

The event highlighted how the IMO’s adoption of the Net Zero Framework, originally scheduled, has been postponed once again, leaving the private and commercial sectors without the regulatory push needed for fleet decarbonization.

The delay, announced on October 17 following a direct intervention by then-President Trump, has raised questions about what went wrong, what lessons can be learned, and how the superyacht industry can proactively prepare for an uncertain regulatory landscape.

The panel was moderated by Lorenzo Pollicardo, Technical and Environmental Director at SYBAss, with experts including Julian Amith (Cayman Island Shipping Registry), Simone Brucker (Sanlorenzo R&D), Engel Jan De Boer (Lloyd Register), and Robert Van Tol (Water Revolution Foundation).

Ocean Assist: A New Tool for the Industry

At the center of the discussion was the Ocean Assist program, promoted by the Water Revolution Foundation, aimed at converting voluntary industry actions into certified, measurable investments for ocean conservation. Vienna Eleuteri, Vice President of the Foundation, explained that Ocean Assist turns donations and offsets into units generated by tangible projects, including blue carbon restoration, marine biodiversity recovery, and coastal community regeneration. Transparency is ensured through independent verification according to ISO 14064 part 3 standards, avoiding greenwashing and guaranteeing measurable outcomes.

Georgina Van Henniet, Head of Sustainability at Burgess, emphasized the practical value of the program for daily fleet operations: beyond reducing environmental impact, it prepares crews and operators for future regulatory requirements, translating emission reductions into certified, actionable results.

Challenges and Opportunities: From Regulation to Daily Practice

A major topic was the relationship between international regulation and voluntary industry initiatives. Fiorenzo Spadoni (RINA) highlighted how ISO certification provides credibility and rigor, distinguishing solid programs from marketing claims. The panel also discussed technological and operational limitations, such as using alternative fuels like methanol in various vessel constructions and the need for crew training, emphasizing that innovations must be implemented safely and with the right infrastructure.

Georgina Van Henniet noted that practical adoption is still in its early stages: the global fleet comprises around 6,000 yachts over 30 meters, with 170 new units delivered annually. Managing emissions requires a gradual but systemic approach, starting with measurable portions of the fleet and assets while anticipating future IMO regulations.

Robert Van Tol compared fiscal tools with offset programs like Ocean Assist, showing how voluntary participation today can prepare owners and operators for stricter future regulations, optimizing both cost and impact.

Current Status and Outlook

The delay in adopting the Net Zero Framework represents a strategic opportunity for the superyacht industry: the unregulated fleet can develop and implement sustainable practices in advance, potentially influencing future IMO guidelines for small ships and yachts. The forum’s key message was clear: immediate action, transparency, and collaboration among operators, foundations, and certification bodies are essential to building a sustainable, future-ready sector.

In conclusion, even in the absence of immediate obligations, the industry has a clear path: adopt tools like Ocean Assist, anticipate regulatory requirements, and create a measurable positive impact on the oceans, turning the challenge of decarbonization into an opportunity for leadership and innovation in the superyacht sector.

At a glance COP 30 in Belém showcased both progress and shortcomings in global climate action.","Framed around the theme of implementation, the conference focused less on setting new aspirations and more on translating ambition into concrete action. However, many observers described it as a “COP of truth,” highlighting the deep divisions and deviations from shared climate goals that became evident.

Critics argue that while COP 30 made strides in funding and measurement, it fell short on mitigation ambition, with UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, saying:

I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide

In any case, At COP30, 195 Parties adopted the Belém Package, approving 29 decisions on topics like just transition, adaptation finance, trade, gender, and technology.

Main take‑aways from COP 30, reflecting both its progress and its persistent tensions, include:

Global mutirão

The main formal decision of COP30 issued a historic call for humanity to unite in a global mutirão (collective efforts) against climate change, marking a new chapter for the climate regime.

As we leave Belém, this moment must not be remembered as the end of a conference, but as the beginning of a decade of turning the game

… said COP30 President, André Corrêa do Lago, adding that “the spirit we built here does not end with the gavel; it continues in every government meeting, every boardroom and trade union, every classroom, laboratory, forest community, large city, and coastal town.”

Adaptation finance: tripling support by 2035

The approved decisions in the Belém Package include a commitment to triple adaptation finance by 2035, emphasizing the need for developed countries to significantly boost climate finance for developing nations.

Parties also concluded the Baku Adaptation Roadmap (launched during COP 29), which approves and establishes the work for 2026-2028, until the next Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement. This initiative supports vulnerable countries by promoting innovative financing and technical aid for National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

Measuring adaptation: indicators and monitoring

COP 30 also saw the adoption of 59 global indicators designed to track progress under the Global Goal on Adaptation. These indicators span areas like water, food security, public health, infrastructure, and livelihoods.

In addition, the conference launched a Global Implementation Accelerator aimed at helping countries deliver on their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and their national adaptation plans.

Just transition mechanism

COP 30 established a Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) to facilitate fairness as economies shift to a greener model. The mechanism is intended to provide technical assistance, capacity-building, knowledge sharing, and other support to countries and communities vulnerable to the social and economic risks of decarbonization.

Fossil fuel roadmap: a major controversy

At COP30, many countries pushed for a binding global roadmap to phase out fossil fuels, but strong opposition from major oil-producing nations prevented any mandatory language from being included in the final negotiated text.

In response, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago announced two voluntary roadmaps outside the formal UN process: one outlining a “just, orderly and equitable” transition away from fossil fuels, and another aimed at halting and reversing deforestation. Because these initiatives were launched by the COP Presidency rather than negotiated and adopted by all Parties, they carry political rather than legal weight.

Many observers saw this as a diluted outcome, signaling how deep divisions remain on fossil fuel phase-out.

Tropical forests forever facility

In a major win for forest conservation, COP 30 launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF). This denotes a blended-finance investment fund aimed at channeling public and private finance to reward tropical forest protection.

Institutional and gender equality dimensions

COP 30 reaffirmed the importance of gender-responsive climate action, supporting a strengthened Gender Action Plan to ensure that women and girls are central in adaptation and resilience efforts.

Also, there was a renewed push for institutional cooperation: capacity‑building, technology transfer, and knowledge-sharing mechanisms were reaffirmed as key levers for global climate progress.

Maritime developments at COP 30

Shipping and maritime transport received particular attention at COP 30, especially regarding black carbon, decarbonization, and the role of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

IMO leadership & vision

IMO leadership played a visible role at COP 30. The IMO Secretary-General used the platform to advocate for a green future for shipping, emphasizing the urgency of shifting toward zero-carbon fuels, modern technologies, and comprehensive regulation.

I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization. Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own

… the Sec-Gen highlighted.

At the same time, IMO’s Director of Marine Environment acknowledged a “setback” related to progress on the Net Zero Forum but insisted the IMO would continue pushing forward. He argued that the setback should not derail ambition and that the long-term vision for green shipping remains intact.

Shipping decarbonization ambitions

Various stakeholders, including NGOs and industry actors, called for accelerated action on shipping decarbonization. Their calls included demands for stricter policies, stronger incentives for alternative fuels, and more support for vulnerable countries.

For instance, Danish Shipping announced they will strengthen their climate ambitions, pledging to intensify efforts to reduce emissions, possibly by investing in greener fuels and improving energy efficiency.

Integration into global action

A Task Force on Oceans was unveiled during a high-level ministerial meeting at COP30. Led by Brazil and France, the initiative integrates oceans into a global mechanism that accelerates the adoption of marine solutions in national climate plans.

It also builds on the work of the Blue Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Challenge, which encourages countries to set ocean protection targets when updating their NDCs.

Other significant COP 30 maritime decarbonization milestones include:

Maersk announced plans to operate 41 methanol-enabled vessels by 2027.

Los Angeles–Long Beach–Shanghai Green Shipping Corridor achieved first milestones with 100% electrification in 3 ports, deployment of the first green methanol container ship, and Port of Shanghai bunkering 47,000 tonnes of green methanol.

C40 Cities, supported by the IFC and IAPH, launched a new Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative targeting USD 1 billion in green maritime infrastructure investment within three years, focusing on Global South ports.

Port of Açu (Brazil) and Port of Antwerp-Bruges (Belgium) announced a green shipping corridor between Brazil and Europe.

Marine Biodiversity & Ocean Health Toolkit launched as a practical resource for the maritime value chain, helping shipping reduce biodiversity impacts, improve operational performance, and support a resilient ocean economy.

Climate risk assessment pilot in an African port, with over 30 ports signing the Call to Action to mainstream resilience in business operations. This represents one of the fastest and broadest commitments by the port industry to integrate climate adaptation into core strategies.

Furthermore, nine countries agreed to slash black carbon emissions, a potent short-lived climate pollutant emitted by ships (among other sources).

At a glance

COP 30 in Belém showcased both progress and shortcomings in global climate action. The summit advanced adaptation finance, institutional tools, and tracking systems.

However, it fell short on a binding fossil fuel phase-out and strong mitigation pledges, disappointing many observers and raising questions about sustained momentum.

In the maritime sector, COP 30 enhanced shipping commitments, with the IMO showing active leadership.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior.
“The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated.
About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period.
The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised.","Following the closing of the COP30 climate summit this weekend, the Clean Arctic Alliance criticised the lack of action on fossil fuels, and failure to harness potential quick victories from cutting black carbon and other short-lived climate forcers.

“COP30 promised so much - it’s disappointing that it delivered so little”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “There was a clear lack of urgency amongst governments, in the face of the climate crisis, with a complete dearth of official COP30 attention to easy wins on short-lived climate forcers - like black carbon.”

“However, with less than a fortnight to go for governments to submit a plan for cutting a plan for cutting black carbon emissions from shipping in the Arctic, International Maritime Organization member states - led by Arctic governments - must now respond to the high-level announcement made by several governments - including Canada - at COP30 on sectoral action to tackle black carbon emissions from commercial and residential energy and transport sources”, added Prior.

“These countries clearly recognise the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic”, said Prior.

“Addressing black carbon offers a unique opportunity to advance climate change mitigation, build climate resilience, improve air quality, safeguard public health, and deliver

sustainable development co-benefits”, said the statement by Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Madagascar, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Uganda.

Governments need to urgently act ahead of the December 5th deadline for proposals on polar fuels, ahead of a meeting of the IMO’s Pollution Prevention and Response committee (PPR 13) in February 2026 in London that will set rules on what fuels can be used in the immediate future by shipping in the Arctic.

Momentum towards these polar fuels is building: the Nordic Council of Ministers recently recommended that Nordic governments work towards the recognition of polar fuels by the IMO and the MARPOL Convention. Now, during COP30, governments have again recognised the need for urgent action on a potent, short-lived superpollutant where action now could make a real difference in mitigating the impact of climate change and also improve air quality and public health for communities in the Arctic.

“As this announcement from COP30 shows, the world is starting to take urgent action on black carbon emissions - we need Arctic governments to take action ahead of the IMO’s December 5th deadline, in order to dramatically reduce black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor, of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “By making cleaner fuels (polar fuels) mandatory for shipping in this unique region that is already being dramatically affected by climate change, Arctic governments - and other IMO member states - have a unique opportunity to demonstrate joint leadership on this issue”.

“Black carbon is one of the longest, unresolved issues running at the IMO, and must now be dealt with without delay”, said Prior. “The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has spent more than a decade on scientific analysis and discussions, but black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping remain unregulated. The next opportunity comes in February 2026, when the IMO’s Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response will meet (PPR 13) to discuss polar fuels.”

“A strong agreement on polar fuels to set rules which will reduce black carbon emission levels from shipping in the Arctic region is essential”, added Prior. “The deadline for submitting proposals is December 5th - and we want to see a concrete proposal led by Arctic states, including Canada, Norway, Iceland, Denmark/Greenland, on polar fuels that will ensure a rapid reduction in Arctic black carbon emissions, ahead of longer-term decarbonisation efforts.”

A regulation requiring the use of polar fuels in the Arctic must set the foundation in MARPOL Annex VI (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) for reductions in emissions which reduce the impact of black carbon on the Arctic.

A recent report by NGO Pacific Environment lays out the case for why the International Maritime Organization (IMO) should immediately act on reducing black carbon pollution — a climate super-pollutant. On Thin Ice: Why Black Carbon Demands Urgent Action, explores how the expansion of Arctic shipping is causing an increase in the release of black carbon into the air, which then settles on snow and ice, accelerating dangerous melting. Switching to readily available and cleaner “polar fuels” — such as marine distillates DMA and DMZ or new fuels with comparable black carbon emissions levels — will rapidly cut emissions, protect vulnerable ecosystems and safeguard communities.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than sixteen hundred times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processes are nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Clean_Arctic_Alliance_COP30.png,N,,2025-11-24 11:56:19.722393

Clean Seas to tackle ocean plastic

Our oceans underpin global trade and face mounting plastic challenges

Oceans carry around 90% of global trade and provide livelihoods for more than 2 million seafarers worldwide. Yet they face unprecedented pressure, with 14 million tonnes of plastic entering and damaging marine ecosystems every year.

While the maritime sector contributes only a small fraction of this pollution, even isolated cargo losses or poor waste handling on board or quayside can have serious consequences which could be prevented, especially with plastic pellets, films and light packaging. By advancing best practices, innovation, and collaboration across the value chain, the industry can play a pivotal role in reducing plastic leakage and protecting the very waters it relies on.

A pivotal moment for maritime sustainability

MACS builds on the IMO’s established Plastic Marine Litter Action Plan and responds to the growing global sentiment for coordinated, industry-wide action on plastic pollution.

As scrutiny around environmental and community impact intensifies, MACS creates a unified front for maritime players to reduce plastic use, share best practices, and inspire change across adjacent sectors with even larger plastic footprints.

Collective action for measurable impact

MACS builds on SCS’ track record of tackling plastic pollution at its source. Operating in some of the world’s most polluted coastal regions, SCS develops holistic certified recovery projects that not only recover ocean plastic but also deliver fair employment and community impact on the ground.

The Association brings maritime leaders together to tackle two core objectives of ocean plastic recovery at scale and waste reduction across the maritime value chain, with the initial focus for 2026 on three key areas:

Sustainable procurement and material use;

Vessel waste measurement and reduction;

And improved portside waste reception.

These efforts align directly with the IMO’s 2030 Action Plan. It also marks a key milestone in SCS’ mission to recover 100,000,000 kilograms of plastic and improve 200,000 lives by 2030, proving how targeted collaboration can drive systemic change and inspire far-reaching environmental progress.

“Seven Clean Seas has always believed in collective action as the most powerful lever for change,” said Tom Peacock-Nazil, Founder & Chairman of MACS. “With MACS, we’re providing the maritime industry with the tools it needs to make measurable progress against plastic pollution. Not in isolation, but together.”

Driving systemic change through collaboration

Founding members Berge Bulk, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), X-Press Feeders, and Britoil Offshore Services represent a cross-section of the global maritime sector, from bulk carriers and ship management to offshore operations. Their participation reflects a shared commitment to operational excellence, environmental leadership, and data transparency.

“At Berge Bulk, the oceans are at the heart of our business, so we have always felt an obligation to protect them and a responsibility to keep them clean,” said Michael Blanding, Head of Sustainability & Communications. “Our long-standing work with SCS has already delivered tangible results, and through MACS, we’re proud to help lead a united industry response that can achieve change at scale.”

Francis Goh, Chief Operating Officer of X-Press Feeders, added, “As a global shipping company, we recognise the responsibility we have to safeguard the oceans that sustain global trade. Our collaboration with SCS goes back several years and joining MACS is a natural extension of our sustainability journey which goes beyond reducing emissions to also address the waste and plastic challenges facing our shared environment. Together with our peers, we can make practical, lasting improvements across the maritime ecosystem.”

“Our work begins and ends with the sea, and with that comes a responsibility to protect it,” said Florent Kirchhoff, Chief Executive Officer of Britoil Offshore Services. “Through this partnership with MACS, Britoil aims to advance responsible operations through collaboration, reflecting our shared care for the oceans and the ingenuity that drives us to find solutions for a better future.”

Elena Pantazidou, HR Director & Board Member of Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, commented, “At Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, we believe that safeguarding our oceans is not just a responsibility but a commitment to future generations. Joining forces as a founding member of the Maritime Association for Clean Seas reflects our dedication to driving sustainable practices across the maritime industry.”

MACS welcomes members who wish to play an active role in shaping a cleaner, more sustainable future for the maritime industry and the oceans that sustain it.

But Zafar believes that, for now, the biggest gains still lie in disciplined engineering and operations onboard today’s tankers.","International shipping, which moves more than four-fifths of world trade, is under growing pressure to clean up its climate footprint. Studies estimate the sector produces around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, putting it on par with a mid-sized industrial economy.

In , the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted a revised greenhouse gas strategy that calls for net-zero emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, with ambitious checkpoints in 2030 and 2040. For tanker fleets trading to and from ports in Pakistan and the wider region, these policies are no longer distant discussions in conference rooms – they are beginning to influence everyday engineering decisions on board.

Among the engineers dealing with these changes at sea is Marine Chief Engineer Zafar Ali, a Pakistani maritime specialist with more than 15 years’ experience on crude oil, product and chemical tankers, currently sailing with a major international ship management company. From drydock projects in Dubai, China and Bahrain to routine voyages, he has seen how environmental rules now sit alongside safety and cost in every major technical choice.

“A few years ago climate felt like a policy topic far away from the engine room,” Zafar says. “Now every big job on a ship comes with three questions: is it safe, is it economical and what does it do to our emissions?”

The regulatory push covers everything from fuel quality to how ships are maintained. The IMO’s

response 2023 strategy is being translated into detailed measures such as stricter carbon-intensity targets, mandatory energy-efficiency plans and the building blocks of a global carbon-pricing regime for shipping. Older tankers that burn more fuel per tonne-mile face increasing pressure to upgrade or risk higher compliance costs.

In Zafar’s experience, the most visible changes on tankers involve the systems that sit around the main engine. Ballast Water Management rules require ships to install and run approved ballast water treatment systems (BWTS) to stop harmful species moving between ports, while exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) help ships meet sulphur limits and cut local air pollution. But he says the real impact comes from how reliably these systems operate.

On one tanker undergoing scheduled repairs in drydock, his team conducted a full overhaul of the existing ballast water system, replacing the original reagent-type TRO (Total Residual Oxidant) sensors with more reliable direct halogen TRO sensors. This upgrade, along with a simplified control layout, improved the system's integration with the ship's automation system, reducing alarms and downtime during port calls. The clearer procedures and better integration enabled the crew to operate the system more efficiently, achieving stable disinfection performance and predictable compliance. Another project focused on fine-tuning of electronic engine settings and tightening up fuel-performance monitoring, leading to noticeable fuel savings over the following trading year.

For Pakistan, these technical details link directly to national climate ambitions. Research suggests that ships serving Pakistani trade routes emit a substantial volume of greenhouse gases each year, contributing to the country’s broader transport-sector emissions. As Pakistan pursues cleaner transport and coastal environments, vessels calling at Karachi, Port Qasim and Gwadar are expected to demonstrate both environmental compliance and operational reliability.

Zafar’s day-to-day role reflects that mix of priorities. He plans drydock work so that conventional maintenance – hull cleaning, machinery overhaul, safety upgrades – is paired with targeted energy-efficiency measures, such as optimising propeller and hull condition, improving boiler settings or adjusting auxiliary power management. He also emphasises data: simple trend charts of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions, he says, often reveal issues before they become expensive problems.

“You can’t treat decarbonisation as a one-off retrofit and tick it off the list,” Zafar says. “The ships, the crew and the shore office all have to treat energy performance as something they manage every day, just like safety.”

Looking ahead, global shipyards are building more dual-fuel vessels capable of running on alternatives such as LNG and methanol, while proposals for a global carbon levy on shipping create additional incentives for low-emission operations. But Zafar believes that, for now, the biggest gains still lie in disciplined engineering and operations onboard today’s tankers.

“New fuels and new designs will arrive in time,” he says. “If we look after the basics – good maintenance, careful energy management and well-trained crews – then when the cleaner technology comes, our ships will be ready to use it responsibly.”",https://www.thefridaytimes.com/digital_images/large/2025-11-24/global-green-rules-reshape-tanker-engineering-says-marine-chief-engineer-zafar-ali-1763983200-9462.jpeg,N,,2025-11-24 08:56:08.926351

DEVELOPMENTS AT ROTTERDAM Rotterdam, the top European port by cargo throughput, is undergoing several expansion projects for LNG and biofuel tanks.
In October, OCI signed a memorandum of understanding with Victrol for ammonia bunkering in Rotterdam, Platts reported earlier.
""We are focused on having the infrastructure for new bunker fuels.""","(Platts)--24Nov2025/703 am EST/1203 GMT **Alternative fuels reach 13.2% of Rotterdam bunker sales in Q3 **IMO Net-Zero Framework delay hampers industry transition **Dutch port adds LNG, biofuel storage and shorepower networks The Dutch port of Rotterdam is pushing ahead with infrastructure expansion for sustainable marine energy, but global decarbonization rules would be required for an industry-wide low-carbon bunker transition, the port's Chief Operating Officer Berte Simons, told Platts, part of S&P Global Energy. LNG and biofuel bunker sales at Rotterdam, the world's second-largest marine refueling hub, have been on an upward trend in recent years, with the port authority kickstarting its pursuit of climate neutrality by 2050. The port reported 2.45 million metric tons of marine fuel sales during July-September, of which alternatives to conventional, oil-based fuels accounted for 13.2%, the highest among major bunker ports. Deliveries of biofuels, composed mainly of biodiesel-fuel oil blends, reached 201,319 mt, and fossil LNG amounted to 121,614 mt. ""For the next few years, we will have LNG there together with new green fuels for quite some time,"" Simons said in a recent interview. ""We have set out to increase the volume of biofuels and to come up with bunkering facilities for new fuels, to work on imports and exports and bunkering strategies for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol."" The continued efforts to decarbonize Rotterdam's bunker mix came despite International Maritime Organization member states voting in mid-October to postpone the Net-Zero Framework by a year, Platts reported earlier. The proposed regulation, backed by the Netherlands and nearly all other EU states, was designed to promote the uptake of low-carbon fuels by placing a cost on maritime greenhouse gas emissions from 2028.

LNG and biofuel bunker sales at Rotterdam, the world's second-largest marine refueling hub, have been on an upward trend in recent years, with the port authority kickstarting its pursuit of climate neutrality by 2050. The port reported 2.45 million metric tons of marine fuel sales during July-September, of which alternatives to conventional, oil-based fuels accounted for 13.2%, the highest among major bunker ports. Deliveries of biofuels, composed mainly of biodiesel-fuel oil blends, reached 201,319 mt, and fossil LNG amounted to 121,614 mt. ""For the next few years, we will have LNG there together with new green fuels for quite some time,"" Simons said in a recent interview. ""We have set out to increase the volume of biofuels and to come up with bunkering facilities for new fuels, to work on imports and exports and bunkering strategies for hydrogen, ammonia and methanol."" The continued efforts to decarbonize Rotterdam's bunker mix came despite International Maritime Organization member states voting in mid-October to postpone the Net-Zero Framework by a year, Platts reported earlier. The proposed regulation, backed by the Netherlands and nearly all other EU states, was designed to promote the uptake of low-carbon fuels by placing a cost on maritime greenhouse gas emissions from 2028.

The organization – MARBEM (Maritime Beyond Methane) – advocates for a ‘beyond methane’ mindset, arguing that this approach will enable the maritime sector to transition toward long-term solutions capable of achieving net-zero emissions. While significant regulatory intervention is still lacking, the experts emphasize that pursuing a methane-free future would help create a resilient, future-proof maritime industry. They also outline their plans to strengthen the integrity of global decarbonization efforts.

SAFETY4SEA: What was the main motivation behind launching Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM), and what gap does it fill in current maritime decarbonization efforts?

The motivation for Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM) is to provide clarity and alignment around maritime decarbonization pathways. The current landscape is dominated by regulatory uncertainty and fragmented policies, enabling pseudo solutions – such as methane-based fuels – to gain market share, without regulators fully accounting for the long-term political, financial, economic, health and social risks. MARBEM fills this gap by providing independent, evidence-based analyses and expert insights to help decision-makers assess material risks, understand transition pathways, and establish 1.5 °C-aligned regulatory and environmental objectives.

S4S: What are your top priorities for the next five years?

Over the next five years, a central priority is to inform regulatory clarity and strengthen accountability for methane emissions within the IMO’s mid-term strategy and within regional regulatory frameworks, such as FuelEU. We want to establish comprehensive regulatory frameworks that:

Adopt measured, evidence-based LNG emission factors from well-to-wake to ensure alignment with real-world performance data.

Account for methane’s full climate and societal impacts in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines, including its short-term warming potential (GWP20), as well as associated leakage, environmental, and health externalities.

Prevent market distortion by avoiding incentives or crediting mechanisms that reward LNG as a transitional fuel despite its climate risks.

Expand control measures to address all methane emission sources onboard ships, covering main and auxiliary engines, and also fugitive and process-related emissions.

Encourage economic measures that enable a Just and Equitable Transition and uphold the polluter-pays principle.

If we can strengthen the integrity of decarbonization efforts, we can move the sector tangibly towards true net-zero emissions. In our work to reduce the impact of emissions of super-pollutants from shipping in the Arctic, we want to urgently reduce black carbon emissions by moving to cleaner fuels but in doing so avoid moving from oil-based fuels to gas-based fuels i.e. LNG which would simply result in reducing emissions of one super-pollutant (black carbon) but increasing emissions of another (methane).

S4S: How does MARBEM define “beyond methane” — and what fuels or technologies does the initiative consider truly future-ready?

“Beyond methane” reflects a transition toward long-term solutions that are capable of achieving net-zero emissions. To achieve this, fuels and technologies must be climate-aligned, regulation-ready, and capable of delivering genuine decarbonization outcomes across their full life cycle. Methane is a super-pollutant, with a global warming potential 82.5 times that of CO₂ over 20 years and 29.8 times over 100 years. Its atmospheric concentration has more than doubled in the past two centuries, contributing an estimated 20–30% of observed global warming. In maritime transport, methane-based fuels – including fossil, bio, and e-LNG – remain the primary source of methane emissions, with these rising 180% between 2016 and 2023 from LNG-fuelled ships.

S4S: The maritime sector already hosts numerous decarbonization alliances — what distinguishes MARBEM’s approach or methodology from others?

Our work connects the micro-level analysis of methane-based fuels with the macro-level context of global decarbonization policy and finance. We focus on bridging the gap between high-level climate ambitions and practical decision-making by translating complex technical and academic research into actionable items for policymakers, financiers, and industry leaders. Unlike many initiatives that adopt a neutral approach, MARBEM provides clarity by identifying both what is and what is not a viable long-term solution. Understanding pseudo-solutions and “non-solutions” is essential to effective risk management — it enables decision-makers to avoid investments and policies that may increase exposure to stranded assets, regulatory misalignment, or reputational risk. Our evidence-based approach emphasizes data, measurability, and regulatory relevance and scenarios to support the sector to align investment and policy choices with scientifically grounded, net-zero pathways.

S4S: What are the most promising zero-emission fuel pathways MARBEM sees emerging as alternatives to LNG and other methane-based fuels?

From a precautionary and energy-centric perspective—rather than a narrow, fuel-centric one—wind propulsion and electrification technologies stand out as the most promising zero-emission and low-cost energy pathways for shipping. By delivering propulsive energy directly to the vessel, wind propulsion removes the climate, environmental, and social externalities associated with fuel life cycles, including extraction, production, and distribution. Energy efficiency is an underutilized tool with great potential to reduce emissions while cutting operational costs. This recent World Bank publication demonstrates that improving energy efficiency can reduce global shipping’s GHG emissions by up to roughly 40% by 2030 – surpassing the IMO’s current interim targets – while also cutting the overall cost of the transition, with annual savings of up to $220 billion. Let’s also consider that approximately 38% of global maritime trade volume is currently dedicated to oil and gas transport (UNCTAD, 2024). As the world is making the transition toward a zero-emissions future, we have a unique opportunity to rethink trade structures, volumes and cargoes at a systems level. Global trade will remain necessary but sourcing goods more locally and restructuring regionally can help to create a sector that is able to operate within planetary boundaries.

S4S: With the IMO’s delay in adopting the Net-Zero Framework, how do you see MARBEM contributing to a stronger and more inclusive outcome over the next year?

This one-year delay opens an opportunity for greater clarity, alignment, and integrity in the end result. Over the next year, we will focus on developing independent analyses, case studies and reports to increase political awareness of the myriad of risks associated with methane-based fuels in the shipping sector. Providing this data will allow member states to come to an informed decision while also ensuring the adopted framework achieves tangible GHG reductions and delivers on its goals. We need to focus on evidence and transparency, with specific emphasis on real-world data that accurately accounts for methane’s climate impacts and market realities. By translating complex technical and policy insights into clear, actionable analyses, we aim to support member states with their role in strengthening the framework.

S4S: What innovations in ship design, retrofitting, and fuel infrastructure would you like to see in the coming years?

For progress to be meaningful, ship design, retrofitting, and fuel infrastructure improvements must be guided by a systems-level approach—one that integrates climate, biodiversity, pollution prevention, and a just and equitable transition. We have seen how addressing shipping impacts in silos has led to fragmented and sometimes counterproductive responses to policies. For instance, measures aimed at reducing air pollution delivered the required reductions in SOx pollution but allowed shipping companies to circumvent the intended solutions – moving to cleaner fuels – and resulted in increasing ocean pollution with the use of scrubbers. A similar risk is created with onboard carbon capture and storage (OCCS) since it will prolong use of fossil fuels instead of steering investments towards sustainable long-term solutions.Innovation has to be comprehensive. Its objective should be to simultaneously reduce greenhouse gases—including methane—while mitigating underwater noise, vessel strikes, air and water pollution, and effluent discharge. Advancements in energy efficiency, propulsion systems, and materials can deliver co-benefits across environmental and operational dimensions.

S4S: What policy or regulatory changes are most urgently needed to prevent a long-term “methane lock-in” in the shipping industry?

What is urgently needed now is clarity, consistency, and implementation. The IMO’s inclusion of methane emissions in its mid-term measures was critical, but short-term actions must now reflect the long-term decarbonization trajectory. According to the IPCC, global methane emissions must fall by one-third by 2030 and by nearly half by 2050 to maintain a 1.5°C pathway, an outlook that underscores there is a limited role for methane-based fuels in a zero-emissions future. In our opinion, the most pressing regulatory gap lies in ensuring that life-cycle assessment methodologies and emission factors accurately reflect real-world fuel performance and externalities – including methane leakage, short-term warming potential (GWP20), and the social, environmental, and health impacts. Without fully accounting for these factors, methane-based fuels will continue to be misrepresented as low-carbon solutions, with their perceived cost advantage reinforced by short-term industry cost-optimization. This puts the sector at risk of investing in assets and infrastructure that may become prematurely obsolete. Short-term market choices, like methane fuels, do not align with long-term climate, regulatory and market projections – and that’s why advancing data, integrity, transparency, and accountability in LCA guidelines and emissions accounting is so important right now.

S4S: In your view, what would a truly methane-free maritime industry look like by 2050?

A maritime industry that would operate with clear life-cycle accountability and with the environmental, social, health and economic costs of energy and infrastructure fully considered. The sector would be guided by evidence-based regulations while investment frameworks would contemplate more than short-term cost optimization. Methane-free shipping would also reflect a just and equitable transition, one that safeguards human health, biodiversity, water, and food systems, and upholds the land and resource rights of Indigenous and rural communities affected by fuel production and supply chains. Ultimately, a methane-free future for maritime transport would represent a future-proof industry: one that has reduced systemic risk, strengthened policy and financial coherence, and redefined competitiveness through transparency, accountability, and real climate integrity.

S4S: What message would you share with shipowners, ports, and governments that remain hesitant to move beyond LNG investments?

LNG is a risky bet that is likely to end in economic penalties and, eventually, stranded assets. The apparent cost advantage of LNG reflects a short-term optimization strategy that is hyped up by the oil and gas industry, even though LNG does not have a durable climate or market position. The LNG market already faces structural and policy headwinds that are starting to impact confidence in LNG and reshape investment patterns. LNG-fuelled newbuilds will likely continue to rise despite mounting evidence suggesting that not all contracts will be fulfilled, and that a pivot toward electrification and other non-methane solutions is already underway. Shipowners must consider the very real possibility of being locked into assets that will require expensive retrofits or early decommissioning, with research estimating £113–185 billion in potential stranded asset losses across LNG-capable fleets. Clear regulatory intervention continues to be the gap, but that too is slowly starting to emerge. It’s time for shipowners, ports and governments to reduce risks and make responsible business and regulatory decisions by moving away from the methane-pathway trap.

MARBEM highlights that any regulatory framework aiming to achieve net-zero emissions must include three core policy instruments:

· A carbon-intensity measure that drives performance improvements;

· A global fuel standard that ensures credible, science-based differentiation among fuels; and

· A GHG pricing system that internalizes external costs and steers investment toward scalable low- or zero-carbon options such as wind, while prioritizing the funding of decarbonization efforts and investments in the global south, small island developing states (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs).

These must be guided by life-cycle (well-to-wake) assessment principles, ensuring decisions reflect full-system impacts rather than isolated emissions metrics.

Dubai-based bunker trading firm Flex Commodities (Flex) is entering the middle of its second year of operations. Singapore bunkering publication Manifold Times checks with Maaz Ahmed, Trading Director at Flex, to find out more:

MT: Flex Commodities is entering the middle of its second year of operations; how has the company grown since its establishment in June 2024?

Over the past year, Flex Commodities has grown much faster than expected. We began in Q3 2024 with just three people, and as the business gained momentum, we built up our capabilities across trading, operations, finance, HR, and compliance. Today, we’re a 22-member team, with our headquarters in Dubai and support teams across multiple time zones.

Geographically, we expanded from being a single-office setup in Dubai to establishing operational presence in Greece, Singapore, and Brazil, giving us coverage across Europe, Asia, and South America.

Flex aims to be present at the heart of market action and a first step in that direction was to establish a Singapore entity – Flex Commodities PTE LTD. We have so far hired three senior professionals for the team who bring extensive experience across different facets of the value chain:

Wilson Tang (Regional Manager, Singapore) With a long track record in Asia’s marine fuels market, Wilson brings strong commercial judgement and regional trading insight that elevates FLEX’s strategic positioning in Singapore.

Tan Ying – Lead Trader, China (Singapore Desk) With more than 15 years of experience in marine fuels trading and business development across China and Singapore, Tan Ying enhances FLEX’s regional trading capabilities and commercial reach.

John Teng – (Senior Supply Trader) John brings deep expertise in regional supply markets, leveraging his understanding of trading economics and supplier networks to strengthen FLEX’s commercial edge across Asia.

MT: As a relatively new bunker and cargo trading startup, what was the biggest challenge Flex faced in gaining a foothold in this competitive marketplace during its first year? How has Flex managed to overcome this challenge?

One of the biggest challenges for us in the first year was credibility. In bunker and cargo trading, the market is extremely relationship-driven suppliers need to trust that you will perform, and customers need to know you can deliver consistently. Even though the team had years of experience, Flex as a company was still new, so we had to prove ourselves from day one.

We tackled this challenge by relying on the relationships and reputation our team members already had in the industry. That helped us gain early support from key suppliers and customers. The backing and PCG support from our parent company also played a major role, giving counterparties the confidence to trade with us at scale while we built our own credit history.

Another challenge was managing market exposure and volatility while scaling up. As our volumes increased, price risk became a bigger factor. To handle this, we set up a derivatives desk for internal hedging and risk management. This gave us better control over our exposure, improved our ability to take positions responsibly, and strengthened our internal risk framework.

At the same time, we expanded our operations, finance, and compliance teams to ensure the company could support the commercial growth sustainably.

By combining strong relationships, reliable performance, PCG support, and disciplined internal risk management, we were able to establish credibility quickly and build a solid foothold in a very competitive market within our first year.

MT: For counterparties, what are the advantages of working together with FLEX? Can you share some examples?

One of the biggest advantages for counterparties working with Flex is the speed and clarity we bring to every deal. Because our structure is lean and our decision-making is centralised, customers and suppliers get quick answers whether it’s pricing, credit approval, operations, or payments. That agility makes a huge difference, especially in time-sensitive bunker markets.

Another strength is our reliability. We take on trades we know we can perform, and once we commit, we execute cleanly. For suppliers, that means timely payments and smooth coordination with barges and agents. For customers, it means fewer operational issues and clear communication throughout the delivery.

We also add value through information. Our research team sends out daily market reports, giving our counterparties insights on price movements. It’s an additional service that many clients appreciate because it helps them make more informed decisions, not just spot purchases.

Our growing geographical presence with Dubai as our HQ and additional coverage in Greece, Singapore, and Brazil lets us support enquiries across multiple time zones and stay closer to both suppliers and end users.

Finally, counterparties take comfort in our financial backing. The support from our parent company, including PCG when required, gives suppliers confidence to extend credit and allows us to scale responsibly.

MT: Considering current global events and market volatility, what are the current risks and pitfalls of bunker trading firms, and how is Flex managing or even taking advantage of these exposures?

The biggest risks for bunker traders right now are price volatility, counterparty risk, and operational/compliance issues.

Volatility can easily eat into margins if exposure isn’t managed properly.

Counterparty risk is one of the major pitfalls, especially with uncertain markets and extended payment terms. At Flex, we run a strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and credit process which helps us avoid taking unnecessary exposure.

Operational and compliance risk is also high, given sanctions changes and port-specific restrictions. We have invested early in strong operations and compliance teams to ensure clean execution and avoid mistakes that can be costly.

These controls give us an advantage because while some traders pull back during volatile periods, we can take on opportunities confidently, knowing our exposure is disciplined and well-managed.

MT: Moving forward, it is clear the shipping industry is adopting green bunker fuels due to IMO 2030/2050. What are the plans Flex has undertaken to future proof itself?

We know the industry is moving toward greener bunker fuels, and our plan is to prepare for that transition gradually and realistically. Flex is already in the process of obtaining ISCC certification, which is the first step toward being able to handle sustainable fuels with proper documentation and traceability.

Beyond that, our approach is to stay informed. Our research team monitors developments in biofuels, methanol, LNG, and other alternative fuels, and we’re keeping an eye on how different ports and suppliers are progressing.

As the market becomes more mature and customer demand increases, we’ll be in a position to integrate these products into our offering. So for now, our focus is on certification, building internal understanding, and making sure we’re ready to move when the market is ready.

Julie Nielsen argued relying on manual Excel sheets for bunkering operations is no longer adequate for maintaining the necessary control in this evolving landscape. As such, digital solutions are vital for dismantling internal company silos, thereby enabling more effective data-driven decisions.

Nielsen was participating in the AI and the Future of Digitalisation: Transforming the Bunker Value Chain panel discussion at IBIA Annual Convention 2025 in Hong Kong on Wednesday (19 November) when she noted a primary impediment to widespread adoption of digital solutions to be human resistance.

“This is often rooted in a ‘psychological barrier’ where individuals perceive data sharing as a risk,” she explained.

“This resistance frequently stems from users’ insecurity that data might expose past inefficiencies in their job performance.

“Despite C-level executives increasingly recognising bunkers as a boardroom topic, driven by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting and banking requirements, user-level adoption remains a challenge.”

Nielsen stressed AI-driven transparency is paramount for the shipping and bunkering industry, necessitating openness with data from both marine fuel buyers and suppliers.

She also highlighted the pivotal role of verifiers in driving behaviour by ensuring data correctness and identifying inconsistencies.

While acknowledging the inherent complexity of the bunkering supply chain, Julie firmly stated there is no viable alternative to digitalisation for maintaining competitiveness.

She further challenged the notion that digitalisation diminishes the “human touch”, contending that digital systems can offer more valuable data than traditional communication methods like WhatsApp.

“A funny argument we also hear out there is, ‘oh we don’t want to go digital because it takes away the human touch’. How much human touch do you actually have on WhatsApp?” She questioned.

“You send a text message [on WhatsApp] and you get a reply.

“What difference does it make when you do it in a system which can actually help create all the data and give you the valued data proposition for future decisions.”

The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD), AIM Horizon Investments and their partners on Thursday (20 November) announced the successful closing of the Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET), securing total commitments of up to USD 35M, exceeding its initial target.

As the world’s first fund for vessel retrofits leveraging a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism, FEET directly addresses the long-standing financial barriers hindering the sector’s uptake of vessel retrofits.

This fund has drawn strong interest from across the maritime value chain, including equipment manufacturers, shipowners, and investors. GCMD provides catalytic equity and is FEET’s appointed decarbonisation advisor.

FEET is managed by AIM Horizon Investments. Formerly known as FPG AIM Capital, AIM Horizon Investments is a Singapore-based fund manager specialising in maritime and aviation funds for institutional and accredited investors.

Shareholders of AIM Horizon Investments hold the fund’s commercial equity position, while the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ) holds the preferred equity position. DBS Bank and ING (which acted as Coordinating Bank) have in principle agreed to provide senior debt financing.

Improving energy efficiency remains one of the most effective strategies to reduce emissions and fuel costs. Energy Efficiency Technologies (EETs), such as wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) and air lubrication systems (ALS), can deliver immediate fuel savings, assisting shipowners to stay competitive amid tightening regional carbon regulations. However, even with a retrofit market valued at over USD 20B, uncertainties around EET performance and access to financing continue to limit uptake.

A primary difficulty restricting adoption is the inherently variable fuel savings from EET retrofits, which depend on operational and environmental factors, such as routing and weather conditions. The lack of standardised methodologies to accurately measure fuel savings further challenges uptake.

This uncertainty has made the return on investment period difficult to predict and has exacerbated the split-incentive issue, where shipowners are expected to invest in retrofits whereas charterers realise savings.

A pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism addresses payback uncertainty with EETs by directly linking repayment to quantified and verified fuel and regulatory savings. Deploying this mechanism requires robust data collection and analysis to isolate the retrofit’s contribution to overall fuel savings.

To this end, GCMD has undertaken EET performance pilots, equipping vessels with additional sensors to acquire high-precision, high-resolution data and applying rigorous data analytics to quantify fuel savings with statistical confidence. As more data is collected across diverse operating and environmental conditions, these datasets can be used to model and predict savings under varying scenarios.

FEET is designed to scale beyond this initial closing, recognising the vast market size and shipping sector’s pressing decarbonisation needs. GCMD and AIM Horizon Investments are targeting to scale the fund to USD 500 million by 2030, capable of supporting around 200 ships.

Professor Lynn Loo, CEO, GCMD, said, “Bringing FEET to life has taken persistence and a willingness from everyone involved to step into the unknown. There was no playbook; our teams were learning as we went. This is exactly the kind of collaborative, problem-solving mindset needed to move the needle on maritime decarbonisation.”

“My hope is that FEET will accelerate the uptake of shipboard energy efficiency solutions and help unlock the scale of action needed to turn the industry’s decarbonisation ambition into tangible progress.”

Benny Hilstroem, Vice President of Market Development at Swiss marine power company WinGD, in an article published on Thursday (20 November), highlighted that LNG remains a strong, credible transition pathway, especially as the industry navigates uncertainty around global carbon pricing and clean-fuel incentives:

With or without the IMO Net Zero Framework, LNG remains a viable transition pathway towards decarbonisation and, with X-DF technology, ultra-low air pollution.

Going into the extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in mid-October, many in the industry had high hopes that the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would be adopted. WinGD was and remains one of the believers; incentivising the production and uptake of clean fuels is the only way to meet both IMO emissions ambitions and wider global climate targets.

The NZF does not mean, as some have suggested, that the case for LNG fuel or for installing dual-fuel LNG technology is over. Just like our X-DF-A ammonia-fuelled and X-DF-M methanol-fuelled engines, our X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions (ZNZ) fuels. In the case of LNG those ZNZ fuels are bio-methane and e-methane, produced using captured carbon and renewable electricity, which can be used without modification and in any blend in X-DF engines.

Had the NZF been adopted with reduction targets and penalties stringent enough to drive people towards bio-methane, and rewards high enough to encourage e-methane production and use, the transition towards those fuels would have come sooner. A pause in implementing the policy only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road.

That is why the NZF delay has made more operators consider LNG propulsion. Without a global carbon pricing policy and immediate e-fuel incentives, it remains the most affordable, widely available and well-established of all marine alternative fuels. Even fossil LNG can push vessels a long way towards the 30% reduction in emissions sought by 2030—an intermediate checkpoint under IMO’s GHG reduction strategy (which remains in place even after the NZF vote postponement).

WinGD’s X-DF concept has been in service since 2016, with more than 900 engines sold. Over that time we have amassed more than 8 million running hours of experience and continuously refined fuel consumption and emissions performance via innovations including iCER and VCR technology.

Advancing GHG benefits

Take methane slip as an example. In less than a decade we have reduced slippage by 60%, thanks to iCER, VCR and other design adaptations. Combined with low fuel consumption, this means that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications. In even more applications, low opex and initial system costs mean that total vessel lifecycle costs remain lower for X-DF than for high-pressure counterparts, regardless of IMO penalties.

Time in the market and continuous improvement have enabled us to develop an engine platform that will yield the best performance whether operating in fossil LNG or biological or synthetic derivatives. Regardless of the status of NZF, those years of refinements will pay dividends for operators choosing methane.

What happens next is far from clear. If the global framework were to fail, a patchwork of regional regulatory regimes would likely follow. Across several regions, port authorities are working to lower air pollution in their communities. It is therefore possible that, as regions regulate, they expand the scope of emissions policy to include not only GHG but also air pollutants.

In such a case, X-DF again has benefits for operators, offering the best air pollution profile of any LNG dual-fuel engine. That includes SOx, NOx and particulate matter. While IMO’s threshold requirements for NOx and SOx hide X-DF’s advantages, under schemes where operators pay for polluting the air, its low emissions profile would translate to real cost savings.

The Net Zero Framework would not have killed the use of LNG, but its pause certainly enhances the business case. Regardless, WinGD’s near decade of optimising the X-DF platform mean operators will pay less, whether they use fossil LNG or transition to cleaner variants. And it opens up new opportunities for air pollution improvements that could also have a significant financial impact on operators.

Today, 25 cruise ships operate with next-generation multi-fuel engines, and this is expected to grow to more than 50 by 2036.
From CLIA’s perspective, Europe must keep its shipyards competitive, expand research and innovation funding, and make sure sustainable maritime fuels are accessible.
OPS installations on cruise ships have tripled since 2018 and now cover 58% of the cruise fleet (65% of total capacity).
Approximately 80% of ocean-going cruise ships are equipped with Advanced Wastewater Treatment Systems (AWTS), representing 84% of global passenger capacity.","In 2022, cruise ship companies pledged to pursue net-zero emissions by 2050. Three years later, those companies say they need more policy signals from the European Union to stimulate the investments needed both on land and at sea to make this happen.

Euractiv spoke with Budd Darr, CEO of the Cruise Line International Association (CLIA) and former executive vice president of government affairs at the MSC Group, about where the industry finds itself in 2025 and what it’s watching for EU policy.

EV: How is the health of the cruise industry in the post-COVID period? Where is the most growth coming from – returning customers or new ones?

BD: Cruise is one of the most resilient and responsible tourism sectors that continues to deliver exceptional guest experiences. The industry has moved well beyond recovery and is now experiencing managed, sustainable growth with a strong environmental focus.

In 2024, 34.6 million people worldwide took an ocean cruise, and this year we estimate 37.7 million people will choose to cruise, which speaks to both strong demand and high traveller confidence. We are seeing demand both from returning guests and new-to-cruise travellers.

Over the past two years, 31% of passengers were first-time cruisers, up from 27% in 2023. At the same time, repeat intent remains exceptionally strong: about 85% of past cruisers say they intend to cruise again, according to our latest research. That is one of the highest repeat-intent rates in the entire travel sector.

EV: What are the chief policy and financing obstacles in Europe for the cruise industry right now?

BD: In 2022, our cruise line members collectively pledged to pursue net-zero emissions by 2050, underscoring a strong, industry-wide commitment to environmental responsibility and sustainability. Achieving this ambition hinges on three critical paths: fuels, fuels, and fuels.

Right now, no single alternative fuel is available globally at scale, and that’s why fuel flexibility is so important.

Our cruise line members are investing tens of billions of euros in new ships and multi-fuel engines that can handle more than one solution.

Today, 25 cruise ships operate with next-generation multi-fuel engines, and this is expected to grow to more than 50 by 2036. These fuel-flexible engine technologies give our member cruise lines the ability to operate on LNG, methanol, or other fuels as supply chains develop – and to transition to lower- and zero-carbon fuels, such as bioLNG (methane), green methanol, or synthetic fuels such as e-LNG.

Across the maritime sector – whether under the EU Emissions Trading System, the IMO, or local rules on operational emissions – there is a clear need for safe and competitively priced fuels available at scale. Equally important are supportive funding mechanisms at both the EU and national levels to help drive the innovation required to meet decarbonisation targets. Progress depends on predictable regulation and effective financing tools.

Currently, only a small share of revenues collected under the EU ETS for maritime is reinvested in the sector.

CLIA advocates for 100% of maritime ETS proceeds to be directed back into ships, ports, shipyards, and innovation projects across the maritime value chain to accelerate decarbonisation while safeguarding Europe’s competitiveness.

The forthcoming EU Maritime Industrial Strategy can help establish this enabling framework.

EV: How well does the EU Maritime Industrial Strategy respond to those obstacles and challenges?

BD: We welcome the upcoming EU Maritime Industrial Strategy, expected in early 2026, as an opportunity to reinforce Europe’s leadership in sustainable shipbuilding and maritime innovation. The cruise sector contributes around €170 billion globally and supports 1.8 million jobs. Three-quarters of those jobs are on land – demonstrating that our impact extends far beyond ships.

Europe’s shipyards are at the heart of this success, with 97% of the 81 new cruise ships on order, worth over €60 billion, being built in European yards. In fact, cruise ships represent more than 80% of the overall value of current shipbuilding in Europe. That reflects real confidence from investors and shipbuilders alike.

From CLIA’s perspective, Europe must keep its shipyards competitive, expand research and innovation funding, and make sure sustainable maritime fuels are accessible.

The EU should also align measures such as FuelEU Maritime and the ETS with IMO rules to avoid fragmentation.

A strong, coherent EU Maritime Industrial Strategy will secure Europe’s leadership, support responsible growth, and help make sure that maritime decarbonisation creates and sustains high-quality jobs across the continent.

EV: How important is it for the cruising industry to have diverse and secure energy supplies at ports? How helpful would it be to the industry if ports could become energy hubs? And, do you expect that the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan will be able to mobilise the financing needed to make these shore power and fuel system installations happen?

BD: European ports are already essential energy gateways – hosting, storing, and transmitting fuels. They can go even further by becoming true hubs for clean maritime fuels and energy. This ambition fits well with the Clean Energy Marine Hubs project that CLIA actively supports, alongside leadership from our partners at the International Association of Ports and Harbors and the International Chamber of Shipping.

Investment in onshore power supply (OPS) is a top infrastructure priority for European ports from 2026 to 2030. By 2028, more than 70% of the global ocean-going cruise fleet will be OPS-equipped. Yet, among Europe’s three busiest cruise ports, only one currently offers active OPS. Continued investment in OPS at Europe’s ports and greater pricing transparency will encourage broader use.

OPS installations on cruise ships have tripled since 2018 and now cover 58% of the cruise fleet (65% of total capacity). The industry plans to reach roughly 90% of capacity by 2036. Combined with the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy, these initiatives can unlock private and public financing, scale European-made fuels, and turn ports into genuine decarbonisation hubs.

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) signals that the EU is serious about renewable and low-carbon fuels. It also acknowledges the role of fossil-based LNG as a transitional energy source – a technology the cruise industry adopted early, helping lay the groundwork for next-generation fuels.

Together with the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy, these initiatives can accelerate investment support by unlocking private and public financing, help scale European-produced fuels, and position ports as key energy hubs for maritime decarbonisation.

EV: The CLIA annual Environmental Technologies and Practices (ETP) report released last month found that there has been good progress in testing and piloting biofuels at port, investing in fuel-flexible engines, and increasing the use of lower-emissions fuels. In what areas do you think progress has been lacking and things should be moving faster?

BD: Although cruise ships account for less than 1% of the global maritime fleet, cruise lines are early adopters and innovators of new technologies – often paving the way for broader maritime use. This is evident in our members’ significant investments in advanced wastewater treatment systems, air lubrication systems, onshore power connectivity, and next-generation multi-fuel engines.

CLIA’s 2025 Environmental Technologies and Practices Report confirms these advancements.

Approximately 80% of ocean-going cruise ships are equipped with Advanced Wastewater Treatment Systems (AWTS), representing 84% of global passenger capacity.

Air lubrication systems and specialised hull coatings are increasingly used on ships to improve energy efficiency and reduce drag. Nearly two-thirds of the global cruise fleet can now connect to onshore power, cutting local emissions from ships at berth by up to 98%. The number of cruise ships with next-generation multi-fuel engines has grown from just one in 2018 to 25 today, with many more on order. And biofuel pilot projects are expanding in multiple European ports.

While progress is clear, achieving the cruise industry’s net-zero emissions ambition by 2050 requires the availability of safe, sustainable, and competitively priced fuels that do not yet exist today at scale. It also demands deeper collaboration between policymakers and industry – both in Europe and globally. The next decade is pivotal – not for promises, but for measurable progress toward a cleaner, more resilient maritime future.

Creating solutions with longevity and performance in mind, one key area of focus has been the cabling used for critical on-board energy systems, especially those operating in demanding marine environments.
In line with the growing need for ‘greener’ services, standards are increasingly focused on reducing GHG emissions too.","While significant inroads have been made on hybrid and electric adoption in workboats, pleasure craft and ferries, the industry currently faces a major bottleneck. Simply put, the lack of scalable on-board electrical infrastructure is slowing progress among larger ships and vessels.

This stems from the fact that these vessels are tailored around diesel propulsion and low-voltage auxiliary systems. These legacy systems are no longer suitable for modern maritime applications – they are ill-equipped to handle the high voltages, power densities, and thermal demands required for modern electric drives and energy storage systems.

At the same time, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) are pushing for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships. Aiming for net-zero emissions by or around 2050, the IMO has laid out a clear roadmap for players within the sector to follow to achieve this. Interim targets include a 20-30% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, and a 70-80% reduction by 2050.

To achieve this, the IMO has recommended a number of key strategies, including the use of alternative fuels and net-zero GHG emission technologies. Wider efforts to improve carbon intensity within the sector and increase the sustainability of marine ecosystems and fisheries have also been considered within the organisation’s recommendations.

The case for electrification

As a result, we have seen increased electrification of the marine sector in recent years. Shipbuilders and marine system integrators are actively replacing traditional fossil fuel powered engines with electric or hybrid-electric alternatives in order to reduce their GHG emission in line with the IMO’s targets.

Air and noise pollution can also be mitigated through electrical propulsion, especially for smaller, short-distance vessels which operate in sensitive areas like ports, waterways and coastal areas. This is crucial; air quality maps published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in December 2024 highlighted higher annual mean Nitrogen Oxide (NO2) concentrations in port areas when compared to surrounding areas. In fact, some ports still exceed the 2030 limit value of 20 micrograms per cubic metre air (µg/m³), while nine ports across Europe also exceeded the new limit value for particulate matter of 10 micrometres (PM10) too.

There’re performance benefits to electrification too, as electric systems typically offer better acceleration and manoeuvrability. For larger vessels carrying cargo or a large volume of passengers, this functionality can help lead to more efficient operations. Increased efficiency also reduces the likelihood of expensive maintenance costs, meaning more economical operations.

Challenges ahead

However, while these solutions offer a more sustainable and optimal path forward for the industry in terms of zero-emission services and increased on-board performance, challenges still remain in scaling the necessary technology and infrastructure.

As the concept is relatively new, there remains some insufficiency in terms of the amount of charging infrastructure. The high costs and demand for procuring batteries and retrofitting existing vessels – which is also causing supply chain issues for scarce battery materials – and the current limited energy density for long-haul operations.

This is only compounded by the issue of durability, especially for larger vessels. When in service, the batteries are likely to encounter harsh environments and conditions. It’s imperative they withstand extreme and fluctuating temperatures, as well as contact with water, salt and any significant vibrations, all while providing consistent and reliable power for on-board systems.

Setting the standard for maritime solutions

Thankfully, vendors serving the marine sector have risen to this challenge. Creating solutions with longevity and performance in mind, one key area of focus has been the cabling used for critical on-board energy systems, especially those operating in demanding marine environments.

Solutions providers such as HUBER+SUHNER now offer cable families that deliver long-term durability in harsh conditions, combining high electrical performance with strong mechanical and chemical resistance.

Designed specifically for battery and fuel energy systems on vessels – making them suitable for both battery-powered and hybrid operations – new cable solutions are capable of working effectively at temperatures between -40 to 130°C, and for usage in applications such as battery wiring, on-board charges, and auxiliary systems, alongside AC/DC charging sockets and power distribution units (PDUs).

Pivotal to these efforts is certification. Classification organisations such as ISO, IEC and DNV have developed specific standards to ensure the highest possible levels of safety and performance for use across the marine industry.

DNV Type Approval ensures products or components meet specific standards for ships, offshore units, and high-speed craft; something which HUBER+SUHNER recently attained through approval on its RADOX 155(S) and Elastomer S cables.

These regulations ensure that shipbuilders and integrators can be assured the products they’ve procured will work optimally during operation, while at the same time, opening the door to new opportunities for the vendors who designed them.

In line with the growing need for ‘greener’ services, standards are increasingly focused on reducing GHG emissions too. Technologies and systems are validated thoroughly for carbon capture and renewable energy use through type approval processes and other programmes. DNV, for example, also verify emission reduction projects against well-established standards such as ISO 14064-2.

Looking to the future

Through these new solutions and relevant certifications, the maritime sector has gained positive momentum in terms of electrification. This is true of the wider transportation segment at large, and in fact, many of the standards required by vessel manufacturers and owners originate from other sectors, such as automotive.

However, for the sake of the market, vendors must remain committed to delivering future-proof solutions that meet the highest standards of safety, performance and sustainability. As we approach IMO’s initial 2030 benchmark for GHS emissions, the pressure to be environmentally-friendly – without compromising on vessel performance – is only going to grow.

By buying certified products, shipbuilders and integrators can give themselves the best possible chance to hit these stringent targets and drive greater electrification across the industry.",https://www.newelectronics.co.uk/media/nyrbusbr/adobestock_1404063326.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 14:56:30.912366

Introduction

The Suez Canal is a critical maritime artery, connecting the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, facilitating roughly 12-15% of global trade and about 30% of container traffic. It handles approximately 9.2 million barrels of oil daily and generates significant toll revenue for Egypt, crucial for the nation’s economy. Given its strategic importance, any disruption in the Suez Canal can lead to significant ripple effects on global commerce and energy markets, underscoring the need for robust security measures.

Historical Context and Vulnerabilities

The canal’s strategic significance has made it a focal point during historical conflicts. The Suez Crisis in 1956 and the Eight-year closure beginning in 1967 resulted in unprecedented shipping disruptions, compelling vessels to take longer routes. These crises illustrated the canal’s leverage in geopolitics and resulted in significant economic losses, prompting shippers to adjust their operations.

Since then, the canal has remained a vital trade conduit amid regional tensions. However, various security threats still linger, as evidenced by a 2013 foiled terrorist attack and recent assaults on shipping during the Israel-Gaza conflict that began in late 2023, where Houthi rebels targeted vessels in the Red Sea.

Recent Conflicts and Their Impacts

The ongoing attacks by Houthi forces on commercial shipping have prompted significant disruptions. Many shipping firms suspended or rerouted vessels, leading to a 50% reduction in trade volume through the canal in early 2024. A spike in transportation costs and insurance premiums further strained global supply chains, resulting in delays and increased freight rates. The conflicts also affected oil volumes transiting the canal, pushing Brent crude prices higher and leading to a marked decline in global shipping capacity.

Global Economic Ramifications

The conflicts around the Suez Canal and the resulting shipping disruptions have far-reaching economic implications, particularly for businesses relying on timely deliveries. Many companies were unable to meet production schedules, which could lead to inflationary pressures in affected economies. Additionally, the spike in marine insurance costs has made using the canal prohibitively expensive for many shippers, resulting in increased reliance on longer routes like the Cape of Good Hope, which yield higher emissions and environmental costs.

The Way Forward: Ensuring Canal Security

Addressing the security vulnerabilities of the Suez Canal is fundamentally an international concern demanding a coordinated approach to ensure maritime safety. A strategic priority should be fostering collaboration among regional and international naval forces to establish protective measures around the Red Sea and beyond. Concepts such as multinational maritime patrols and intelligence-sharing systems could help mitigate risks.

Investments in the canal’s infrastructure, along with technological advancements for surveillance and security, will be crucial. Increasing the capacity to handle larger vessels and establishing advanced communication systems can fortify maritime safety measures.

Conclusion

The Suez Canal’s health is intrinsically linked to global trade stability. Ongoing conflicts in the surrounding regions highlight the canal’s vulnerability, reinforcing the necessity of maintaining its operational integrity through enhanced security and proactive diplomatic efforts. Policymakers and industry stakeholders must realign their strategies to bolster both the canal’s resilience and the broader supply chain systems it supports, ensuring this vital trade artery remains open and secure.",https://cdn-kdmmj.nitrocdn.com/rMIbIrPSYFfiGCokvtkImuATKIjcDThC/assets/images/optimized/rev-41bbbe8/maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-22 20:56:09.099215
