The trigger was a dispute over the procedural rules behind IMO law-making.
The NZF is not a minor tweak to existing IMO rules but a far-reaching package that would redefine how ships use and report fuels while introducing an economic mechanism – effectively a global shipping climate fund.
Caught in the middle is shipping – the world’s most globalised industry, dependent on global rules, now watching those rules fragment.
The NZF is a structural package that would reshape fuel use, reporting and the economic backbone of climate policy in shipping.","The decision at the recent Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to postpone the adoption of the so-called Net Zero Framework (NZF) by a full year is not a sign of the industry dragging its feet – it is a reminder that political manoeuvring still trumps progress.

The NZF, designed to give legal force to IMO’s “net-zero by or around 2050” goal, was on track: in April 2025, 63 states voted for adoption in principle. By October, the vote was expected to turn that agreement into binding text. Instead, procedural disputes and geo-strategic posturing derailed the process.

The industry’s position has been consistent. Owners are ordering dual-fuel and methanol-ready tonnage, ports are building infrastructure for low-carbon fuels, and cargo interests increasingly treat decarbonisation as non-negotiable. What’s missing is regulatory certainty – and that’s exactly what the NZF was meant to deliver.

The plan would have introduced fees for non-compliance with tightening carbon-intensity targets, with compliant ships rewarded and surpluses tradable. Revenues could have reached up to US$15Bn annually by 2030.

But the path toward adoption veered off course. The trigger was a dispute over the procedural rules behind IMO law-making. Since 1973, amendments to the Marpol Convention – the core environmental treaty for shipping – have entered into force through ’tacit acceptance’, meaning they take effect automatically unless a threshold of objections is reached. During the October session, however, the United States – backed by Saudi Arabia and others – pushed for ’explicit acceptance,’ a far more cumbersome process that would require active ratification by each state and could delay or block the framework indefinitely.

As the week unfolded, procedural wrangling turned into geopolitical theatre. The US reportedly threatened tariffs, port access restrictions, or visa limits for officials from states backing the NZF. Under pressure, many large flag and tonnage states either abstained, changed their positions, or withdrew support. The motion to delay passed with 57 in favour, 49 against, and 21 abstentions.

That vote matters. The NZF is not a minor tweak to existing IMO rules but a far-reaching package that would redefine how ships use and report fuels while introducing an economic mechanism – effectively a global shipping climate fund. Without adoption, the original 2027 entry-into-force target is now uncertain, possibly slipping toward the next decade.

IMO has become a stage for competing agendas. The EU presses ahead with its Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime – measures that accelerate regional action but undermine faith in global regulation. For developing nations and petro-states, Brussels’ unilateralism offers a convenient excuse: why agree to a global carbon price when Europe is already imposing its own?

Across the Atlantic, the US and Saudi Arabia have played their own part in the stalemate. Washington’s hesitation is increasingly driven by domestic politics, with a revived Trumpist narrative eroding support for climate multilateralism. That shift is already complicating the EU’s broader COP30 strategy – and it is seeping into IMO. Riyadh, meanwhile, continues to defend its petro-economic position by slowing any attempt to put a meaningful price on carbon.

Caught in the middle is shipping – the world’s most globalised industry, dependent on global rules, now watching those rules fragment. Regional carbon regimes and national carve-outs will not deliver decarbonisation; they will only create a two-tier system, with compliant fleets in wealthy jurisdictions and carbon-heavy fleets everywhere else. The NZF is a structural package that would reshape fuel use, reporting and the economic backbone of climate policy in shipping. Losing momentum now risks losing the framework altogether.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/183/Germany-dr_martin_kroger-2022-21_Main.png,N,,2025-11-06 07:16:29.824340

Scientists warn that expanding crop-based biofuels to sectors like shipping could undermine global net-zero goals, displace communities, and drive deforestation.
Despite being branded “green,” crop-based biofuels emit on average 16% more CO2 than fossil fuels once land use change impacts are included.","Transport & Environment (T&E) released an open letter signed by 100 scientists urging world leaders at COP30 to recognise the climate, social and environmental risks of an unchecked expansion of global biofuels demand.

The scientists call for governments and international bodies, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to focus on genuinely sustainable, scalable fuels rather than doubling down on crop-based biofuels.

The letter lands just as leaders gather in Belém for the COP30 summit, where Brazil is expected to launch a global pledge to quadruple the use of “sustainable fuels,” including doubling biofuel consumption.

At the IMO, Brazil – currently the second largest biofuels producer worldwide – has been promoting the use of biofuels as a way to decarbonize the shipping sector.

Global shipping is at risk of expanding into harmful biofuels, if unregulated. Both the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) and the 2023 Revised GHG Strategy, which commits to full decarbonisation by 2050, currently lack any safeguards or sustainability criteria for biofuels.

This gap means that as the IMO works to define its net-zero pathway, crop-based biofuels could rapidly expand without any environmental or social protections in place. Scientists warn that this would undermine climate progress, worsen deforestation, and deepen global food insecurity the very impacts climate action seeks to avoid.

Biofuels have become a live issue at the IMO as countries define the fuels and technologies that will be part of the green future of shipping. As biofuels are cheap and largely available, they have been looked at by the shipping industry as an easy way to meet its decarbonization targets. But without sustainability criteria, according to experts, this pathway risks replicating the same environmental and food security crises already seen in the road and aviation sectors.

Scientists warn that expanding crop-based biofuels to sectors like shipping could undermine global net-zero goals, displace communities, and drive deforestation.

Already, growing crops for fuel uses 32 million hectares of land, an area about the size of Italy, to meet just 4% of transport fuel demand. By 2030, this could rise to 52 million hectares, roughly the size of France.

Despite being branded “green,” crop-based biofuels emit on average 16% more CO2 than fossil fuels once land use change impacts are included. These same crops – soy and palm oil, in particular – could otherwise feed up to 1.3 billion people. Today, about a fifth of the world’s vegetable oil supply is burned in cars instead of being used for food.

At last month’s IMO meetings (ISWG-GHG-20), member states remained divided on biofuels’ role in the maritime transition. Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushed for a “technology-neutral” approach that would allow food and feed-based biofuels to count toward emissions targets. The EU and Pacific Island states countered that this risks repeating the mistakes seen in road transport and aviation, arguing instead for a shift toward renewable e-fuels.

However, discussions have stalled: the US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries argued against further work on these sustainability safeguards until after the NZF’s adoption, despite previously citing the absence of such clarifications as a reason for delay.",,N,,2025-11-06 07:16:41.069275

“Access to finance can equip ports with the necessary infrastructure to handle future low and zero-carbon energy molecules produced from renewable energy sources.","C40 Cities, supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), today announces the launch of the Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan (SLL) Initiative at the C40 World Mayors Summit. This transformative partnership is designed to unlock massive investment in sustainable port infrastructure and accelerate the maritime sector’s just transition to net-zero.

The initiative establishes the first global framework specifically tailored to deploy Sustainability-Linked Loans for port decarbonisation projects worldwide. By combining C40’s network of nearly 100 cities and dozens of ports, IFC’s expertise in structuring climate finance transactions, and IAPH’s global alliance of 201 ports, the partnership will deliver comprehensive market guidance, capacity-building programmes, and direct access to finance for port authorities, particularly in the Global South where financing barriers have hindered green infrastructure deployment.

Maritime transport carries over 80% of global goods and accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. Ports, as nodes of global trade, require an estimated $1-2 trillion in cumulative investment through 2050 for shore power electrification, alternative fuel bunkering infrastructure, and zero-emission cargo-handling equipment. Yet approximately $200 billion in sustainability-linked capital remains untapped due to technical, financial, and regulatory barriers facing port authorities.

The C40-IFC-IAPH partnership directly addresses this climate finance gap through:

Standardised SLL frameworks that tie loan terms to ambitious sustainability KPIs, reducing transaction costs and improving investor confidence

Technical advisory support helping port authorities structure investment-ready projects and access to a global network of development banks and commercial lenders

Blended finance mechanisms combining concessional climate funds, development bank capital, and commercial investment to de-risk early-stage green technologies

Capacity-building programs including regional workshops and Port SLL Academies targeting Global South participants

The projected impact will drive C40’s efforts to:

Prepare more than 50 zero-emission port and shipping projects for investment by 2030

Mobilise resilient and sustainable maritime infrastructure finance for at least $1 billion within three years, leveraging IFC’s mobilisation capacity

Reduce maritime and port-related emissions in participating cities by 25-40% by 2035

Generate up to 4 million new jobs globally by 2050 through maritime decarbonisation, with significant concentration in Global South port cities

Support achievement of C40 cities’ commitment to drive creation of 50 million good, green jobs by 2030

Facilitate equitable access to competitive infrastructure financing for IAPH member ports in the Global South and Small Island States

The initiative builds on extensive groundwork including comprehensive market assessments and lender outreach to 30 commercial banks confirming strong support for standardised port SLL frameworks. The partnership formalises the Memorandum of Understanding signed between IFC and C40 in September 2024, moving beyond information-sharing to active co-leadership of sector-wide financial mobilisation.

The initiative will provide critical support for port authorities in the Global South, which handle more than half of seaborne exports and 60% of imports and face acute challenges including limited fiscal space, higher perceived investment risk, and weak credit ratings that drive up borrowing costs.

The partnership’s next steps include regional workshops and capacity-building programmes, commencing in 2026.

C40 Cities Managing Director of Climate Finance, Knowledge, and Partnerships Andrea Fernandez said, “Ports are gateways of international trade, and this global framework sets a new precedent, sending clear signals to the market and accelerating the pace and scale of climate finance for critical investments in zero-emission port infrastructure.

“This joint initiative delivers many wins: it de-risks commercial investments in port infrastructure and green fuels, it advances a just transition by enabling ports, particularly in the Global South, to address fiscal challenges, and also enhances technical assistance and capacity-building programmes.

“Crucially, the Global Port SLL initiative makes a compelling case to ramp up maritime decarbonisation and accelerate climate resilience, protecting the people and places we love.”

IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven said, “The Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative marks an important step forward for further collaboration between ports, loan providers, and regulators. These land-based investments can fund long-term infrastructure and support offtake agreements for low and zero-carbon shipping fuels and liquid bulk transport.

“Access to finance can equip ports with the necessary infrastructure to handle future low and zero-carbon energy molecules produced from renewable energy sources. This initiative complements IAPH’s work on the Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM HUBS) initiative, which aims to import, export, bunker, and where feasible, produce clean energy sources and zero and near-zero emission fuels.",,N,,2025-11-06 07:16:49.048639

Mobility and transport are vital to the EU’s industrial growth and competitiveness, however, the sector remains a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To address this, the EU aims to reduce transport-related GHG emissions by 90% by 2050. Adopted on 5 November, the STIP focuses on promoting renewable and low-carbon fuels for aviation and maritime transport, aiming to mobilize investments and expand production of sustainable fuels.

European Shipowners have welcomed the plan as a first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework. As stated, STIP recognises the need for more investments in clean fuels for shipping and identifies possible next steps and concrete action points.

We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero.

…said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

Moreover, European Shipowners support the STIP proposal to use national Emissions Trading System (ETS) revenues to promote clean fuel adoption in shipping. They emphasize that the €9 billion generated from shipping’s ETS contributions should help offset the high cost of clean fuels, which are about four times more expensive than conventional ones.

STIP also highlights the lack of clear requirements for European suppliers to make clean fuels available for the shipping sector. As an initial step toward establishing binding mandates for fuel suppliers, European Shipowners welcome the commitment to further incentivize clean fuel use in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime initiative.

However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at IMO level.

…said Raptis.

In addition, the World Shipping Council (WSC) has welcomed the decision, highlighting it as a promising first step toward accelerating the energy transition in Europe for shipping.

WSC has called for the funding outlined in the STIP to focus on:

Price-bridging measures that make renewable fuels competitive, enabling their use by dual-fuel ships.

Targeted incentives for renewable fuels to bring production to scale.

De-risking market investment mechanisms connecting producers and buyers to de-risk investments and accelerate market development.

The plan sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.

Secretary of State

Marco Antonio Rubio was born in May 1971 in Miami, Florida. His parents were Cubans who immigrated to the U.S. He attended Tarkio College in Missouri for a year on a football scholarship before enrolling at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Florida. He later earned an undergraduate degree in political science from the University of Florida and received a Juris Doctor from the University of Miami School of Law. He interned with a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Rubio was elected to a seat as a city commissioner for West Miami before becoming a member of the Florida House of Representatives, where he served eight years, two as the Speaker. He was elected to the United States Senate, assuming office in January 2011.

Rubio was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump for Secretary of State prior to his inauguration in 2025. The Senate confirmed Rubio the day President Trump was sworn in and Rubio was sworn into office the following morning.

Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, and they have four children. He is a Catholic.

In the News…

Secretary of State Marco Rubio was joined by Transportation Secretary Duffy and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to explain why the United States voted “no” on the proposed United Nations global carbon tax. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) proposed the Net-Zero Framework (NFZ) to reduce “global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector.”

The U.S. secretaries stated, “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.”

They continued, “The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.”

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.”

The U.S. then successfully garnered support to block the adoption of the NFZ in London. Another vote on the measure is anticipated next year.

Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

Direct China-U.S. voyages showed pronounced volatility, declining 3% in the first nine months of 2025 but spiking 15% in July before dropping 10% in September. China's retaliatory port fees targeting U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels introduce additional complexity to carrier deployment strategies.

Chinese-built vessels completed 36% of Q3 voyages, while 53.1% of vessels under five years old have been built from Chinese shipyards. South Korean-built vessels carried out 24.6% of all Q3 containership voyages, but 41.3% of all VLCS. South Korean built vessels' voyages recorded the lowest emissions intensity at 152.7 g CO2e/TEU km due to larger capacities and long-haul trade deployment.

Well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for very large container ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while very large container ships completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km, which reflects their significantly higher efficiency levels.

Given the recent delay to the NZF and the framework’s weaknesses, it is up to individual countries and regional blocs to strengthen climate efforts

A recent extraordinary session of the International Maritime Organisation, which was meant to turn the tide on the global shipping sector’s poor climate performance, ended in acrimony. Instead of launching the IMO’s flagship Net-Zero Framework, pressure from the United States and oil-rich countries led, by a slim majority, to the 12-month postponement of the vote.

Although it was vital that the IMO pass the NZF, our latest study and briefing, released today (Thursday 6 November), reveal that the NZF is woefully inadequate to bring down the carbon footprint of the shipping sector.

Carried out by industrial economics professor Michele Cincera, our analysis projects that the NZF, had it been adopted, would have led to emissions cuts of only 8-10% compared with the 43% that would be necessary to bring the maritime sector in line with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5°C.

“Despite the procrastination at the IMO, governments need to face the reality of rising emissions from the shipping sector and support the transition to clean fuels and technologies,” says Jenny Helle, CMW’s expert on shipping decarbonisation and author of the policy briefing. “They should deploy all the tools in their arsenal to tackle the role of the shipping sector in fuelling the climate crisis. With the delays facing the IMO framework, the climate cost is bound to rise.”

Regional rescue mission

In light of both this delay and the low ambition of the Net-Zero Framework, our forthcoming briefing recommends that IMO member states strengthen the NZF in the meantime so as to make up for lost time.

We also recommend that national governments and regional blocs salvage the lost momentum by launching or shoring up their own measures to cut shipping pollution, such as by introducing a shipping component to their cap-and-trade carbon markets or expanding its coverage. For example, the EU can enlarge its Emissions Trading System to cover 100% of emissions from ships entering and leaving the European Economic Area, instead of the current 50%.",https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/theo-eilertsen-photography-9bOHP92SPck-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 18:56:16.950106

In 2023, Asyad Drydock launched a floating dock capable of servicing vessels ranging from 50,000 to 80,000 DWT, a size that constitutes a significant portion of global maritime traffic.
Dr. Al Rabbani emphasized, “Asyad Drydock is the second-largest facility of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa.
Asyad Drydock specializes in the installation of exhaust gas scrubbers to eliminate sulfur oxides and other pollutants from ship emissions.","MUSCAT, NOVEMBER 5 — Asyad Drydock, a subsidiary of Asyad Group—Oman’s integrated global logistics provider—announced plans to invest in a second floating dock. This initiative is part of its strategy to enhance the capacity for maintenance and repair of small to mid-size vessels at its state-of-the-art facility in the Port of Duqm.

Dr. Abdulsalam Omar al Rabbani, Chief Operating Officer of Asyad Drydock, stated that the new floating dock will surpass the current Panamax-size facility, which was acquired and initiated at Al Duqm two years ago.

At the recent Duqm Economic Forum 2025, held in the Special Economic Zone, Dr. Al Rabbani highlighted that this new facility is part of annual investments averaging RO 4–5 million. These funds are dedicated to modernizing, expanding, and optimizing the yard’s capabilities to manage all types of maritime vessels and crafts requiring drydocking and repair services in Duqm.

In 2023, Asyad Drydock launched a floating dock capable of servicing vessels ranging from 50,000 to 80,000 DWT, a size that constitutes a significant portion of global maritime traffic. This addition has increased the yard’s overall capacity by approximately 20%, allowing the facility to accommodate around 40 more ships annually, raising its total repair capacity to about 240 vessels each year.

Dr. Al Rabbani emphasized, “Asyad Drydock is the second-largest facility of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to our capacity for handling some of the world’s largest ships, we provide a comprehensive range of ship repairs, onboard fabrication, and related services. Our annual capital expenditure of around RO 4–5 million bolsters our technical capabilities and boosts overall efficiency.”

The yard is also focusing on environmentally sustainable practices to align with international environmental standards and Net Zero objectives. Asyad Drydock specializes in the installation of exhaust gas scrubbers to eliminate sulfur oxides and other pollutants from ship emissions. Additionally, it implements ballast water management systems that comply with IMO regulations, and employs robotic blasting and painting technologies to reduce the environmental impact of repair operations.

“By committing to these initiatives, we ensure that repair work is performed safely while maintaining superior quality and craftsmanship—essential elements that enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and competitiveness in pricing,” he added.

Kaushal said HPCL’s strategy over the next 5 to 10 years and beyond is closely aligned with India’s growth targets, as the nation progresses toward becoming a $5 trillion economy and ultimately achieving developed nation status by 2047.
The complex is jointly built by HPCL and the Rajasthan government, with equity stakes of 74% and 26%, respectively.
“Every time we go to the crude oil market, we see there is an adequate supply,” Kaushal said.
That is, lowering our own footprint to reduce emission intensity, while enabling customers in transition,” Kaushal said.","India’s oil demand growth is expected to remain strong over the next couple of decades, fueled by robust consumption of oil products such as gasoline and LPG, and sustained by resilient economic growth, according to Vikas Kaushal, chairman and managing director of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp.

“I expect overall demand to remain strong for the rest of this year and next year as oil demand is related to core economic activity, and economic growth is showing a lot of resilience,” Kaushal told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, on the sidelines of the annual Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, or ADIPEC 2025, on Nov. 5.

India’s refined oil products demand is projected to increase by 78,000 b/d year over year in 2025, with growth in 2026 expected to reach nearly 218,000 b/d, bringing total demand to about 5.65 million b/d, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Diesel demand growth had been somewhat muted due to seasonal factors, but we are positive about the overall outlook,” Kaushal said.

S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts India’s real gross domestic product to expand by 6.3% in fiscal year 2025-26 (April-March), driven by strong consumption, rationalization of goods and services tax rates and moderating inflation, despite global policy uncertainty. It projects India’s real GDP growth of 6.2% in FY 2026-27.

Kaushal said HPCL’s strategy over the next 5 to 10 years and beyond is closely aligned with India’s growth targets, as the nation progresses toward becoming a $5 trillion economy and ultimately achieving developed nation status by 2047.

“Over the next decade, we see our role not just as a supplier of energy but as a key enabler of India’s economic and social transformation,” Kaushal said. “Our vision at HPCL is to be a trusted, future-ready integrated energy company that supports India’s growth story, while enabling its decarbonization and transition pathways.”

HPCL’s broad vision rests on three pillars: ensuring energy security and access; readiness for the energy transition and a focus on sustainability; and emphasis on innovation, technology and digital leadership, according to Kaushal.

Refinery expansion

HPCL’s two refineries at Mumbai and Visakhapatnam processed a record 6.57 million mt in the July-September quarter, up 4.3% year over year, the company said in a regulatory filing Oct. 29. Total imported crude volumes were 5 million mt, or 396,739 b/d, during the second quarter of the financial year.

Kaushal said HPCL’s overall refining capacity — including joint venture refineries — is set to rise to 45 million mt/year from the current 36 million mt/year, following the completion of the HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd. project.

The complex is jointly built by HPCL and the Rajasthan government, with equity stakes of 74% and 26%, respectively.

“We are on track to complete the project and aiming for crude cut-in over the next few months,” Kaushal said.

HPCL is transitioning to a crude sourcing model that optimizes both term and spot contracts, as upgrades and expansions in refinery technology enable the processing of a broader range of feedstocks, allowing the company to capitalize on abundant market supplies, he said.

“Every time we go to the crude oil market, we see there is an adequate supply,” Kaushal said. “We are having a lot of interactions with oil suppliers here at ADIPEC. The question is about finding the right price and the right grade — heavy or light — depending on the need for our oil products output.”

“In the long run, crude supplies will depend on how much upstream investments are taking place, but in the short run, there is enough supply.”

Energy transition focus

Kaushal said India’s energy transition represents both a national imperative and a significant opportunity, and HPCL is dedicated to leading this transformation.

While ensuring the availability of affordable energy to support India’s rapid growth, he said HPCL is actively reshaping its portfolio to focus on cleaner, more sustainable fuels and low-carbon pathways.

“HPCL will be a pragmatic transition enabler — and have a two-fold approach. That is, lowering our own footprint to reduce emission intensity, while enabling customers in transition,” Kaushal said.

“We are executing a clear plan to net zero (scope 1 and scope 2) by 2040, with a finalized road map guiding investments in efficiency, renewables, green hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage/carbon capture and utilization for hard-to-abate emissions.”

HPCL aims to reduce energy intensity and emissions at its refineries by enhancing efficiency, switching to alternative fuels, adopting renewables, utilizing low-carbon hydrogen, and minimizing flaring — initiatives that are anchored in its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, Kaushal said.",,N,,2025-11-05 17:56:14.091070

The EU measures under this plan are expected to mobilise at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.
European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping.
“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.","The European Commission has adopted its communication on the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out a roadmap to rapidly accelerate the energy transition of aviation and waterborne transport sectors.

To meet the fuel targets set out in the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime Regulations, a significant volume of around 20 million tonnes of sustainable alternative fuels (13.2 Mt of biofuels and 6.8 Mt of e-fuels) will be needed by 2035. This calls for substantial investments from the market, with an estimated €100 billion required by 2035 to drive production.

Regulatory stability is key for attracting investments into renewable and low-carbon fuels. With the STIP, the Commission sends a clear signal to investors that its targets are stable, and that it will support the sector throughout the transition.

The Commission says: By accelerating the production of EU-made sustainable fuels, Europe can significantly boost its competitiveness, reduce its energy dependency on fossil fuels and lead this industrial transition, on the way to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Europe is already a global leader and holds most of the know-how and industrial leadership in this sector.

The EU measures under this plan are expected to mobilise at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027.

The Commission will propose €300 million by end of this year to support the production of hydrogen for sustainable aviation (SAF) and maritime (SMF) fuels through the European Hydrogen Bank.

The Commission will support R&I projects with around €133 million under Horizon Europe.

The Commission will mobilise €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and €293 million for maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

In the medium-term, the EU needs an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to provide revenue certainty and de-risk investments. The Commission will work towards establishing such a mechanism.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future. It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport. This ambitious plan shows the Commission’s firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport. Success will depend on close cooperation among Member States, industry, financiers and civil society to turn this challenge into a strategic opportunity for Europe.""

ECSA responds

European Shipowners welcomed the STIP as a good first step.

“We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

European Shipowners welcome STIP’s suggestion to use national ETS revenues to support the uptake of clean fuels for shipping. The EUR 9 billion generated from the contribution of shipping to the EU ETS should be used to bridge the immense price gap with clean fuels that are on average four times more expensive than conventional fuels.

“STIP takes a major first step towards the use of the national ETS revenues to make clean fuels for shipping available at a competitive price. National ETS revenues have contributed substantially to the scale-up of renewables in Europe. We need to see the same happening for shipping. The use of the ETS revenues should also be matched by a binding mandate on European suppliers to make clean fuels available for shipping” Raptis added.

European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping. Therefore, European Shipowners welcome the commitment of the Commission to assess the burdensome reporting requirements for shipping companies and simplify rules. However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at IMO level” said Raptis.

Danish shipowners respond

For Danish Shipping, the current lack of fuels must be addressed urgently.

“The EU is in imminent danger of being overtaken by China and other ambitious players when it comes to the production of the green fuels we need to power our ships. It is therefore very positive that the Commission has focused on this issue in the STIP. The Commission proposes several sensible action points and investments, and we look forward to seeing these move from strategy to reality,” said Anna Vejlby Ib, Head of Danish Shipping’s EU Representation.

Danish Shipping has previously proposed that part of the DKK 3.8 billion that Danish shipping alone is expected to contribute annually once the sector is fully included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2026 should be earmarked to bridge the price gap between fossil and green fuels — both in production and consumption.

The organization says it is therefore encouraging that the European Commission is now urging Member States to allocate sufficient ETS revenues to the maritime and aviation sectors, including for the production of sustainable and low-emission fuels. The EU itself should follow suit and earmark ETS revenues for the green transition of shipping.

“The EU must focus on ensuring supply, price stability, and competitiveness when it comes to green fuels. The EU should, among other things, set common European targets for the production of green fuels. At Danish Shipping, we view positively the Commission’s proposal on de-risking long-term contracts and introducing two-sided auction mechanisms to reduce the price gap between fossil and green fuels. This is simply a prerequisite for implementing the EU’s own initiatives such as FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Ib.

Danish Shipping also strongly supports the Commission’s ambitions to strengthen cooperation with partner countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt — where there is abundant sun, wind, and robust energy infrastructure.

“It is positive that the Commission maintains its focus on com­petitiveness and the green transition at the same time — not least at a time where other forces are pulling in the opposite direction. Shipping is — and must remain — part of the solution. But that requires the EU to dare to invest massively in the green transition now. The world is not standing still — and neither must Europe,” said Ib.

World Shipping Council (WSC) responds

WSC says financial measures are key in EU's STIP implementation to make renewable fuels competitive.

“The European Commission’s publication today of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) is a promising first step toward accelerating the energy transition in Europe for shipping,” says Jim Corbett, WSC’s Environmental Director, Europe.

“The plan sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.”

World Shipping Council is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the STIP translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers. Without this, production and uptake will stall despite significant fleet investments already made by the liner shipping sector.

WSC calls for the funding outlined in the STIP to focus on:

• Price-bridging measures that make renewable fuels competitive, enabling their use by dual-fuel ships.

• Targeted incentives for renewable fuels to bring production to scale.

• De-risking market investment mechanisms connecting producers and buyers to de-risk investments and accelerate market development.

These measures are essential to help unlock the estimated €100 billion investment needed by 2035 and to ensure that funds mobilized through InvestEU, the European Hydrogen Bank, and the Innovation Fund deliver maximum impact.

Demand for renewable maritime fuels is growing. WSC’s Dual-Fuel Fleet Dashboard shows the readiness of liner fleets, with over €150 billion invested in dual-fuel ships, ready to run on zero/near-zero fuels by 2030. These investments will only translate into GHG emissions reductions if renewable fuels become available at competitive prices.

While the STIP focuses on investment, Europe must not lose focus on additional measures critical for the transition:

• Fit-for-purpose certification of global fuel production to ensure environmental integrity and support early uptake.

• Strategic port infrastructure investments for green fuel bunkering and onshore power supply, to be outlined in the upcoming EU Port Strategy.

SASHA responds

Aurelia Leeuw, Director of EU Policy at the Skies and Seas Hydrogen-fuels Accelerator (SASHA) Coalition, said: “The Commission deserves credit for taking concrete steps to finance and de-risk e-fuel production – especially through the creation of a double-sided auctioning system that can finally bridge the price and contract gaps between fossil and e-fuels, which marks a real stride forward.

""But the STIP still falls short where ambition matters most. An extension of the ETS is still missing, and without it, we won’t generate the revenues needed to truly accelerate decarbonisation in aviation and maritime. And while it’s positive to see recognition of zero-emission aircraft and hydrogen’s role, support for zero-emission technologies across the board remains limited.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/doganmesut-adobe-165213.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 16:56:07.949838

Magdalena Bosson, CEO of Ports of Stockholm, highlighted the joint responsibility and ambition that unite the two countries.","Joint targets for greener port operations

The Memorandum covers a range of joint activities and targets to be implemented across four ports, focusing on reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and promoting circular economy practices. Among the key goals is the installation of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) systems for ro-pax vessels in Paldiski South Harbour and the Port of Kapellskär by 2030, enabling ships to connect to shore power while at berth and thereby reduce CO₂ and noise emissions.

According to Valdo Kalm, CEO of the Port of Tallinn, the collaboration aims to reduce the environmental impact of maritime transport while offering passengers and cargo operators future-oriented, sustainable solutions. In addition to environmental goals, the cooperation also seeks to increase passenger numbers, cargo flows, and ship calls.

Investment in renewable energy solutions

Both ports are also investing in renewable energy solutions. The Port of Tallinn plans to transition to CO₂ emission-free heating and electricity systems at the D-Terminal in Old City Harbour and at Paldiski South Harbour, as well as to deploy solar panels, LED lighting, and other green energy sources.

Ports of Stockholm, in turn, are exploring opportunities for more solar cell installations in Värtahamnen and Kapellskär and explore the possibilities to provide fast charging options for heavy vehicles in the port areas.

Enhancing waste management and circular economy practices

A key focus area of the collaboration is enhancement of waste management and circular economy practices. The Port of Tallinn aims to increase the proportion of ship-generated waste directed to recycling through improved sorting and handling, while Ports of Stockholm are developing solutions for the separate offloading and processing of food waste to produce biogas and reduce hydrogen sulfide levels in sewage treatment systems.

The partners will also assess possibilities for reusing treated greywater, for example for quay flushing, within an ongoing project.

Transition to energy-efficient and zero-emission port operations

Another important goal is the transition to energy-efficient, zero-emission port machinery and transport. The Port of Tallinn will continue the complete conversion to energy-efficient and zero-emission port equipment and promote the use of green taxis, public transport and bicycle infrastructure in port areas.

Ports of Stockholm will follow their port truck strategy for zero-emission cargo handling in the Port of Kapellskär and support further electrification in Värtahamnen to reduce air and noise pollution.

Modernising port terminals with high environmental standards

The cooperation also includes the modernisation of port terminals in line with high environmental standards. The Port of Tallinn will share best practices from the renovation of the D-Terminal and the construction of the new A-Terminal in Old City Harbour, while Ports of Stockholm are rebuilding the Värtahamnen terminal in accordance with the sustainability requirements of Stockholm.

To remind, almost a year ago, Port of Tallinn has announced plans to develop Muuga Harbour and Paldiski South Harbour into leading energy hubs, focusing on sustainable and efficient energy solutions. Around the same time, Ports of Stockholm announced a project that combines onshore power supply (OPS) and microgrid technology to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency and increase port capacity.

This detailed study analyses 73,353 containership voyages completed by 4,750 vessels between July and September 2025, revealing critical patterns in containerships fleet performance as the industry approaches crucial compliance deadlines.

Using enriched primary data captured at the vessel and voyage level, the report examines maritime performance across multiple dimensions - vessel size, age, shipbuilding origin, and specific trade routes - providing stakeholders with the granular analysis necessary for informed decision-making in an increasingly complex operational environment.

Key findings from VesselBot's vessel-level monitoring and analysis reveal:

Emissions Stabilization Amid Traffic Growth: Total containership emissions reached 50.3 million tons in Q3 2025, remaining virtually unchanged (-0.2%) compared to Q3 2024 despite a 2.3% increase in voyages. Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

Trade Tensions Reshape Routing: Direct China-U.S. voyages showed pronounced volatility, declining 3% in the first nine months of 2025 but spiking 15% in July before dropping 10% in September. China's retaliatory port fees targeting U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels introduce additional complexity to carrier deployment strategies.

Persistent Vessel Size Efficiency Gaps: Well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for Feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for Very Large Container Ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while VLCS completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km, which reflects their significantly higher efficiency levels.

Shipbuilding Origin Influences Deployment: Chinese-built vessels completed 36% of Q3 voyages, while 53.1% of vessels under 5 years old have been built from Chinese shipyards. South Korean-built vessels carried out 24.6% of all Q3 containership voyages, but 41.3% of all VLCS. South Korean built vessels' voyages recorded the lowest emissions intensity at 152.7 g CO2e/TEU km due to larger capacities and long-haul trade deployment.

Route-Specific Performance Variations: Major fronthaul trades demonstrate the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days, highlighting how aggregate metrics obscure critical operational differences.

""The regulatory landscape is growing more complex rather than simplified, as evidenced by the European Parliament rejection of the Omnibus simplification effort and the IMO's postponement of the Net-Zero Framework,"" noted C. Komodromos, CEO & Founder of VesselBot. ""With CBAM certification requirements beginning in weeks and Scope 3 reporting deadlines approaching, maritime stakeholders require granular, real-time data to navigate diverging compliance requirements across multiple jurisdictions. Industry averages fail to capture the significant performance variations between vessel sizes, ages, and routes that directly impact both compliance costs and operational efficiency. VesselBot's voyage-level analysis reveals that containership intensity can vary significantly depending on vessel characteristics; insights that are invisible in aggregated data but critical for strategic decision-making in an increasingly carbon-constrained environment.""

We’re bridging maritime expertise and modern technology, delivering solutions that mainly help ship owners and charterers secure the best possible conditions for profitable growth, while reducing complexity and operational costs.

For many years, bunker procurement has been characterized by inefficiency and outdated practices. Manual quotation requests, fragmented communication across email, reliance on spreadsheets, and rapid decision-making without access to comprehensive data have long been standard procedure. This approach is time-consuming, stressful, and inherently risky. XMAR identified these challenges and developed a platform that streamlines the entire process from end to end. The system integrates strategic fuel procurement with intelligent voyage planning, providing real-time supplier visibility, optimized routing, and bunker scheduling that adapts to port availability and weather conditions. This results in fewer deviations, reduced idle time, and minimized fuel waste — ultimately lowering emissions and increasing operational efficiency. Importantly, XMAR’s platform has been designed to serve the full spectrum of industry stakeholders. It is accessible not only to large fleets with dedicated procurement and technical teams but also to smaller operators with lean organizational structures. By democratizing access to digital tools, XMAR enables broader industry participation in the transition toward more sustainable and data-driven operations.

Fincantieri S.p.A. received the 2025 GREEN4SEA – EUROPORT Initiative Award for its ‘’Wave 2 the Future’’ which is a flagship innovation project to pioneer hydrogen-based propulsion systems for maritime applications. Other short-listed nominees were: BERG Propulsion, Columbia Group, NatPower Marine, Port of Rotterdam, Tallinn Shipyard | BLRT REPAIR YARDS.

Accepting the award on behalf of the winner, Enrico Bigi, VP Special Projects, Fincantieri S.p.A., said: ‘’ For over 240 years, we’ve been building ships and – more than that – we’ve been keeping the edge of innovation building best-in-class ships. Innovation is part of our DNA, and we’ve always seen challenges, not obstacles, as opportunities to move forward.

Today, one of the challenges we face is making that future of maritime sustainable. “Wave 2 the Future” is how we’re stepping up. It’s not just a project, it’s how we answer ambitious challenges.’

‘’Wave 2 the Future’’ is part of a broader European initiative to accelerate the green transition through strategic industrial ecosystems. The project focuses on the development of hybrid propulsion systems powered by hydrogen (e.g. fuel cells or reciprocating engines) and on the design of hydrogen-powered combined cycles for onboard power generation. Promising technologies are tested under operational conditions, onboard real ships. As a first result of developing hydrogen technologies, on April 8th, 2025 Fincantieri and Viking announced the first cruise ship in the world to be powered by hydrogen stored onboard for both propulsion and onboard electricity generation, the “Viking Libra”. The vessel is currently under construction at the Fincantieri Ancona shipyard, with delivery scheduled for late 2026. ,Wave 2 the Future initiative is a cornerstone of Fincantieri’s decarbonization roadmap, which anticipates the IMO’s 2050 net-zero targets by 15 years, aiming to achieve them by 2035. Wave 2 the Future is part of the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on Hydrogen, a framework that supports breakthrough innovation across the EU. Within this context, Fincantieri is developing this comprehensive program structured in H2Tech, the first of the 4 IPCEI “waves” on Hydrogen. Together, the 4 IPCEI waves form a complete ecosystem to enable and scale hydrogen adoption in the maritime sector.

Deltamarin received the 2025 GREEN4SEA – EUROPORT Ship Design Award for leading the EU-funded Project CHEK that explored ways to create a more sustainable maritime industry, listed as a Research and Innovation Project success story. Other short-listed nominees were: Besiktas Shipyard, Damen, Fincantieri S.p.A, Norden Shipyard, Ulstein.

Accepting the award on behalf of the winner, Mika Koli, Sales Manager, Offshore, Deltamarin, said: ‘’This recognition means a lot to us, because energy efficiency and smart ship design has always been part of what we do. Today, that same mindset guides our work on future-proof vessels, combining hybrid propulsion systems, advanced energy management and optimized hydrodynamics into balanced, complete ship concepts.

In the CHEK project, our role has been to develop two conceptual ship designs that demonstrate significant energy savings and readiness for new clean fuels.

In May 2024, Deltamarin finished the three-year long EU-funded project called CHEK. Project CHEK involved 15 consortium partners with a focus on decarbonising long-distance shipping. Deltamarin played a central role in the project by orchestrating the decarbonisation methods for the conceptual vessel designs. A future-proof vessel (FPV) design platform was the tool and focus of the development, which allows holistic evaluation of ship energy and environmental efficiency as early as at the ship conceptual design stage. The FPV design platform consists of several digital layers such as ship volume and structural layer (DeltaWay), ship operational propulsion power layer (DeltaSeas) and ship system level energy model (DeltaKey). The various layers have strong connections to each other, but independent analysis can be performed, which is typically necessary in practical project work. The digital design layers are an input to the latest dimension in Deltamarin’s toolbox: life cycle assessment (LCA). The numerous design variations studied during ship conceptual design can now also be analysed in terms of their impact on the ship life time, also considering the upstream energy and material flows and end-of-life stage.

Concluding the event, the winners of the 2025 GREEN4SEA Europort Awards participated in a dedicated panel discussion, sharing their perspectives on the latest green shipping trends shaping the industry. During the session, they reflected on the significance of this recognition for both themselves and the wider maritime community, outlined the key priorities on their sustainability agendas, and discussed the sector’s ongoing progress in improving environmental performance. The panel also examined the actions still required to accelerate the transition to a greener future and highlighted the one change that could deliver a truly profound impact on shipping’s environmental footprint.

After a successful collaboration in 2019 and 2023, SAFETY4SEA and Europort once again this year joined forces to present a total of 15 Awards at special events during the exhibition days.

The winners were those who attracted the most votes by the end of a voting period which was held online during a three-month period. The process included a combination of open nomination and voting which provided a unique opportunity for all nominees to get acknowledged for the hard and good work they put into their projects and initiatives, worth to be awarded.

The results confirm the sector’s growing maturity in integrating environmental sustainability into daily operations, long-term strategies, and stakeholder engagement. The Environmental Management Index (EMI) has reached a new peak value of 8.67 in 2025, continuing the upward trajectory of recent years.

This improvement reflects high scores across nearly all environmental management indicators, particularly in policy establishment, objective setting, monitoring, and transparency. The share of ports with a certified Environmental Management System (EMS) now stands at 78%, a 24-point increase since 2013.

The existence of an Environmental Policy has risen to 99%, and for the first time, 100% of ports report having defined environmental improvement objectives. Communication of environmental policies has also reached new records. 95% of ports share their policies with stakeholders, and 91% publish them online, underscoring the sector’s commitment to transparency and public engagement.

Regulatory imperative

The Fit for 55 regulations, particularly AFIR and FuelEU, are having a significant impact on ports and present considerable challenges. The growing availability of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) connection points across ports reflects long-standing efforts by the sector, independent of regulatory obligations.

While this indicator does not measure member states’ compliance with the 2030 targets, it clearly shows that ports have been proactively working on OPS since well before the introduction of current regulations.

New indicators in 2025 on the availability of alternative fuels in ports shows that port managers are actively supporting the energy transition in line with their landlord and community building functions. This figure is expected to rise further, provided there is sufficient demand for these fuels.

At a time of increasingly stringent environmental requirements—both in terms of reporting and compliance—it is essential to demonstrate how ports voluntarily strive to improve their surroundings and reduce the environmental impact of port activities

… commented Tim Verhoeven, ESPO Senior Policy Advisor and EcoPorts Coordinator.

Environmental monitoring

The monitoring section tracks how ports assess environmental aspects such as air quality, noise, water quality, and energy use, while also highlighting progress in climate adaptation. In 2025, 95% of ports report conducting environmental monitoring, with the most frequently monitored issues being port waste (87%), energy efficiency (84%), ship waste (84%), and water quality (79%).

A growing share of ports now faces operational disruptions due to climate change (69%), with 77% adapting existing infrastructure and 86% integrating adaptation into new developments, demonstrating a strong shift toward climate-resilient planning, an important trend for the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy and the European Oceans Pact.

Zero-emission ambitions

This year’s report introduces a new focus on ports’ zero-emission ambitions, in line with Europe’s broader climate objectives, including the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy on decarbonisation and energy transition, and the European Green Deal. The results show that 80% of ports have established their own GHG reduction targets where required, while 66% have defined air emissions reduction targets and report compliance with local authority requirements.

However, only 37% of ports report the existence of low-emission zones or emission standards at berth.

These measures often require coordination with local and national authorities, and their implementation raises concerns about ensuring a level playing field between ports and Member States.

The implementation of FuelEU Maritime Regulation will provide an EU-wide framework, requiring certain vessels to connect to Onshore Power Supply (OPS) from 2030-2035, which is expected to address this issue more consistently.

Encouragingly, 53% of ports have adopted zero-emission targets for port-related activities, signalling an increasing commitment to contribute to climate neutrality by 2050.

Top environmental priorities

This year’s report also provides insights into the top 10 environmental priorities identified by ports. Climate change, air quality and energy efficiency are the top three concerns, reflecting the sector’s focus on decarbonisation and resilience. Other high-ranking priorities include port development, noise and water quality.

This year’s results confirm the continued expansion of green services to shipping, such as Onshore Power Supply (OPS), LNG bunkering, and environmentally differentiated port dues.

In 2025, 62% of ports offer OPS, 50% of them with high voltage, and 51% provide LNG bunkering, reflecting strong progress in alternative energy infrastructure.

For the use of new fuels for shipping, such as hydrogen and biofuels, is starting to gain relevance. Environmentally differentiated dues, used by 61% of ports, reward cleaner shipping and reinforce ports’ role in maritime decarbonisation.

Clean fuels for road transport

The report also tracks developments in clean fuels for cars and trucks, reflecting ports’ growing role in supporting the decarbonisation of road transport. As of 2025, 95% of ports report having electricity charging stations for cars and trucks, up from 85% the previous year, demonstrating strong momentum in electrification efforts.

In contrast, hydrogen fuelling infrastructure remains limited, with only 8% of ports offering this service.

Conclusion

According to ESPO, together, these findings confirm that European ports are making meaningful strides toward improved environmental performance, stronger governance, and climate action.

Continued progress in areas such as climate adaptation, clean energy infrastructure, and staff training will be essential to maintain momentum and meet the EU’s sustainability goals in the decade ahead.

ESPO’s Environmental Report is a cornerstone of the EcoPorts initiative, designed to champion environmental sustainability in European ports. This year’s edition draws upon data collected from 77 European ports across 18 countries. Through the EcoPorts Self-Diagnosis Method (SDM), ports submit a wide range of environmental data, providing the basis for the report.

The 2025 Environmental Report once again highlights the positive progress ports are making in environmental management. It introduces new and relevant indicators and outlines the top priorities for EcoPorts

He says having worked for a cruise line on his return means he has “extensively more knowledge and experience. It helps me to keep the broader picture in my mind and look at opportunities to work at a higher level with others in the maritime community”.

Some 12 years ago, CLIA grew rapidly through a consolidation of various entities to create greater efficiency and alignment across the cruise community, reflecting the direction and priorities of its member lines. This forms part of Mr Darr’s vision for the association. “I want to complete the transformation, so we look and feel and move as one organisation globally that shares resources among the areas we operate in around the world.”

Another focus for Mr Darr is collaborating with other sectors of the maritime community. Indeed, a clear example is his attendance and speech at Interferry’s conference. And straight after, he was flying to International Ports and Harbours Association’s (IAPH) conference in Kobe, Japan, to ink an MoU between the former and CLIA.

He expands, “I am focused on building higher levels of collaboration with other organisations, such as the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association.” He also singles out CLIA’s recent 10-year agreement with Seatrade.

“Our MoU with IAPH is a co-operation to identify areas of mutual interest, of which they are many. I have an open mind as to how to work together. I have also stayed very close to the International Chamber of Shipping and BIMCO, looking to better enhance what we bring to the table. I want to put serving the needs of our members front and centre and think about what we grow into.”

Turning to some of the challenges facing the industry, he speaks about shore power. Some 60% of CLIA’S members’ fleet (166 ships) have shoreside power, a number that is expected to grow to 273 ships by 2036. But by contrast, less than 3% of ports that cruise ships call at provide shore power, and they provide power for only one ship.

Mr Darr says, “The first and most obvious thing is that our members must ready themselves and have done the engineering so that when it becomes available, they have the equipment installed. We are helping to make sure the regulations are fit for purpose and are working with ports to determine which ones are the best candidates. On top of this, shore power needs to meet the technical standards that are well developed, be offered at a competitive price and come from a source that is environmentally sound. We are helping to bring these pieces together and make connections,” Mr Darr says, adding, “It is difficult to suggest 100% readiness on ships when there is 3% readiness in places we are going to call. And that 3% is the terminal being able to provide one berth for shore power. On the shipboard side there is a very high degree of confidence. On the shore side, if society and the political leadership think it is important, it will happen.”

But there is, he points out, a large challenge to overcome, the availability of grid density. “If smaller communities need the power, those ports are not going to have the extra grid density available. Some large ports sometimes have challenges here – it is not just about the equipment, it is having the electrons available while still serving the community.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/Bud_Darr_photo_MSC_Group1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-05 09:56:19.282724

Maritime transport carries over 80% of global goods and accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. Ports, as nodes of global trade, require an estimated $1-2 trillion in cumulative investment through 2050 for shore power electrification, alternative fuel bunkering infrastructure and zero-emission cargo-handling equipment. Yet approximately $200 billion in sustainability-linked capital remains untapped due to technical, financial, and regulatory barriers facing port authorities.

C40 Cities, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) launched on 4 November the Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan (SLL) Initiative at the C40 World Mayors Summit. The partnership as stated, aims to unlock investment in sustainable port infrastructure and accelerate the maritime sector’s just transition to net-zero.

Ports are gateways of international trade, and this global framework sets a new precedent, sending clear signals to the market and accelerating the pace and scale of climate finance for critical investments in zero-emission port infrastructure.

…said Andrea Fernandez, Managing Director of Climate Finance, Knowledge, and Partnerships, C40 Cities.

As explained, the initiative establishes the first global framework specifically tailored to deploy Sustainability-Linked Loans for port decarbonisation projects worldwide.

The initiative builds on extensive groundwork, including market assessments and lender outreach to 30 commercial banks, confirming strong support for standardised port SLL frameworks. Furthermore, the partnership formalises the Memorandum of Understanding signed between IFC and C40 in September 2024, moving beyond information-sharing to active co-leadership of sector-wide financial mobilisation.

The Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative marks an important step forward for further collaboration between ports, loan providers, and regulators. These land-based investments can fund long-term infrastructure and support offtake agreements for low and zero-carbon shipping fuels and liquid bulk transport.

Container vessels now command 65% of all alternative-fuel orders, with dual-fuel configurations dominating 79% of the current orderbook.

LNG-fueled container vessels represent more than a technical fix for carbon emissions.","As global shipping navigates the treacherous waters between decarbonization mandates and geopolitical upheaval, liquefied natural gas has emerged as the container industry’s fuel of choice a pragmatic wager that’s reshaping maritime energy politics.

LNG-fueled container vessels are positioned for continued expansion despite regulatory uncertainty, driven by practical advantages over methanol and immediate decarbonization benefits.

However, this growth trajectory intersects with escalating geopolitical tensions around energy security, trade protectionism, and shipping infrastructure vulnerabilities.

LNG-fueled container ship orders nearly doubled from 194 vessels in late 2023 to 362 by mid-October 2025, even as overall alternative-fuel orders dropped to just 52% of the previous year’s levels.

Container vessels now command 65% of all alternative-fuel orders, with dual-fuel configurations dominating 79% of the current orderbook.

Container operators are betting on LNG’s practical advantages over competitors like methanol, which remains constrained by limited supply and stubbornly high prices.

LNG delivers immediate benefits: a 20% reduction in carbon emissions, widespread infrastructure availability, and operational flexibility that proves invaluable when trade routes shift unexpectedly.

The Ukraine war accelerated what climate policy alone couldn’t achieve. Desperate to replace Russian pipeline gas, Europe built seven new LNG terminals in the Baltic region between October 2022 and March 2024. Germany alone commissioned five facilities a breakneck pace enabled by emergency legislation that swept aside normal bureaucratic procedures.

This infrastructure boom creates a virtuous cycle for maritime LNG adoption. As terminals proliferate, bunkering becomes easier. As more ships burn LNG, terminal economics improve. The container industry finds itself riding a wave of geopolitical necessity disguised as energy transition.

Yet this transition unfolds against deepening US-China antagonism that threatens to reshape global shipbuilding.

China controls 53.3% of global shipbuilding capacity while the US limps along at 0.1%. Chinese yards lead in constructing LNG-capable vessels, but Washington’s proposed docking fees targeting Chinese-built ships introduce a costly dilemma for carriers.

The Red Sea crisis exposes how regional instability can upend even the best-laid plans.

Houthi attacks forced container ships to reroute around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, adding 70% to journey lengths and fuel consumption. For LNG vessels, this means burning more gas to achieve the same emissions reductions a reminder that geopolitics can erase technical advantages overnight.

The disruption also highlights dual-fuel vessels’ strategic value. When routes lengthen unexpectedly or fuel prices spike, the ability to switch between LNG and conventional bunkers becomes a critical hedge against uncertainty.

The market’s trajectory depends on which forces dominate.

If the IMO delivers regulatory clarity by October 2026, orders could surge past 500 vessels. But protectionist escalation could choke supply, stalling growth around 380-400 vessels as Western yards struggle to fill the gap.

A prolonged Red Sea crisis validates dual-fuel flexibility but strains LNG supply chains.

Chinese economic weakness might slow orders while maintaining long-term momentum. Most likely, extreme energy price volatility driven by multiple conflicts will accelerate adoption as operators prize fuel-switching capability above all else.

LNG-fueled container vessels represent more than a technical fix for carbon emissions. They’ve become strategic assets in a fragmenting global order, where energy security, trade tensions, and maritime chokepoints intersect with climate imperatives.

The International Maritime Organization’s delayed Net-Zero Framework symbolizes this complexity industry momentum for decarbonization persists despite regulatory uncertainty, driven by commercial logic and geopolitical necessity rather than policy mandates alone.

What emerges is a shipping sector navigating by multiple stars: environmental targets, fuel economics, infrastructure availability, and the hard realities of a world where trade routes can become battlegrounds overnight.

In this environment, LNG’s dominance reflects not perfection but pragmatism a transitional solution for transitional times, when the destination remains clear even as the path keeps shifting.

The container industry’s LNG bet will likely pay off, but not quite as planned.

Photo credit: CMA CGM Published: 5 November, 2025","A 12-month delay regarding work towards consensus on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Net-Zero Framework has given more time for the shipping industry to develop a pragmatic approach towards maritime decarbonisation, believes a classification society DNV representative.

Gustad Hormazdi, Business Development Director, Maritime, DNV made the following observation during ‘The Rise of LNG as a Sustainable Marine Fuel’ panel discussion session at the Asia Gas Markets Conference 2025 on Tuesday (28 October).

Hormazdi highlighted the complex interplay between demand, supply, and regulatory clarity as hurdles for the maritime industry’s transition towards decarbonisation, including for the adoption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a bunker fuel.

While there has been a large number of LNG-fuelled vessels on order, the supply infrastructure for LNG bunkering needs to keep pace. He observed shipyards in China and Korea are demonstrating a strong appetite for building LNG Bunker vessels, indicating scaling up production can be achieved once demand solidifies.

However, he cautioned investor hesitation persists due to regulatory uncertainty, despite motivators such as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).

“DNV actively works with energy companies, charterers, and owners to analyse various scenarios and has even submitted a white paper to the IMO (Report of the Comprehensive impact assessment of the basket of candidate GHG reduction mid-term measures) on tariffs and penalty schemes to help shape acceptable policy routes,” he shared.

Addressing DNV’s stance, Hormazdi explained its Maritime Forecast to 2050 and Energy Transition Outlook reports advocate for a balanced and pragmatic approach to the life cycle assessment of marine fuels. This position aims to support early adopters by preventing overly theoretical approaches that could hinder investment in renewable and near-zero fuels.

Regarding the IMO’s decision to delay the Net-Zero Framework, Hormazdi described it as an delay in decision making noting while April 2025 targets were initially well-received subsequent discussions revealed numerous unresolved technical and governance issues.

These included questions about compensating for near-zero fuels, correction factors (within the guidelines related to GFI), specific lifecycle assessment methodologies, and the management of a proposed fund of between USD 10 to 15 billion annually.

He noted 57 countries voted in favour of adjournment, 49 countries opposed, and 21 abstained – underscoring divided opinions towards adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

Moving ahead, Hormazdi suggested “book-and-claim” mechanisms for biomethane could accelerate decarbonisation provided if issues of trust, assurance, and tagging are adequately addressed.

He also acknowledged the positive impact of the EU ETS and other decarbonisation measures on marine fuel choices, leading to immediate offsets for using energy.

Global marine insurer NorthStandard on Monday (3 November) shared more information regarding the one-year US-China port fee suspension:

The United States and China have agreed to a one-year suspension of their respective port service fees on vessels with a US or Chinese nexus, effective 10 November 2025. The agreement follows trade discussions and aims to stabilise maritime and economic relations between both nations.

Further to press reports of a trade deal reached between the United States and China on 30 October 2025, the White House has published a Fact Sheet dated 1 November 2025, available here.

The Fact Sheet confirms that a “trade and economic deal” was reached in the Republic of Korea between U.S. President Donald J. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China. It includes the following statement regarding suspension of the US service fees imposed on vessels with a Chinese nexus:

The United States will suspend for one year, starting on November 10, 2025, implementation of the responsive actions taken pursuant to the Section 301 investigation on China’s Targeting the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance. In the meantime, the United States will negotiate with China pursuant to Section 301 while continuing its historic cooperation with the Republic of Korea and Japan on revitalizing American shipbuilding.

The PRC Ministry of Commerce has also reported on the agreement (Chinese version only), available here.

According to that report, the United States will suspend its Section 301 measures first, after which China will reciprocally suspend its special port fees on vessels with a US nexus.

Accordingly, if the United States duly implements its suspension on 10 November 2025, China is expected to suspend its countermeasures against vessels with a US nexus for the same one-year period.

Further clarification is awaited, including whether fees will continue to be charged in the interim period up to 10 November 2025. No details have yet been published on this or on any potential refund or claw-back mechanism for fees already paid or payable in the interim period, although there are reports that some ship operators are engaging U.S. counsel to seek guidance from the relevant US authorities.

As advised previously, should members be unsure about how the port fees will affect them, they should seek US or PRC legal advice as appropriate, or contact the Club’s dedicated US-China Tariffs team or their usual Club contact for further assistance.

French shipping giant CMA CGM on Tuesday (4 November) announced the entry into the fleet and registration under the French flag of ten Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) dual-fuel vessels, each with a capacity of 24,212 TEUs, among the largest and most energy-efficient in the world.

By choosing France, CMA CGM said it is making a powerful statement in favour of French maritime and logistical sovereignty on the global stage.

Rodolphe Saadé, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, said: “CMA CGM has decided to register ten new 24,000 TEU vessels, among the largest in the world, under the French flag starting next year.

“Powered by liquefied natural gas, they reflect our confidence in France’s maritime sector and its people, with the recruitment of 135 French seafarers and a strengthened partnership with the French Maritime Academy (ENSM).

“These vessels will serve two major French ports, Le Havre and Dunkirk, on the Asia–Northern Europe route, reinforcing our presence in France at a time when the sea plays an increasingly strategic role in global economic and geopolitical dynamics.”

These vessels, among the largest container ships in the world, will operate under French law in terms of safety and working conditions, thus upholding the excellence and influence of the French flag.

These LNG dual-fuel vessels are compatible with biomethane and e-methane, two low-carbon alternative fuels that reduce CO2 emissions by 67% and 85% respectively, while significantly cutting atmospheric pollutants, including sulfur oxides, fine particles, and nitrogen oxides.

Thanks to their large capacity, which improves carbon intensity, these vessels concretely illustrate the CMA CGM Group’s commitment to more sustainable and responsible shipping.

Each will bear the name of an iconic French monument or landmark:

CMA CGM NOTRE DAME, CMA CGM PANTHÉON, CMA CGM ORSAY,

CMA CGM LUXEMBOURG, CMA CGM PONT NEUF, CMA CGM VERSAILLES,

The revised discussion on 19 November 2025, IMO MEPC 83: What next?, addresses how the delay reframed industry thinking on carbon and shipping, the likely effects on tanker operations and trade, the weight of regional regulation during the pause, how the framework could still progress despite the adjournment, and what the sector should anticipate heading into MEPC 84.

The confirmed line-up comprised ABS manager, global sustainability Ilias Soultanias; Braemar global head of decarbonisation and fuel transition Joey Ng; DNV senior vice president and global segment director for tankers Catrine Vestereng; IPTA general manager Mike Beviss; and MOL (Asia Oceania) general manager – carbon solutions (A) Capt Ashutosh Kumar.

The adjournment stemmed from the need to complete guideline work, including financial architecture, rather than a reversal of direction.

That interpretation shapes the panel’s new brief: tanker stakeholders should plan on the basis that the overall trajectory persisted while the detail matured.

Commercial contributions to the briefing emphasised that regional measures would continue to shape exposure during the interval, and that includes ongoing obligations linked to regimes in the UK, Turkey, parts of Africa and the EU.

The delay following MEPC 83 also highlights immature credit markets for low-carbon fuels, uneven operating experience with biofuel pathways and upward pressure on biofuel costs.

These elements, taken together, reinforced the message that owners and charterers needed to price compliance, not pause it.

The delay at MEPC 83 does not impact other regulations, and the panel will discuss short-term compliance levers within EU regimes.

It's already identified new wetlands and rewetted peatlands as ""areas of opportunity"" to pull more carbon out of the atmosphere.

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts released the new 'Assessment Framework for Carbon Removals' on Tuesday night.

It signalled the coalition's desire to amend the Climate Change Response Act (CCRA) to recognise new carbon removal activities in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

""Now change that we're proposing won't automatically mean that that will be effective, but it creates an effect, a mechanism for us to be able to in a future point in time, recognise and reward those activities in the ETS which will make it faster and simpler as and when we do that,"" Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said.

The minister said New Zealand needed to be more ""agnostic"" about how the country removed carbon, scoping out past just forestry.

""At the moment the market only recognises forestry, particularly exotics and some forms of natives, as the only mechanism that sequesters carbon. We know that scientifically, that's not the case.

""There are other aspects within the broader ecosystem that do sequester carbon, including quite significant areas of opportunity in the blue carbon space in terms of oceans, soil sequestration, wetlands and other considerations like that.""

The government was still working out how new methods of carbon removal could be rewarded, Watts said.

""You could recognise or reward sequestration either through the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme or thorugh a voluntary carbon market using a biodiversity credit.

""We're not set on this one or the other,"" he said.

The minister said the framework released this week was ""a first step"" and he was committed to proceeding with caution, given the range of scientific criteria other countries had adopted.

""We want to make sure that if we do put this in place that it's done so in a credible way.""

Changes to the Climate Change Response Act

On top of the carbon removals framework, the government set out a raft of changes it would make to the CCRA.

They include:

Removing or fixing unnecessary, complex or duplicative requirements in the Climate Change Response Act. This includes removing the need for the Climate Change Commission to provide advice on policy direction prior to an emissions reduction plan being developed by the government and removing duplicative consultation requirements, for both the commission and the government.

Improving functions of the NZ ETS (amending the Industrial Allocation settings, changing the annual ETS settings process to a biennial one, removing the requirement for ETS Settings to accord with Nationally Determined Contributions)

Expanding opportunities for other types of carbon removals to be recognised in the NZ ETS in the future.

Other technical updates to make it easier for stakeholders to comply with the requirements of the CCRA.

Watts said the CCRA had been in place for a while and needed to be changed to ""increase the efficiency and reduce the amount of bureaucracy and duplication"" embedded in it when it was drafted.

""We now know and have experience across multiple climate ministers and multiple governments of the reality of what this legislation is in terms of operationalising that.

""I think it would be fair to say that a wide range of climate ministers, since the implementation of this bill, would have had a degree of appetite and also identification that there's some aspects within the bill that are not necessarily deriving the intended outcomes of the bill and are unnecessary or duplicative.

""So we are simply using the opportunity to make those changes and clear it up and as a result of that, it creates more capacity within our system and particularly our public system, to focus on the actions required in order to meet our targets and reduce emissions.""

The government would introduce an amendment bill to the Climate Change Response Act to make these changes next year.

It's also decided to change the neutrality goal for the Carbon Neutral Government Programme from 2025 to 2050.

""This change acknowledges that the original 2025 deadline was too soon for organisations to reduce their emissions enough to meet carbon neutrality,"" Watts said

""The new deadline also aligns with New Zealand's broader, legislated 2050 net zero target.""",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--bsvIFbeg--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1759259731/4K087UG_Image_2_jfif?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-11-04 13:01:08.563135

The newbuilding prediction rests on final investment decisions (FIDs) taken on LNG projects through the middle of 2025. In total, those projects are expected to produce some 84M tonnes of LNG each year.

Mr Berterottière’s estimations of the need for ""close to around 150"" new LNGCs is a better than back-of-the-envelope calculation by one of the companies that stands to gain sizeable contracts associated with the uptick in newbuild orders.

The majority of the LNG volumes expected will come from projects sanctioned in the US, with US President Trump following through on a campaign promise to end a Biden-era moratorium on granting LNG export permits if elected to a second term.

According to Mr Berterottière, about 80% of the total volume of LNG that’s been sanctioned in 2025 has come from the US, and the export of those volumes is linked to a higher ’shipping intensity’, or more vessels needed to carry the same amounts that fewer vessels carry on projects enacted in other areas of the world.

From the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has a long history of setting strict global climate goals, requiring countries to forgo energy freedom and adopt net-zero mandates with no consideration of their effect on our pocketbooks.

While the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has played the most prominent role in pushing the transition to net-zero, the most recent effort comes from a lesser-known agency: the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Established in 1958 with the stated purpose of facilitating international cooperation on the high seas, the IMO has re-oriented its focus on safety, efficiency, and pollution mitigation to include “tackling the climate crisis.”

Citing the UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 — which directs all countries to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts” — the IMO adopted a “GHG Strategy” that sets a goal of net-zero shipping by 2050. In doing so, the IMO included some “mid-term” measures to try and achieve this goal, which involve setting a marine fuel standard and greenhouse gas emissions pricing mechanism — i.e., a first-of-its-kind global carbon tax targeting global shipping. With almost no one paying attention, the IMO tried to reach beyond its scope of authority and reinvent the shipping industry. In April, the IMO approved a draft regulation for the carbon tax. They would’ve gotten away with it if not for President Trump.

Carbon taxes are a red line that most self-respecting U.S. politicians have been unwilling to cross, as evidenced by the failure of the 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act, an attempt to implement a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system. It’s no surprise, therefore, that the IMO’s proposal relies on heavy support from climate catastrophists in the European Union.

Proponents point out that the $11-13 billion in annual revenue generated from the tax by 2030 would go towards IMO investments in helping the industry transition to greener shipping. But there is a reason why the industry hasn’t already invested in this transition. Low-carbon fuel alternatives, such as ammonia and methanol, have lower energy densities than traditional fuels, which requires ships to have larger storage capacity or refuel more than twice as often as conventional ships, according to the Global Maritime Forum. All this extra space and stoppage make each trip longer and less fruitful; when applied to the world’s fleet, these consequences would be disastrous.

Shipping is the most essential transportation mechanism for the global economy. Representing around 90% of global trade, over 50,000 merchant ships are responsible for transporting many of the products and raw materials people across the world rely on, ranging from automobiles to liquified natural gas. With the industry accounting for only 3% of global carbon emissions and 11% of life-cycle carbon emissions for the transportation sector, while also being instrumental to avoiding supply chain disruptions, it’s clear that the economic effects of forcing a transition to lower-carbon alternatives would heavily outweigh any climate benefits derived from the tax.

Even if Europe could shoulder these costs (though why they would want to is beyond me), the reality is that much of the world remains energy poor, meaning that any additional fee on transporting the vital products they require could cost lives — not just far in the future, as climate extremists predict, but now.

People across the world should be grateful that the Trump administration had the conviction to stand up to Europe and oppose the tax. Via a joint statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, the administration threatened to impose visa restrictions, port fees, and sanctions on the individuals and states supporting the IMO’s net-zero framework, calling it a “neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” This pressure contributed to the body voting 57-29 to postpone a decision on implementing the regulation by another year.

The IMO’s attempted carbon tax continues a long line of UN efforts to push a green agenda by punishing countries for continuing to rely on natural gas, oil, and coal. President Trump did the world a tremendous service by fighting back against this EU-led initiative. However, the war is not yet won. The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee will reconvene in October 2026 to vote again on formally adopting the tax.

The Trump administration needs to remain vigilant, using any available leverage to ensure the world doesn’t decide to change course and allow the tax to go into effect next year. Moreover, the administration should look more closely at our relationship with the UN and, without significant reforms, consider whether the more than $13 billion we give to the UN every year is worth the headaches we get in return.

The endeavor, announced on November 4 at a summit, is supported by the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The partnership reportedly formalizes a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between C40 and the IFC in September 2024.

The partnership is to focus on unlocking “massive investments” for environmentally friendly port infrastructure development projects with the overarching goal of speeding up maritime decarbonization. Per officials from C40 Cities, the initiative will set up “the first global framework tailored to deploy SLL for port decarbonization projects” around the world.

“Ports are gateways of international trade, and this global framework sets a new precedent, sending clear signals to the market and accelerating the pace and scale of climate finance for critical investments in zero-emission port infrastructure,” C40 Cities Managing Director of Climate Finance, Knowledge, and Partnerships Andrea Fernández highlighted.

As elaborated, the collaboration will target $1 billion in green maritime infrastructure investment within three years, delivering market guidance, capacity-building programs and direct access to finance for port authorities, especially in the Global South, where financing barriers have impeded the deployment of eco-friendly infrastructure.

In doing so, the SLL will help tackle a $200 billion sustainability-linked financing gap for infrastructure in the maritime sector, which has arisen largely due to technical, financial, and regulatory barriers facing port authorities, C40 has said.

The project breakdown

As informed, the C40-IFC-IAPH partnership is to directly tackle the climate finance gap via:

‘standardized’ SLL frameworks that tie loan terms to sustainability KPIs that could minimize transaction costs and ‘boost’ investor confidence;

technical advisory support that could aid port authorities put together investment-ready projects and access a global network of development banks as well as commercial lenders;

blended finance mechanisms integrated with concessional climate funds, development bank capital and commercial investment, which is expected to de-risk early-stage green technological solutions;

capacity-building programs that encompass regional workshops and Port SLL Academies targeting participants from the Global South nations.

As noted, the partnership will endeavoe to start with the regional workshops and capacity-building programme in 2026.

As a result, it is expected that the envisaged impact could push C40’s efforts to:

prepare more than 50 zero-emission port and maritime transport projects for investment by 2030;

mobilize “resilient and sustainable” infrastructure finance by using IFC’s capacity;

lower maritime and port-related emissions in participating cities by 25-40% by 2035;

produce up to 4 million new jobs around the world by 2050 via maritime decaebonization (especially in the Global South port towns);

support C40’s own target of creating at least 50 million green jobs by 2030;

provide ‘equitable’ access to competitive infrastructure financing for IAPH member ports in the Global South and Small Island States.

“The Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative marks an important step forward for further collaboration between ports, loan providers, and regulators. These land-based investments can fund long-term infrastructure and support offtake agreements for low and zero-carbon shipping fuels and liquid bulk transport,” IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven commented.

“This initiative complements IAPH’s work on the Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM HUBS) initiative, which aims to import, export, bunker, and where feasible, produce clean energy sources and zero and near-zero emission fuels,” Verhoeven added.

To remind, last year, after having commissioned Maritime & Transport Business Solutions (MTBS) to conduct a study on port climate adaptation and decarbonization investment needs of developing nations, the IAPH submitted submitted the findings of this research to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), seeking to emphasize the extent of the necessary investments.

Specifically, the study had estimated that the aggregate total investment needs for ports in developing nations lay between $55 and $83 billion.

For Deniz Kirdar True, Managing Director, AMEA at Svitzer, sustainability isn’t a buzzword or perhaps a distant ambition; it’s a daily operational reality woven into the very fabric of tugboat movements, data dashboards, and the design of the vessels themselves.

“I think for us, our decarbonisation ambition is one goal,” she says in an exclusive conversation with ET Edge Insights. “We do not really differentiate between developing markets and developed markets because we want to embrace this as a company as a whole.”

And that ethos drives Svitzer’s strategy as it redefines what sustainability looks like in maritime logistics. This approach rests on three pillars: behaviour, equipment, and fuel. Each one, True explains, plays a role in helping ports cut emissions while maintaining the efficiency global shipping depends on.

Powering everyday decisions

For True, sustainability begins with behaviour. “Everybody can make a difference,” she insists. It’s a philosophy that has given rise to Aim for Eight — Svitzer’s internal campaign encouraging tug crews to mobilise and demobilise at the most economic speed possible.

“You go at the most economic speed when you do not need to give full power, when the customer is not asking for it,” True says. “We say the best fuel is the fuel that you haven’t burnt.”

The logic is rather simple: efficiency saves both carbon and cost. From digital dashboards that allow tug masters and pilots to analyse past operations to closer coordination with port traffic schedulers, Svitzer is using data and teamwork to eliminate idle time and wasted fuel.

“If they plan it in a way that a vessel is going to depart and that they tell us, ‘Please go and be ready,’ but then we go there, we keep burning fuel, but the vessel is not ready — you sit there for 45 minutes for no reason burning fuel,” she says. “So, if we can improve this vessel scheduling with coordination, everything happens just in time, which also means you don’t burn the fuel.”

These behavioural shifts, she says, are meaningful because they can be implemented immediately — “something you can do today”, without waiting for new technologies or regulation.

Reimagining the tugboat

The second pillar — equipment — focuses on optimising and reconfiguring what Svitzer already has. With more than 450 assets worldwide, even incremental upgrades can have a telling impact.

“There’s a lot of equipment that if you can do some tweaks and improvements, actually you can reduce your fuel consumption,” True notes. “It may be that you’re not reinventing something, but you’re just restructuring it — configuring it differently — and that gives you a different outcome.”

But here, ambitions extend far beyond retrofits. “How do we design the future tug, and what sort of equipment needs to go in?” she asks. “What can we do with the main engine manufacturers, battery manufacturers, and all these different ways of putting things together?”

That question is already bearing fruit in the transverse tug design—a new configuration that, by rethinking hull structure, propeller placement, and towline geometry, reduces emissions by 15 percent without changing the fuel type. “Just being a little, you know, thinking a little differently, out of the box… the tug itself can deliver a 15 percent reduction,” she says.

The quest for the next energy

If behaviour and equipment are about optimisation, the third pillar — fuel — is about transformation. “What can we do today?” True, he asks.

The company has already adopted drop-in biofuels—both blended and pure—that can be used in existing vessels without modification. “They can work with existing assets and existing equipment today,” she says. But the future of fuel, she believes, will be multi-faceted.

“That energy can come from, maybe it’s going to be electricity. Maybe it’s going to be some hybrid structure. Is it going to come from methanol?” she muses. “Because I think there will be a variety of fuels in the future as well.”

For now, Svitzer is betting big on battery technology. “If you think about tugs as a near-shore vessel — these are not vessels that are going to sail forever into the ocean, right? They always return to the shore,” True explains. “We think there is a very big potential out of the battery technology.”

In certain ports, hybrid or fully electric tugs can already work for two hours, recharge in one, and get back on the water. “Battery technology is, I think, really, really important,” she says. “Then I think drop-in fuels are super important as well.”

Decarbonising the port ecosystem

True is quick to note that progress in this space depends on collaboration. “Individually we applaud every partner, you know, everyone in the maritime industry that goes alone and sets a high ambition and a target and then tries to achieve it regardless of what’s happening,” she says. “That’s what we are doing. So, we have our own ambitions. No matter what IMO does or doesn’t do, we will go for it.”

But the greatest impact, she believes, lies in systemic change — led by ports themselves. “They are the ones shaping the narrative. They are the ones owning that decarbonisation agenda across their whole ecosystem,” she says.

That collaboration can be immediate — aligning vessel scheduling, data sharing, and behaviour — or infrastructural, through joint investments in shore power, solar energy, or charging networks. “If they set the tone by saying this is what we want to do, now we can co-invest together on electric tugs,” she explains.

Ultimately, she argues, sustainability and performance are not opposing forces. “I see it as one,” True says. “It’s all the same agenda.” By improving efficiency, ports can cut emissions and reinvest the savings in greener fuels. “We will work on behaviour, we are going to reduce the emissions, and we are going to reduce the fuel consumption,” she explains. “That’s going to save X number of dollars. And that then gets invested into buying sustainable fuels. So the net effect is actually zero.”

The result is what she calls a “self-reinforcing ”circle”—one where environmental responsibility strengthens commercial competitiveness.

Innovation, a daily practice

So far as innovation goes, True’s definition is refreshingly pragmatic. “For us, innovation is a combination of small and meaningful improvements that actually can deliver significant value,” she says. “It doesn’t need to be something like from one day to another you just generate some big bang.”

That belief underscores Svitzer’s success with its transverse tug — a product of many small, proven ideas combined in a new way. “All of these things are actually not something that came from the moon,” she laughs. “They came from trials and tested solutions in various places. When they are put all together, then they create something really, really meaningful.”

To her, innovation isn’t confined to the engineering lab or boardroom. It’s a mindset shared by every mariner and port operator in the ecosystem. “It’s innovation every day. Everybody can contribute to doing something different to contribute to the decarbonisation agenda,” she says.

And while technology will play a pivotal role, True reminds us that progress ultimately depends on people. “It’s about the people — the people actually on the front line,” she says. “All these seafarers, everyone, I’m sure they have a lot of ideas of what could be done to improve today and into the future.”

Her message is clear: the maritime industry’s path to decarbonisation will not be defined by one grand solution but by thousands of coordinated acts of innovation, collaboration, and discipline. “If you are going to wait for one solution that’s going to magically decarbonise everything, that’s not going to happen,” True says. “Everyone needs to work together and collaborate.”

As global shipping navigates the challenge of going green, True’s approach — measured, inclusive, and relentlessly forward-looking — offers a model for how sustainability and maritime efficiency can not only coexist but also thrive together.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Towage.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:01:03.673375

When the new specifications went into effect in 2020, LSFO sales surged to account for 63% of total bunker fuel sales in Singapore during that year.
Trends in distillate fuel oil sales Distillate fuel oil sales also increased, although by a much smaller margin, from 8% of total bunker fuel sales in 2019 to 9% in 2020.
After peaking in 2020, distillate bunker fuel sales have generally remained between 6% and 8% of fuel sales.
Total bunker fuel sales have generally increased since 2022, yet sales of LSFO specifically have decreased every year after peaking in 2020.","When the International Maritime Organization’s lower marine sulfur limit known as IMO 2020 took effect in January 2020, commercial shippers pivoted sharply to fueling their vessels with low-sulfur fuel oil (LSFO). In the years since, high-sulfur fuel oil has reclaimed some market share, as a growing number of commercial vessels install sulfur scrubbers that allow operators to use the heavier, cheaper fuel oils while complying with the new sulfur emission limits.

The 2020 sulfur cap limited the sulfur content in marine fuels to 0.50% globally, down from 3.50%, with stricter limits of 0.10% in designated Emission Control Areas. Its goal is to reduce harmful sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions, improving air quality and protecting human health. Ships comply by using low-sulfur fuels, installing scrubbers to clean exhaust gases, or switching to alternative fuels.

Pre-IMO 2020 bunker fuel landscape

Prior to IMO 2020, heavy fuel oil was the dominant bunker fuel. After IMO 2020 went into effect, the fastest way for many vessels to comply was by adopting fuels such as LSFO or blending some distillate fuel oil (such as diesel fuel) into a vessel’s bunker fuel supply.

Early adoption of LSFO in Singapore

Early adoption of LSFO ahead of IMO 2020 lifted the total volume of LSFO sales in Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering port and a bellwether for the global bunker fuel market, from under 1% of total sales in 2018 to almost 11% in 2019. When the new specifications went into effect in 2020, LSFO sales surged to account for 63% of total bunker fuel sales in Singapore during that year.

Trends in distillate fuel oil sales

Distillate fuel oil sales also increased, although by a much smaller margin, from 8% of total bunker fuel sales in 2019 to 9% in 2020. After peaking in 2020, distillate bunker fuel sales have generally remained between 6% and 8% of fuel sales.

LSFO pricing and cost considerations

LSFO incurs higher fuel costs for vessel operators. LSFO is priced at a premium to fuel oils with a higher sulfur content, reflecting the costs of desulfurization during the refining process. In response to these higher fuel costs, many vessel operators began installing sulfur scrubbers on existing and new ships, allowing them to comply with the IMO standard while consuming higher-sulfur grades of fuel oil.

Impact of sulfur scrubber adoption

The gradual adoption of sulfur scrubbers in the global vessel fleet is reflected in the transformation of consumption patterns in Singapore since 2020. Total bunker fuel sales have generally increased since 2022, yet sales of LSFO specifically have decreased every year after peaking in 2020.

Current bunker fuel market dynamics

Although LSFO remains the most popular bunker fuel in Singapore, heavier sulfur grades have reclaimed some of the bunker fuel market, accounting for 36% of total sales this year, as more ships gain the ability to process heavier fuel oil grades.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shutterstock_2494996709-e1762253501872.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:56:26.813219

During a bilateral meeting in Singapore, MOWCA’s Secretary General, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, met with the Chief Executive of the MPA, Ang Wee Keong, where he sought Singapore’s expertise in port infrastructure, digitalisation, and environmentally sustainable shipping practices.

Adalikwu said MOWCA was keen to draw from Singapore’s globally acclaimed port model to replicate similar standards across West and Central African ports.

“We are seeking closer working ties and the expertise of Singaporean authorities in areas such as human capital development, infrastructural upgrade and maintenance, and cargo handling,” he stated.

He further emphasised the importance of digitalisation in achieving efficiency at ports, advocating for a maritime single window system and harmonised documentation processes to ease import and export procedures.

According to him, “There is a need for harmonisation and single document submission for seamless end-to-end processing of import and export procedures in ports.”

On environmental sustainability, Adalikwu reaffirmed MOWCA’s commitment to the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by or around 2050, stressing that the organisation has set advisory timelines for member states to align with the goal.

“MOWCA is planning to reduce emissions by at least 20 per cent before 2030, and a technical collaboration with the Singaporean Maritime and Ports Authority would be helpful in achieving compliance with the IMO target by MOWCA states,” he said.

Adalikwu noted that a modernised port system capable of delivering efficient services is critical to driving the blue economy agenda at both national and sub-regional levels.

In his remarks, Keong commended MOWCA’s initiative and reaffirmed Singapore’s readiness to support the region’s maritime development ambitions.

“We appreciate your visit and express our willingness to collaborate with MOWCA on all requested areas. We are optimistic about the rapid maritime development of partnering MOWCA countries,” Keong stated.

Both sides agreed to reconvene in London later this year for the formal signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that will outline the modalities for technical cooperation between the two organisations.

We quantify the effects of shipping emissions on lightning by examining the difference between the factual (observed) and counterfactual values of the lightning density.
Increases in lightning density due to shipping activity are most evident along the major shipping lane around 5.5°N.
Two cloud properties are analyzed: the height of the mid-to-high cloud top and the radius of the cloud droplet of low water cloud.
However, because small but nonzero shipping emissions are present in the reference lanes, the counterfactual values contain the impacts of both meteorological conditions and shipping emissions on the lightning density.","Atmospheric aerosols have a profound effect on Earth’s radiation budget, influencing both regional and global climate. They interact with solar and terrestrial radiation directly by scattering and absorbing radiation1 and indirectly by perturbing cloud micro- and macro-physical properties, such as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INP)2. Among various aerosol species, sulfate aerosols have the strongest cooling effect on the climate system; however, current estimates of this effect remain highly uncertain3. Human-emitted sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a key source of sulfate aerosols, and its global emissions have significantly decreased over the past several decades due to the implementation of air quality regulations, such as the Clean Air Act in the U.S.4. This reduction in SO2 emissions may contribute to the recent acceleration of global warming5,6,7,8.

Although accounting for only ~10% of global total anthropogenic SO2 emissions9, international shipping emissions play a critical role in the formation and development of marine clouds through aerosol–cloud interactions, largely owing to the low background concentration of sulfate aerosols from natural sources over the open ocean. Ship-emitted SO2 can affect shallow clouds over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and deep clouds in strong convection systems10. The “anomalous cloud lines”, i.e., long strings of bright low-marine clouds around ship exhaust, were first observed in 1965 by satellite and later known as ship tracks11. Since then, numerous studies have investigated the formation mechanism of ship tracks through both observations and numerical simulations. It is found that sulfate aerosols from shipping emissions act as CCN and promote the formation of marine low clouds12,13,14,15. On the other hand, the impacts of ship-emitted sulfate aerosols on deep clouds are reflected by the enhanced lightning frequency over two major shipping lanes in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and South China Sea compared to its surrounding regions [e.g., ref. 16], as shown in Fig. 1. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of the enhanced lightning remain disputed despite extensive research efforts, mainly due to a lack of robust observational evidence of aerosol-induced changes in cloud microphysical properties. Modeling studies hypothesize that shipping aerosols enhance deep convection (i.e., strengthening updraft, increasing convective cloud top height, and causing larger ice particles) and thus storm electrification in the shipping lanes16,17,18,19, but observational studies based on the close relationship between the locations of ship transponder events and lightning strokes suggest that tall ships extending up into a high electric field environment could facilitate lightning discharges and thus enhance lightning activity, namely the direct ship interactions20.

In January 2020, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) imposed a new regulation to reduce sulfur emissions from ships. The new regulation (hereafter IMO 2020) mandates a maximum sulfur mass content of 0.5% (versus 3.5% previously) in marine fuel globally. Consequently, global SO2 emissions from international shipping decreased from 10.4 Tg in 2019 to 3.0 Tg in 2020 (i.e., a 71% reduction)21. This new regulation provides a unique opportunity to study the influences of shipping emissions on cloud formation and lightning intensification in observations. A satellite-based study has already found a reduction of 50% in ship tracks since 2020 compared to the climatological mean over the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans22. The decreasing ship tracks and consequently the reduction in cloudiness have generated a positive radiative effect at top of the atmosphere in the order of 0.1 W m−2 at the global scale5,6,23,24 that could contribute to the record-breaking global temperatures in 2023 and 20247,8.

However, how deep convective clouds respond to the decrease in sulfur emissions from ships due to IMO 2020 remains an open question. A recent study25 demonstrated a decline in warm liquid cloud-base drop number along the shipping lane over the BoB during the period of 2020–2023 compared to 2010–2019, which may be partially responsible for a 40% drop in lightning density. Although lightning is a complicated process and a significant knowledge gap still exists regarding the exact details of its formation mechanism, it is widely accepted that the occurrence of lightning involves two key processes: separation of electric charge and generation of an electric field above some threshold within a thunderstorm26,27. The dominant process of deep convective cloud electrification is the non-inductive charging mechanism where charge separation is achieved through rebounding collisions between larger and denser graupel or hail particles in downdrafts and smaller ice crystals in strong updrafts in the presence of supercooled liquid water28. Since graupel and hail particles develop from ice crystals, the latter play a vital role in lightning occurrence—storms that produce large quantities of ice crystals produce lightning with a high chance29,30. Ice crystals form through heterogeneous or homogeneous ice nucleation processes, depending on temperature and the availability of INP31,32. Both ice nucleation processes require temperatures below freezing and supercooled water, implying that clouds must develop at high altitude. Therefore, examining changes in deep cloud properties, such as cloud top height, sizes of water droplets and ice particles, and ice water path that can influence the formation and abundance of ice crystals and thus graupel and hail, can provide direct and compelling evidence for how changes in shipping emissions influence lightning activity. It is worth mentioning that this study does not aim to investigate the details of charge separation mechanisms; instead, by examining changes in cloud properties that are closely linked to ice crystal formation and abundance, it provides observational evidence that a reduction in ship-emitted SO2 can decrease lightning activities by modulating ice crystal formation processes.

Specifically, by analyzing cloud properties, especially deep cloud microphysics from multiple satellite products and surface lightning observations, we have proposed a physical mechanism that is responsible for the frequent lightning activity along the major shipping lane over the BoB and further attributed the weakened lightning after 2020 to the IMO 2020. The BoB is selected because the lightning density demonstrates a vivid contrast between the enhanced values along a narrow shipping corridor in the east-west direction versus reduced values surrounding the major shipping lane over the BoB (Fig. 1). The meridional contrast in lightning density makes this region ideal for examining the effects of ship-emitted aerosols. The effects of shipping activity on lightning are quantified by examining the differences between the factual (observed) and counterfactual values of cloud micro- and macro-physical properties. The counterfactual values are estimated using the regression kriging method and represent the values the variables would have if the impacts of shipping emissions were largely removed or minimized, i.e., only the impacts of meteorological factors are considered. The random forest regression model was used and trained at the grid cells over the reference lane where the least shipping impact was expected. The well-trained regression model was then applied within the shipping lane to estimate the counterfactual values of a variable assumed to be unaffected by the shipping impact. For details of the regression kriging method, please refer to the Methods section. Our analyses showed that i) shipping emissions are linked to higher mid-to-high cloud tops, smaller radius of low cloud droplets, smaller cloud ice particles (4–20 km), and greater ice water path, which promotes the formation of strong convection and thus lightning; ii) the impacts of shipping emissions on cloud properties have been significantly reduced since the implementation of the IMO 2020; and iii) the IMO2020 weakened the lightning activity over the BoB by at least 11% after 2020 and shipping emissions contributed at least 17% to climatological lightning activity over the BoB. Our results provide multiple observational evidence that ship emissions significantly strengthened lightning activity and were responsible for the weakened lightning over the BoB after 2020, underscoring the important impacts of human activity on cloud properties and natural hazards.

Enhanced lightning resulted from shipping emissions and their reduction after IMO 2020

Enhanced lightning activities over the major shipping lane with reference to its surrounding regions over the BoB are detected in the recent decade. Here, the lightning activity is characterized by lightning density, which is defined as the number of lightning strokes per unit area over a specified period. Annual lightning density is calculated with units of strokes km−2 year−1. Figure 2a–c demonstrates the observed lightning densities for three periods: 2012–2019 (climatology), 2016–2019 immediately before the IMO 2020 regulation (pre-regulation), and 2020–2023 immediately after the regulation (post-regulation). The enhanced lightning density was observed in an east-west-oriented area along the major shipping lanes over the BoB (black box in Fig. 2a) from 2012 to 2019. Along the shipping lanes, a maximum lightning density of ~2 strokes km−2 year−1 was observed in latitudes from 5°N to 6°N. During the pre-regulation period of 2016–2019, although the enhanced lightning densities were obvious along the shipping lane, the magnitudes were close to the climatological level: with an area-average value of 0.86 for 2016–2019 vs. 0.98 strokes km−2 year−1 for the climatology. However, during the post-regulation period of 2020–2023, the lightning densities within the shipping lane area decreased to 0.63 strokes km−2 year−1 (i.e., a 36% decrease from the climatology). The coincidence of reductions in shipping emissions and lightning frequency over BoB after the implementation of IMO 2020 suggests a potential link between the two.

We quantify the effects of shipping emissions on lightning by examining the difference between the factual (observed) and counterfactual values of the lightning density. Figure 2d–f shows that the enhanced lightning density along the major shipping lanes is almost absent in the counterfactual values, implying a significant positive impact of sulfate aerosols emitted from ships on the lightning density. Figure 3a–c shows the differences between the factual vs. counterfactual values of lightning density. Increases in lightning density due to shipping activity are most evident along the major shipping lane around 5.5°N. The area-averaged increases within the shipping lane area are 0.17 (17%), 0.11 (13%), and 0.06 (10%) strokes km−2 year−1 for the climatology, pre-regulation (2016–2019), and post-regulation (2020–2023), respectively. The increase in lightning activity along the shipping lanes over the BoB in the climatology supports the findings of previous studies [e.g., ref. 17]. In the post-regulation period, the number of grid cells with a statistically significant increase (above the 95% confidence level) in lightning density has decreased to 11 (~50%) vs. 25 and 19 for the climatology and pre-regulation periods, respectively.

To assess how different the shipping perturbed lightning activity and cloud properties (i.e., observed minus counterfactual values) are during the post-regulation period 2020–2023 versus prior 4-year periods (2012–2015 and 2016–2019) and their climatological values, we estimated and compared the probability distribution functions (PDF) of the area-averaged shipping perturbation values within the shipping lane using the Bootstrap method, as shown in Fig. 4a. The PDF for the post-regulation period (2020–2023) is statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level from that for the climatology (2012–2019): the 95% confidence intervals of the two PDFs have no overlap. This indicates that the IMO 2020 regulation has significantly weakened the lightning activity in the shipping lane area over the BoB. Note that the PDFs for the periods of 2012–2015, 2016–2019, and 2020–2023 demonstrate a shift toward zero difference, but the first two PDFs before the IMO 2020 regulation overlap with the PDF for the climatological period. The above results demonstrate that the IMO 2020 regulation has resulted in a weakened impact of shipping emissions on the lightning density over the BoB.

Response of cloud top height and droplet size to shipping emissions

The physical mechanism of the enhanced lightning density over the shipping lane area and its weakened magnitude after the IMO 2020 regulation can be understood by examining cloud responses to shipping emissions. Two cloud properties are analyzed: the height of the mid-to-high cloud top and the radius of the cloud droplet of low water cloud. The former is closely linked to the strength of deep convection where lightning occurs, and the latter is highly susceptible to aerosol concentrations since i) cloud droplets generally tend to be smaller in environments with higher aerosol concentrations and constant water vapor supply, and ii) the low cloud is usually the place where aerosols enter the clouds and get activated to form CCN and INP. Here, we argue that although low clouds are generally considered to have little contribution to lightning occurrence, in strong convective regions like the BoB, low clouds such as small cumulus clouds can develop into cumulonimbus clouds33 and thus can be linked to lightning activity.

The observed and counterfactual heights of the mid-to-high cloud top are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. For the climatology and pre-regulation periods, the observed heights illustrate greater values of up to 9.6 km along the major shipping lane around 6°N than those in the reference lane area. However, the contrast of the heights between the shipping and reference lanes becomes weaker for the post-regulation period of 2020–2023. The differences between the observed and counterfactual heights are 50 and 40 m for the climatology and pre-regulation periods, respectively, which are much greater than the post-regulation value of 20 m, as shown in Fig. 3d–f. These differences have the same order of magnitude as the standard deviation (56 m) of the heights between 2012 and 2023, suggesting that the differences are quite large despite their magnitudes being 2–3 orders smaller than the absolute values of the cloud height. Note that the above analysis of CERES mid-to-high cloud top height bears poorly quantified uncertainty since the uncertainty of CERES cloud top height retrievals varies, depending on cloud types and atmospheric conditions34. Moreover, the areas with statistically significant differences are larger in the climatology (14 grid cells) and pre-regulation period (12 grid cells) than in the post-regulation period (3 grid cells). The area-averaged heights within the shipping lane area during the post-regulation period are statistically significantly lower than those during the periods before the IMO 2020 regulation: no overlap between the PDF during the post-regulation vs. the PDFs for other periods, as shown in Fig. 4b. These results indicate that higher mid-to-high cloud top is associated with the enhanced lightning density, and this association has been weakened after the IMO 2020 regulation. The elevated height of the mid-to-high cloud top along the major shipping lane is further verified by the relatively low cloud top temperature and pressure (Supplementary Figs. S2, S3). Further analysis shows that shipping-induced impacts on cloud top temperature and pressure of mid-to-high clouds have been reduced during the post-regulation period (Supplementary Fig. S4). Although CERES retrievals of cloud top properties have considerable uncertainties, the consistent changes in height, temperature, and pressure of the mid-to-high cloud top indicate strong robustness of the above analysis.

The elevated height of the mid-to-high cloud top along the major shipping lane is consistent with previous findings that smaller cloud droplets in polluted regions due to high aerosol concentrations lead to longer cloud lifetime and taller cloud top35,36. Supplementary Fig. S5 shows a mean radius as low as 13.5 μm along the major shipping lane around 6°N during all periods vs. a greater mean radius up to 15 μm within the reference lane area. The radius during the post-regulation period has increased compared with that during the pre-regulation period, which is associated with the emission reduction of sulfur oxides from ships after the IMO 2020 regulation. Figure 3g–i shows that the differences of the radius between the observed and counterfactual values are negative and have greater magnitudes of 0.15 and 0.13 μm for the climatological and pre-regulation periods, respectively, than that for the post-regulation period with a value of 0.08 μm. The area with statistically significant negative differences is also larger during the first two periods (24 and 13 grid cells) than during the post-regulation period (6 grid cells). These results suggest that the impacts of shipping emissions on cloud droplet size have been reduced after 2020. The PDFs of the area-averaged radius within the shipping lane during various periods are shown in Fig. 4c. Although the 95% confidence intervals of all PDFs are far from zero, they overlap with each other due to their large variations. The increase in cloud droplet radius of low cloud during the post-regulation period is consistent with the results of a recent study that demonstrates a decrease in cloud droplet number concentrations at warm cloud-base along the shipping lane over the Indian Ocean25. The larger but fewer cloud droplets could enhance the downdraft yet weaken the updraft, which constrains the cloud top to a relatively low altitude and in turn reduces the production of ice crystals and thus graupels, ultimately lowering the chance of rebounding collisions, charge separation, and lightning occurrence in a thunderstorm37.

Variations in deep cloud properties due to shipping emissions

Since lightning activity is closely associated with deep cloud formation29,30, the vertical profiles of deep cloud ice properties are further analyzed in this section. The above analyses show that both shipping emissions and lightning density demonstrate strong meridional variations from 1° to 11° N, with the peak values at ~5.5°N, so similar meridional variations in deep cloud ice properties are also expected around this latitude. Here, vertical profiles of ice water content and ice particle radius from CALIPSO and CloudSat retrievals, as well as their changes after the IMO 2020 regulation, are examined (Figs. 5 and 6). Elevated ice water content over 20 g m−2 was observed between the altitudes of 8 and 13 km (Fig. 5a). As expected, a peak of ice water path integrated between 3 and 15 km was observed at 5.5°N during the period of 2006–2019. However, such a peak disappeared during the post-regulation period of 2020–2023 (Fig. 5b). The changes in the ice water content and ice water path from 2006–2019 to 2020–2023 were dominated by negative values and showed maximum magnitudes at 5.5°N (Fig. 5c). Note that the decrease in ice water path was statistically significant at the 90% confidence level only at 5.5°N with a value of −500 g m−2 vs. −200 g m−2 at other latitudes, which highlights the impact of shipping emissions on the ice water path.

The higher ice water content along the shipping lane versus in the reference lane is consistent with the meridional variability of the sizes of ice particles. Figure 6. illustrates that the column mean radius is ~13 μm between 4 and 20 km. In the vertical direction, ice particles are larger between 6 and 10 km and generally decrease with altitude above 10 km. In the meridional direction, ice particles are relatively smaller at latitudes from 4.5 to 6.5°N with a minimum radius of 10.5 μm at 5.5°N, which is consistent with the elevated shipping emissions along the shipping lane that tend to result in smaller ice particles. Note that we did not show the difference in ice particle radius before and after the IMO 2020 regulation due to a lack of CloudSat data after August 2020. Our results show that although the ice water path is enhanced along the major shipping lane, the ice particles are smaller than those in the reference lane, implying that the shipping emission-induced increase in ice particle number concentration may have dominated the increase in the ice water path.

Meanwhile, it is worth noting that 1) the meridional ice properties in Figs. 5 and 6 are averaged over the zonal range of 85°E–90°E instead of the full zonal width of the shipping lane because the enhanced lightning densities due to shipping emissions are most obvious in this zonal range (Fig. 1a–c); 2) the 95% confidence intervals of ice water path is larger in the post-regulation period (Fig. 5b) than in the pre-regulation period (Fig. 5a), which is due to a shorter period of observations since 2020 and could reduce the statistical robustness of the changes in ice water path since 2020 (Fig. 5c). We believe that the statistical robustness will be improved when more observations are available; and 3) ice water content retrieved by CALIPSO lidar only represents ice in the very tops of deep convective clouds given the large opacity of such clouds. Thus, Fig. 5 may also indicate another possibility that deep cloud top shifts toward a lower height vs. the changes in the deep cloud microphysics analyzed above. Anyway, both possibilities suggest reduced convection activities and thus less lightning activities due to the reduction in shipping emissions.

Potential impacts of direct ship interactions and meteorological conditions on lightning frequency

The above analyses support the previous hypothesis that the ship-emitted SO2 can modify the lightning activity over the BoB through the aerosol–cloud interactions, but they do not rule out the potential importance of the direct ship interactions in the lightning enhancement. Ships emit both SO2 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), but no new regulation on NO2 emissions from ships has been implemented since 2020. Therefore, shipping activities after 2020 can be approximated by the column density of NO2 remotely sensed from space, as shown in Fig. 7a. Enhanced NO2 density is observed along the major shipping lane over the BoB compared to the surrounding oceanic regions, indicating that NO2 density can be safely used to represent shipping activities. Note that the enhanced NO2 density could also be partially attributed to the enhanced lightning, given that lightning can produce nitric oxide (NO) that can be further oxidized into NO238,39. While NO2 density showed positive changes over the South China Sea from 2019 to the post-regulation period (2020–2023), no spatially homogeneous changes were observed over the BoB. Therefore, we argue that i) the enhanced NO2 is dominated by direct shipping emissions rather than enhanced lightning-produced NO2; and more importantly, ii) the direct ship interactions alone can hardly explain the lightning enhancement; and in addition, iii) the 36% reduction in the lightning density during the post-regulation period can be attributed to both the IMO 2020 regulation and changes in the meteorological conditions because shipping activities showed little changes after 2020.

The contribution of the changes in meteorological conditions to the reduced lightning density after 2020 within the shipping lane area can be estimated using the counterfactual values in Fig. 2d, f as −0.24 (0.57 minus 0.81) strokes km−2 year−1 (−24%). Then the contribution of the shipping emissions is −0.11 (−0.35 in total variations minus –0.24) strokes km−2 year−1 (−11%). Ideally, the counterfactual values should represent the impacts of meteorological conditions alone. However, because small but nonzero shipping emissions are present in the reference lanes, the counterfactual values contain the impacts of both meteorological conditions and shipping emissions on the lightning density. Therefore, the estimated impact of the meteorological conditions here represents its upper bound value, yet the estimated impact of the shipping emissions represents its lower bound value.

The Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) demonstrates that SO2 emissions from international shipping over the shipping lane in the BoB decreased by 66% from the period of 2012–2019 to 2020–2022. By assuming a linear relationship between SO2 emissions and lightning density, a zero SO2 emission from shipping would result in a reduction of at least 17% (11%/66%) in lightning density.

In this study, we use data from a global lightning location network and satellite-retrieved cloud products to investigate the physical mechanisms behind frequent lightning activity along the major shipping lane over the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Additionally, we examine the reduction in lightning density and changes in cloud properties resulting from the IMO 2020 regulation. Our findings show that the enhanced lightning density along the shipping lane, centered at ~5.5°N, compared to surrounding regions, is closely linked to changes in cloud properties, including higher tops of mid-to-high clouds, smaller cloud droplets in low clouds, greater ice water paths between 3 and 15 km, and smaller ice particles between 4 and 20 km. These changes in cloud properties are attributed to sulfate aerosols from shipping emissions. Further analysis reveals that the contrasts in all these cloud properties except ice particle radius between the shipping lane vs. surrounding regions have significantly decreased after the implementation of stricter sulfur emissions regulations by the IMO in 2020. Given that satellite data shows no significant change in shipping activity, we conclude that the reduction in shipping emissions is the main driver of the 11% decline in lightning activity since 2020. The interactions between ship-derived sulfate aerosols and clouds likely play a more important role than direct shipping interactions in this reduction in lightning occurrence. Our results provide robust observational evidence of the impact of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols on deep convection by modulating both micro- and macro-properties of clouds. More specifically, reduced sulfate aerosols can result in less but larger cloud droplets, which could cause stronger downdraft and thus weaken the updraft in a thunderstorm, consistent with the observed lower cloud top. A lower cloud top could constrain the supercooled water at a relatively warm temperature, which in combination with less INP due to reduced sulfate aerosols can reduce the production of ice crystals through the heterogeneous ice nucleation process, as indicated by observed less ice water path. A less ice water path implies less latent heat released within the thunderstorm which can inhibit further development of the thunderstorm into a higher altitude, forming a positive feedback loop. The above discussed changes in shallow and deep cloud properties initialized by the ship-induced reduction in sulfate aerosols could ultimately reduce the rebounding collisions between graupels and ice crystals, charge separation, and lightning activities.

Three key caveats should be considered in this study. First, the assumed linear relationship between the reductions in sulfur emissions due to the shipping regulations and changes in lightning density may introduce uncertainties, particularly when estimating the relative importance of aerosol–cloud interactions versus direct shipping interactions on lightning enhancement over the BoB. Future studies should address this uncertainty by using numerical models that well capture the non-linearity in aerosol–cloud interactions24,40. This uncertainty may also be addressed based on future observations if the IMO implements even stricter sulfur content regulations (e.g., reducing sulfur from 0.5% to 0.1%). The second caveat concerns the counterfactual values derived using the kriging method. While these values help isolate the impacts of shipping emissions, they may still underestimate their full effects on clouds and lightning. Quantifying the extent to which this underestimation could bias the attribution of the lightning changes to the shipping emission regulation is challenging based on observations but could be well addressed through model simulations in future research. The third caveat relates to the seasonality of lightning activities and its decline since 2020. Preliminary analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6) shows more frequent lightning and greater declines during convectively active seasons (boreal winter and spring) compared to other seasons. This study focuses on annual rather than seasonal changes due to the limited data (only four years since 2020), which makes robust statistical analysis of seasonal changes challenging. As the first attempt to demonstrate the statistical robustness of the lightning density changes during the climatology and post-regulation periods, we calculated standard errors of the monthly means based on the interannual variability. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, no overlap was seen between the monthly mean lightning densities ± one standard error during the two periods in all months except for July, August, and March, indicating the monthly changes are robust based on the applied statistical method. The annual means of lightning densities are 0.98 ± 0.06 vs. 0.63 ± 0.03 (one standard error) strokes km−2 yr−1 for the climatology and post-regulation periods, respectively. The two numbers are far part by more than 3 standard errors, indicating the decrease in annual lightning density is very robust. As more data becomes available, more sophisticated and powerful statistical methods can be used to estimate the confidence intervals of the changes in the lightning activities.

Previous studies have highlighted that the enhanced lightning activity along the shipping lane, compared to surrounding regions, is most evident over the BoB and South China Sea17,20. However, a question remains: Why is lightning enhancement not observed over other busy shipping lanes, such as the Gulf of Mexico, which are far from continental influence and possess convective environment? One possible reason is that ship-derived sulfate aerosols may not lead to a significant increase in ice cloud particles along these shipping lanes, possibly due to differences in atmospheric dynamics or thermodynamical conditions. Future research contrasting environments over shipping lanes with versus without lightning enhancement could provide insights into aerosol activation conditions in deep convective storms, where observing cloud properties remains challenging from both satellites and aircraft.

Although this study focuses on a regional domain, its findings have significant implications for the global climate. As more countries implement stricter air pollution standards to improve air quality, sulfate aerosols and other hygroscopic aerosol species–key CCN and INP–are showing decreasing trends across continents, particularly in North America, Europe, and East Asia4,41. The decline in these aerosol concentrations may reduce lightning activities on a global scale, potentially leading to fewer lightning-ignited wildfires42,43,44 and a decrease in lightning-produced nitrogen oxides39,45, which could disrupt Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. Moreover, a better understanding of meteorological conditions for aerosol activation could reduce uncertainties in the estimates of global aerosol forcing and climate sensitivity, ultimately improving the accuracy of future climate projections.

WWLLN

(The World Wide Lightning Location Network) observes global lightning strokes from 2004 to the present46. WWLLN operates over 70 sensors around the world, each of which monitors very low-frequency radiation and detects lightning strokes47. Each lightning stroke is recorded with latitude, longitude, and time stamp when at least five sensors detect the stroke. The location and time accuracy are 3.4 km and 1 microsecond, respectively48. In this study, the raw data are re-gridded into a regular latitude-longitude grid map of 1° × 1°. The annual lightning density is calculated by aggregating the counts of lightning strokes within each grid cell over a year and then dividing the total number of lightning strokes by the area of each grid cell, resulting in a unit of strokes km−2 year−1. Here, only data from 2012 to 2023 are used because the number of sensors has continued to increase before 201249, which could introduce uncertainty in our analysis and thus be neglected.

CEDS

(The Community Emissions Data System) estimates anthropogenic emissions by country, sector, and fuel9,50. The emissions are estimated based on 1) energy production and consumption data compiled by the International Energy Agency, 2) population data from the United Nations and World Bank, and 3) emission factors for combustion and non-combustion emissions. The data have an annual temporal resolution and two spatial resolutions at 0.5° × 0.5° and 0.1° × 0.1°, covering a period from 1750 to 2022. The data are interpolated to 1° resolution to keep consistency with other datasets. Here, SO2 emissions from the sector of international shipping (1A3di-International-shipping) are used to find the shipping lanes over the Bay of Bengal. The data are available at https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS.

CERES

(The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) instrument onboard the Terra satellite measures the Earth’s energy budget and cloud properties51. Cloud properties are extracted from the level 3 gridded 1° × 1° monthly averages of the Single Scanner Footprint product (SSF1deg)52. These properties include cloud top height for mid-to-high clouds and water particle radius at 3.7 μm for low clouds. The low and mid-to-high clouds are defined as clouds between surface and 700 hPa (~3 km) and between 500 hPa (~5 km) and 300 hPa (~9 km), respectively. The monthly data from January 2012 to December 2023 are used.

CALIOP

(The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) instrument onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite is used to obtain the vertical profiles of ice cloud microphysical properties53,54. The properties of the ice cloud are derived from the extinction profiles of the clouds at 532 nm. Here, the level 2 cloud profile product (CAL_LID_L2_05kmCPro-Standard-V4-51) of ice water content was analyzed. The cloud profiles have 399 layers that extend from the surface to an altitude of 29.8 km, with vertical resolutions of 60 and 180 m below and above 20.2 km, respectively, and a horizontal resolution of 5 km. In total, there are 488,349 profiles selected within a rectangular area of 1–11 °N and 80–98 °E from June 2006 to June 2023. The spatial distribution of these profiles is shown in Supplementary Fig. S7.

2C-ICE

(The CloudSat and CALIPSO Ice Cloud Property Product) provides profiles of effective radius and other properties of ice clouds. The 2C-ICE product was produced by combing the measured radar reflectivity factor by CloudSat and measured attenuated backscattering coefficients at 532 nm by CALIOP to reduce the biases of ice cloud retrieval55,56. The profiles have 125 layers that extend from the surface to 24.9 km, with a vertical and horizontal resolutions of 240 m and 1.1 km, respectively. There is a total of 1,184,075 profiles within the area of 1–11 °N and 80–98 °E from June 2006 to December 2019. Note that following the re-gridding method used in the WWLLN dataset, both the profiles of CALIOP and 2C-ICE are re-gridded into a regular latitude-longitude grid map of 1° × 1° to keep consistency with CERES data resolution.

ERA5

(The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5) is the atmospheric reanalysis of global climate57. It has a spatial resolution of 31 km, covering a period from January 1940 to present. Here, monthly horizontal wind fields at 850 hPa from 1940 to 2023 are averaged to achieve the climatology.

TROPOMI

(The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) onboard the European Space Agency Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite monitors trace gases and aerosols for air quality and climate research58. It is a low Earth orbit polar satellite with a swath width of 2600 km, which makes it have a daily near-global coverage. Based on radiance measured in the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared-shortwave infrared spectrum, TROPOMI retrieves aerosol properties and atmospheric densities of trace gases including NO2, SO2, O3, CO, CH4, and CH2O with a spatial resolution of 5.5 km × 3.5 km. Here, NO2 and SO2 data of version 2 from 2019 to 2023 are used. NO2 and SO2 retrievals are based on the radiance in the visible (400–496 nm) and ultraviolet–visible channels, respectively59,60,61,62. Not that the retrieval accuracy of SO2 concentration in the troposphere from space is intrinsically limited by the Rayleigh and Mie scattering and ozone absorption of ultraviolet radiation, which hampers the penetration of ultraviolet radiation to the lowest atmospheric layer59. Consequently, SO2 concentration does not show a clear footprint along major shipping lanes, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S8.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41612-025-01256-w/MediaObjects/41612_2025_1256_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-11-04 02:56:23.453290

COP30 updates

The 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) takes place from November 10 to 21 in Belém, Brazil.

Senators John Curtis (R-UT) and Chris Coons (D-DE) reportedly will co-lead a US congressional delegation to COP30, the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place next month in Belém, Brazil. At least three other Senate Republicans have expressed interest in joining the delegation. It remains uncertain whether the US government will send a formal delegation, and the government shutdown could create additional complications. A number of media outlets are observing that even a small or nonexistent US presence could shape COP30 negotiations.

Following weeks of speculation, Sir Keir Starmer, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has announced he will attend COP30. A spokesperson for Starmer stated that his attendance reaffirms his commitment to the UK’s climate targets and called the energy transition “the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands.” In addition, Starmer will join William, Prince of Wales, in Rio de Janeiro at the ceremony announcing the 2025 Earthshot Prize, a global environmental award founded by the Prince.

The European Union (EU) will send a smaller delegation than usual to COP30 due to accommodation and logistical difficulties in Belém as well as uncertainty over US attendance. Some EU countries are still weighing whether their leaders will attend.

That delegation will include the delegation from the European Parliament, led by Chair Lídia Pereira and Vice-Chair Mohammed Chahim, which has adopted a resolution urging that countries provide “adequate climate finance,” address debt crises for climate-vulnerable countries, and simplify climate finance procedures. The delegation is also calling for the EU to accelerate its phaseout of fossil-fuel subsidies and align with the Paris Accord’s 1.5°C target.

Ahead of COP30, the European Council has issued a press release outlining its intended focus at the conference on climate finance, nature-based solutions, and industrial transition, emphasizing that corporate sectors must align with the forthcoming regulatory direction and calling for transparent disclosure and 1.5°C-consistent pathways.

In addition, the European Commission and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, have released the “EU global climate and energy vision: securing Europe's competitive role in world markets and accelerating the clean transition,” the bloc’s updated climate strategy for 2025 to 2029. The business-oriented strategy, issued on October 16, seeks to unite the EU’s internal and external diplomatic agendas, strengthening the Green New Deal and the bloc’s domestic security through global climate action and explicitly linking support for the energy transition to a rules-based international order.

But EU environment ministers have again postponed decisions on the EU’s 2035 and 2040 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) – the climate action goals that are the building blocks of the Paris Agreement – despite a Commission proposal for a 90-percent emissions cut by 2040 with limited use of international carbon credits. Member states remain split: Denmark and others want both targets adopted together to strengthen the EU’s COP30 stance, while France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia resist a high 2040 goal and seek more flexibility for industry. An extraordinary Environment Council is set for November 4 to continue this work. Key debates will include the role of carbon credits, interaction with the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), and CO2 storage outside the EU.

An open letter from the World Economic Forum’s Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders warns that “current global policies are setting the world on a 3°C trajectory” which “will disrupt food security, damage the financial resilience of businesses and governments, and endanger livelihoods, communities, healthcare systems and ecosystems.” Stating that “a wait-and-see approach is not viable,” the letter urges policymakers and businesses to work together to accelerate the transition to net zero. The Alliance represents $4 trillion in revenues and 12 million employees in 130+ companies; between 2019 and 2023, its members reduced their aggregate emissions by 12 percent while delivering revenue growth of 20 percent. Read the letter.

No sector on track to meet global climate goals, State of Climate Action 2025 finds. A new State of Climate Action 2025 assessment from the World Resources Institute published ahead of COP30 finds the world is off course on every one of 45 climate indicators needed to keep global warming to 1.5°C. Most metrics are improving, the assessment states, but “far too slowly.” To keep 1.5°C in reach, the report calls for a dramatic intensification of efforts in this decade – for instance, accelerating the phaseout of coal to ten times its current pace, reducing deforestation nine times faster, expanding rapid transit five times faster, and increasing climate finance by nearly $1 trillion annually. The assessment states that some signs of momentum – clean energy investment outpacing investment in fossil fuel projects and rapid gains in technologies like green hydrogen – show that progress is possible, but, without immediate, sustained acceleration across all sectors, the climate action gap will likely continue to widen.

Disclosures and voluntary reporting

California: CARB postpones rulemaking for SBs 253 and 261, but not the reporting deadlines. The California Air Resources Board (CARB announced on October 14 that it will postpone its initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for California’s landmark climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, to Q1 2026. Of note: the delay does not change the initial reporting deadlines required under both measures. Disclosures under SB 261, Climate-Related Financial Risk, are still due on January 1, 2026. Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting under SB 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, still must draw on FY 2025 data. CARB stated that the delays in issuing the rulemaking arise from the “large volume of public comments” it received during its August workshop for stakeholders and that is also working to refine the Preliminary List of Reporting/Covered Entities released in September, which set out specific companies that may be subject to SB 261 and SB 253. Also on October 14, CARB released a more simplified draft reporting template for Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting under SB 253. For the first reporting cycle, use of the template will be voluntary.

EU: Omnibus I in the news. The EU continues to work through Omnibus I, the set of proposed simplification measures that will streamline key reporting and compliance requirements of the bloc’s Green Deal: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), EU Green Taxonomy, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Here are the latest developments:

On September 29, the European Council formally adopted simplifying changes to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that had been overwhelmingly approved by the European Parliament on September 10. As we reported last month, chief among the amendments is a new de minimis threshold under which imports of up to 50 metric tons per importer per year will not be subject to CBAM rules. This change effectively exempts 90 percent of importers from CBAM’s rules. Notably, the overarching climate ambition behind the mechanism remains unchanged: 99 percent of total CO2 emissions from imports of iron, steel, aluminum, cement, and fertilizers will still be covered by the CBAM.

Last month, we reported that the European Commission was considering another 12-month postponement of the due diligence obligations in the EUDR. On October 21, the Commission released its proposed amendments to the EUDR which, notably, preserve the current due date, December 30, 2025, for large and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission is also proposing to allow such enterprises a six-month grace period. The proposed amendments include several other key changes. Upstream entities – those introducing a commodity into the bloc’s market – would still need to provide due diligence reports, but downstream entities – which leverage commodities already on the EU market – would not. To further lighten overall reporting requirements, micro and small primary operators from low-risk countries – which, the Commission stated, include most of the bloc’s foresters and farmers – would each need to submit just one simple declaration in the EUDR Information System. And micro and small operators would have until December 30, 2026 to comply, rather than the current due date of June 30, 2026. Next, before the amendments can be formally adopted, the European Parliament and Council must consider them. The Commission called for the amendments to be adopted by December 30, 2025.

On October 22, the European Parliament rejected proposed amendments to due diligence and sustainability disclosure rules in the CSRD, CSDDD, and the EU Green Taxonomy. The rejected proposal was a compromise measure submitted to Parliament on October 13 by the EU’s Legal Affairs Committee (also called the JURI Committee) that would deeply slash the number of in-scope companies required to report. JURI’s proposal was defeated narrowly, 318 to 309, with 34 abstentions. Next, the Omnibus I initiative goes back to Parliament for renewed negotiations; a parliamentary vote on any new proposals is slated for November 13. Negotiations among the Commission, Parliament, and Council can only take place after Parliament finalizes its position.

Going forward, in Q4 we may expect additional omnibus initiatives, not least a planned Environmental Omnibus which would affect the Waste Framework Directive, Net Zero Industry Act, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) rules.

US, Qatar express “deep concern” to EU leaders about CSDDD. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Qatari Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi have sent a joint letter to the leaders of EU member states to express their “deep concern” about the impact of the CSDDD – in particular, “its unintended consequences for LNG [liquified natural gas] export competitiveness and the availability of reliable, affordable energy for EU consumers.” In the undated letter, Wright and Al-Kaabi state, “We have consistently and transparently communicated how the CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy.” None of the proposed revisions to the CSDDD currently under consideration, they continue, has properly addressed their concerns. Wright and Al-Kaabi’s letter concludes with a call for EU leaders to “take immediate decisive action by reopening substantive dialogue with your global partners, including the United States and Qatar and the wider international business community.”

PwC Global Sustainability Reporting Survey: Pressure is rising to report on sustainability, but reporting brings value, too. A study from multinational accounting firm PwC concludes that, despite political uncertainties around climate-related due diligence, sustainability is increasingly important to a company’s performance. The inaugural Global Sustainability Reporting Survey asked 496 companies about their approach to reporting under such regimes as the CSRD or the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). First, PwC found, despite likely postponements coming in the EU under the Omnibus I simplification initiative, 40 percent of respondents said they plan to hold to the original CSRD reporting schedule, even if the EU alters its compliance requirements. More largely, many reported to PwC that pressure from investors, governments, and the marketplace is prompting them to accelerate their disclosures of sustainability risks and opportunities. Furthermore, about 70 percent of respondents said that sustainability reporting brings their company moderate to significant benefits that extend beyond compliance, helping inform their strategic moves in such areas as risk management, the supply chain, and investments. The study concludes, “Changes of direction this year by regulators have, without a doubt, slowed the momentum towards statutory sustainability reporting. But the overall trend to increase reporting remains unchanged.” Read PwC’s Global Sustainability Reporting Survey here.

Greenwashing

District court approves Rust-Oleum greenwashing settlement. The US District Court for the Northern District of California finally approved a $1.5 million settlement to a class of Rust-Oleum consumers who charged that the company’s ""non-toxic"" and ""Earth Friendly"" claims for its Krud Kutter cleaning products over an approximately 10-year period were false and misleading. The court’s order, issued on October 2, requires Rust-Oleum to remove “non-toxic” claims from its products’ labels and “add an asterisk to the 'Earth Friendly' representation on the products' front labels to direct consumers to the back label where it will state: 'Contains no inorganic phosphates, hazardous solvents, or environmentally harmful surfactants,' or similar qualifying language.” In addition to the payment to the class, the court also awarded class counsel $500,000 in fees and over $280,000 in costs. The case, brought in 2020, alleged that Rust-Oleum’s stain remover and degreaser products included potentially harmful chemicals like alcohol ethoxylates and sodium metasilicate and asserted violations of California consumer protection statutes, such as false advertising statutes, as well as the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The parties reached the settlement after the court denied Rust-Oleum’s motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. With the settlement, Rust-Oleum does not admit liability or wrongdoing.

Company charges that a competitor is greenwashing a product line. Moldex-Metric, a manufacturer of respiratory and hearing protection products, has sued competitor Protective Industrial Products, charging that Protective’s claims about the environmental benefits of its BioSoft earplugs are “a calculated ‘greenwashing’ scheme to capture market share” via “unqualified environmental benefit claims.” In its complaint, Moldex lists a number of Protective’s marketing statements about the products, among them that they are eco-friendly, “decompose 76% in 180 days,” and are the world’s first sustainable bio-based ear plug. Moldex next stated that, in seeking to confirm Protective’s claims, its numerous requests – first, that Protective substantiate its marketing and, subsequently, that it correct its inaccurate statements – changed nothing. Protective, the complaint states, “has failed to timely remove or correct its false and misleading environmental claims, instead choosing to continue deliberately deceiving consumers.” Moldex is calling on the court to rule that Protective has competed unfairly under the Lanham Act and the California Business and Professions Code, to enjoin Protective from any further act of unfair competition, and to require the company to issue corrective advertising. The suit, still in its earliest stages, was brought in the District Court for the Central District of California.

France: historic ruling in TotalEnergies écoblanchiment case. On October 23, in a highly anticipated ruling, the Tribunal Judiciaire de Paris found that TotalEnergies SE and TotalEnergies Électricité et Gaz France misled consumers in a 2021 ad campaign claiming TotalEnergies could become carbon neutral by 2050. Specifically, TotalEnergies claimed that it put “climate at the heart of its strategy, with the aim of providing cleaner, safer and more affordable energy to as many people as possible” and that it had set the ambition to achieve “net zero” by 2050. The tribunal ordered the company to remove claims on the TotalEnergies SE website stating that sustainable development is at the heart of its business strategy and that, in line with United Nations development goals, it contributes to the well-being of populations. Écoblanchiment – greenwashing – is not explicitly addressed in French law, so charges were brought under French laws governing “pratiques commerciales trompeuses” – misleading social practices. This is the first time these French laws have been brought against a fossil fuel company, and the first time that any court in the world has held a fossil fuel company responsible for greenwashing. Notwithstanding this landmark ruling, the tribunal notably dismissed most of the claims that had been brought against TotalEnergies, including those related to its advertising campaign around its name change and generally promoting natural gas and biofuels as not sufficiently connected to the sale of products to consumers and thus outside the scope of consumer law. The company has a month from the date of the ruling to remove the implicated statements and post the tribunal’s ruling on the TotalEnergies SE website; it remains to be seen whether the ruling has a knock-on effect on other fossil fuel marketing campaigns across Europe. In September 2024, South Africa’s Advertising Regulatory Board ruled that a TotalEnergies social media campaign, #FuelYourExperience, was misleading, marking that country’s first decision on corporate greenwashing.

German court orders shoe retailer to withdraw sustainability claims. A German regional court has ruled that Germany-based Deichmann, the leading European footwear retailer, is guilty of making false advertising claims about the sustainability of some of its products. This case was brought by Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), an environmental and consumer protection organization, which charged that the retailer had advertised hundreds of its shoes as sustainable, using the slogan “Sustainability: Yes,” without providing any verifiable evidence to substantiate that claim. During the trial, Deichmann compared the shoes in question to similar products from competitors to demonstrate that the advertised shoes offered no environmental benefits. In a binding ruling issued on October 7, the Landgericht (regional court) of Bochum agreed with DUH, ordering the company to withdraw its sustainability claims and “cease its misleading advertising.”

Manx FCA issues guidance on greenwashing. The Isle of Man’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued guidance notes on greenwashing and consumer protection to help regulated entities understand and manage the implications of their sustainability-based claims. The guidance affirms that the FCA’s existing authority and current Isle of Man law “apply equally to greenwashing as to other forms of misleading or false advertising.” It sets out, then explains, five principles to help avoid making greenwashing claims, among them that claims should be correct and capable of being substantiated and entity-level claims should align with corporate strategy. The guidance is directed at entities registered under the Financial Services Act 2008, Insurance Act 2008, Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000, and Collective Investment Schemes Act 2008. While the guidance does not have the force of law, the FCA states, “it is persuasive.” The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency known for its business-friendly milieu.

Singapore rolls out Guide on Quality-Related Claims. Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry’s Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCS) has issued the Guide on Quality-Related Claims, created, CCS states, to help businesses make clear and accurate product claims and avoid engaging in unfair trade practices. The guide sets out five key principles for companies regarding product claims under the country’s Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003. CCS developed the guide in response to concerns raised by companies about potential greenwashing following a number of recent CCS enforcement actions. See the CCS infographic about the guide here, and download the guide here.

Sustainability: Regulatory

EPA reverses course on coke emissions standards. In a reversal on October 3, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin signed a final rule that reinstates the original compliance deadline for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens. Coke is a key component in steelmaking. The tighter standards governing emissions from coke plants were originally slated to go into effect in July 2025, but, that month, the agency extended their compliance deadline by two years, stating that the industry could not feasibly implement them. The final rule signed by Zeldin on October 3 reinstates the original effective date. The rule establishes stricter emissions limits for emissions of such substances as mercury and requires plants that manufacture coke to install fenceline monitoring systems for releases of benzene. Also in July, the EPA extended the compliance deadline for a separate rule, Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, by two years. At this writing, it is unclear whether that postponement too will be reversed.

Deadline approaches for comments on proposed changes to Chemical Risk Evaluation Process under the TSCA. November 7 is the deadline to submit comments to the EPA on a proposed rule that would change the way the agency evaluates the risks of chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The EPA states that the proposed rule, pursuant to Executive Order 14219, “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department Of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative,” and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative, would streamline such evaluations while increasing transparency and providing a more predictable regulatory process for chemical manufacturers. The current procedural framework for evaluating the risk of chemicals is set out in a 2017 rule that was revised in 2024 to require a single, comprehensive risk determination for each chemical across all conditions of use (COUs). The proposed rule would revert to separate evaluations for each COU. Among other key changes in the proposed rule: the EPA would be allowed to take into account occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment, in risk determinations and chemical risk evaluations; would use the definition of “weight of scientific evidence” set out in Executive Order 14303, “Restoring Gold Standard Science”; would eliminate “overburdened communities” from the list of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” that must be considered in evaluations; and would require less information from manufacturers submitting requests for risk evaluations. See the proposed rule here.

CalRecycle: Updates on progress of EPR law. California’s Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act Advisory Board met on October 17 to discuss the implementation of SB 54, California’s EPR legislation. At the meeting, the California Department of Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) stated that it is currently focusing on rulemaking efforts, reviewing public comments, and preparing its responses. Additionally, CalRecycle stated that interim technical reports on collection, processing, and end markets; source reduction and material design; and consumer education and access will be released soon. The Circular Action Alliance (CAA) also provided an update at the meeting, reporting that it is working with several agencies to develop plans for stakeholder engagement in the EPR program. CAA urged producers to submit their 2023 data by November 15, 2025 to enable more accurate 2027 fee rate ranges and source reduction planning. Additionally, CAA noted that de minimis clarity for certain types of plastic is still pending.

CAA discusses RecycleOn Colorado EPR strategy. In an October 9 webinar, CAA laid out its “RecycleOn Colorado” education and outreach strategy under the state’s EPR law, HB 22-1355, the Producer Responsibility Program for Statewide Recycling Act. Speakers from CAA and the agencies working on the marketing campaign explained that, starting in spring 2026, RecycleOn Colorado will work to expand public awareness of the EPR program through a broad outreach program that helps residents understand and take part in the new recycling system. Among the marketing campaign’s overall goals are increasing Colorado’s recycling rate to 47 to 60 percent by 2035 and expanding curbside recycling to 500,000 new households, particularly focusing on rural areas in which recycling programs currently may not exist and residents may be skeptical. July 31 was the initial reporting deadline for covered entities under HB 22-1355, which in January 2026 will begin paying responsibility fees that will be used to establish free recycling programs for Colorado residents. The longer-term plan is to bring small businesses into the recycling program by 2030. For more information, see our latest state EPR law roundup.

Quebec’s Bill 29, addressing planned obsolescence in consumer goods, is now in effect. Quebec’s new durable goods law, the Act to protect consumers from planned obsolescence and to promote the durability, repairability and maintenance of goods (Bill 29), became effective on October 5. Bill 29 introduces a right to durability, requiring manufacturers to provide a legal warranty of good working order for certain new goods, such as refrigerators, stoves, laptops, and cell phones. It also enhances the right to repairability, requiring manufacturers and merchants to warranty the availability of replacement parts and repair services for goods requiring maintenance and specifying that they must provide information about maintaining and repairing such goods. Further, the installation of replacement parts must be possible using “commonly available tools.” Find out more about Bill 29 in our alert.

IMO postpones vote on net zero framework and global pricing mechanism for ships’ carbon emissions. Global members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed on October 17 to table for one year their vote on draft regulations amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships’ Annex VI. The amendments – designed over years with input from all major countries – would have put in place a legally binding timetable to reduce maritime shipping emissions: a 20- to 30-percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, a 70-percent reduction by 2040, and net zero “by or around” 2050. Vessels not in compliance would be required to pay fees with gradually increasing carbon-intensity targets. This framework has been broadly supported by the shipping industry because it sets out global standards that are consistent and clear.

At an IMO meeting in April, a majority of the world’s countries endorsed the amendments. The next step was for IMO members to vote on adopting the amendments during this month’s extraordinary session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London. However, in August, the US formally rejected the agreement. On October 16, it reiterated its warnings to IMO member nations that, if the net zero framework were voted in, the US would consider remedies. Ultimately, on October 17, Singapore’s motion to table the vote on the measure, put forward by Saudi Arabia and supported by Russia and the US, passed narrowly, pushing a vote on adoption to October 2026. Given the delay, the IMO is now reportedly working to revise the timelines set out in the agreement, which would have gone into effect in 2028. The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Sustainability: Litigation

Several lawsuits filed over rescission of Solar for All grants. A coalition of 22 US states and the District of Columbia have filed suit in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington charging that the EPA and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin illegally revoked $7 billion in clean energy funds that had been awarded to local governments. The suit, brought on October 16, concerns the Solar for All program, created to bring low-cost distributed solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. Funding was appropriated by Congress for the program in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

This is just one of several cases filed this month over the Solar for All termination. On October 15, a coalition of 24 Solar for All grant recipients, led by the Maryland Clean Energy Center, state of Arizona, and California Public Utilities Commission, brought a breach of contract action in the US Court of Federal Claims over the EPA’s decision to unilaterally terminate competitive grants they had been awarded under Solar for All. On October 13, Harris County, Texas filed its own suit against the EPA, Zeldin, and EPA Award Official Devon Brown in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, charging that no act of Congress authorized the decision to cancel Solar for All and that the cancellation violates the Constitution. Finally, a separate lawsuit filed on October 6 in the US District Court for the District of Rhode Island alleges that the termination of Solar for All was unconstitutional and caused the plaintiffs harm. That suit differs from the others in that its plaintiffs are “intended beneficiaries” of Solar for All – a group of nonprofits, solar installation companies, a trade union, and a homeowner. They argue that the Executive Branch did not have the statutory authority to rescind Solar for All’s funding because, although Congress repealed large swathes of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the summer, it has not repealed the Solar for All program retroactively.

All these cases are in the earliest stages.

Iowa counties petition Supreme Court over proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. On October 3, the Iowa counties of Story and Shelby petitioned the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn a ruling by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked them from enforcing local setback ordinances against carbon sequestration pipelines. This is the latest development in the ongoing saga of Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed $9 billion Midwest Express carbon capture pipeline, which would collect captured CO2 from ethanol plants across the Midwest and sequester it in underground rock formations in North Dakota. Earlier this year, in a setback for the company, South Dakota banned the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, effectively blocking that portion of the planned route. In June, the Eighth Circuit agreed with Summit’s contention that the counties’ regulations requiring “hazardous liquid pipelines” to meet setback rules around schools, churches, and other buildings are preempted by the federal Pipeline Safety Act. The company’s struggle to obtain permits for its multistate project is continuing across other fronts. Also this month, it argued in Iowa’s Polk County District Court that, before a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club against the permit itself moves forward, the company’s proposed changes to its Iowa Utilities Commission permit allowing the Iowa portion of the pipeline should be decided on. Should the pipeline be built, it would become one of the world's largest carbon capture projects, moving up to 12 million metric tons of CO2 a year to storage. The company said last year that it had already obtained voluntary easement agreements from 75 percent of the Iowa landowners along the route. A response to the counties’ petition will be announced by the Supreme Court November 6.

Montana district court dismisses youth-led climate lawsuit. On October 15, the US District Court for the District of Montana dismissed Lighthiser v. Trump, a youth-led lawsuit charging that three of the President’s energy-related Executive Orders (EOs) will accelerate climate change, causing “irreversible harm” to the plaintiffs and violating their constitutional rights to life and liberty. They asked the court to invalidate the EOs and order the President, as well as 11 federal agencies also named as defendants, not to enforce or implement them. The court found that, while the activists had shown they would be harmed by these policies, their injuries could not be redressed by the court: “This court would be required to monitor an untold number of federal agency actions to determine whether they contravene its injunction. This is, quite simply, an unworkable request for which plaintiffs provide no precedent.” The ruling continued, “With this understanding in mind, the Court reluctantly concludes...that it cannot grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek.” Following the ruling, the lead lawyer for the 22 plaintiffs announced their intent to appeal. See our earlier coverage of this litigation here and here.

Supply chain integrity

Rare earths update. On October 9, in the latest move in the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced tighter restrictions on exports of products containing five more rare earths – bismuth, indium, molybdenum, tungsten, and tellurium. Rare earths, among them lithium, copper, and cobalt, are essential to modern technologies ranging from laptops and phones to electric vehicles. The addition of the five minerals to the restricted list tightens supply chain concerns for companies worldwide that are already seeking replacements for the other rare earths affected by Chinese restrictions imposed in early April.

The US currently imports the majority of its critical minerals, and the federal government is striving to change that. On October 20, President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a United States–Australia policy framework to secure and diversify critical minerals and rare earths supply chains spanning mining, separation, and processing. (Find out more about the framework in our alert.) In addition, in recent weeks the federal government has been working to develop domestic rare earths capacity. On October 6, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that the federal government intends to purchase a 10-percent share in Canadian rare earths developer Trilogy Metals (NYSE:TMQ), with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5 percent to accelerate the company’s exploration in Alaska’s remote, mineral-rich Ambler Mining District. Also on October 6, the White House announced it will allow the construction of the 211-mile Ambler Road, and President Trump directed that permits for the project be issued promptly. On October 1, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced a significant investment in British-Columbia-based Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC), which plans to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, the world’s largest known measured lithium resource and reserve. And in July, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in Las Vegas-based MP Materials (NYSE:MP), owner of the Mountain Pass mine, the only rare earth mine and processing facility currently operating in the US.

Supply chains in focus: Lessons from a recent enforcement action. Recent increases in trade barriers have led some companies to reconsider and reshape their supply chains to minimize risk and costs. A series of enforcement actions against a Dominican manufacturer of aluminum extrusions, culminating this September when a court vacated a forced labor finding, highlight how companies must look beyond tariff risk to fully account for the multi-dimensional risks associated with regulatory compliance and enforcement in their supply chains. Our alert tells you more.

Energy and natural resources

Trump Administration’s plan to revive coal industry moves forward. On September 29, the Trump Administration announced the next steps in its sweeping plan to revive the mining and use of coal in the US. The Department of the Interior announced it will open 13.1 million acres of federal land to coal mining, lowering royalty rates and streamlining approvals. A press release from the Interior Department states that such lease sales are already underway for sites in Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. At DOE, Secretary Chris Wright announced in late September that the Administration will continue using emergency authority “to stop the closure of coal plants.” On September 30, the DOE announced a major funding opportunity, “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” offering a total of $625 million in awards to address two “topic areas,” Coal Recommissioning, Retrofit, and Modernization Projects and Rural Capacity and Energy Affordability. On October 15, the media outlet NOTUS reported that the majority of those funds, $525 million, were originally appropriated by Congress under the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act. Though the funds were intended for carbon capture programs and rural energy projects, the DOE funding notice states that coal projects may be eligible for awards from the funds originally allocated for carbon capture projects even if they do not immediately include carbon capture utilization and storage components. The Administration’s initiative to revive the coal industry is in accordance with two Executive Orders, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” and “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid.”

Nuclear reactor update. DOE has added four more companies to the Fuel Line Pilot Program, created to help establish a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain for testing new reactors and to fast-track the commercial licensing of reactors. Newly selected by DOE for the program are Oklo Inc., whose small-scale advanced Aurora reactors can be fueled by recycled nuclear waste; Terrestrial Energy Inc., developer of the Integral Molten Salt Reactor powered by molten salt fission technology; TRISO-X LLC, which is developing tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel for the commercial market; and Valar Atomics, which is developing high-temperature gas reactors that use TRISO fuel. The federal government is supporting the development of SMRs under two Executive Orders, “Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy” and “Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security.”

The US military will be among the beneficiaries of this move to build new reactors. On October 15, the US Army announced Project Janus, which aims to build and bring online small modular reactors (SMRs) on nine Army bases as soon as 2027. The program, a partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit, seeks “to provide clean, reliable energy for federal installations and other critical infrastructure.” The reactors will be commercially owned and operated. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the government is already working with private companies that are developing SMRs small enough to be transported on airplanes or trucks and even forward deployed. The US Navy’s submarine fleet is already fully powered by reactors, and the Navy is currently developing the next generation of naval nuclear propulsion infrastructure. In July this year, the Department of the Air Force (DAF) issued Oklo a Notice of Intent to Award for an SMR to be sited at Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks, Alaska.

Sustainability in financial services

SEC signals potentially significant changes to Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal process. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has suggested that the agency may be amenable to arguments from Delaware-incorporated companies seeking to exclude precatory shareholder proposals from company proxy materials. His statements and the SEC’s planned regulatory agenda may denote significant changes to the shareholder proposal process for the 2026 proxy season. See our Market Edge blog.

UN SSE releases Model Guidance on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures. The United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative (UN SSE), in partnership with the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, has released Model Guidance on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, designed to support issuers and listed companies in understanding and disclosing nature-related issues. Climate change, UN SEE commented during the guide’s October 1 release, poses material risks to businesses, investors, financial institutions, and markets. The guidance sets out information that is clear, consistent, and science-based to help entities identify, assess, disclose, and respond to their impacts on nature, which “in turn strengthens risk management, improves transparency, drives accountability, and helps direct capital towards nature-positive outcomes, building resilience and long-term value.” UN SSE also announced that, via its SSE Academy, it will soon launch a new training program for market participants worldwide on nature-related financial disclosures.

Federal banking regulators withdraw climate risk guidance for large banks. The federal banking agencies have withdrawn the Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, a framework created to help large financial institutions – those with $100 billion or more in total assets – address climate-related financial risks. In a joint press release, the agencies stated that the principles are not necessary because supervised institutions already must comply with existing safety and soundness standards and already “should be resilient to a range of risks, including emerging risks.” As we reported in the spring, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency withdrew its participation in the interagency principles on March 31. On October 16, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also withdrew. The principles, the press release stated, have been rescinded “effective immediately.”

European Commission urged to exclude fossil fuel developers from SFDR’s “sustainable” investment categories. In an open letter sent on September 30, more than 120 signatories – among them financial institutions, think tanks, environmental nonprofits, and prominent academics – called on the European Commission to exclude fossil fuel developers from financial investments that are labeled sustainable. The Commission is currently considering revisions to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), legislation put in place in 2019 which sets out how financial market participants must communicate sustainability information. The SFDR allows three different categories to describe the sustainability of financial products: one for funds with a sustainable investment objective; another for funds that meet lower ESG criteria; and a third to be used by funds that meet none of the ESG standards. The letter states that “developing new fossil fuel projects – a long-term investment incompatible with global climate goals – is a clear indication” that a company has no plans to transition to net zero. It concludes: “We advocate strongly for a strict exclusion of companies developing new fossil fuel projects to serve as reference for all future SFDR categories.” Read the letter here.

Sustainability in the marketplace

Indonesia reopens international carbon trading. With the overarching goal of generating new foreign investment and achieving net zero, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has signed a decree ending the country’s four-year moratorium on international carbon trading. The Indonesian government, which had become one of the world’s leading sources of carbon credits, stopped such sales to international buyers in 2021, stating that it preferred to focus on meeting domestic emissions goals. Over the last couple of years, however, it has worked to more closely collaborate with global certification registries, signing mutual recognition agreements with such entities as Gold Standard, the Joint Crediting Mechanism, and Verra; it also introduced its own domestic carbon exchange, starting to offer credits to international buyers earlier this year. President Subianto’s decree requires that traded carbon units be verified either under recognized international standards such as those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or Indonesia’s national standards. Aiming to ensure transparency and accuracy while avoiding double counting, Indonesia has also established a decentralized registry to record carbon units in real time.

Industrial, manufacturing, and tech companies report on their readiness for extreme weather events. A report from insurance company FM of 800 risk decision-makers at global industrial, manufacturing, and technology companies finds that 62 percent of respondents have experienced severe business disruptions from extreme weather events over the past three years – but those respondents still report significant gaps between perceived and actual preparedness for future weather disasters. Four in ten companies, FM noted, report that their boards regularly discuss extreme weather risks, and 80 percent of the study’s respondents told FM that their employees are increasingly concerned about their company’s exposure to weather risks. Furthermore, compared to five years ago, the report found that corporate boards have a far more nuanced understanding of these risks – an understanding that extends to the vulnerability of entire supply chains and business ecosystems. However, the respondents also said that significant gaps remain between perceived and actual preparedness: their current insurance, most reported, would cover about half of potential weather-related impacts. Respondents also reported that their companies are under-adopting risk mitigation measures that could harden their facilities against weather disasters. See the 2025 FM Natural Disasters Report.

The transfer was executed in accordance with the Cyprus Transfer of Banking Business and Securities Law, and as of October 31, 2025, Alpha Bank Cyprus has assumed the assets and liabilities transferred under the agreement, completing a deal first signed on June 24, 2025.

Cyprus’ shipping industry remains firmly committed to the green transition, even after the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) decided to postpone by one year discussions on the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the mechanism that will outline measures for the gradual decarbonisation of global shipping.

Two weeks ago, following an intense week of deliberations, the majority of IMO member states voted in favour of postponing discussions on the NZF for one year.

The framework will define the measures that will guide shipping towards the IMO’s 2050 zero-emissions targets, providing clarity for shipowners and low-carbon fuel producers to move forward with key investments.

The next extraordinary MEPC session to be held in twelve months will give member states the opportunity to build broader consensus on the framework’s content and structure.

According to Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC), “the decision to postpone, while delaying final decisions, also provides valuable time, which has proven necessary, for the international shipping community to conduct further analysis, foster collaboration and develop practical solutions that will ensure an effective, balanced and realistic decarbonisation transition of the shipping industry.”

Cyprus’ Deputy Ministry of Shipping presented a slightly surplus budget for 2026, with expenditures set at €18.7 million and projected revenues of €20.3 million, during a session of the Parliamentary Finance Committee at the end of October.

At the same time, Director General Stelios Chimonas told MPs that the Cyprus registry has grown by around 20 per cent since September 2023, while the number of companies under the Tonnage Tax System rose by 4.5 per cent.

The 4 per cent rise in revenues compared with the 2025 budget, he said, reflects the effectiveness of strategies implemented to strengthen Cypriot shipping.

According to the Annual Action Plan for 2026, the Deputy Ministry employs 155 people, including 94 women and 61 men, operates three administrative directorates, six overseas shipping offices, and 29 departments and services.

Its mission is the sustainable development of Cyprus as a maritime state, reinforcing both the economy and the Republic’s international standing.

Wellington Management Group LLP has reduced its voting rights in the Bank of Cyprus Holdings Public Limited Company to below the 5 per cent disclosure threshold, according to a regulatory filing.

The change, which occurred on October 30, 2025, triggered a mandatory notification to both the issuer and the Central Bank of Ireland.

The notification was submitted using the Standard Form TR-1 for major holdings and was received by the issuer on October 31, 2025.

The filing cited the acquisition or disposal of voting rights as the reason for the disclosure.

The risk of poverty among people who are employed remains a persistent issue across the European Union, with new Eurostat figures showing that 8.2 per cent of workers aged 18 or over in the bloc were at risk of poverty in 2024.

According to Eurostat, the share of working individuals at risk of poverty was notably lower for women at 7.3 per cent, compared to 9.0 per cent for men.

In Cyprus, the rate stood at 7.3 per cent overall, slightly below the EU average.

However, the gender distribution in Cyprus diverged from the European pattern, with the rate higher among women (8.5 per cent) than among men (6.3 per cent).

This places Cyprus among the few EU countries where working women face a greater risk of poverty than their male counterparts, alongside Czechia, Latvia, and Luxembourg.

Cyprus retail trade rose sharply in September 2025, lifted by higher consumer spending across most categories, according to figures released on Monday by the Statistical Service (Cystat).

The Turnover Value Index of retail trade, excluding motor vehicles, increased by 6.3 per cent from a year earlier, while the Turnover Volume Index rose 9 per cent.

Using 2021 as the base year, the value index reached 140.4 and the volume index 125.5.

Over the first nine months of 2025, retail trade grew 6.2 per cent in value and 7.6 per cent in volume compared with the same period in 2024.

Among individual categories, food, beverages and tobacco in specialised stores recorded the largest annual increase, with value up 15.1 per cent to 153.2 and volume up 19.2 per cent to 122.5.

The Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Keve) released a statement Monday recapping the 5th Red Diamond International Business Women Awards.

In its announcement, the chamber said the event, which took place on October 31 in Limassol, has been “established now as a benchmark for highlighting female business excellence in Cyprus and abroad”.

The awards were heled in the presence of Keve secretary general Philokypros Rousounides, and the president of the Limassol Chamber of Commerce and Industry Andreas Tsouloftas, who delivered opening addresses.

The chamber also noted the the attendance of former Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades, who “congratulated the organisers and participants for their contribution to strengthening entrepreneurship”.

Cypriot beverage maker KEO plc‘s board of directors has decided to pay an interim dividend to its shareholders.

According to an announcement following a board meeting, the total amount of the dividend is set at €2,109,096.

This corresponds to €0.05 (5 cents) per each fully paid ordinary share.

The dividend will be paid to the shareholders of the company that will be registered in the CSE records by November 11, 2025, which is the record date.

The company’s shares will begin trading without the right to receive dividend (ex-dividend) from November 10, 2025.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Troodos.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 02:56:34.439331

“The resolution on polar fuels adopted by the Nordic Council this week should spur nordic governments to take the lead on action with IMO Member States to urgently protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions – in particular black carbon, which has a disproportionate impact on Arctic ice”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance.
“The clock is ticking – IMO Member States, led by Nordic governments and other Arctic countries, must urgently develop and adopt a mandatory IMO regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic”.

During this week’s session in Stockholm, the Nordic Council adopted a Member proposal on polar fuels for a prosperous Arctic: “The Committee for a Sustainable Nordic Region proposes that the Nordic Council recommends that the Nordic governments work to ensure that the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) recognises polar fuels in the MARPOL Convention and to implement regulations that require increased use of polar fuels for ships sailing in the Arctic waters of the Nordic countries.”

The Nordic Council is an official body for inter-parliamentary co-operation comprising 87 MPs elected by Nordic parliaments, from the Aland Islands, Denmark, Faroe Islands,Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.

“The resolution on polar fuels adopted by the Nordic Council this week should spur nordic governments to take the lead on action with IMO Member States to urgently protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions – in particular black carbon, which has a disproportionate impact on Arctic ice”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance. “The clock is ticking – IMO Member States, led by Nordic governments and other Arctic countries, must urgently develop and adopt a mandatory IMO regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic”.

The deadline for submission of concrete proposals for such a regulation isDecember 5th, in order to be accepted to the thirteenth session of an IMO technical committee in February 2026, which addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13).

“Black carbon is a climate superpollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned”, continued Prior. “It has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts near to the Arctic settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which in turn absorbs more heat.

The second edition of Making Waves; PR strategies to transform your maritime business, is out on November 4 on Amazon with publisher Rethink Press. A special offer will see the Kindle version retail on Amazon for 99c only on November 4 and 5 visit.

Pinnington says the book is the result of a year’s worth of research and interviews and features 45,000 new words. Making Waves II includes a new in depth section on the US maritime industry as well as new chapters on maritime technology, the maritime media, AI and public relations, social media and crisis communications.

“Maritime now has its highest profile in decades and this is an opportunity and threat, “ he said. “As we have seen with President Trump challenging China’s maritime industry and with the IMO Net Zero framework being paused, maritime is now front and centre of the news agenda. And your perception is your reality. Divided polluting industry in crisis or industry steeped in centuries of innovation pumping billions into decarbonization and recalibrating Western shipbuilding? The maritime industry faces a battle for hearts and minds but historically has preferred a lower profile in the mainstream. But times have changed and maritime needs to start prioritizing professional communications to build authentic reputation and trust. Key will be to educate the mainstream – public, politicians and media – about maritime’s “emissions Everest” setting out the immense cost to decarbonise maritime – up to $1.9trillion. And further explain how difficult it is to find an alternative fuel to power ships the size of the Empire State Building with 120,000 hp engines.

Failure to get this right risks a deeper reputational backlash. But get it right and it will be much easier to attract the best minds and investment to scale the decarbonization mountain and drive digital transformation.”

Pinnington said the book is further aimed at maritime business leaders who want to professionalize their communications.

“I want Making Waves II to give proven ideas so businesses can better do themselves justice,” he said. “The hard reality is that many maritime firms do not have the reputation they deserve. They are trapped in repeating the same year with minimal growth and average marketing. However, if you communicate authentic good behaviour on digital media and in the abundant maritime press – your reputation will rise. And research has shown that with a stronger reputation, your business is more likely to grow.”

Making Waves II features interviews with leading industry figures including maritime VCs Marina Hadjipateras and Nir Gartzman, marine autonomy specialist Jack Dougherty, entrepreneur Darren Shelton, Texas maritime figure Niels Aalund, American maritime lawyer Charlie Papavizas, Great Lakes maritime professionals Ian Hirt and William Friedman, Inland waterways specialist Scott Sigman and PR thought leader Stephen Waddington.

At London International Shipping Week’s ShipZERO30 Workshop, the IMO was the stage for innovators and disruptors to showcase the cutting-edge solutions that deliver a healthy ocean and a profitable future.

IMO’s secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez opened the workshop by reminding delegates of the IMO’s responsibility “to reduce emissions and achieve our goals in order to protect the planet for future generations”, calling on industry innovators “to continue to be the early movers” in shaping decision-making at the IMO, and underling that “this transition can only succeed if it is safe”.

The workshop presented successful real-life vessels, primary wind-powered commercial ocean-going cargo ships, hybrid battery-hydrogen fuel cell propulsion and mobile green hydrogen generation at sea, each built on decades of proven technology. The message was clear: The transformation of maritime transport is not only feasible, it is here, and the business case is real.

Kishan Muthu, head of SeaLabs at global shipowner Union Maritime, kicked off proceedings by sharing the formidable emissions reductions and fuel cost savings with BAR Technologies guaranteeing minimum 1.5 tons fuel reduction per day per WindWing and Norsepower Rotor Sails measuring five to 25 percent fuel savings – all on retrofits of ocean-going tankers and dry bulkers.

When the power of the wind is maximized through design of a new build, the results are staggering: 80 to 90 percent fuel reductions seen on the Neoline Origin, currently under sea trials in Türkiye and due to enter RoRo service in the Atlantic by the end of the year. On top of savings, shipowners benefit greatly from the EU ETS and coming IMO Net Zero Framework.

The message from the panelists was clear: “Wind works and is here to stay”.

The effectiveness, maturity and commercialization of wind propulsion makes the case for a HyWindship, a vessel combining hydrogen and wind for propulsion to achieve absolute zero emissions, is evident: With such dramatic fuel reductions, the quantity of expensive green hydrogen and the supply chain issues are manageable.

Danielle Southcott of Veer Voyage made clear their Design Number 1, which integrates large-scale wind propulsion with hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, can provide absolute zero emissions transport across diverse cargo types and is only one charterer signature away from the shipyard.

Kim Nguyen, project manager at LH2 Shipping, removed any remaining doubt concerning hydrogen’s potential as a reliable absolute zero emissions fuel. Their Hydra RoPax vessel in Norway has been operating since 2023 with 98 percent uptime – the best performance in Norled’s entire fleet of nearly 80 electric and diesel-powered vessels.

Bunkering is completed every two weeks and fills the four-ton tank in just one hour. Zero boil-off gas is achieved during sailing, and just 0.5 percent observed in bunkering, meaning costs are minimised. She finished by making clear that “scale up is not more complicated”, as proven by their two zero-emissions wind-assisted container ships for Samskip, under construction and entering service between Oslo and Rotterdam from Q4 2026.

Hydrogen heavyweights Chart Industries, Air Liquide and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, detailed how supply chain challenges have been met and overcome for years, while Norwegian green hydrogen producer Gen2 Energy’s EVP of project development, Lars Nesje Grimsmo, made clear that through unlocking coastal transport of renewable hydrogen delivered straight into ports, “shipping will be first in line for hydrogen”.

These breakthroughs show how collaboration across shipowners, insurers, supply chains, and policymakers can unlock fresh opportunities for financing and technology adoption.

As Madadh MacLaine, secretary general of ZESTAs, put it: “As we push down the curve, accelerating the trajectory toward steep emissions reductions, supported by IMO regulations, ZESTAs is keeping that cutting edge sharp, creating a pathway that the entire maritime industry can follow.”

Debates throughout the day brought capital markets, technology, and operations together, shaping a common language for an emerging ecosystem — a pathway to a new ocean asset class where profitability and ocean stewardship go hand in hand.

International Maritime Organization (IMO) Net- zero Framework (NZF) is said to hold great promise for climate action in the form of green shipping, but there is great uncertainty surrounding its future. What was supposed to be a step towards establishing a global legally binding framework to decarbonise global shipping has been halted by the threat of tariffs and other punitive measures by the United States (U.S.) on countries that support the undertaking. Notably, the U.S. was not alone in thwarting IMO members’ shipping carbon reduction efforts, as Saudi Arabia, a leading petroleum power, proposed the motion to delay voting on the adoption of the agreement for a year, and many countries backtracked on their initial support. The balancing act involved in global climate efforts, in this case, attempts at decarbonising shipping, and economic interests, is always one worth exploring, as interests matter and this is demonstrated by the results of this initiative. In this article, I explore the interests and the costs of this framework.

Unpacking the IMO Net-zero Framework

The IMO Net-zero Framework was approved for circulation by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at its Eighty-Third session in April 2025 to set international standards geared towards curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the shipping sector. Poised to form part of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollutiofrom Ships (MARPOL), Annex VI, the draft legal text was circulated and due for adoption in October 2025, but it stalled due to resistance by concerned members. Over 100 member states gathered in London to vote on the draft document, with 57 countries supporting adjournment, 49 opposing it, and 21 abstaining.

At the centre of its opposition are the two key elements of the framework, namely, a global fuel standard and an economic measure geared towards reducing carbon emissions from ships. Essentially, the fuel standard sets the rules to get vessels, over time, to minimise the GHG emissions per unit of energy used, and it considers emissions through the entire life-cycle of fuel from production to consumption. The economic measure refers to a two-tiered pollution system with annually increasing GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) targets, which prescribe maximum limits on GHG emissions per unit for large vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage which emit 85% of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas. This mechanism is based on a carbon credits trading scheme, where a set number of credits is allocated to ships. Ships emitting above their GFI thresholds (exceeding their credits) will be required to purchase remedial units to cover the excess.

In simple terms, think of it as a bank account; in this case, the ship has a certain amount of money (GHG emission limit) to participate in shipping, and if the ship goes over, it would be synonymous with having an overdrawn account and would accrue a penalty. In this case, the shipping company pays the penalty in the form of remedial units to offset going beyond the limit.

Conversely, vessels with lower emissions benefit financially through a rewards system, earning credits, with the option of selling their credits to vessels with high emissions. Consequently, ships that exceed set limits have to pay, while those that are net zero or near net zero benefit. Under this framework, the money paid for exceeding limits would go into the IMO-Net Zero Fund. This fund is then used to reward ships with low emissions, support member states’ NZF transition and any other associated initiatives. Employing such measures is believed to be a force for driving clean shipping, fostering technological innovation in sustainable shipping and facilitating capacity building (much like the Caribbean Shipping Lanes Project). This sounds quite doable; pay when you pollute in excess. However, states like the U.S. are concerned with the costs for paying ‘the cost’.

Costs for Paying ‘the cost’

While NZF proponents see the merit of the proposed system in fostering GHG emissions reductions, U.S. President Donald Trump views it as a “Global Green New Scam Tax”. The U.S. Department of State dubbed what, if adopted, could have been the world’s first global environmental tax an injurious initiative. Washington suggests that the NZF could have an adverse trickle-down effect on the American people and the global economy through increased shipping costs. As a result, the U.S. threatened retaliatory measures against states voting in favour of the draft text in the form of visa restrictions and sanctions on state officials, blocking and increasing port fees on vessels from such states, and commercial penalties. What is noteworthy is that Caribbean states, Antigua and Barbuda and the Bahamas, opted to abstain citing transitional concerns, notwithstanding their advocacy for climate change. Also interesting is that China, a trading powerhouse, initially supported the plan but then changed its position.

To say that the concerns about the potential increases in energy and consumer prices are illegitimate would be disingenuous, as this has been a primary concern for many. Based on calculations from the Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP) at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, a vessel utilising the IMO’s recommended environmentally friendly very low sulfur fuel could face an additional $1.5 million in annual operating expenses.

There is a high likelihood that the costs could be passed on to consumers in the form of higher merchandise prices. This will ultimately affect import-dependent countries such as those in the Caribbean. Moreover, the ability of firms to acquire vessels with green technology or upgrade them to support the green shipping transition is also a consideration. Then there are petroleum states, such as Saudi Arabia and increasingly Guyana, which stand to be adversely affected as

their oil sectors are a central part of their economies. However, while transition costs are an essential consideration, so are the real and lived experiences of the effects of climate change.

The Climate Cost

Economists argue that there are opportunity costs for choices made, and the same can be applied in balancing the priorities for economic growth with the environment. Although Caribbean states have not historically contributed to climate change, for all of them, the effects are real and lived experiences. Faced with supersonic monster hurricanes, like hurricane Melissa that ravaged Caribbean countries in October 2025, rising sea levels, droughts and increased temperatures, coastal erosion, progress in climate change adaptation is a matter of lives and livelihood. At the same time, many Caribbean countries are import-reliant economies and the effects of the NZF can appear daunting.

Power politics always seem to stymy adaptation progress, from the 1982 UN Law of the Sea, to the 2015 Paris Agreement, and now the pause in the IMO NZF. In this matter, the concerns raised have some legitimacy. IMO members should use this pause to work through the questions and issues of members with an aim to get closer to a plan that can see the reduction of GHG in shipping. Every effort on every front counts, on the journey to sustainability.

Life extension and conversion to existing tonnage in our repair yards can educate the political leaders on how to solve the problems.
The Cargo Authority approvals can range between confirming proper cargo tank coatings, stainless steel cargo systems, cargo pump capability and IBC code requirements.
To support our domestic markets, we turn to tug & barge in an attempt to solve both of those problems.
The selection of life extension and conversion resulted in a greater than 60% reduction in the asset capital cost when delivered.","We are well into the discussions advising shipbuilders and operators how the U.S. will create a renaissance of the maritime industry. Federal Legislation, Executive Orders, and new foreign partnerships driving the promise of commercial competitiveness with the leading global shipbuilders. Most of the shipbuilding rhetoric indicates the domestic markets will be left to survive on their own. This despite the fact the domestic operators and builders have proven to be the strongest undercurrent to decisions and amendments on the legislation efforts.

It is year-end here at Maritime Reporter & Engineering News. With that gathering of actual shipbuilders and operators comes the end of the political storytelling and the announcements of who is building and who is not. In our opinion 2026 will fall into who is not as the geopolitical rhetoric continues. Unfortunately, the problem is not the builders, not the owners or managers and in some cases not the markets. It is just mass political confusion of what direction the industry is going to take and how we build a supply chain or manufacturing base to support and meet the White House goals. Life extension and conversion to existing tonnage in our repair yards can educate the political leaders on how to solve the problems.

Year End: The Storm Looms

Let’s concentrate on the home front and the domestic projects developing beyond the stories of new construction shipyards competing for Navy and USCG work now coupled with new foreign partners promising global competitiveness. We are still asking where is the support of our commercial fleet and most look to lucrative Navy contract.

Domestic trading opportunities are developing as historical clean and dirty petroleum products are slowly accompanied by chemical and gas. In the chemical markets few if any of the existing domestic barges are capable of transporting new bio fuels, chemicals and or base products. The Cargo Authority approvals can range between confirming proper cargo tank coatings, stainless steel cargo systems, cargo pump capability and IBC code requirements. Despite the now “one-year delay” in meeting the IMO MEPC net zero wish list, new cargoes will continue to develop.

Despite the MEPC vote to delay the position on carbon tax and emissions, the foreign tonnage entering the U.S coasts will require new bunkering sources to address alternative fuels. With that necessity, coastwise registered domestic vessels will need to distribute these cargoes from one U.S. port to another. With our lessons learned identifying the U.S. manufacturing base and supply chain is one of the lead problems with our shipbuilding growth, there are other commodities that will also increase in demand globally and can move to rebuild U.S. infrastructure and manufacturing.

Hopefully the geopolitical discussions in our government departments will wake up to the fact that Gaza needs to be rebuilt and at some point, Ukraine. With that wakeup call, new legislation to support the effort and demand U.S. material be required, can work towards agreements that these goods will be delivered to on new U.S. Flag tonnage. Not an absurd request considering the cost of military equipment and funding the U.S. has provided to both regions. Russia has a ghost fleet, with tariffs and taxes, the global trading patterns are changing and U.S. maritime needs to step to the front of the line with support of our Navy.

LNG has been addressed with capable bunkering tonnage provided. A move to Ammonia, Hydrogen, Methanol or the simplest of alternative fuels in the U.S. fleet has not. Make no mistake, there is no domestic customer base to build or charter new “Bluewater” ship tonnage at the current prices estimated to build that tonnage. The commercial trading markets can’t absorb both the construction Capex and the full crew compliment of US ship operation. To support our domestic markets, we turn to tug & barge in an attempt to solve both of those problems.

None of this should be a surprise.

ATBs: The Future Domestic Coastwise Fleet

The purpose of the Articulated Tug & Barge design developed in 1950 and further advanced in the 1970’s and 1980’s was to provide additional operational performance beyond historic tug tow line. In 1981, the USCG recognizing the ATB safety advantages and created new regulatory amendments that affected crew size and inspection criteria.

Make no mistake, with new ship construction current price levels, the ATB is our future domestic coastwise fleet. The next steps should be the continued pursuit to elevate designs and work towards becoming more efficient in ATB construction. It is not only “Bluewater” costs that are rising. It is also “Brownwater”. And with that, we are seeing a transition period develop with projects addressing life extension and conversion of existing ATB tonnage while the cargo priorities shift from historical petroleum products to a new set of commodities in wet markets.

AMTECH developed an ATB life extension and conversion project in mid-2024 with Marathon Asset Management of New York and Gulf Marine Repair in Tampa, Florida. The business model included the purchase of an existing 155,000-barrel petroleum barge and Articulated Tug along with a design proposal to convert the vessel to trade soft chemicals. The selected tonnage was idle in layup and eighteen years of age when purchased. A 15-year life extension was targeted for the reconstruction.

The business model was developed based upon the purchase of existing tonnage and conversion compared to the estimated cost of new construction. Cost estimates were provided by several U.S. yards. The selection of life extension and conversion resulted in a greater than 60% reduction in the asset capital cost when delivered.

The project development took into account every shipbuilding issue debated in Washington, DC circles over the past 12 months and with that a “lessons learned” of what our actual “shipbuilding” problems are were well defined. It is an underdeveloped manufacturing base and a supply chain of near zero. We still need foreign support from our allies.

Three hundred and twenty tons of steel were renewed after extensive gauging and survey. All of the steel was renewed in a U.S. shipyard with U.S. labor. In the logistics category, the purchase and delivery of steel was identified as a major problem and most was delivered from foreign sources despite a request that no Chinese steel be supplied. A complete redesign of the cargo piping system was completed in 316 stainless steel. Stainless pipe, fittings and valves were near nonexistent in U.S. inventory. The supply chain delivery quotes in these categories were 18 to 30 weeks. If purchased foreign, extended delays exist to request of Imperial standards versus global metric.

Cargo tanks reconstruction was specifically targeted to support an investment with Advanced Polymer Marine Line tank coatings to allow the carriage of new cargoes. This is the first U.S tank barge project applied with Marine Line in the United States to support the commercial and trading applications. Anchor Sandblasting & Coating of Tampa agreed to take on the project and our Amtech South Korea teams provided previous coating experience from our new construction contracts in Hyundai. Anchor Sandblasting & Coating attended shipyards in Turkey to complete the training and take part in coating repairs during the attendance. The selection of Marine Line was an important part of the conversion. The polymer coating provides superior resistance to corrosion and wear, a faster cleaning surface and upgrades to cargo sequencing.

Our Korean teams could not obtain Visa(s) under current immigration issues in the U.S. If U.S shipbuilding is determined to partner and learn from the Far East global shipbuilding powerhouses – H1 Visa approval for professional engineers, trainers and educators is paramount for the advancement of new technologies applied in the Far East.

The project did not experience a lack of labor at Gulf Marine. When schedule advances were required, additional labor was made available. The quality of the work we inspected and approved in near every trade was well above satisfactory. The American shipyard worker can do the job and the Port of Tampa continues to be “shipbuilding” supportive.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/image-courtesy-165120.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:56:42.423212

LNG-fuelled vessels dominated the month’s activity with 26 orders, all from the container segment. The remaining four orders were for methanol-fuelled vessels, with three in the tankers segment.

Despite October’s uptick, the year-to-date picture remains subdued. A total of 222 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed in the first 10 months of 2025, representing just 52% of orders placed during the same period in 2024. LNG-fuelled vessels continue to lead with 67% of all alternative-fuel orders this year, totaling 147 ships. Methanol-fuelled vessels follow with 47 orders, while LPG carriers account for 19, ammonia-fuelled vessels for 5, and hydrogen-fuelled vessels for 4.

The container segment now dominates alternative-fuel vessel orders, accounting for 65% of all new orders in 2025.

Infrastructure investment also advanced in October, with four LNG bunker vessels and two bunker vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel added to the orderbook. While these vessels are not included in alternative-fuelled vessel statistics, they represent continued commitment to supporting the emerging alternative-fuelled fleet.

Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV Maritime, welcomed the improvement while acknowledging ongoing challenges. “Following some weak months, it is encouraging to see stronger numbers in the alternative-fuelled space in October, both for vessels and with further investment in bunkering infrastructure. While activity remains well below last year’s levels, it is important to recognize that this is happening within a weaker overall newbuild market,” Stefanatos said.

Regulatory uncertainty has been identified as a key factor affecting market sentiment. Stefanatos previously noted that “uncertainties around the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, including lifecycle assessment factors for certain fuels, are prompting many owners to adopt a ‘wait and see’ approach to new orders.”

Last month, the IMO postponed the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework by one year following pressure from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and other countries, pushing the adoption vote to October 2026. The framework aims to bring international shipping emissions down to net zero by 2050 and would create the world’s first global carbon pricing mechanism for shipping, with revenues expected to reach up to $15 billion annually from 2030.

“Although issues of regulatory uncertainty are yet to be solved, the push for maritime decarbonization continues, led by the container segment and driven by a range of actors, including cargo owners, financiers, and shipowners themselves. This continued commitment across the industry signals that the transition to cleaner fuels remains firmly on the agenda,” Stefanatos added.

The IMO will reconvene for technical working group talks from April 20-24, 2026, followed by the 84th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee from April 27 to May 1.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shutterstock_1925152076-800x391.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:59:58.251418

Shipping currently accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and without any intervention, the I.M.O.","An important international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry was delayed on October 18 after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions against countries that supported the measure. Delegates at the International Maritime Organization (I.M.O.), a United Nations body that regulates international shipping, voted 57-49 to delay adopting the Net Zero Framework (N.Z.F.) by at least a year, postponing rules that would have required ships to cut emissions starting in 2028. The framework, which was first agreed upon in April 2025, aimed to make shipping the first global industry with binding climate regulations, including a carbon-pricing system to incentivize cleaner fuels and penalize harmful excess emissions.

International leaders reacted quickly with divided responses. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised the delay as “another huge win” for Trump, commending the president for protecting American consumers from what he called a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” according to PBS News. In contrast, European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera described the delay as “a huge shame” and reaffirmed Europe’s commitment to ambitious global climate standards (Politico). Based on AP News, Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change, called the decision “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change,” noting that island nations are already confronting rising seas and extreme weather events. Environmental NGOs (non-governmental organizations) like Transport & Environment and Opportunity Green expressed extreme concern that the delay jeopardizes efforts to reduce emissions, as Alison Shaw of Transport & Environment states, “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” according to PBS News.

This outcome is concerning from a climate perspective. The N.Z.F. was designed to create uniform regulations that would have allowed shipping companies to invest in greener technologies. Thomas Kazakos, Secretary-General of the International Chamber of Shipping, emphasized that “industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector,” as noted by the BBC. By succumbing to pressure from fossil-fuel-producing nations, the I.M.O. missed an opportunity to enforce global standards and encourage the use of alternative fuels like ammonia and methanol. While the U.S. celebrated the decisions as a protection of domestic economic interests, the broader consequence is a delay in global efforts to combat climate change, which puts vulnerable communities, especially in the Pacific and the Caribbean, at extreme risk.

The conflict comes from rising tensions between the need to address climate change, the desire of countries to protect their economies, and the influence of global political power. It shows the flash of governmental goals, money, and politics. Shipping currently accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and without any intervention, the I.M.O. has projected that these emissions could grow by 10% and even up to 150% by 2050, according to BBC reporting. The N.Z.F. would have required ships to gradually transition away from the use of heavy fuel oil, impose fees for extra carbon emissions, and encourage support for using cleaner fuel alternatives. Countries including China, the European Union, Brazil, and the U.K. support the plan, while Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the U.S. oppose it, worrying about costs and effects on the economy. Based on AP News reporting, this is similar to previous international negotiations, such as the failed global plastic treaty earlier in 2025, where the U.S. and Saudi Arabia blocked regulations even though most countries agreed that there was urgent environmental action needed.",https://theowp.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0_wmDPQ-UpLBV7413M.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:04:09.532060

This delay raises concerns that regional legislation and Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) may emerge as alternatives to the anticipated global framework. The European Union’s ETS, initially viewed as a temporary measure, is now poised to take center stage as a model for other regions.

New EU Guidelines on Methane Reporting

On October 8, 2025, the European Commission unveiled its Guidelines for Reporting and Verification of Actual Methane Slip Factors. This marks a pivotal moment for shipowners, allowing them to substitute conservative default methane values with actual measured data, verified in line with IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83). Previously, the FuelEU default tables focused solely on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, neglecting methane slip (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) factors associated with various renewable fuels, including bio- and e-methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, and dual-fuel engines.

The absence of verified data for these fuels could lead to inaccuracies in greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity reporting, potentially exposing shipowners to higher emissions costs. Fortunately, the IMO MEPC.402(83) provides a framework for measuring both methane and nitrous oxide emissions onboard vessels. The new EU guidelines outline how to report verified CH₄ factors under FuelEU, with procedures for N₂O expected to follow shortly. Existing technology, such as VPS Emsys, can continuously measure and verify emissions of CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O, while automatically generating a Methane File ready for verification.

As the shipping industry prepares for the EU ETS 2026 cycle, which will include pricing and verification of all combustion-related GHGs, it is crucial for shipowners and operators to act swiftly. Currently, FuelEU lacks default methane or nitrous oxide factors for new fuels, making accurate GHG accounting essential to minimize ETS exposure.

According to Greek shipbroker Intermodal, these plans target modernising shipyards, including replacing outdated machinery, installing larger cranes and adopting advanced automation and digital technologies.

Additionally, the Japanese government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United States to expand collaboration, with Washington pursuing similar opportunities with South Korea.

A new chapter in innovation

These investments are centered on technological innovation. “Japan’s industry is advancing zero-emissions vessels, autonomous ships and IoT-enabled solutions through collaborations with R&D centres, universities and think tanks,” said Intermodal senior analyst Nikos Tagoulis.

By 2040, Japan aims to become a leader in autonomous and zero-emissions shipbuilding, targeting half of its domestic fleet to be autonomous.

“Rather than prioritising sheer production volume, the focus is on innovation and value-added technological solutions that enhance both vessel performance and overall quality,” Mr Tagoulis added.

He noted while Japan’s global market share may remain broadly stable, eco-friendly technologies, efficiency-enhancing solutions and strategic partnerships could boost profitability and reinforce its international standing.

Fallen share and market challenges

“These efforts come as Japan seeks to regain ground in a shipbuilding landscape that has shifted dramatically over the past two decades,” Mr Tagoulis said.

Intermodal data shows that while Japan once commanded more than 35% of new orders, its share has declined from 26% in 2017 to just over 10% as of October 2025, coinciding with rapid growth in China.

The Japanese orderbook currently comprises 737 vessels totalling 40.7M dwt, primarily bulk carriers, tankers and container ships. Regarding alternative fuels, 10% of vessels may use methanol and approximately 4% are LNG-capable. Moreover, 32% of ordered tonnage will be scrubber-fitted.

Consolidation amid structural constraints

In response to market pressures, Japan’s shipbuilding sector has undergone consolidations to sustain competitiveness.

Significant developments include Imabari Shipbuilding increasing its stake in Japan Marine United, while Mitsui E&S has gradually scaled back operations, closing its Chiba yard and transferring most newbuilding activities to Tsuneishi. Similarly, Sasebo Heavy Industries exited newbuilding in 2022, shifting focus to repairs and machinery.

However, structural challenges persist. “Limited coastal space restricts new shipyard expansion, though upgrade investments aim to increase capacity at existing facilities,” Mr Tagoulis highlighted.

Additionally, an ageing workforce has prompted the industry to recruit foreign workers, who now comprise roughly 20% of the workforce, up from virtually zero a decade ago, Intermodal data shows. Specialised training centres have also been established to support skills development.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/174/Oshim1_Thumb.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:00:21.674793

According to a LinkedIn post by Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV, in October, 30 new vessel orders were added to the database, with LNG-fuelled ships dominating the tally.
Year-to-date, 222 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in 2025.
LNG-fuelled vessels account for roughly two-thirds (67%) of these, while container ships represent 65% of the total.
These new orders demonstrate sustained momentum in the maritime sector’s shift toward lower-emission shipping solutions … said Stefanatos.","The latest data from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform shows that the market for alternative-fuelled vessels remains active, even amid a slowdown in the broader shipbuilding sector.

According to a LinkedIn post by Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV, in October, 30 new vessel orders were added to the database, with LNG-fuelled ships dominating the tally. Of these, 26 were container vessels powered by LNG, while the remaining four vessels were methanol-fuelled, three of which are tankers. Year-to-date, 222 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in 2025.

LNG-fuelled vessels account for roughly two-thirds (67%) of these, while container ships represent 65% of the total. Although these figures represent a noticeable decline from the same period in 2024, down 52%, DNV attributes this largely to a weakening in the wider newbuild market rather than a shift away from alternative fuels.

The October orderbook also saw the addition of four LNG bunker vessels and two methanol-capable bunker vessels, highlighting ongoing investment in fuel infrastructure.

It is encouraging to see that despite persistent regulatory uncertainty, the transition to cleaner fuels continues to be firmly on the agenda. These new orders demonstrate sustained momentum in the maritime sector’s shift toward lower-emission shipping solutions
