Theofilos Mozas from Greece. This session addresses critical issues from maritime security enhancements to regulatory frameworks for emerging technologies and certification requirements. The discussions are key for shaping global safety standards aimed at protecting human lives and the environment.

### Addressing Maritime Security

A pressing concern includes rising threats in the Red Sea, highlighted by recent ship attacks and the hijacking of the MV Galaxy Leader. With more than 40 incidents reported, the MSC aims to implement measures to mitigate these risks and bolster the safety of seafarers in affected areas. A proposed resolution condemning these attacks underscores the urgent need for collective action against maritime security threats.

### Autonomous Shipping

As the industry moves towards autonomous vessels, the MSC is developing a non-mandatory code for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). This code is essential for integrating these ships safely into existing maritime operations while ensuring compliance with safety standards applicable to traditional vessels.

### Sustainable Maritime Operations

In response to climate change pressures, the committee is working on a safety regulatory framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. This framework is pivotal for the IMO’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions in shipping through the adoption of innovative technologies and alternative fuels. It will address safety complexities and risks associated with implementing low-emission technologies.

### Protecting Seafarers

The committee’s agenda also focuses on the human element in maritime operations, particularly addressing violence and harassment. Proposed amendments to the Seafarers’ Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping Code (STCW Code) aim to enhance protections for seafarers, providing essential training and support to combat abuse and harassment.

### Modifications to Certification Standards

Recognizing the need for updated certification requirements, the MSC is seeking to revise the International Convention on Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (STCW-F Convention). These adjustments will cater to the evolving fishing industry, standardize qualifications, and improve safety for fishing vessel workers.

### Addressing Other Emerging Challenges

The MSC’s agenda includes reviewing safety measures outlined in the 1974 SOLAS Convention, tackling piracy and armed robbery, and analyzing reports from its subcommittees. Their comprehensive approach also focuses on improving navigational aids and ensuring the safe transport of hazardous cargo.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-07 10:56:10.794402

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has been at the very heart of the US policy maelstrom that rocked global shipping in 2025.

USTR policies on port fees have forced widespread vessel deployments, and tariffs based on USTR investigations have caused global shifts in cargo flows. Some shipowners have profited; others have lost.

The shipping industry was forced into Herculean efforts on contingency planning, only to see the port fees paused for a year on November 10 as part of the US-China trade agreement.

Countless ships were rerouted, vessels were refinanced to remove Chinese sale-leaseback exposure, time and money was spent on rebuttals to USTR proposals, and it all ended up being a bargaining chip in a much bigger game.

02 / Li Chenggang, China International Trade Representative

China, for whom Li Chenggang is the International Trade Representative, responded to the US port fee plan with tit-for-tat fees for ships linked to the US, calling them “necessary acts of passive defence”.

Its measures largely mirrored those of the US, even down to the lack of clarity about how “ownership” and “vessel operator” were defined.

There was consternation over how China would calculate the 25% US ownership threshold — but fees on all US-listed fleets would be far-reaching.

Fearnley Securities estimated the extra costs per call at $6m for a very large crude carrier, $5m for a capesize and $20 per tonne for a liquefied petroleum gas cargo.

03 / Marco Rubio, US State Secretary

Donald Trump’s White House and the departments of State and Energy were absent from the April meeting that approved the International Maritime Organization’s landmark Net-Zero Framework.

They more than made up for it next time round. State secretary Marco Rubio, energy secretary Chris Wright and transportation secretary Sean Duffy came out swinging against the NZF, and the economic threat it presented to the US (or more likely the relatively cheap political win it represented against UN agencies with green ambitions for industry) over the next six months.

What followed was an overwhelming show of diplomatic force to kill the NZF, including bullying, threats and intimidation against delegates from countries much weaker than the US. Rubio contacted several nations personally to promise retaliation if countries voted Yes.

The US and Saudi Arabia eventually won a one-year delay, which many think is the end of the IMO work plan — and thus the end of the industry hope of global carbon pricing.

04 / Mohammad Ayoub, Saudi Arabia (UNFCCC delegate)

While the headline-grabbing threats by the US were seen as the major blocker of the NZF, Saudi Arabia has long been the leader of the IMO bloc most opposed to green regulations.

The US and Saudi call to adopt the NZF under the old system of “explicit acceptance” — to ensure it never enters into force, even if it passes — was a deft procedural attack, throwing the EU and other delegates off guard and threatening to undermine the functioning of the IMO itself.

Saudi Arabia’s UNFCCC delegate, Mohammad Ayoub, was brought for this year’s two MEPCs to do what he does best: oppose, oppose, oppose.

Saudi Arabia also submitted several detailed documents listing the various reasons for countries to reject the green scheme they had approved just six months earlier, citing studies to argue carbon taxes would raise food prices for poor countries.

05 / Arsenio Dominguez, International Maritime Organization

Keeping October’s extraordinary MEPC meeting (there’s no better word for it) from going off the rails was arguably the biggest challenge an IMO secretary-general has yet faced.

Arsenio Dominguez narrowly avoided presiding over a rejection of the NZF, or a total collapse of the talks. He told delegates not to celebrate the outcome, but to “come back fresh in one year ready to negotiate”.

Dominguez made it his trademark never to answer when journalists asked what would happen should the NZF not be adopted. His job could well depend on whether it goes through next year.

06 / Sveinung Oftedal, chair, IMO ISWG-GHG (Norway delegate)

Norway’s IMO delegate Sveinung Oftedal chairs the IMO’s intersessional working group on greenhouse gases, ISWG-GHG. It is that forum, not the main chamber, where the real horse trading on carbon pricing usually takes place (perhaps because it’s closed to journalists).

Oftedal has sought gradually to build consensus on a plan that worked. He was instrumental in forming what became the NZF, which passed by a majority vote in April. That majority included Brazil and China, which had been significant critics.

Pacific Islands pushing for a flat carbon levy complained that their plan was sidelined, while the EU27 reckoned that such a levy would never fly. Oftedal got a global carbon price closer than anyone else has — no small achievement.

07 / Maria Angelicoussis, Angelicoussis Group

Greek shipowners have made no secret of their scepticism of carbon pricing. But the intervention in September by a group of six big players, led by Maria Angelicoussis, was important.

The support of the group, which has made big investments in liquefied natural gas fuel, was enough to sway the governments of Greece and Cyprus to abstain from the vote to postpone the framework, breaking with the rest of the EU27.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has since called for Europe to rethink its green agenda more broadly. Let’s see how that plays out now that the EU’s are the only significant emissions rules for shipping in place for the foreseeable future.

08 / General Mamadi Doumbouya, junta leader, Guinea

After nearly 30 years, the $23bn Simandou mine is set to take the tiny African nation of Guinea from nowhere to the world’s third-biggest iron ore exporter.

The biggest mining project on the planet has the potential to reshape the global iron ore trade, giving China the advantage and displacing the dominance of Australia’s Pilbara region, with big ramifications for dry bulk shipping.

General Mamadi Doumbouya, who seized power in Guinea in 2021, is arguably more responsible than any other person for making Simandou happen, forcing mining giant Rio Tinto and its Chinese partners to share the huge costs of developing a railway and port.

09 / Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas, European Commission

The setback at the IMO makes the European Commission — represented in this list by Magda Kopczynska, Fotini Ioannidou and Apostolos Tzitzikostas — the most significant regulator of shipping’s environment impacts for the foreseeable future.

The ETS and FuelEU Maritime regulations continue to be implemented, and a small industry has sprung up in response on advising companies how to pool and trade compliance surplus to avoid having to pay for biofuels or penalties.

The commission has kept shtum on whether it plans to carry out its threat to extend the schemes to cover 100% of voyages to and from EU ports, from 50% today, if the IMO does not deliver.

But another IMO delay in 2026, or a failure of the NZF altogether, makes such a tax hike far more likely.

10 / Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping

The shipowners’ association, the International Chamber of Shipping, continues to be the main voice of the industry in IMO debates. It will have its work cut out for it next year as the role of industry associations diminishes and great-power politics takes over the carbon price debate.

But the ICS — represented in this list by Emanuele Grimaldi and Thomas Kazakos — remains influential in lobbying governments on industry topics including safety and security, alternative fuels and seafarer well-being.

In the two centuries international shipping has transitioned from sail to steam, and from coal to oil propulsion. As a result of the need to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from ships, the industry is now on the brink of a ‘Fourth Propulsion Revolution’, possibly using a combination of hydrogen/ammonia and batteries powered from renewable energy sources.

Hi, Diana Stinson, President and owner of Texas Global Services. First of all, thank you for reading my blog. Also, this is a wonderful article by the Chamber (International Chamber of Shipping). Although, the author is unknown, this article shows the shipping industry coming in strong to meet the ambitious CO2 emissions target set by the IMO. Decarbonizing shipping and using zero-carbon technologies seems so far off. 2030 is just five years away and there needs to be a 40% efficiency improvement? I don’t see it happening that fast but I see the solution happening that fast. Hydrogen, ammonia and electricity powered ships? Wind powered ships? These ideas are bold and I love to share them with you. Are they realistic you ask. This cannot be in production already, can it?

The Blue Marlin Inland Solar cargo ship is already in operation. It is a hybrid ship that uses solar power to bring their emissions down considerably. Also, can be powered on solar alone for limited time. So the short answer is yes. These ideas are bold and they are realistic. The 106,000 HP engine that runs container ships is a huge ask to replace. Using ideas that reduce these emissions is the least we can do. Are we doing more? Yes. Pyxis Ocean’s maiden voyage was in June of this year. She is a wind powered hybrid that has experienced over 1/3 reduction in emissions using rigid sails. Hydrogen cell using vessels are in production for inland cargo ships and a California Coastal Research Vessel. I do see even bigger ideas becoming realities. Norway has a Sea Zero that is amazing. Fully electric cruise ship with retractable sails to be used on coastal Norwegian routes.

I’m very happy with the things I’m seeing to reduce the amount of carbon from the shipping industry. My industry of 22 years. There is much to be done. How much is in production I am unsure. The solutions have come and they are being implemented. There’s many cargo ships in the world, 58,000 says Google. I see opportunities for new companies and existing companies. Humanity comes together when they are needed the most. We are seeing that now. I’m still proud to be moving freight and am looking to the future that is coming fast.",https://www.texasglobalservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/hydrogen-ship-Copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 12:56:08.685415

“While decarbonizing the global shipping industry remains a long-term challenge, China, an indispensable partner in this endeavor, is emerging as a driving force in this transformation,” he said.

“This is thanks to its strong industrial base, world-leading shipbuilding capacity and growing strength in renewable energy.”

As the world’s largest consumer and producer of renewable energy, China plays a pivotal role in the transition. Its position as a strategic hub for international shipping and a major investor in clean technologies has attracted multinational collaboration in recent years, he added.

Everllence, which is headquartered in Augsburg, Germany, has been expanding its investment in key technologies, including future fuel engines, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), and industrial heat pumps, to support the decarbonization and digital transformation of the global shipping industry, he said.

According to Kettschau, partnerships with Chinese companies have been focusing on developing low and zero carbon engine solutions powered by clean fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), methanol and ammonia dual-fuel engines.

“These collaborations are advancing next-generation technologies while driving the integration of innovation, local manufacturing and sustainable growth,” he said.

The push for greener shipping is reshaping China’s energy landscape.

In August, the National Energy Administration formally recognized green liquid fuels, including green ammonia and green methanol, as renewable energy sources, sending a strong signal to the market while aligning with surging global demand.

The global green fuel market, according to market research firm Verified Market Reports, was valued at $70.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $175.1 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 12.66 percent.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) predicts that by 2050, green methanol demand could hit 190 million metric tons, comprising 42 percent of the shipping fuel mix, while fossil fuels shrink to 15 percent.

Beyond the vessels themselves, Chinese utilities are also targeting the carbon footprint of the shipbuilding process.

State Grid Nantong Power Supply Co recently launched a pilot program to create “near-zero carbon “shipyards, implementing precise carbon management across the manufacturing cycle.

By replacing traditional ceramic heating with electromagnetic induction in the welding stage, the project improved heating efficiency by 50 percent and cut power consumption by 60 percent, it said during this year’s United Nations climate change conference, or COP30.

In the coating workshop, which accounts for the bulk of energy use, smart temperature controls reduced electricity usage by 30 percent, while further efficiency gains were realized in the assembly stage, where upgrading air compressors cut power use by 40 percent.

The company has also deployed an AI-driven digital energy management platform, allowing shipyards to schedule energy-intensive production during low-cost electricity periods, creating a commercially viable road map for green manufacturing in the heavy industry sector.

Everllence has just unveiled its new, dual-fuel ME-LGIA (liquid gas injection ammonia) engine. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement. It is another concrete step to advance the green transition and toward a climate-neutral future, said Kettschau.

“With more than a century of history in China, strong local production capabilities in collaboration with our Chinese ship engine licensees, and a shared commitment to a sustainable future, Everllence will continue working hand-in-hand with Chinese partners,” he said.",,N,,2025-12-05 06:56:58.211930

At Marintec China, the world's largest maritime exhibition, companies from across the world are showcasing their latest green innovations. Wu Bin reports from Shanghai.

Marintec China has been held for over four decades, but this is the first year the exhibition features a dedicated section on decarbonization in the shipping sector.

GONG KANGKANG Head, International Organizing Committee for Marintec ""Our current IMO zero-carbon framework has now entered the final stage of implementation. We also needs a platform to bring together global resources to drive the application of decarbonization technologies—from research and development to commercial deployment.""

One key aspect of decarbonization is the use of clean energy.

Currently, the shipping industry mainly relies on LNG and methanol.

More companies are now developing equipment that runs on another fuel: ammonia, which offers higher energy output and zero carbon emissions.

This company is showcasing its latest ammonia engine, unveiled just last month and slated for delivery next year.

UWE LAUBER CEO, Everllence ""This year is a special year I would say because we see so much technology and so much change and that the shipping industry is pushing forward in terms of decarbonization, so ammonia, methanol, all these green fuels and engines and technology which is needed. You can found it here right away. Technology is ready, when the regulations are popping in, we are ready to go for it.""

This institute under CSSC, the world's largest shipbuilding group, is presenting a solution called the ""Green Energy Island"", an integrated unit designed to handle all these needs at sea.

LI XIN Deputy Dean, Shanghai Merchant Ship Design and Research Institute, CSSC ""The green fuel needed for future ships requires zero-carbon in both production and transportation. To meet this requirement, we have chosen to produce, store and resupply green fuel on a single offshore platform. This approach minimizes comprehensive costs, providing an effective green fuel solution for our entire maritime operations.""

Most of the new orders across the globe now come to China.

Despite some disagreements over the IMO's net-zero framework making shipowners more cautious, green innovations continue to advance.

CHEN GANG President, Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding, China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) ""During the 14th Five-Year Plan period, we have upgraded the entire green solution across all our ship products. From a low-carbon perspective, we must closely follow international regulatory requirements, maintain ongoing communication with manufacturers and supply chain partners, and deliver offshore equipment and ship products that meet market demands and regulatory standards in a timely manner.""

WU BIN Shanghai ""In October this year, the vote on adopting the International Maritime Organization's net-zero framework was postponed for a year after being rejected by the United States. But here at Marintec China, countries are pushing forward with green innovations. Experts say that the shipping industry's transition to low-carbon and sustainable practices is an unstoppable trend.

With new rules coming and technology moving quickly, owners are being urged to invest in long term strategies built on data, flexibility and collaboration.

As shipowners prepare for another year of rapid change, Wärtsilä has outlined four trends it believes will shape how fleets are managed in 2026. The company says the sector is moving into a period where digital systems, mixed-fuel operations and long range planning are becoming standard expectations rather than future concepts.

A central shift is the move toward lifecycle optimisation. Instead of reacting to each new regulation or equipment requirement, owners are being pushed to plan for the entire life of a vessel. This includes environmental impact, fuel efficiency, operating costs and the ability to maintain value over decades. Wärtsilä argues that this approach only works when owners, operators and equipment manufacturers share data and maintain clear operational transparency.

Fuel strategies are also changing. Wärtsilä notes that no single pathway suits every company and that a vessel’s trading pattern, fuel availability and commercial priorities determine the right mix. Many owners are exploring fuel flexible engines, hybrid propulsion and systems designed to prevent methane slip. The company says these options help owners keep their fleets compliant as rules evolve.

Digitalisation and the use of big data remain a challenge for much of the sector, even as leading operators adopt real time analytics to guide daily decisions. Modern vessels often run hybrid power setups and advanced automation, making integrated data systems a requirement. Wärtsilä says the ability to turn operational data into recommendations is already cutting fuel use and emissions for early adopters. Issues related to data governance and system compatibility continue to hinder wider use.

Regulatory uncertainty adds another layer of pressure. The delay in the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has not slowed regional action. Measures like the EU Emission Trading System and FuelEU Maritime are pushing owners to strengthen compliance and reporting processes.

Roger Holm, President of Wärtsilä Marine, says collaboration across the sector is crucial. He states, “As we look ahead to 2026, collaboration will play a vital part in driving the sustainable transformation of shipping and shaping a cleaner and smarter future for the maritime industry.” He adds, “Legislation is critical to accelerating investment in alternative fuels, but it is no silver bullet. Decarbonisation is a team effort.”

For shipowners, the message is clear. Long term planning, flexible fuel strategies and stronger digital foundations will define competitiveness as the next wave of regulations and technologies arrives.",https://thedigitalship.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-04 18:57:24.463352

Without clear regulatory incentives and long-term pricing signals, however, methanol risks remaining a technically capable solution that’s commercially out of reach.","Methanol is positioning itself as a strong near-term contender in the maritime industry’s shift toward low-emission fuels. A new white paper from DNV, Methanol fuel in shipping, highlights how the technology supporting methanol-powered vessels has matured significantly, with more than 450 ships either operating or on order and over 600,000 hours of methanol engine runtime logged to date.

Unlike ammonia or LNG, methanol can be handled using much of the existing port infrastructure, removing the need for new cryogenic systems and reducing both investment and operational complexity. Retrofit solutions are also well developed, offering flexibility for existing fleets.

One of methanol’s most significant selling points is its operational flexibility. Dual-fuel engines can run on methanol alongside other fuels, including biodiesel and, in some configurations, even ethanol. This optionality is a strategic advantage in a volatile regulatory and pricing environment.

Environmentally, methanol offers benefits such as sulfur-free combustion, reduced soot, and lower NOx emissions. In particular, bio- and e-methanol pathways hold potential for achieving ultra-low or even net-negative lifecycle emissions—if production can scale and sourcing remains sustainable.

Cost and Capacity Remain the Deciding Factors

Despite strong technical foundations, methanol faces economic and logistical challenges. Today’s bio-methanol costs hover around USD 2,500 per ton MGOe—roughly three times the price of marine gas oil. On the supply side, global production currently sits at around 2.2 million tons, a small fraction of what could be needed by 2040 if adoption accelerates.

The outlook is starting to shift, with a wave of new capacity investments underway. China currently leads with 43% of all planned low-emissions methanol production projects. But the speed of market development will ultimately be shaped by regulatory frameworks. DNV’s analysis points to the importance of international policy levers such as the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation in driving fuel transition timelines.

Tools like DNV’s Fuel Selector and Alternative Fuels Insight platform are already supporting shipowners in evaluating compliance options, assessing future investment risks, and modeling operational scenarios. Without clear regulatory incentives and long-term pricing signals, however, methanol risks remaining a technically capable solution that’s commercially out of reach.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251203-080051-249-mike-hindle--8n2CGk7Ihk-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 12:58:38.442178
