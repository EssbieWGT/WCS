A recent National Corn Growers Association survey shows that nearly half of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis. For many, 2025 marks the third consecutive year of negative profitability, threatening both food security and the stability of local economies.

Industry leaders stress that short-term fixes will not be enough. Instead, new and durable demand markets are required to restore profitability for America's farmers. A potential breakthrough may come this October, when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is expected to finalize its Net-Zero Framework, requiring large ocean-going vessels to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beginning in 2027.

This policy will accelerate demand for biofuels; renewable fuels made from plant material, animal waste, and agricultural residues. By 2030, biofuel demand for maritime use could grow by up to 25 million metric tons; one-third of global demand.

""Biofuels represent more than just cleaner energy. They represent a lifeline for U.S. farmers,"" said Ben Kruger, senior vice president, Roeslein Renewables. ""By leveraging our agricultural waste and renewable resources, we can stabilize rural communities while helping the shipping industry decarbonize.""

Among the most promising fuels are:

BioLNG: Produced from manure, crop residues, and food waste, BioLNG is compatible with existing LNG infrastructure and can even achieve negative lifecycle emissions. With over 1 billion tons of agricultural waste generated annually, the U.S. is uniquely positioned to lead in BioLNG production.5

Biodiesel: Derived from animal fats, oilseeds, and used cooking oil, biodiesel offers a near drop-in replacement for marine diesel with minimal retrofitting. Increased demand could equal up to twice the size of Iowa's annual soybean crop, generating new markets for farmers across multiple feedstocks.

Together, BioLNG and biodiesel could help U.S. agriculture supply flexible, scalable, and sustainable fuel solutions for maritime shipping. Projections show these markets could generate $100-200 billion in new farm revenues by 2050, reducing dependence on ad hoc government assistance and strengthening rural economies.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Roeslein_Renewables_2f5ed99b19.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:56:06.984207

The NZF aims to establish binding global emissions-reduction measures for the maritime sector, driving a major transition toward green hydrogen-based shipping fuels over the coming decades. According to the Green Hydrogen Organisation, the framework’s implementation would require about 200 million tonnes of green ammonia and methanol by 2040.

All European nations expressed their backing for the framework, which proposes a system of financial penalties for high-emission vessels. The revenues would be channelled into a “net zero fund” designed to reward low-emission ships, foster innovation and training, and provide financial assistance to vulnerable nations. Notably, small island developing states, which had previously criticised the framework for not going far enough, also endorsed it during the opening session.

However, opposition came from the US delegation, representing the Trump administration, alongside a few fossil-fuel-reliant nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. According to TradeWinds, around 15 countries raised concerns, while at least 46 nations declared their support—some of which had previously abstained during the April meeting that provisionally approved the NZF draft by 63 votes to 16.

The US was the only country to explicitly reject any regulation of shipping emissions. Saudi Arabia, which initially opposed certain elements, later softened its stance, saying it did not wish to abandon the framework altogether.

The NZF represents an amendment to Annex VI of the IMO’s MARPOL Convention on marine pollution. Its adoption requires a two-thirds majority among the 108 signatory nations, meaning the US alone cannot block it. Nevertheless, American officials have attempted to undermine the process through threats of economic retaliation—including sanctions against officials, port restrictions on ships from supporting nations, higher port fees, visa limitations for seafarers, and other financial penalties.

The US delegation argued that the net zero fund could become “a giant environmental slush fund” and criticised the focus on “expensive and unproven” alternative fuels.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez dismissed these claims, emphasizing that the organisation has long administered international funds—such as oil pollution compensation mechanisms—from its London headquarters. He also warned that delaying adoption would create uncertainty, deterring investment and prompting fragmented regional regulations.

“Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in the IMO,” Dominguez told delegates. “Adopting this plan will ultimately reduce the costs of decarbonisation and provide a coherent global framework.”

Despite the tensions, backers remain confident the framework will be formally adopted and enter into force in 2027.

“I understand that some view this outcome as not ambitious enough, while others fear the reduction targets are too demanding,” Dominguez said. “The IMO Net-Zero Framework may not be perfect, but it offers a balanced foundation to move forward and deliver meaningful progress toward a cleaner, more sustainable shipping industry.”",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Imo-day-1-news-today.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:56:12.774040

For carbon emissions above this cap, the IMO would collect what is effectively a carbon tax, to be held in a green energy fund and used on unspecified projects.
Maritime shipping accounts for only 3% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, meaning that the IMO regulations will impose a huge burden on the global shipping industry, for only a marginal reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
However, this aspiration lacked the radical plan to achieve this goal through a U.N.-imposed carbon tax.
Proponents for the IMO carbon tax form an unusual coalition of developed European nations and Pacific island nations.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) will vote this week whether to approve new regulations authorizing them to charge maritime shipping companies for their carbon emissions. The measure would be the first ever carbon tax on maritime commerce and the first ever tax collected directly by a U.N. agency, which is unaccountable to the consumers who must pay higher prices as a result. Before the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) convened on Tuesday, the Trump administration issued an ultimatum warning countries against voting for the measure.

In a lopsided vote of 63-16, the MEPC approved the 120-page draft regulation during its 83rd session on April 7-11. The regulation implements a “net-zero framework” (NZF) by requiring all maritime shipping to achieve “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, with intermediate targets set for 2030 and 2040.

“Net”-zero carbon emissions is not the same as absolute zero. According to the regulations, ships that emit less carbon gain “surplus units,” while ships that exceed the emission threshold “will have to acquire remedial units,” said the IMO. Operating companies can cover these remedial units by “Transferring surplus units from other ships;?Using surplus units they have already banked; [or] Using remedial units acquired through contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund.”

In effect, the IMO regulation would take the “cap-and-trade” scheme used to limit industrial pollutants and apply it to emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas necessary for all plant life on earth. For carbon emissions above this cap, the IMO would collect what is effectively a carbon tax, to be held in a green energy fund and used on unspecified projects.

“This is the first instance we can find of the U.N. claiming the ability to levy a tax — the revenues from which will be paid directly into a U.N.-controlled fund,” wrote The Wall Street Journal editors. “That’s bad enough as an invitation to opaque special dealing and corruption. But the IMO also contemplates using the funds for ‘just-transition initiatives in developing countries’ and to ‘mitigate negative impacts’ of climate change on ‘vulnerable States.’ In other words, this is another income redistribution scheme for whatever ideas the U.N. bureaucracy deems worthy.”

The regulations would impose a two-tier tax of either $100 or $380 (depending on certain factors) per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions, resulting in an estimated $10 billion to $12 billion collected from shipping companies. By 2035, “a mid-size carrier relying exclusively on very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) … could face more than $1.5 million in additional annual expenses, or 17 to 20% of fuel costs,” according to researchers at Columbia University.

The carbon tax aims to nudge the shipping industry away from fossil fuels by making it so expensive to run fossil fuels that ships powered by non-carbon alternatives become economically viable. Currently, the leading non-carbon alternatives include green ammonia (which is two to four times as expensive as VLSFO), bio-methanol (5.7 times as expensive), and e-methanol (6.3 times as expensive).

Fuel is one of the primary cost inputs for maritime shipping, which accounts for approximately 90% of international trade. Such an increase in shipping costs could raise the cost of imported goods for Americans by up to 10%.

This is a significant impact for very little gain. Maritime shipping accounts for only 3% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, meaning that the IMO regulations will impose a huge burden on the global shipping industry, for only a marginal reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

The regulations would amend Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), which entered into force on October 2, 1983. Adopted in 2005, Annex VI limits emissions of harmful pollutants such as sulphur oxide, nitrous oxides, ozone-depleting substances, and particulate matter. In 2011, Annex VI was amended with energy efficiency requirements “aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”

While Annex VI of MARPOL does control air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, it does nothing so radical as phasing out fossil fuels. But that is exactly what the new regulations proposed by the MEPC would do.

For decades, U.N. agencies, including the IMO, have been pushing an anti-fossil fuel agenda based in climate ideology, but never to this extent. In 2018, the IMO published a strategy with the 2050 target of cutting in half the carbon emissions level of 2008. In 2023 — with the far-left Biden administration now steering U.S. policy — the IMO updated this strategy with an aspiration to eliminate carbon emissions entirely by the same date. However, this aspiration lacked the radical plan to achieve this goal through a U.N.-imposed carbon tax.

In April, the IMO was already counting its unhatched chickens with a detailed timeline: the new regulations would be officially adopted in October 2025, detailed implementation guidelines would be approved in the spring of 2026, and the regulations would enter into force in 2027, 16 months after adoption. But now, the Trump administration is trying to throw a last-minute wrench into that scheme.

Proponents for the IMO carbon tax form an unusual coalition of developed European nations and Pacific island nations. Low-lying Pacific nations are greatly concerned about rising sea levels, buy into the notion that this phenomenon is connected to manmade carbon emissions, and therefore seek to reduce those emissions to save their island homes.

Meanwhile, European nations have already implemented strict carbon emission standards at home, which puts them at a commercial disadvantage compared to other nations; they see this as an opportunity to level the playing field by imposing Europe-style carbon regulations on other nations. Thus, in a representative statement, Finland declared that the proposed IMO carbon tax would “even out the imbalance in international regulation of maritime emissions and level out the competitive environment, between the EU and the rest of the world.” After the Trump administration warned countries against voting for the plan, the European Union reaffirmed its support.

Perhaps surprisingly, the shipping industry has also endorsed the regulatory scheme. “Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations,” read a joint statement from industry and labor associations on October 9.

In other words, shipping companies would appreciate the convenience of having to meet only one global standard, instead of different regulations in different countries. Or at least the shipping companies operating under stricter standards would like their competitors to bear the same burden. As for the higher costs these regulations would impose on global shipping, this statement proves that the shipping industry expects to pass those higher costs on to consumers.

The statement was signed by most of the world’s shipping industry: the Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA), European Shipowners (ECSA), International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA), International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), and the World Shipping Council (WSC). The ASA represents approximately 50% of the world merchant fleet, ECSA represents 35%, and the ICS represents over 80%.

On October 10, the day after the industry endorsement, the Trump administration published a full broadside attack on the scheme. In a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy threatened “actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

“Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

“Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

“Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations “in favor of the NZF;

“Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

“Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.”

“This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world,” the statement declared. “The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous.”

The Trump administration had issued a similar, but less detailed, statement of opposition on August 12, arguing that the standards would “conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale. These standards would also preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where U.S. industry leads such as liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels.”

In comments submitted to the MEPC, the U.S. again argued that the proposed regulations irrationally penalized low-emission fossil fuels like LNG, as well as decrying the scheme’s excessive revenue accumulation in pursuit of ill-defined goals.

The U.S. is part of another unusual coalition in opposition to the regulations. The nations most opposed to the regulation are oil-producing countries, which includes many of America’s geopolitical adversaries. In the April vote, the 16 countries to oppose the regulations included Iran, Lebanon, Russia, Venezuela, and Yemen.

A coalition of six oil-producing nations submitted their own comment in opposition to the regulation, arguing that tax collection and the creation of a green energy fund is entirely outside of the scope of the MARPOL convention, and there is no prior precedent for a U.N. agency to require financial contributions for the non-compliance of private entities, rather than sovereign parties.

The final outcome remains unclear. The IMO usually operates based upon consensus, but the regulation vote may force it to a rare ballot vote, in which the resolution would need to carry a two-thirds majority to pass.

Thus, the regulation would require support by 72 out of the 108 member states who have ratified MARPOL Annex VI — but only if they all show up. At the April vote, only 79 nations had delegates present for the vote. Since 63 countries already voted for the regulation in April, the U.S. would either need a sizable majority of undecided countries to vote against, or it would need some countries to switch their votes. Reportedly, some countries are considering switching their votes, including Philippines, Turkey, Argentina, and Australia.

While the Trump administration threatens economic sanctions, Saudi Arabia is whipping its own votes against the measure with promises of economic opportunity and other sweeteners. Saudi Arabia may also have offered to pay the travel costs for representatives of countries not present in April, if they will vote against the measure. Such an energetic campaign suggest one thing: either way, the vote will be close.

Ironically, the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization appears poised to hold a rare vote of member countries on an issue without any popular buy-in at all. “Voters are showing their opposition to the net-zero climate agenda whenever they get the chance. But that isn’t stopping the United Nations,” wrote The Wall Street Journal editors. “Yes, this is the definition of taxation without representation. … It’s an attempt by climate-obsessed politicians to entrench their agenda before voters in democracies can kill it.”

The Albanese government is expected to reaffirm its support for the Net Zero Framework at a key vote this Friday during the International Maritime Organization summit in London.

The UN-backed plan, which Australia helped draft and endorsed in April, aims to slash emissions from the global shipping industry by introducing a carbon price and fuel standards starting in 2028.

The framework targets the 3 per cent of global emissions produced by international shipping, steering the sector away from polluting bunker fuel and toward cleaner, renewable alternatives.

But the Trump administration has launched a fierce campaign against the proposal, calling it a 'European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.'

The United States has abruptly withdrawn its delegation from the IMO negotiations, issuing a stern warning to member states over the proposed NZF.

In a fiery statement released on October 10, Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the U.S. would 'defeat' the plan and cautioned that 'fellow IMO members should be on notice'.

Rubio condemned the NZF as a threat to national sovereignty and economic stability, warning that countries backing the proposal could face serious consequences, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies.

'This framework is a direct assault on American sovereignty and economic interests,' Rubio said.

'It would cripple supply chains and punish American workers.'

He further argued that the NZF would impose a burdensome and unjust global tax regime, affecting not only the U.S. but all IMO member states.

'The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.' Rubio said.

Despite the pressure, Australia is expected to vote in favour of the NZF alongside China, Brazil, Britain, and the European Union.

One of the most vocal domestic supporters of the plan is billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest, whose company Fortescue has publicly backed the initiative.

'The global shipping sector has demonstrated what can be achieved through courage, conviction, and international cooperation,' Forrest said after the framework was endorsed in April.

Supporters argue the NZF is a critical step toward decarbonising a sector long exempt from climate rules.

By setting a global carbon price, the IMO hopes to create a level playing field and drive investment in green shipping technologies.

Forrest has a major financial stake in the proposal's success, with interests in green ammonia, a fuel alternative for ships.

However, his broader green hydrogen ambitions have faced major setbacks.

Fortescue scrapped projects in Queensland and Arizona, prompting the Queensland government to seek repayment of nearly $66million in public funding.

The company also laid off hundreds of staff and merged its energy division with mining operations.

The diplomatic clash comes just days before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is due to meet President Trump in Washington, setting the stage for a potentially frosty encounter between the two leaders.

When asked to clarify its position, a spokesperson for the Albanese Government did not confirm a definitive stance.

'The Australian Government is committed to reducing emissions in the transport sector as part of our economy-wide goal of reaching net zero by 2050. We will continue to play a constructive role in advancing this important global effort,' the spokesperson told Daily Mail.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/16/02/103028801-0-image-a-44_1760578821298.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:56:17.904138

The barn doesn’t look like much yet. The white exterior still bears the name of its former owners, the Atwaters, who once packed it with seed potatoes. The dusty interior has been stripped down enough to reveal a timber frame that dates, in part, to the 18th century. In the early days of summer, just shy of the Vermont border in Salem, New York, there’s little more inside than roosting pigeons and 6,000 square feet of empty ground on which to build. But two years from now — or sooner, if Russell Wallack has his way — this will become the largest chestnut processing facility in the country. Get the details at ambrook.com

This could include sanctions against countries seeking to enforce the tax if it comes into force.
Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and other cabinet members issued a statement warning that the impact could be “disastrous” for shipping costs ultimately borne by consumers.
“This will be the first time that a UN organisation levies a global carbon tax on the world,” Rubio said.
It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions.","American officials say consumers will be the losers and China, as the world’s largest ship-building nation, will benefit as the tax forces the replacement of seaworthy vessels. With ship emissions representing 3 per cent of harmful global gases, environmental campaigners say the move would be a big win for climate, public health and marine life.

“Being taxed by the UN would be far more offensive than the taxes imposed by Great Britain against the American colonies more than 250 years ago. Those taxes sparked the American Revolution,” said Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, warning of a blow to the state’s maritime industry. “No taxation without representation,” he added.

The US delegate to the talks at IMO headquarters in London warned that the net-zero framework (NZF) was of concern “at the highest levels” of the Trump administration and it would “not hesitate to protect the American people and their economic interests” if the deal receives the two-thirds majority of the 176-member body required to pass. This could include sanctions against countries seeking to enforce the tax if it comes into force.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and other cabinet members issued a statement warning that the impact could be “disastrous” for shipping costs ultimately borne by consumers. They threatened “commercial penalties … on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF” including “additional port fees on ships owned, operated or flagged by countries” supporting the framework.

“This will be the first time that a UN organisation levies a global carbon tax on the world,” Rubio said.

“The administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers or tourists.”

“The net-zero framework proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.”

Vern Buchanan, a Republican congressman from Florida and vice-chairman of the House of Representatives ways and means committee, said the proposal “raises serious concerns not only about the inflationary nature of the framework but also about its potential to distort global trade … and exacerbate foreign industrial advantages, particularly for China.”

In the global tussle for supremacy between Washington and Beijing, “incentivising the premature retirement of seaworthy ships and driving demand for new construction … would disproportionately benefit China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, further entrenching its dominance in a sector that is vital to US strategic national security interests,” he said.

The framework aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships over 5,000 gross tonnes to net zero by 2050 using mandatory emissions caps and a global carbon-pricing system requiring the purchase of credits for exceeding the limits.

The IMO’s marine environment protection committee passed a draft of the tax in April by 63 votes to 16, with 24 abstaining including several small Pacific island states that said the measure was too weak.

Some are now expected to swing behind on Friday but there are signs the US pressure campaign is changing minds: Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, said it would abstain. “Like the United States, we think there should be a deferral,” he said. “We will not vote against it because we remain strong climate advocates, but this proposal could significantly increase living costs.”

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO secretary-general, urged nations to vote for the plan or face a patchwork of competing schemes that would eventually cost the industry more. “Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in the IMO, your organisation,” he said. “The energy and digital transition of shipping has already begun. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long term.”

Rosie Seville, Britain’s permanent representative to the IMO, reposted a statement by the International Chamber of Shipping on LinkedIn declaring that the NZF was “a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net-zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field”.

Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “The IMO’s net-zero framework is far from perfect — lacking ambition, proper safeguards against the uptake on unsustainable fuels and failing to provide the levels of guaranteed finance needed for a just and equitable shipping energy transition — but it is a vital step forward by the IMO. It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions. What has been missing — until now — is a plan that countries could agree on. This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally binding climate action is possible — now.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fc5c8e990-4624-4eb2-b3bd-803fd2ae7141.jpg?crop=7952%2C4473%2C0%2C828&resize=1200,N,,2025-10-15 20:56:07.866497

The project, which was first revealed last year, reports that GTT, known for its containment systems and Bloom Energy will lead a joint innovation project to develop an integrated energy system to cover the vessel’s energy needs related to onboard consumption.

“This partnership is a key milestone in developing innovative and efficient ways to capture CO2 and embodies our commitment to finding new solutions to decarbonizing the maritime industry,” said Mathieu Petiteau, Newbuilding and R&D Director of Ponant Explorations Group. “It also marks another step forward for our Swap2Zero vessel project, co-funded by the European Union Innovation Fund and France 2030.”

The Swap2Zero Project was unveiled in 2023 with the goal of developing the first transoceanic ship aimed at carbon neutrality. The concept, which is being designed by firms LMG Marin and Stirling Design, envisions an 181-meter (594-foot) cruise ship with approximately 100 passenger cabins that would use 50 percent wind energy. They project a speed of 10 knots and total autonomy for an endurance of up to 30 days. It would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80 percent. Bureau Veritas is also participating in the project.

In addition to an optimized hull design, the vessel would have more than 1,000 square meters of photovoltaic panels. A low-temperature hydrogen fuel cell with be dedicated to propulsion with recycling of the water and heat produced. A high-temperature fuel cell would be dedicated to the needs of the ship’s hotel and also use heat recovery for hot water production.

In the joint innovation project, GTT will design and develop a marine carbon capture system compatible with Bloom Energy’s SOFC technology. According to the companies, the integrated solution will supply auxiliary electricity for the vessel, covering the hotel load for lights, hot water, and onboard services while capturing CO2 from the exhaust gases. The dual approach, combining emission reduction and the reuse of low-temperature energy from the ship’s cryogenic installations, they report, will further enhance the overall efficiency of the SOFC system through optimized thermal management.

“We see solid oxide fuel cells as a cornerstone of the maritime industry's low-carbon future,” said Aman Joshi, Chief Commercial Officer of Bloom Energy. “By integrating fuel cells with onboard carbon capture and sequestration, this initiative exemplifies how innovation and collaboration can accelerate the transition to cleaner, more sustainable shipping.”

The project was awarded a €40 million grant in 2024 from the EU to develop the designs that would contribute to the decarbonization of the maritime sector. They have said the project will serve as a catalyst for new energy solutions.

Buchanan and Blazer frame the vote as a test of “leadership and resolve,” warning that accepting the “unaccountable global tax” would “open the door to further encroachments on our sovereignty and weaken our ability to compete with China.”

They argue that the NZF’s carbon pricing framework, which penalizes vessels based on emissions, would incentivize the premature retirement of ships and drive demand for new construction, disproportionately benefiting China, the world’s largest shipbuilder.

Threat of Retaliation against IMO Members

The IMO Council advanced the global carbon pricing framework proposal in April with a 63 to 16 vote. Next week, IMO members are scheduled to vote on the final adoption of the NZF, which would be the first time a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

The US State Department has explicitly stated it “will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens” and is considering a range of retaliatory actions against nations that support the “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

Potential measures include:

Port Restrictions: Pursuing investigations, regulations to combat anti-competitive practices, and potentially blocking vessels from supporting nations from U.S. ports.

Commercial Penalties: Imposing financial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts, including new commercial ships, LNG terminals, and infrastructure.

Visa Restrictions: Imposing increased fees, mandatory re-interview requirements, and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

Additional Fees: Imposing new port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework.

Sanctions: Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring “activist-driven climate policies” that burden American consumers.

In June, Congressman Buchanan wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, urging him to treat the proposed tax as a continuation of the non-market tactics identified in the Section 301 investigation into China’s shipbuilding sector.

Once approved, the framework would establish the first global carbon pricing system in any industry.

Members of the IMO voted to approve the framework initially in April, agreeing to charge shipping companies for greenhouse gas emissions released by their vessels if they exceed a certain threshold.

The fee is intended to accelerate a transition to the use of cleaner fuels, such as biofuels.

Under the framework, shipowners who exceed certain thresholds would face a minimum tax of $100 for every ton of carbon dioxide emitted over the lowest baseline. Those that exceed higher thresholds will be forced to pay a $380 fee.

If adopted, the carbon tax would not go into effect until 2028, giving countries more than two years to decide how and if they would like to implement the rules.

Environmentalists and climate activists have lauded the international tax as a major win for lowering global carbon emissions. It is expected to raise upward of $40 billion by 2030 and reduce emissions by 8% in the same time frame.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez admitted Tuesday that the framework in its current form “is not perfect,” but insisted it sets a number of goal-based provisions critical for decarbonizing the shipping industry.

Possible impact on the US

The U.S. has adamantly opposed the net-zero framework, claiming that it “poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties.”

Some analysts and economists have warned that the framework would force shipping companies to incur higher costs by switching to cleaner fuels, costs that would likely trickle down to consumers.

Meanwhile, others in the renewable fuels industry have said the framework would help boost the U.S. economy through increased production of American-made renewable fuels such as ethanol produced from corn, sorghum, and soybeans.

The U.S. only has a small share of worldwide commercial shipping, roughly 0.57%, but effects of the framework may not be limited to just that sector, warned Paul Mueller, a senior research fellow with the American Institute for Economic Research.

“It’s not just about the cost of bringing clothes or iPhones or things from China, consumer goods, but it will also affect the transportation of rare earth metals, and car batteries, and steel, and even inputs into all kinds of production processes,” Mueller told the Washington Examiner.

Even if the U.S. were to decide not to enforce the international tax, experts have warned, it would be difficult for the U.S. to evade, given its central position in global trade.

The framework also permits those who have signed on to it to inspect and detain noncompliant foreign vessels.

The Trump administration’s efforts to block the net-zero framework is the latest push from the U.S. to strengthen its hold on international debate over climate change. Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration has urged Europe and other allies to walk back climate change-related policies and regulations.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REJECTS ‘NET-ZERO’ PLAN AND CARBON TAX FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING

Most recently, Trump and his Cabinet members called on the European Union to weaken rules such as its deforestation ban and the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, claiming that the regulations would negatively affect trade with the U.S.

If the EU and other member states of the IMO prevail in approving the net-zero framework this week, it will mark a major win for those still advocating international climate diplomacy and send a signal that many will resist pressure from the Trump administration.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP22160749148711.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-15 18:02:49.078783

DOE Moves to Terminate Grant Funding for Clean Energy Projects: Last week, a list purporting to reflect proposed grant funding terminations by the Department of Energy (DOE) circulated through the clean-energy industry. The list included over 600 clean energy grants totaling more than $20 billion, including projects funded under the Biden administration’s initiatives, such as hydrogen hubs and direct air capture facilities. Initial cuts appeared to target predominantly Democratic-led states, but the expanded list reportedly includes significant projects in Republican-majority areas, including hydrogen hubs and carbon-capture programs backed by GOP lawmakers. DOE officials have not confirmed the authenticity of the list but noted that some projects are currently under “individualized” review.

IRS Modifies Tax Brackets and Sets Inflations Adjustments: On Oct. 9, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Revenue Procedure 2025-32, which adjusts the 2026 income tax brackets for inflation as well as changes enacted in the OBBBA. While the tax rates remain unchanged, ranging from 10% to 37%, the income thresholds for each bracket increased, which allows taxpayers to earn more before being subject to higher marginal tax rates. The standard deduction also increased to $16,100 for single filers and $32,200 for married couples filing jointly. The Revenue Procedure also adjusted a range of other provisions as required annually under current law.

EU Countries Weigh Extension of U.S. Carve-Out to Global Minimum Tax: Last week, Ioanna Mitroyanni, the European Commission’s deputy head of unit for company tax initiatives, spoke at a conference in Lisbon about the ongoing debates on the global minimum tax agreement. She noted that countries have yet to decide whether universal eligibility criteria for the “side-by-side” system proposed by the Trump administration will be developed or if the system will apply exclusively to U.S.-headquartered companies. Mitroyanni discussed the continuing negotiations over carve-outs for U.S. companies and emphasized the potential challenges of extending exemptions to other countries. Treasury Department officials continue to aim for the adoption of a side-by-side system to address the United States’ concerns with the global minimum tax by the end of the year.

Rubio, Wright and Duffy Issue Statement on the IMO Net-Zero Framework: In a joint statement on Oct. 10, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy announced the United States’ unequivocal opposition to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF). The NZF aims to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping by introducing a global carbon tax on shipping. They emphasized that the Trump administration rejects any international environmental agreement that unfairly burdens the U.S. economy and warned that the NZF could increase global shipping costs by 10% or more, adversely affecting American consumers, energy providers, shipping companies and tourists. The joint statement also outlined potential retaliatory measures against countries supporting the NZF, including port restrictions on vessels, visa limitations and increased fees for foreign maritime crews, commercial penalties related to U.S. government contracts, additional port fees, and sanctions targeting officials and organizations advancing the proposal.

OECD Reviews Transfer Pricing Guidelines: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is reviewing its Transfer Pricing Guidelines to clarify and simplify existing rules in order to minimize disputes and mutual agreement procedures (MAP) between tax authorities. The review will focus on improving methods for determining comparable ranges, applying comparability adjustments, segmenting business units or regions, and intra-group services. The OECD also intends to develop guidance on pricing high value-added services, such as cloud computing. A consultation document outlining the proposed changes is expected by spring 2026.

CBO Estimates $453 Billion Drop in Corporate Tax Revenue Post-OBBBA: On Oct. 8, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its “Monthly Budget Review: September 2025,” estimating a federal budget deficit of $1.8 trillion for fiscal year 2025. The report noted that corporate income tax receipts fell by $77 billion, or 15%, from $530 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $453 billion in fiscal year 2025. According to the CBO, the decline primarily reflected provisions in OBBBA that expanded deductions for certain investments, along with timing shifts that moved some corporate tax payments from fiscal year 2023 into fiscal year 2024. Overall, total revenues rose 6%, supported by increases in tariff revenue and individual income and payroll taxes.

Court Finds IRS Standards for 501(c)(4) Political Activity Unconstitutionally Vague: On Sept. 30, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Freedom Path, Inc. v. Internal Revenue Service that the IRS standards for determining whether a 501(c)(4) organization engaged in excessive political campaign activity are unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the IRS’ multi-factor, “facts and circumstances” test lacks clear definitions on how much political activity is permissible or what counts as political activity, resulting in inconsistent enforcement. While the court partly granted Freedom Path’s motion for summary judgment on this issue, it did not grant the organization tax-exempt status because neither party proposed a constitutionally sound alternative standard grounded in existing law. The court ordered both parties to submit new standards that are clear, constitutional and based on existing statutes and regulations. To read more about the ruling, see here for Brownstein’s analysis.

U.S. Deficit-to-GDP Ratio Declines: At the Federal Reserve Board Community Bank Conference on Oct. 9, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent highlighted that the U.S. deficit-to-GDP ratio has declined to under 6%, specifically to 5.9% for fiscal year 2025, down from 6.4% in 2024. Despite a roughly unchanged budget deficit of $1.8 trillion, driven by increased government spending and corporate tax cuts reducing revenue, heightened tariff revenues have helped offset the gap. Bessent emphasized his goal of further reducing the deficit ratio to the low-3% range by the end of Trump’s second term. He also noted tax code changes under OBBBA are expected to increase tax refunds for lower-income Americans in 2026, boosting real take-home pay for the bottom half of earners. Interest on federal debt surpassed $1 trillion yearly for the first time in 2025, representing a significant expenditure challenge.

IRS Issues Guidance on Remittance Tax Penalty Relief: On Oct.7, the IRS issued guidance for the 1% excise tax on remittance transfers in the OBBBA. Notice 2025-55 provides limited relief for the first, second and third calendar quarters of 2026, allowing providers to avoid penalties if they make timely deposits, even if calculated incorrectly, and pay any underpayment in full by the due date of the quarterly IRS Form 720 filing. Additionally, providers’ ability to use the deposit safe harbor rules under IRS excise tax procedural regulations will not be affected by deposit failures during this transition period, provided they meet the reasonable cause standard.

Maria Ogbugo calls for strong African Union leadership ahead of a critical IMO meeting, warning that the continent risks missing a vital opportunity to embed equity, climate justice, and fair transition principles into measures that will shape global shipping for decades to come.

As member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) head to London for an extraordinary session of the Marine Environmental Protection Committee, a coordinated African position on the decarbonisation of the shipping industry has never been more urgent.

The IMO’s Net Zero Framework was agreed in April 2025 after a contentious debate that culminated in a rare vote, illustrating the high political stakes of global maritime decarbonisation. After the political wranglings, it is expected to be formally endorsed at the extraordinary session. The Framework is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry through the introduction of a two-tier global fuel standard, and an emissions pricing and reward system for ships that use cleaner fuels. It will also establish an IMO Net-Zero Fund that will collect and redistribute revenues. Of the 37 African IMO member states, only 13 voted; the remaining 24 did not participate in the vote because they didn’t attend the meeting or didn’t pay their dues. Of the 13 that voted, five voted Yes, two voted No, and six abstained. This left observers to wonder whether the abstentions reflected a lack of interest or a form of quiet protest.

Several factors help explain this poor showing: many governments give a low priority to the maritime sector, there is a lack of funding for participation at the IMO, and some countries’ voting rights have been suspended for non-payment of dues.

More concerning than basic levels of participation, however, was the absence of coordination at the continental level. Without a common position, the African bloc lacked the negotiating strength that unity brings.

This lack of coordination has weakened Africa’s collective voice to align the IMO process with its own ambitious development agenda. This includes the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement, the revised African Maritime Transport Charter, the Africa Integrated Maritime Strategy, and the African Green Industrialisation Initiative. These initiatives aim to boost intra-African trade, develop resilient regional maritime value chains, and position Africa as a competitive force in global markets.

A report published last year by the Africa Policy Research Institute, LSE’s Firoz Lalji Institute for Africa, and the African Future Policies Hub provided some initial analysis on the impact of the NZF on African countries. On one hand, aligning with the NZF could help Africa leverage green shipping and energy transitions to drive green industrialisation, attract climate finance, and strengthen its global trade position. On the other hand, rising compliance and freight costs could undermine export competitiveness and exacerbate inequalities between countries with different levels of readiness.

It is therefore concerning that the African Union has not played a stronger coordinating role in shaping Africa’s position on maritime emissions reduction. It has proved leadership in the sphere of aviation, having recently successfully championed the continent’s interests at the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly, securing strong representation and pursuing a clear common agenda. There could be no better time for such leadership in the maritime space. In an era of geopolitical turbulence and declining multilateralism, Africa needs a steady hand to guide its 37 IMO member states through external risks.

Two issues are of particular concern: First, the US threats of retaliatory tariffs against IMO members that back the NZF. The US administrations has called the measures “a global carbon tax on Americans by an unaccountable UN organisation” and “which would benefit China”. Second, there is the risk that the EU’s unilateral measures aimed at reducing emissions from ships (the Emissions Trading System for shipping and the FuelEU Maritime regulation) may remain in place even after the NZF goes into force. If these overlapped with the NZF, the compounding compliance costs for international shipping will ultimately be passed on to African consumers.

Should the NZF be adopted this week, the next phase will involve developing detailed guidelines on critical aspects such as fuel lifecycle analysis and the operation of the Net Zero Fund. Another reason for coordination at the African Union Commission level is to ensure that African member states adopt a unified approach to implementing the NZF and mitigating its potential disproportionate impacts.

African countries would be better served if they agreed on shared priorities and advanced them collectively within the relevant working groups. Without such alignment, the continent risks missing a vital opportunity to embed equity, climate justice, and fair transition principles into the measures that will shape global shipping for decades to come.

In his seminal speech on African unity made at the inauguration of the Organisation of African Union in Addis Ababa in 1963, Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, argued that “Africa must unite or perish.” He cautioned against the continent remaining a loose collection of states with “mere charters” where weaker states are at the mercy of powerful non-African nations. He argued for an Africa that is united with a common purpose to move forward together in dealing with matters that affect us collectively. Africa must now connect the dots between the IMO Net Zero Framework and its common purpose. Under the coordination and leadership of the African Union Commission, Africa can and must unite to secure its collective interests in the global maritime transition.

The meeting, running from October 14–17, is expected to finalize a “Net-Zero Framework (NZF)” where ships would pay for emissions over a set limit, while vessels that meet tougher standards could trade or bank so-called “surplus units.”

The money collected would go into a fund supporting zero- and near-zero-emission fuels and technologies, particularly in the developing world and for island states.

Washington calls initiative “neocolonial”

But in a statement released Friday, the U.S. administration sharply condemned the proposal, calling it “a European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

The White House said the framework amounts to the UN levying “a global carbon tax” that would unfairly burden American consumers and businesses.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” said a joint statement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

Dive Brief:

Ocean rates fell to their lowest levels since late 2023, near the start of the Red Sea crisis, Freightos Head of Research Judah Levine wrote in an Oct. 15 Freightos weekly update.

Trade war-related frontloading and supply growth contributed to the pressure on Transpacific container prices, which fell 8% week over week, according to the report.

U.S. import volumes are lower than they’ve been since mid-2023 and are projected to continue falling through December, per Levine, placing a further drag on rates.

By the numbers: Ocean rates for Oct. 8-15

$1,431

The average rate per FEU from Asia to the U.S. West Coast, down 8% WoW

$3,015

The average rate per FEU from Asia to the U.S. East Coast, down 8% WoW

Dive Insight:

Ocean rates and import volumes are sinking amid a wave of turbulence for maritime shippers, including the implementation of U.S. fees on China-linked ships and some easing tensions in the Red Sea.

Red Sea crisis developments

Expectations are rising for a return of container traffic in the Red Sea as the first stage of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire unfolds, Levine said. After years of schedule disruptions and congestion due to the yearslong crisis in the waterway, the ceasefire is expected to release a wave of capacity back into the market.

Levine reported that some carriers have already begun ramping up services through the Suez Canal. However, many carriers are holding off until “after a significant period of demonstrated stability and security,” Levine wrote in the update.

U.S. port fees on China-linked vessels

The U.S. rolled out port call fees for China-linked vessels Tuesday, despite hopes the charges would be reduced or canceled due to reported progress in trade negotiations between the two countries, Levine said.

Some carriers have decided not to pass on the additional costs to customers. For example, A.P. Moller - Maersk is planning to prioritize cost avoidance while deploying China-built ships on other trade lanes, Anders Sonesson, head of contract product management for North America, said in September. Meanwhile, China-based carrier Cosco has assured customers not to expect service disruptions or surcharges, Levine reported last week.

Due to such actions, the fees may have limited impact on eastbound Transpacific freight rates, operations or capacity, Levine said.

China also began charging port fees for U.S. ships Tuesday as a countermeasure to the U.S. ship tax, China’s Transport Ministry announced Oct. 14.

The country’s fees would impact about 5% of port calls, and impacted carriers will likely adjust vessel networks to lessen exposure, Levine said, citing data from Clarksons Research.

Other sanctions

On Friday, the U.S. also threatened to impose penalties on countries that vote in favor of the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework — a global tax to slash carbon emissions in the ocean shipping industry. Some of the potential actions include imposing visa restrictions for crew members and additional port fees on ships owned, operated or flagged by NZF-supporting countries.

Meanwhile, the U.S. also plans to charge 100% tariffs on China-linked ship-to-shore cranes and cargo handling equipment starting Nov. 9, per a notice from the U.S. Trade Representative.

For shipping - a sector responsible for moving 90% of global trade - the clock is ticking loudly.

This week’s meeting at the IMO, aptly titled “Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)” will likely adopt the widely anticipated GFI (Greenhouse Fuel Index), ensuring clarity and alignment of parties. But it still won’t be enough.

Before combustion engines were invented, shipping was a great example of zero carbon technology. For the past 100 years, however, shipping has relied on fossil fuels and, over time, ended up being responsible for some 3% of the world’s total global greenhouse gas emissions.

Alternative fuels like ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen are often framed as the future of clean shipping and will undoubtedly play an important role. But these fuels are costly and not always readily available. Wind, an abundant element, is the key to driving decarbonization.

Wind propulsion is as practical as it is scalable. Wind can reduce fuel consumption and emissions between 5-25% - and in good weather conditions, for up to 70%. This isn’t a hypothetical prediction; these results are verified, repeatable, and achievable across a range of vessels, as demonstrated across the world’s biggest trade routes.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework provides a unique opportunity to embed wind propulsion in regulatory and incentive mechanisms. The International Wind Shipping Association (IWSA) calls for consistent and equitable treatment of wind propulsion within its proposed framework.

Based on the best data from our experts’ projections, Energy Cost-Emissions Curve’ measurement tool (below) shows that while adopting alternative fuel types mean lower carbon emissions, they also result in higher energy costs. As pioneers in wind propulsion technology, we know this too well. With 35 sails built and installed and 48 on order now, we see wind propulsion as the only solution that achieves both low energy costs and high GFI improvement potential.

Recognition of wind propulsion as a cornerstone technology by the IMO would accelerate adoption, ensure better overall compliance, deliver long-term investment in sustainability and most importantly, significantly reduce emissions.

Momentum is already building, with wind propulsion technologies now increasingly recognized by shipowners and operators as a proven, class-approved technology, operating successfully across global fleets.

As the MEPC convenes, decision-makers must acknowledge that the winds of change are not theoretical: they are measurable, reliable, and ready to scale.

The Editorial Board warns that these costs could increase global shipping costs by as much as 10%, directly impacting American households through higher prices on imported goods.
Unlike traditional U.N. funding, where roughly 90% of revenue comes from governments accountable to their own taxpayers, this carbon tax would be “paid by ship owners directly into a new ‘Net Zero Fund’ created by the agency,” managed by IMO staff.
Despite the U.S. opposition, the framework has received backing from the European Union, which views it as “a significant milestone” and calls for its adoption.
Major shipping industry associations, representing over 80% of the world merchant fleet, have also endorsed the package, arguing that “only global rules will decarbonise a global industry.”","As the International Maritime Organization convenes this week to vote on its Net-Zero Framework, the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board has issued a sharp rebuke of what it characterizes as a global carbon tax that bypasses democratic accountability.

In an opinion piece published today, the Editorial Board argues that the IMO’s proposed framework represents “the ultimate in taxation without representation,” noting that “this is the first instance we can find of the U.N. claiming the ability to levy a tax—the revenues from which will be paid directly into a U.N.-controlled fund.”

The framework would impose charges of $100 or $380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide that ships emit above certain limits, potentially generating $10 billion to $12 billion annually in revenue. The Editorial Board warns that these costs could increase global shipping costs by as much as 10%, directly impacting American households through higher prices on imported goods.

Unlike traditional U.N. funding, where roughly 90% of revenue comes from governments accountable to their own taxpayers, this carbon tax would be “paid by ship owners directly into a new ‘Net Zero Fund’ created by the agency,” managed by IMO staff. The Editorial Board notes that beyond supporting green shipping innovation, the IMO also plans to use funds for “just-transition initiatives in developing countries” and to “mitigate negative impacts” of climate change on “vulnerable States.”

“In other words, this is another income redistribution scheme for whatever ideas the U.N. bureaucracy deems worthy,” the Editorial Board states.

The opinion piece raises concerns about governance, questioning how tax rate increases would be decided by a “170-plus member ‘committee’ under the aegis of the IMO,” with the Editorial Board noting that voters in “Boston, Berlin or Bangkok” would have little ability to influence such decisions.

The Editorial Board suggests that Western governments’ support for the IMO plan reflects an attempt “by climate-obsessed politicians to entrench their agenda before voters in democracies can kill it,” citing growing voter opposition to net-zero climate policies across the U.S. and Europe.

The Trump Administration has threatened sanctions against countries voting in favor of the measure. The Editorial Board concludes that “President Trump will do Americans and the entire democratic world a favor if he can scare the IMO into thinking twice about this global carbon-tax plan.”

The IMO’s Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC E.2) is meeting in London from October 14-17 to consider formal adoption of the Net-Zero Framework. If adopted, the framework would likely enter into force in 2027, becoming mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which collectively emit 85% of total CO2 emissions from international shipping.

Despite the U.S. opposition, the framework has received backing from the European Union, which views it as “a significant milestone” and calls for its adoption.

Speaking to state media, Browne explained that while the government supports the overall goal of achieving carbon neutrality, the current proposal could impose steep costs that would ultimately raise the cost of living for ordinary citizens.

“Like the United States, we are equally concerned about this transition,” Browne said. “We think that there should be a deferral, and if there is no deferral, then we will clearly abstain. We will not vote against it, because at the end of the day, we remain one of the most strident climate advocates. But this particular initiative could result in significant shipping costs, which in turn would increase the cost of living and it’s from that standpoint that we are likely to abstain.”

The prime minister emphasized that Antigua and Barbuda’s position is based on national interest, not external pressure.

“We certainly cannot support the initiative at this time,” he stated, underscoring that the decision reflects the country’s independent, sovereign judgment.

Browne also noted that while Antigua and Barbuda remains a leading voice in global climate advocacy, practical realities must be considered. “We are committed to the net-zero transition,” he said, “but the pace and structure of implementation must not disproportionately harm small island economies.”

According to the IMO, the proposed Net-Zero Framework represents a major step toward a legally binding global system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, targeting net-zero emissions by or around 2050.

The plan, approved during the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s 83rd session in April 2025, introduces mandatory emissions caps and a global carbon pricing mechanism for ships over 5,000 gross tonnage vessels responsible for roughly 85 percent of global maritime CO₂ emissions.

Formal adoption of the IMO measures is expected later this month, with implementation slated for 2027.

Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore (BV) has entered into a contract with Turkey’s Gelibolu Shipyard and Germany’s eCap Marine covering the classification of two hydrogen-powered cargo vessels, with options for two more. To be built for Norwegian shipowner Møre Sjø AS, they will be the first general cargo ships in BV class to use hydrogen propulsion.

According to ship designer Naval Dynamics, the vessels are NDAS EcoFlex 4.0K fuel cell coastal bulkers and will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells operating on compressed hydrogen.

Designed with the integration of a high-pressure hydrogen power system, a battery pack and electric propulsion, the vessels will measure 88.7 meters in length and 14.2 meters in breadth, with a maximum draft of six meters and an estimated gross tonnage of 3,750. The vessels are designed to transport heavy and occasional dry bulk cargoes under the Norwegian flag.

On delivery from the yard, the vessels are being designed to meet the requirements for BV’s HYDROGENFUEL-PREPARED notation.

The hydrogen power system is currently being designed by eCap Marine, which will also be responsible for its installation, commissioning, and the execution of the Alternative Design Approval process. BV will be closely involved throughout the review and approval process to help ensure the safe and reliable integration of the system. Once completed, the vessels will be eligible to be assigned the HYDROGENFUEL notation.

In addition to their alternative fuel capability, the vessels are intended to be classed with a comprehensive scope including Cyber Resilient, Unrestricted Navigation, AUT-UMS, In-Water Survey and OPS (On-shore power system) notations. These standards will help ensure the vessels meet the requirements for safety, performance and operational flexibility while being able to run as zero-emission vessels.

Matthieu de Tugny, executive vice president,i ndustrials and commodities at Bureau Veritas, said: “This project marks an important step in advancing hydrogen as an alternative fuel for general cargo shipping. By working together with Gelibolu Shipyard, eCap Marine and Møre Sjø AS, we are helping to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of new technologies, combining efficiency with readiness for future fuels.

Shipping stands at a decisive moment. With the International Maritime Organization targeting a 20–30% cut in emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050, owners face one of the most uncertain investment periods in maritime history. According to DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050, 93% of the global fleet still runs on fossil fuels, while most new orders are designed with built-in fuel flexibility to hedge against regulatory and market uncertainty. The transition has clearly begun, but the shift remains slow and uneven.

DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) database shows that 84% of vessels on order still rely on conventional fuels, while just 16% are alternative-fuel capable. On this backdrop, we will look at the three candidates that dominate the discussion as the fuels of the future.

LNG: the transitional fuel

Liquefied natural gas remains the most established alternative fuel, supported by a mature bunkering network and immediate cuts in sulphur, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. AFI data confirms LNG’s dominance among dual-fuel orders through the late 2020s, reflecting its technical maturity.

But, in the long-term, LNG’s role in decarbonisation seems to be transitional. Its reliance on fossil gas and its methane slip, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than CO₂, weakens its long-term credibility. Economically, LNG engines require higher upfront costs, and as the EU’s carbon pricing expands, operators risk stranded assets. LNG offers compliance and flexibility today but not a lasting solution.

Methanol: liners early frontrunner

Methanol has rapidly emerged as the frontrunner among alternative fuels, driven by the liner sector’s commitment. Maersk, CMA CGM, and COSCO have all invested heavily in methanol-capable fleets. According to DNV’s AFI database, methanol-fuelled vessels now account for about 5% of all ships on order, with roughly 240 of them being container vessels.

Its appeal lies in practicality. Methanol is liquid at ambient temperature, easier to handle, and compatible with existing bunkering systems. Yet most methanol available today is fossil-based, and green methanol remains expensive and scarce. High production costs and limited supply make it viable mainly for liners with long-term fuel contracts, not for tramp shipping. Methanol is the industry’s early leader, practical and scalable if renewable production expands, but far from the universal answer.

Ammonia: the long-term candidate

Ammonia offers perhaps the clearest zero-carbon promise. It produces no CO₂ when burned and can be made from green hydrogen and nitrogen from air. However, realistically it is still at an early stage. Only 0.5% of vessels on order are ammonia-capable, according to DNV’s AFI database, but it could be the first symbolic step toward wider adoption.

On the other hand, the obstacles and the challenges it provides are significant. Ammonia is toxic, corrosive, and requires entirely new safety and bunkering infrastructure. Costs remain high, and production is still limited. Realistically, ammonia will become relevant after 2035, once hydrogen projects scale and port infrastructure matures. For now, it’s a long-term candidate, and not a commercial solution.

Efficiency and flexibility

When comparing LNG, methanol, and ammonia, one conclusion stands out: there is no single winning fuel yet. DNV’s forecast points to efficiency as the only large-scale, proven path to decarbonization this decade. Operational and technical measures alone could cut emissions by 4–16% by 2030, an equivalent to 120m tonnes of CO₂, making efficiency the cheapest per ton of carbon reduction available.

Looking ahead, shipping’s cost per ton-mile could rise 69–112% by 2050 as new fuels and compliance measures reshape economics. Owners who invest early in energy-saving technology, dual-fuel flexibility, and fuel-ready designs will be best positioned to adapt as the fuel landscape evolves.

Today’s winning strategy is not gambling on one fuel, but maximising efficiency, while designing with flexibility in mind for tomorrow. Companies best positioned to benefit from this transition will be those who act now to reduce emissions and strategically prepare for whichever fuel dominates the industry in the decades to come.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dual-Fuel-LNG-Tanker-WindWings-BAR-Technologies-Union-Maritime.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 16:01:22.080359

She also made clear that the EU will want to see the IMO system in practice, in particular, how compliance and enforcement work out.
These will provide the European Commission with the opportunity to outline its views on how the EU and IMO systems can be aligned.
The EU supports the IMO NZF, but it has its own demanding legislative requirements and a strong desire to retain regulatory control.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is set to adopt its Net Zero Framework (NZF) for the decarbonisation of the shipping industry at this week's emergency meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).

The MEPC approved this NZF in April this year. If approval is achieved this week, then the necessary implementation details will be drafted and agreed over the next two to three years, with the first reporting year under the NZF being 2028.

The challenges of implementation are substantial.

The document setting out the NZF is not a complete regulatory text; it is a framework. The IMO Secretariat has identified over twenty different work streams where guidance, guidelines, or amendments to existing regulations are needed to implement the NZF.

These details apply to the most critical elements of NZF, such as the pricing mechanism or the Net-

Zero Fund, and the possible rewards for the use of zero-to-near-zero emissions fuels, all of which are to be developed and approved by late 2026.

Work on developing the framework has been ongoing since April and will continue in Inter-Sessional Working Groups at the IMO from next week. But a big question about the implementation of the IMO NZF is: what is the EU going to do?

The IMO's Framework will overlap with the EU's Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS).

From January 2024, the EU-ETS has applied to maritime carbon emissions, with 2025 being the first year of payments into the system. The EU-ETS applies to 100% of emissions for voyages between EU ports and 50% of the emissions for voyages that start or end in the EU.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Domínguez and a wide range of IMO member states and other stakeholders have warned that shipping needs a single global framework.

Different regional or national regimes will lead to fragmentation in decarbonisation efforts and increase costs for the maritime industry, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers. The solution, according to many, is for the EU to adapt its maritime fuel policies to the IMO's or somehow merge the EU ETS into the IMO NZF.

Further, many stakeholders say this needs to be done quickly to minimise reporting burdens.

However, reforming EU law is not a quick process, as it must be carried out in line with the EU's political and legal processes. Many of the calls for quick action seem to overlook this, expecting the EU to change things right away or assuming it is easy for the EU to give the IMO system precedence.

Neither is an accurate way of looking at how matters are likely to proceed.

Both the EU-ETS (Article 3ggg) and FuelEU Maritime (Article 30) have triggers for when the IMO adopts the NZF. Once the measures are adopted, the Commission is required, within 18 months, to ""present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council"".

This report needs to examine how the IMO system contributes to the objectives of the Paris Agreement; assess the ""overall environmental integrity"" of the measures; and examine the coherence of the two systems.

Likely, the EU is already working on this, and a report can be completed in under 18 months. That is just the start.

If the report contains proposals to remove maritime from the EU ETS, that would be a significant step requiring changes to existing legislation.

That means the Commission will need to engage the Council and Parliament in drawing up the proposals for reform, have a public consultation, and then go through the legislative process with the Council and the Parliament.

The EU statement this week, issued by the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport, only reiterates that the EU will be reviewing the situation; that is all for now.

In an interview earlier this year, Magda Kopczyńska, Director-General for Mobility and Transport at the European Commission, made clear that if the IMO adopts the NZF this October, the EU will only be considering what to do next, as the EU's legal obligations only extend to ""looking into the matter"".

Kopczyńska explained that the EU will need to see what the entirety of the NZF looks like, which includes the twenty-plus guidelines and guidance to be adopted by the IMO over the next two years. She also made clear that the EU will want to see the IMO system in practice, in particular, how compliance and enforcement work out.

As the EU-ETS is viewed as a cornerstone of the EU's climate ambitions, it is difficult to see the Commission accepting that another organisation has created a more effective system for decarbonising a hard-to-abate industry without extensive evidence from practice.

Plus, there will also be resistance from Member States about limiting the intake of funds under the EU-ETS, as EU-ETS funds are shared among all Member States, not just maritime states, and can be used for climate action more broadly.

Funds from the IMO NZF are for support in areas specific to shipping.

Hopefully, the NZF will be adopted this week. But that only creates an initial hurdle for the EU to determine - when will the IMO's Framework be a completed piece of regulation?

On the IMO's workplan for the NZF, all the guidelines should be adopted by the end of 2026, the NZF will enter into force on 1 March 2027, with the first year of reporting and fund collection being 2028.

During 2028, matters such as finalising certification systems and the appointment of the governing board for the Net-Zero Fund will occur. If all that goes to plan, 2029 could be the first year of disbursements from the framework; this is yet to be decided.

Ensuring the NZF is working may not be completely clear after two years of operations.

The EU requires three years of implementation data before a review can be carried out of its own legislation. That means the maritime dimension of ETS may be subject to a review in 2027, and there is a review of FuelEU Maritime scheduled for December 2027.

These will provide the European Commission with the opportunity to outline its views on how the EU and IMO systems can be aligned. But again, this is just the start of the process, the EU will not just change its ETS system following IMO adoption of the NZF this week.

In the meantime, shipowners are going to have to get used to the idea of multiple regulatory and reporting systems. The UK and China are both moving forward on their versions of emissions trading systems applicable to shipping.

The EU can consider discounts, rebates, or other financial measures to minimise the impact on shipping from the different regulatory systems, but again, these will take time to develop.

The procedural and political complexities of the EU mean that it will not quickly align with the IMO's global Framework without question. The EU supports the IMO NZF, but it has its own demanding legislative requirements and a strong desire to retain regulatory control.

According to analysis by Matthias Pasche, a carbon advisor at Glander International Bunkering in Geneva, the system would apply two tiers of progressively tougher carbon-intensity targets to ships over 5,000 GT from 2028 to 2035, making 2028 the first year in which the industry pays for greenhouse-gas emissions globally.

Initial penalties are described as $380/mtCO2e for failing the higher base target thresholds and $100/mtCO2e for emissions above the lower direct compliance target.

Overcompliance beyond the direct target would generate surplus units that can be banked for up to two years or traded, while consuming energy below an initial carbon-intensity threshold of 19 gCO2e/MJ would earn rewards funded by penalties.

The base target threshold is set at 89.506 gCO2e/MJ in 2028, declining to 65.310 gCO2e/MJ by 2035; the direct compliance target moves from 77.439 gCO2e/MJ in 2028 to 53.181 gCO2e/MJ by 2035.

Pasche estimates that one tonne of VLSFO at a GHG intensity of about 91 gCO2e/MJ would incur about $72/mt in total IMO-framework costs in 2028, rising to about $450/mt by 2035, adding that “the cost of the regulation for shipowners will be limited at first but will quickly scale up.”

He argues the framework will change bunker supply: suppliers able to deliver fuels with lower verified GHG intensity should offer customers materially lower regulatory costs; sourcing strategies—particularly in biofuels where feedstocks drive intensity—will need redesign; and contracts will require explicit product mixes with stated GHG intensities and energy densities.

An active market is “likely to emerge” for trading surplus units between over- and under-compliant ships, with the bunker sector facilitating this, similar to EUA procurement under the EU-ETS and the pooling mechanism under FuelEU Maritime. From 2027, transparency of delivery is highlighted as critical.

If EU-ETS, FuelEU Maritime and the IMO framework all remain in force simultaneously, Pasche contends compliance costs could exceed the underlying price of conventional bunkers.

The cost of the regulation for shipowners will be limited at first but will quickly scale up as the years pass. One tonne of VLSFO consumption at a GHG intensity of about 91 gCO2e/MJ will cost about $72/mt in total IMO framework costs in 2028, but this will move up to about $450/mt by 2035.

For the bunker industry, the framework should deliver a profound shift in how it operates.

Every tonne of carbon will count. Suppliers that can deliver products with a lower GHG intensity than their competitors - and have that figure independently verified to the standards set by the regulation - will be able to provide their customers with significantly lower regulatory costs.

Sourcing strategy will need to be retooled to reflect this. In the biofuel market in particular, differences in feedstocks could deliver notable differences in GHG intensity and IMO costs.

Contracts will also need to be updated to reflect the new requirements. New contractual terms will be needed specifying exactly what mix of products the supplier is committing to deliver over the term of the agreement, and exactly what their GHG intensities and energy densities will be.

Finally, an active market is likely to emerge in the trading of surplus units between overcompliant and undercompliant ships.

As with EUA procurement for EU-ETS compliance and the pooling mechanism under FuelEU Maritime, the bunker industry will play a key role in facilitating the emergence of this market.

Transparency of delivery will be the watchword for marine fuel companies in the years from 2027 onwards.

If the EU-ETS, FuelEU Maritime and IMO framework regulations remain all in place at the same time, compliance costs with these regulations are likely to outweigh the underlying fuel price for conventional bunkers before long.

Our customers will be seeking trusted partners to help them guarantee a stable supply of all the fuel types they need, provide full visibility into the green credentials of their fuels and minimize regulatory costs.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_0489d7b0868be3b35ceaaf39f40343c1.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 13:00:41.091036

Foreign Affairs Minister Fred Mitchell said the government has already written to the IMO requesting that the vote be postponed, warning that if it goes ahead, The Bahamas will likely withhold support.

His comments follow a warning from the Trump administration, issued through the US Department of State, outlining five measures it plans to take against countries that vote in favour of the Net Zero Framework.

Torpoint Ferries (Tamar Crossings) – operational expertise and vessel access

University of Plymouth – performance data collection and analysis

The project gets underway as the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meets at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) headquarters in London to agree on incorporating the Net Zero Framework, which includes stronger global regulatory incentives to accelerate scalable zero-emission fuels and propulsion technologies.

Maritime Minister, Keir Mather, said:

“Our £300,000 investment into Torpoint Ferry will be transformational in the region as we chart a course to net zero shipping by 2050 and build a cleaner, greener future.

“This comes as part of our wider commitment to decarbonise shipping backed by a £448m investment to clean up sea travel whilst supporting jobs and boosting growth across the UK.”

Tim Munn, managing director at Marine Zero, said:

“With Torpoint, we’re proving that even the most demanding 24/7 maritime operations can transition to zero emissions. Our goal is to create solutions that are not just technically feasible, but financially viable and scalable – safeguarding a vital regional service whilst setting a global example for short sea shipping.”

Philip Robinson, Chief Officer, Tamar Crossings, added:

“We are proud to be leading this transformation. This work will safeguard our service for the next generation and support the South West’s growing clean maritime sector.

The union explained that this would allow for more time to reach a wider consensus ahead of its adoption at the MEPC ES.2 session from October 14 to 17.

According to the statement, the NZF poses “a serious threat to the European shipping, economy, and energy security,” while also representing “a grave danger to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)”, the backbone of European shipping.

It was described as “a multi-billion-euro tax that does not reduce emissions but instead shifts the cost to end-consumers, fuelling inflation across the European Union.”

The Union explained that the framework imposes exorbitant charges despite the lack of realistic technologies or infrastructure to ensure compliance. It relies on so-called “green” fuels, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, and synthetic LNG, which, as the Union noted, are not available at industrial scale and consume more renewable energy in production than they yield.

Rather than reducing emissions, it added, the framework diverts critical financial resources away from genuine technological and energy innovation, thereby slowing the transition to cleaner solutions.

At the same time, the Union described the NZF as “a fiscal measure with socially unjust consequences.”

Since shipping transports over 90 per cent of global trade, any additional cost imposed on ships will inevitably be passed on to the prices of goods and services, from food and medicines to raw materials and energy.

“The result will be broad-based price increases,” it said, “a higher cost of living and intensified inflation.”

Moreover, CUS referred to “a threat to fleet viability and the global supply chain.”

It said the NZF’s implementation would lead to a supply shortage at a time when there are no mature or scalable alternatives to fill the gap.

“As a result,” it noted, “the SMEs, being the backbone of EU shipping, will face competitive challenges resulting in a setback for the EU as a whole.”

Such an outcome, the Union added, “would entail a permanent strategic setback for Europe, resulting in the loss of its global maritime leadership.”

It continued that it would also mean “severe ecological damage,” since the premature dismantling and replacement of ships would generate massive waste and additional emissions.

CUS further warned of “destabilization of global supply chains”, with delays, product shortages and higher transport costs, as well as “accelerating inflation and loss of purchasing power throughout Europe and, by extension, globally.”

On Europe’s energy security, the Union stressed that the continent remains heavily dependent on LNG imports, which already reach Europe at more than double the US domestic price.

It mentioned that under the NZF, this cost is projected to rise further, leading to energy-price surges, further inflationary pressure and a deepening crisis with disproportionate effects on households and industry.

In addition, the statement reaffirmed that international shipping is “the most efficient and environmentally sustainable mode of transport.”

Through technological innovation, operational optimisation and continuous investment, it explained, the industry has achieved significant emission reductions, even as transport volumes have multiplied.

CUS also emphasised that shipping is a pillar of the Cypriot economy and a strategic sector for Europe as a whole.

“Cyprus, as a major maritime nation, must support the European consumer and the creation of a global and decarbonisation incentive scheme whose funds are re-invested amongst others in the shipping industry,” it stated.

At the same time, the Union called for rejecting “unfair, ineffective, and damaging multi-billion taxation schemes, whether regional or not, with no experience or clear procedures over how such funds are utilised.”

Finally, the Union stated that it “supports global policies of genuine environmental progress under the auspices of the IMO” and called upon the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and all EU Member States to vote against the current Net-Zero Framework to allow more time for consensus by major stakeholders.",https://cyprus-mail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shipping-ship-vessel-maritime-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 16:02:01.018224

We are actively planning to expand our low-carbon methanol supply to other shipping companies and major ports globally.","ChemAnalyst in Conversation with Rei Mizuki, Deputy Manager of Basic Raw Materials Chemicals Department at ITOCHU Corporation

The maritime sector is undergoing a transformative shift as global decarbonization targets push the industry toward cleaner, more sustainable fuel options. Among the emerging solutions, methanol stands out as a practical and scalable low-carbon alternative.

In this interview, ITOCHU discusses its vision, strategy, and technical approach to developing methanol as a key marine fuel, as well as how these efforts align with Japan’s carbon neutrality goals and IMO’s net-zero 2050 targets.

Q1: How is methanol as a fuel different from other green fuels like ammonia or hydrogen?

A: Methanol's key advantage is being a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, allowing the use of existing infrastructure for easier handling and bunkering. It is also a clean-burning fuel that significantly reduces SOx, NOx, and PM emissions. While ammonia and hydrogen have no CO2 emissions at combustion, they present their own challenges, such as the toxicity of ammonia and the cryogenic management and risk of metal embrittlement associated with hydrogen. Thus, we believe methanol can be a balanced and practical solution for near-term adoption.

Q2: How does ITOCHU plan to expand its role in the global marine fuel supply chain?

A: We will leverage our global network to build an integrated supply chain for alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia etc. Our plan is to establish bunkering hubs in major ports worldwide, expanding from production and procurement to final supply.

Q3: Can you quantify the GHG reduction achieved by using your biomass-derived methanol compared to conventional marine fuels?

A: Our biomass-derived methanol offers significant GHG reductions (more than 65%) on a Well-to-Wake (life-cycle) basis compared to conventional fuels. While the exact percentage varies by production pathway, it represents a substantial step towards decarbonization as we work towards certified figures.

Q4: How does this initiative contribute to Japan’s carbon neutrality targets by 2050 and the IMO’s decarbonization strategy?

A: This initiative is a tangible step towards achieving Japan's 2050 carbon neutrality goal and the IMO's net-zero 2050 strategy. By promoting the adoption of low-carbon fuels, we directly contribute to the decarbonization of the global shipping industry.

Q5: What technical challenges are involved in ship-to-ship bunkering for methanol compared to conventional fuels?

A: The main technical challenges for methanol bunkering involve managing its low flash point and toxicity. This requires strict safety protocols, including specialized equipment, leak detection systems, and thorough crew training to ensure safe operations.

Q6: What infrastructure change or retrofitting is required for dual-fuel carriers to use methanol efficiently?

A: Retrofitting ships for methanol use requires installing dedicated, corrosion-resistant fuel tanks and a new fuel supply system. Engine modifications are also necessary to create a dual-fuel capability, ensuring safe and efficient operation.

Q7: How scalable is the production and distribution of biomass-derived methanol to meet growing global shipping demand?

A: While not yet at full scale, bio-methanol production has significant growth potential by utilizing diverse feedstocks like agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and sustainable forestry products. We are expanding our feedstock sourcing globally and also developing e-methanol to meet future demand.

Q8: How do you see low-carbon methanol adoption impacting the competitiveness of Japanese shipping companies internationally?

A: Adopting low-carbon methanol enhances the international competitiveness of Japanese shipping companies by meeting stricter environmental regulations. It attracts eco-conscious cargo owners and strengthens their brand as sustainable leaders in the global market.

Q9: Are there plans to supply low-carbon methanol to other shipping companies or markets beyond NYK Line?

A: Yes, this is just the beginning. We are actively planning to expand our low-carbon methanol supply to other shipping companies and major ports globally. We are already in discussions with multiple potential partners to build a wider network.

Q10: How is ITOCHU working with regulatory bodies, such as the IMO or local governments, to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon fuels?

A: We actively collaborate with regulatory bodies like the IMO and local governments through industry associations. Our goal is to help develop international safety standards and port infrastructure to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon fuels.

Q11: Do you anticipate competition from other low-carbon marine fuels, and how is ITOCHU positioning itself amidst these alternatives?

A: We anticipate competition and are pursuing a multi-fuel strategy to meet diverse customer needs. We see methanol as a strong near-term solution due to its practicality, while also developing supply chains for future fuels like ammonia and hydrogen.

Q12: Beyond marine transportation, does ITOCHU plan to explore low-carbon methanol for other industrial or energy applications?

A: Yes, we plan to promote green methanol in other sectors, replacing fossil-based methanol in the chemical industry for products like plastics and paints. We are also exploring its potential as feedstock for fuels like SAF or low carbon gasoline.

Q13: How does this initiative fit into ITOCHU’s long-term business vision and the “Brand-new Deal” management policy?",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-15 16:02:12.022214

The United States is considering the actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers.","President Donald Trump has made it clear that Washington will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.

The world's largest maritime nations gathered at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London yesterday for a four-day meeting to vote on the adoption of a so-called Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organisation levies a global carbon tax on the world.

The US has made it clear that it will not accept any global environmental pact that unduly or unfairly burdens the US or harms its interests. The International Maritime Organization is convening a meeting in London to vote on adopting of a framework aimed at reducing carbon dioxide gas emissions from the global shipping sector. “The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous,” the US noted.

IMO member nations agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework in April this year. The aim is to adopt it at this meeting.

Most ships run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers or tourists,” a joint statement issued by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10 per cent or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security,” they noted.

The NZF sets a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

There's a base level of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels. There's a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity.

Ships with the highest emissions would have to buy those credits from other ships under the pricing system, or from the IMO at $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, to reach the base level of compliance. In addition, there's a penalty of $100 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach direct compliance.

Ships that meet the base target but not the direct compliance must pay the $100 per ton penalty as well. Ships whose greenhouse gas intensity is below a certain threshold will receive rewards for their performance.

The fees could generate $11 billion to $13 billion in revenue annually. That would go into an IMO fund to invest in fuels and technologies needed to transition to green shipping, reward low-emission ships and support developing countries so they aren't left behind with dirty fuels and old ships.

The United States is considering the actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers. It plans to pursue investigations and consider potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from US ports.

It may impose visa restrictions, including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

The US government may impose commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF. It may impose additional port fees on ships owned, operated or flagged by countries supporting the framework.

The United States is evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, the joint statement added.

If adopted, this agreement would be the first global fee on greenhouse gas emissions related to climate change. Currently, most vessels operate on heavy fuel oil, which emits carbon dioxide and other pollutants.

The discussions are taking place at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) headquarters and will continue through Friday. The Trump administration has opposed the proposal and threatened retaliatory actions if other nations support it, raising concerns about the agreement’s future, according to The Associated Press.

In April, IMO member states reached a consensus on the regulatory framework, with plans to finalise its adoption at this meeting. Delaine McCullough from the Ocean Conservancy noted that this development could significantly advance climate action, public health, and marine conservation.

“This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible,” said McCullough, shipping programme director for the nonprofit environmental advocacy group.

“The energy and digital transition of shipping has already started. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long run,” said Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the IMO, during his opening remarks at the meeting.

Over the past decade, shipping emissions have risen to approximately 3% of the global total due to increased trade and reliance on fossil fuels for cargo transport. In response, the “Net-Zero Framework” has been established, introducing a marine fuel standard that progressively reduces allowable greenhouse gas emissions.

This framework includes a pricing system that imposes fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted beyond specified limits, effectively implementing the first global tax on such emissions. It features a baseline compliance level for greenhouse gas intensity and a more stringent direct compliance target requiring further emission reductions.

Vessels using lower-emission fuels than those mandated under the direct compliance target can earn “surplus units.” At the same time, ships with higher emissions must purchase these credits or pay a penalty of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent for non-compliance. Those who meet the baseline target but fail to comply with direct requirements will also incur penalties.

Additionally, ships with greenhouse gas intensity below a specified threshold will receive performance rewards. This structure is expected to generate $11 billion to $13 billion annually, with funds allocated to the IMO for investments in sustainable fuels and technologies. This support aims to promote low-emission vessels and assist developing countries in transitioning away from outdated, polluting fuels and ships.

Using alternative fuels

IMO has established a significant goal for the shipping industry to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 2050. To facilitate this objective, the IMO is actively promoting the adoption of zero or near-zero-emission fuels. Vessels can effectively reduce their emissions by employing alternative fuels, electricity, or carbon capture technologies. Furthermore, advancements in wind propulsion and energy efficiency play a crucial role in diminishing fuel consumption.

Given that large ships generally have a lifespan of around 25 years, the industry must initiate investments now to meet the 2050 target. Effective in 2027, new regulations will introduce penalties for emissions from large oceangoing vessels exceeding 5,000 gross tonnage, which are responsible for 85% of international shipping’s carbon emissions. These penalties will begin in 2028. The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80% of the global merchant fleet, has expressed its support for these regulations.

Biofuels need vast amounts of crops

Heavy fuel oil, liquefied natural gas, and biodiesel are expected to dominate the shipping industry through the 2030s and 2040s, unless the IMO incentivises greener alternatives.

According to modelling from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental organisation, current regulations make biofuels the most cost-effective compliance option.

However, the agricultural demands of biofuels can displace less profitable food production and lead to deforestation, as highlighted by Faig Abbasov, the shipping director at T&E. Abbasov calls for the IMO to focus on scalable green alternatives rather than promoting biofuels derived from food crops.

The existing proposal before the IMO is unlikely to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Additionally, green ammonia is expected to become competitively priced for shipowners by the late 2040s, while green methanol could significantly contribute to the transition to sustainable shipping.

The April meeting in London

IMO is committed to achieving consensus in its decision-making process; however, it is anticipated that member nations will proceed with a vote on the proposed regulations. During the recent meeting in April, a vote was initiated to approve the content of these regulations. Although the United States was not present at that time, the US plans to participate in the upcoming session.

During the opening session on Tuesday, several nations, including Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Russia, expressed reservations about the agenda, which predominantly focuses on adopting the Net-Zero Framework by the end of the week.

Teresa Bui, the Senior Climate Campaign Director at Pacific Environment, conveyed optimism about the situation, noting that “global momentum is on our side,” and suggests that a majority of countries are likely to support the adoption. Pacific Environment holds a consultative, non-voting status at the IMO. The failure to adopt these regulations could further postpone the decarbonisation efforts within the shipping industry.",https://www.europeaninterest.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G3NoecTXwAAvU_w.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 06:56:53.241514

In April, the measures passed with the support of 63 IMO member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.","Donald Trump’s government is putting intense pressure on vulnerable countries to vote against measures that would force shipping companies to pay for their carbon emissions.

US officials have written to countries that support the measure and besieged them with phone calls threatening to impose tariffs, withdraw visa rights and take other retaliatory action.

The moves appear to be having some impact and, if successful, could throw more than two decades of tortuously slow progress on decarbonising the shipping industry into reverse.

Representatives from most of the 176 member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which governs global seafaring, are meeting at its headquarters in London for four days of talks. They are expected to approve new rules that would levy charges on ships based on their greenhouse gas emissions. The money raised would go to funding the transition to cleaner fuels for ships and to help developing countries.

The pricing mechanism could start operating from 2028, raising an estimated $10bn (£7.5bn) a year, and would be the first time that shipping companies had to pay for the damage they do to the climate. Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions currently, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century.

Although the carbon levy was approved at an IMO meeting in April, the complex procedures of the UN body mean it must be reaffirmed by two-thirds of countries this week. After that, countries have a further 10 months to decide whether to accept it, followed by a period of assessment and refinement before new rules can finally be introduced.

Trump is attempting to halt the measure. At the April meeting, US officials issued a public letter objecting to the carbon pricing mechanism and walked out of the talks, which continued without them. Since then, Trump has spoken publicly of his opposition to the measure.

On Friday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, along with energy secretary Chris Wright and transport secretary Sean Duffy, issued a public statement threatening to slap tariffs on countries that supported the measure, as well as other commercial penalties such as port fees on ships that complied.

The statement also hinted at targeting individual negotiators in the talk by “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers”.

Behind the scenes, the US has also issued a démarche – a diplomatic document – seen by the Guardian, which lists retaliatory measures.

“Our government will consider reciprocal measures to offset any fees charged to US ships and compensate American people any related economic harm from any adopted greenhouse gas emissions measures,” the document reads. “These measures could include, but are not limited to, the following actions to those countries supporting the net zero framework: levying additional tariffs; increasing port levies on ships owned, operated by or flagged in your country; reexamining eligibility for crew members for visa categories; increasing downline disembarkation fees for your nationals visiting US ports.”

Many people involved in the negotiations said that developing countries, and some developed countries, were concerned by the threats. In April, the measures passed with the support of 63 IMO member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained. Several small Pacific island states abstained because they felt the measure was too weak and should impose stiffer penalties.

Working alongside the US against the measure are several petrostates, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. The Guardian understands that Saudi’s approach is to offer sweeteners and hold out the promise of future deals or economic opportunities to entice developing countries to change their minds. Riyadh is also thought to have offered to pay the travel costs for officials from countries not present in April to attend this week and vote against the measures.

Depending on who turns up, it could take only a dozen or so countries to flip their votes – or a larger number of previous absentees to turn up and vote against it – to block the motion. It is understood that several countries are now considering opposition, including the Philippines, Turkey, Argentina and Australia.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, said he believed the consensus formed in April would prevail. “Last April, we reached a compromise – which is the text we have in front of us for adoption – on the technical and pricing mechanism measures. This is an agreement from the membership, based on years of negotiations, input, assessment and analysis,” he said. “My goal is, and always will be, to keep all the organisation together. There are concerns and we will address those concerns as we move forward.”

He added that a vote could be called if the consensus was unclear. “For me, [this] is the meeting where we’re going to adopt the amendments. How we do it is a mechanism that the member states will decide, based on established legal practices.”

Tuvalu was one of the Pacific nations that abstained in April, finding the compromise agreement for a levy too weak. Simon Kofe, minister of transport and energy for Tuvalu, had proposed several amendments this week that would strengthen the compromise, including the urgent setting up of a fund to disburse revenues generated by the proposed measure.

He said: “While larger, wealthier nations debate the threat to livelihoods, Pacific island nations are forced to consider the threat to lives and to statehood itself. That is the scale of what is at stake. We call on every delegation to set a course toward a just and equitable transition. This is about more than shipping. It is about survival.”

A US government spokesperson said: “We are actively engaging with countries on the extremely flawed proposal, as well as exploring and preparing to act on remedies including tariffs, visa restrictions, and/or port levies. We will also be engaging our like-minded partners and allies to propose they take similar measures. We will fight hard to protect the American people and their economic interests.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe27564f239300472c38f21c7a05a7f4dd1309fc/434_0_3383_2706/master/3383.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=175be223edf80bd6f6fc887ef2b64b22",N,,2025-10-15 06:57:03.978956

The Trump administration last week threatened to sanction nations that vote in favour of the NZF. In a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said countries backing the IMO’s decarbonisation plan could face port bans, visa restrictions on seafarers, punitive vessel fees, and even sanctions on government officials deemed to be “sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

For his part, Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, conceded yesterday that the NZF may not be perfect, but it provides what he described in his opening remarks as a “balanced basis” for further work on a number of elements ahead of its entry into force in 2027.

“The energy and digital transition of shipping have already started. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long run,” Dominguez said, adding: “It will incite a proliferation of regional and national climate measures leading to inefficiency and a myriad of emissions pricing schemes, without IMO – all of you the member states – or the industry having a say in how to use the collected revenue.”

Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in the IMO, Dominguez warned.

China, the European Union, the UK, Brazil and several other member states reaffirmed their support for the NZF yesterday, while a group of oil producing states came out against it. The global regulation targs net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping by or around 2050, in line with the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy. The NZF is potentially the first legally binding regime to combine mandatory GHG emission limits and pricing for an entire sector.

It introduces a global fuel standard requiring ships over 5,000 gt to gradually reduce annual GHG fuel intensity, measured on a well-to-wake basis. Ships exceeding these limits must purchase remedial credits, while those using zero or near-zero emission fuels are rewarded financially.

Initially approved in April, member states are set to vote on Friday on formally adopting the NZF. Pacific Island states, which abstained in the initial vote over concerns the proposal was not ambitious enough, are now expected to support it. Adoption will require a two-thirds majority.

The upcoming vote has sparked concern after the United States issued a warning to countries planning to adopt the NZF. In a statement released by the US Department of State, the Trump administration outlined five initial measures it could take against nations voting in favor of the framework, which it claims “unduly or unfairly burdens the United States” and its citizens.

The IMO, a specialized United Nations agency, oversees the safety, security, and environmental performance of international shipping. The Bahamas is a key member and maintains one of the world’s largest ship registries.

The NZF aims to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions from the international shipping sector. The US government, maintaining its stance that climate change policies are economically burdensome, has warned that an overwhelming vote for the NZF would amount to the first UN-sanctioned global carbon tax on maritime operations.

“The administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” the statement said. “The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10 percent or more.”

The US indicated it may pursue a range of sanctions against countries that support the NZF, including blocking vessels from US ports, imposing visa restrictions on maritime crews, levying commercial penalties related to US government contracts, and evaluating sanctions on officials advocating for climate policies.

Countries with large ship registries, like The Bahamas, could face added pressure from measures such as increased port fees. The Bahamas’ registry includes shipping vessels and cruise ships, many of which are transitioning to cleaner fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Not perfect but balanced basis

Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), highlighted the “special importance” of the week-long session for the agency and its work.

He acknowledged that some countries see the plan as too ambitious, while others believe it does not go far enough.

“The IMO Net-Zero Framework is not perfect,” he told delegates, “However, it provides a balanced basis for our further work ahead of its entry into force in 2027.”

“This process has been inclusive and thorough,” Mr. Dominguez added, urging delegates to approach the talks “with diplomacy and respect.”

“Here, we are diplomatic and respectful to one another, we listen to everyone’s opinion, we take steps forward and we are always looking to improve in this ever-changing sector.”

IMO currently has 176 Member States and three Associate Members.

The framework

The session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee runs through Friday, when delegates are expected to vote on adopting the framework as an amendment to the main international treaty for reducing air pollution from shipping and improving energy efficiency.

If adopted, the rules would apply to all ocean-going vessels over 5,000 gross tons, which together account for around 85 per cent of shipping-related emissions. National governments will be responsible for enforcement.

Ships would be required to gradually reduce their reliance on carbon-emitting fuels and pay a price for excess emissions, with revenue expected to be reinvested in clean energy transition measures and support for developing countries.

If a ship emits below a certain threshold, it can bank or trade its surplus units, and similarly, should a vessel fully switch to zero or near-zero emission fuels, it qualifies for financial rewards.

Strong headwinds

The proposal, however, faces strong headwinds from United States.

In a joint statement last week, US Secretaries of State, of Energy, and of Transportation said the framework amounted to “a global carbon tax on the world,” warning that it could raise shipping costs by more than 10 per cent and harm American consumers.

If adopted, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Net-Zero Framework would become the first binding global carbon pricing mechanism under international law.

The framework could mark a significant inflection point in trade and climate governance, but only if the IMO effectively confronts three design and implementation challenges: managing distributional impacts, enabling and responding to viable fuel pathways, and building a credible monitoring, reporting, and verification system.

US opposition branding the framework a “global carbon tax” risks diverting attention from the more consequential operational gaps in enforcement, fuel incentives, and cost distribution that will ultimately determine the framework’s durability.

On April 11, 2025, parties to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) provisionally endorsed what could become the first binding global carbon pricing mechanism adopted under international law. Known as the “IMO Net-Zero Framework,” this mechanism targets international shipping, a sector responsible for approximately 3 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or the entire emissions output of Japan, that has long been situated outside the core architecture of climate mitigation policy.[1] Barring last-minute negotiation derailment, formal adoption, which requires a two-thirds majority vote of IMO member states party to the amendment, is expected in October 2025, with implementation to begin in 2028.[2]

By introducing a price on shipping emissions, the framework marks a rare innovation in trade and climate governance. Yet it has quickly become the subject of familiar disputes over ambition and cost. Criticism has concentrated less on the framework’s technical design than on whether its ambition is commensurate with the scale of the climate challenge. Environmental groups and climate-vulnerable states have lamented what they see as critical omissions, such as a levy, a nonflexible emissions cap, and an explicit redistributive pricing model.[3] The United States, by contrast, has condemned the framework as a costly “global carbon tax” skewed to China’s advantage.[4]

Such critiques risk obscuring the underlying operational challenges that will ultimately define the framework’s durability. This commentary considers three of the most persistent of these challenges:

Distributional and market impacts — whether the Net-Zero Fund can offset the risks of market concentration and disproportionate burdens on smaller carriers, vulnerable states, and thin trade routes.

Fuel transition constraints — whether the framework creates sufficient incentives and infrastructure support to scale viable low- and zero-emission fuels beyond transitional compliance strategies.

Verification and enforcement gaps — whether the IMO can establish a robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system capable of ensuring compliance across highly fragmented jurisdictions.

The future of the framework will rest on whether the two-year negotiating process that follows formal adoption in October can address these challenges and sustain political consensus.

Cost Impositions

Disparate impacts across value chains

The core of the Net-Zero Framework requires ships engaged in international trade to comply with an emissions intensity limit that is set to increase annually. If a ship does not meet the GHG limit, its operator must purchase “remedial units” through direct contributions to the IMO or purchase/trade units from more efficient ships.[5] Remedial units are priced in two tiers: Tier 1 at $100/tons of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e) and Tier 2 at $380/tCO₂e. Both are fixed until 2030 and will be reviewed thereafter. Vessels that overperform can generate “surplus units,” which are expected to be tradeable through an IMO-administered platform at market prices capped by the Tier 2 level. Projected annual revenue, financed by remedial credit purchases, is estimated to be $11 to 13 billion,[6] which will be allocated to the Net-Zero Fund.

As such, the framework introduces a new layer of compliance costs for ship operators. By 2035, a mid-size carrier relying exclusively on very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), the prevailing “conventional” marine fuel, could face more than $1.5 million in additional annual expenses, or 17 to 20 percent of fuel costs in this example, rising in proportion to fuel use over time.[7]

The goal of the cost imposition is to shift operators away from higher-emission fuels and toward lower-emission alternatives. Remedial unit pricing is designed to reflect the estimated future cost difference between conventional VLSFO and emerging low-carbon fuels, thereby creating a direct financial incentive for switching to low-emissions alternative fuels. In practice, however, cost differentials will likely exceed IMO projections, which assume rapid infrastructure scale-up in response to the regulation, risking added operating expenses without corresponding fuel-market development.[8]

Since penalties are based on fixed prices rather than market-based, operators can calculate with certainty the maximum compliance cost they will face within a given cycle. That predictability makes it more attractive, particularly in a capital-intensive industry with 20- to 30-year asset cycles and low historical returns, to rely on remedial credits rather than invest in retrofits or alternative fuels; for most conventional vessels, paying penalties remains the least cost-compliant strategy until at least 2031.[9]

In contrast, green ammonia, often described as the cornerstone fuel for maritime decarbonization, is projected to cost between $885 and $1,050 per ton, or roughly two to four times the price of VLSFO after accounting for energy density.[10] Similarly, bio-methanol and e-methanol are projected to be 469 percent and 626 percent more expensive than VLSFO, respectively, with their scalability hinging on market signals shaped by IMO regulation.[11]

Large shipping firms are considerably more likely to be able to absorb the added cost of remedial units and retrofitting their fleet, and to be able to endure the initial discomfort of an inevitable lack of supply within the low-emissions fuel market. With access to capital and larger fleets, they can retrofit vessels, secure scarce supplies of low-emission fuels, and use credit trading to offset penalties, effectively balancing the costs of older, less-efficient ships against the performance of those already prepared to run on green methanol or ammonia.

For smaller carriers, particularly those operating on thin margins, servicing irregular routes, or based in developing economies, the calculus is more constrained. Without the financial capacity to retrofit or the flexibility to optimize emissions, these carriers will experience compliance costs as either a direct hit to margins or a pass-through expense. Measures such as cutting speed in order to reduce fuel consumption (“slowsteaming”), optimizing port calls, or pooling surplus credits may provide partial relief but often at the cost of slower service, reduced reliability, and diminished competitiveness.

The 2024 extension of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to maritime transport offers an instructive precedent. An analysis of more than 500 voyages by major carriers found that nearly 90 percent involved full pass-through of ETS costs to customers,[12] often with significant markups. On long-haul routes with limited competition, surcharges sometimes doubled or tripled the actual compliance cost. While cost pass-through is not inherently problematic (indeed, it is a normal feature of competitive markets), in the case of the ETS, it was largely decoupled from operational efficiency or emissions reduction. Rather than absorbing costs or driving operational efficiency, carriers largely treated the ETS as a pricing adjustment opportunity within existing market structures.

On highly competitive routes, carriers have an incentive to absorb part of the compliance costs in order to protect their market share. In contrast, on routes with limited service or monopolistic conditions, carriers that face little competitive pressure are more inclined to pass the full costs on to consumers and domestic exporters. As a result, the least competitive trade corridors, often those connecting Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and remote economies, would be disproportionately affected.

Such effects are unlikely to remain confined to carriers. Compliance costs, fuel switching expenses, and operational adjustments tend to diffuse through global supply chains, to cargo owners, port operators, freight forwarders, and ultimately consumers. Unlike explicit tariffs, such costs are absorbed at different points in the value chain depending on market structures and contractual relationships. For SIDS and lower-income markets, many of which rely heavily on maritime trade, even modest cost increases may carry disproportionate impacts.[13]

A Corrective Mechanism — But Does It Go Far Enough?

The IMO itself projected that a similar measure would impose higher burdens on long-haul, low-margin trade routes, particularly for agricultural goods, bulk materials, and manufactured inputs.[14] Small and medium-sized exporters in regions such as Africa, Latin America, and the Pacific could face additional competitive pressures, potentially reinforcing structural trade imbalances.

The establishment of the Net-Zero Fund is intended to mitigate these concerns, with a directive to both reduce cost disparities between conventional and low-emission fuels and channel resources into adaptation and resilience in climate-vulnerable states, especially SIDS and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).[15] In theory, such a dual mandate allows the fund to serve as both an incentive mechanism for the industry and a redistributive instrument for vulnerable economies. Yet whether it can do so remains highly uncertain.

The fund is projected to generate $11 to 13 billion annually, which would place it among the largest dedicated climate finance vehicles globally. But such ambition faces significant institutional challenges. The IMO, which will oversee the fund, is primarily a regulatory body with limited experience administering or managing climate finance. Establishing one of the world’s largest funding mechanisms within a two-year window will require the IMO to develop governance systems, fiduciary safeguards, eligibility criteria, and disbursement protocols at an almost-unprecedented speed and scale for international climate finance.

Unlike established multilateral funds, the IMO will also have to reconcile its regulatory mandate with the political and distributive implications of managing capital flows across highly diverse economies. Much of the framework’s design implicitly assumes that financial support will be available at sufficient speed and scale to offset the uneven distributional burdens created by compliance costs. But historical precedent suggests that those assumptions are optimistic. The establishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) took approximately five years[16] and is regularly subject to criticism regarding its pace of capital allotments.[17] The GCF has raised approximately $9.3 billion since its inception and has disbursed a total of $5.8 billion in capital over the past decade.[18] By contrast, the Net-Zero Fund, annually dwarfing the GCF, must be negotiated, capitalized, and deployed within two years, while immediately delivering on promises of large-scale investment. If delays occur, the burden of compliance costs will be felt well before mitigating finance is available, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable.

Even under ideal conditions, the mechanics of financial disbursement present structural limitations. Capital must move through national institutions, be converted into operational investments, and be paired with infrastructure development — processes that rarely align with the speed at which market shifts occur. In SIDS and developing states in particular, capacity constraints, limited port infrastructure, and logistical challenges slow the deployment of new technologies and fuel systems, meaning that even well-funded disbursements may take years to translate into practical reductions in cost burdens or emissions. The fund’s effectiveness will therefore depend on both the volume of resources raised and its ability to streamline allocation, target systemic bottlenecks, and deliver relief at a pace that matches the rapid escalation of compliance costs.

A more fundamental uncertainty lies in how the fund will reward zero- and near-zero (ZNZ) fuels. The rules for ZNZ rewards, including which fuels qualify, how rewards are structured, and what portion of revenues will be dedicated, will not be finalized until 2027 at the earliest.[19] That timeline collides with the long lead times fuel producers face: developing scalable e-ammonia or e-methanol requires ten- to fifteen-year offtake agreements, underpinned by predictable revenue streams. Absent clarity, the fund risks failing to derisk investment in scalable fuels at precisely the moment decisive commitments are required.

Moreover, the framework lacks earmarked provisions for adaptation projects, directing resources primarily toward fuel-cost subsidies. Should actual price differentials prove greater than anticipated, as is likely, funding available to SIDS and developing countries for infrastructure projects will be minimal

If the Net-Zero Fund succeeds in its mandates and timelines, it could provide a critical financial bridge, cushioning the near-term inequities of compliance and catalyzing investment in low-emission fuels and infrastructure across regions that would otherwise be left behind. If it fails, whether through delays, uneven distribution, or mismanagement, the entire legitimacy of the framework could be undermined.

Fuel Transition Constraints

Price parity is only part of the problem; realizing a transition to low- and zero-emission fuels will require far-reaching operational changes spanning ships, ports, and supporting infrastructure. The fuels expected to be “subsidized” by the Net-Zero Fund — green methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen-based fuels — are not drop-in replacements for conventional fuels. Each presents distinct barriers: lower energy density, specialized handling requirements, volatile safety profiles, and severely limited global supply. Achieving viable transition pathways demands coordinated investment in vessel retrofitting, fuel production, bunkering infrastructure, safety regulation, and workforce training, none of which can be rapidly scaled across the global fleet.

Further, the framework’s fixed prices of $100 and $380 per ton CO₂ equivalent risk distorting incentives across the sector, signaling to alternative fuel producers both the maximum premium they can charge over conventional fuels and the minimum price advantage needed to secure compliance demand. Such a dynamic encourages transitional fuels like LNG or early-stage biofuels to cluster just below the penalty threshold, sustaining artificially high prices while discouraging cost reductions or scaling when fuel prices sit safely below the penalty floor. Those risks are not trivial: LNG will be the cheapest compliance option until the mid-2030s, after which ammonia dual-fuel ships (first blue, then e-ammonia) emerge as the lowest-cost pathway.[20]

Absent more frequently updated penalties and time-sensitive infrastructure co-investment, the framework risks anchoring the market in a transitional compliance equilibrium that is sufficient for regulatory thresholds but inadequate for climate goals. In a capital-intensive, risk-averse sector, added costs constrain noncompliance but also define the outer limits of innovation. Firms will pursue what is profitable within regulatory parameters, not necessarily what is transformative for decarbonization.

Verification and Enforcement Gaps

The credibility of any carbon pricing regime depends on the integrity of its MRV system. The framework’s MRV design is yet to be negotiated. What is determined is that emissions data will be self-reported by operators, with enforcement delegated to national port authorities, a model prone to regulatory inconsistencies, enforcement disparities, and administrative bottlenecks across jurisdictions.

Port State Control (PSC), which is the procedure by which a country examines visiting foreign vessels at its ports to verify compliance with international rules on safety, environmental protection, and crew working conditions, is the center of enforcement. Ships will be required to carry certificates of annual compliance and proof of credit purchases covering the entirety of their international voyages, creating a clear compliance pathway: vessels calling at participating ports must be verified, even if their origin or destination lies in a nonparticipating state. Some operators may therefore seek to avoid the requirement altogether by restricting voyages within nonparticipating ports, essentially creating limited “dirty corridors” for older, higher-emission vessels within a given fleet as a means to minimize costs. Yet for stringent supply chains, avoidance is not a viable strategy. A container ship departing from London, Rotterdam, or Singapore for the United States, for example, must already be in compliance to sail, with certification covering the full route. Once the framework is anchored in the world’s principal maritime hubs, compliance becomes a de facto prerequisite for global trade.

This dynamic has two consequences. First, it insulates the framework from outright fragmentation. While some “dirty corridors” between nonparticipating ports may persist, the scale and profitability of such markets are limited relative to the globalized trade flows that depend on major participating hubs. Second, it means that stringent supply chains linking finance, technology, pharmaceuticals, and other time-sensitive industries will remain tethered to compliant carriers. Even powerful nonparticipating economies will find it difficult to wall themselves off from the system without accepting trade frictions and competitive disadvantages.

Where fragmentation does occur, it is more likely to be concentrated in lower-value, bulk, or regionally confined trade; older, higher-emission vessels may cluster in noncompliant circuits, creating a secondary carbon-intensive market. Such a bifurcation would reduce the framework’s environmental reach, but it would not free major global supply chains from its requirements, so long as major economies remain party to the regulation.

A centralized, independent verification body will be essential; without it, the system risks replicating past failures at scale, undermining both compliance integrity and the stability of the Net-Zero Fund’s revenues.

Conclusion

The Net-Zero Framework offers an extraordinary precedent in a new era of trade policy and regulation, by pricing emissions embedded in the mechanism of trade itself. If the two-year guidelines process, set to follow the October vote, significantly mitigates the outlined challenges, the framework could catalyze new markets for green fuels, drive shipbuilding and retrofitting at an unprecedented scale, and channel billions of dollars toward the energy transition and resilience in vulnerable states. If, however, the framework hardens around its current design, the result may be a hollowed-out coalition of reluctant participants and strategic noncompliance. Time is critical, as it is with any international agreement, but so too is ensuring the framework’s design is sufficiently robust to endure political tides.

[2] At the April session, only sixteen states opposed the provisional text, suggesting defeat in October is possible, but unlikely. Industry, for its part, has consistently pressed the IMO for a coherent global framework, citing the administrative complexity of overlapping regional regimes. Industry advocacy also dovetails with substantial capital commitments to alternative fuels and dual-engine vessels, reinforcing technological and financial path dependencies that make the decarbonization trajectory increasingly difficult to reverse. A failed vote in October would leave the IMO free to reopen discussions, though at the cost of protracted renegotiation. Under Article 16(2) of MARPOL (the treaty for which the Net-Zero Framework is an amendment), any party may resubmit an amendment proposal for consideration by the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 [MARPOL], art. 16, “Amendments.”). The committee itself may also call an extraordinary session to revisit a revised draft, as it has done in past Annex VI negotiations when timing was politically or commercially pressing. A further avenue lies in Article 16(3), which obliges the organization to convene a Conference of the Parties if one-third of parties so request, allowing amendments to be reconsidered outside the MEPC format. MEPC may likewise direct subsidiary bodies to revise contentious elements for resubmission. In practice, therefore, failure in October represents a procedural setback rather than a terminal defeat: the proposal could re-emerge in modified form at a subsequent MEPC or conference, though the timing and ambition of the text would depend on the willingness of key economies to sustain pressure for an agreement.

The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) is convening from October 14–17 to vote on a draft marine fuel emissions standard that would impose a levy on ships over 5,000 gross tons that exceed defined CO₂ output thresholds. The measure would penalize higher emitters, reward vessels using cleaner fuels, and channel revenues into a proposed IMO Net-Zero Fund to finance decarbonization projects and climate mitigation in maritime economies.

Mechanism: Vessels surpassing the set threshold would either purchase remedial emissions units or pay a direct penalty; those emitting below a separate lower threshold would accrue surplus units, potentially tradable in later compliance markets.

The proposal stems from an April 2025 preliminary agreement within the IMO which the United States opted out of, subsequently warning of “reciprocal measures” against backers—including port fee increases and visa restrictions. On October 11, the US State Department denounced the framework as “a European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

By contrast, EU member states reiterated their call for swift adoption, framing the measure as aligned with the Fit for 55 decarbonization package and the bloc’s FuelEU Maritime regulation, which aims to cut maritime GHG intensity by 80% by 2050.

DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast to 2050 provides essential insights for stakeholders navigating this transition, focusing on low-GHG fuels, technologies, and necessary infrastructure. With the IMO’s ambitious targets for emissions reduction, the industry must adapt swiftly to ensure compliance and sustainability.

New Regulations Set Emission Reduction Targets

The IMO’s revised 2023 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Strategy outlines a clear roadmap for the shipping industry’s energy transition. The strategy mandates a 20% reduction in emissions by 2030, a minimum of 70% by 2040, and aims for full decarbonization by around 2050, using 2008 levels as a baseline. The Net-Zero Framework (NZF) is designed to expedite the adoption of low-GHG fuels and technologies, with a focus on a GHG fuel intensity (GFI) metric that measures carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy used onboard. Starting in 2028, the framework will introduce progressively stricter GFI targets, impacting technology choices, ship operations, and the development of shoreside infrastructure.

DNV’s forthcoming white paper will delve deeper into the NZF following the anticipated vote on its adoption at the IMO meeting in October 2025. This framework is expected to influence the availability of low-GHG fuels and CO2 storage, making it crucial for shipowners to understand the implications for their operations. Eirik Ovrum, Maritime Principal Consultant at DNV, emphasizes the importance of knowing where to refuel and offload captured CO₂, as these factors will be vital for the successful transition to low-emission shipping.

Transitioning to Alternative Fuels and Technologies

According to DNV’s Maritime Forecast, the shift towards alternative fuels is gaining momentum, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and methanol leading the charge. The report indicates that the fleet of alternative-fuel vessels is set to nearly double between 2024 and 2028, with potential alternative fuel consumption reaching approximately 50 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2030. This growth is driven by the increasing availability of biofuels in ports and the potential for bio-methane to serve as a drop-in fuel for dual-fuel LNG vessels.

As the industry transitions, the demand for trained personnel will rise. DNV estimates that around 33,000 additional seafarers will require alternative fuel training within the next three to four years. Furthermore, wind propulsion technologies are gaining traction, with 64 ships currently equipped with modern wind-assisted systems. This trend is expected to accelerate as GHG regulations tighten, prompting further investment in innovative propulsion methods.

Despite the promising developments, the maritime sector faces significant challenges in scaling up low-GHG fuel production. The competition for these fuels is intensifying, particularly from other industries such as aviation and trucking. DNV’s report highlights the need for a substantial increase in production capacity to meet the IMO and EU targets. Currently, only a small fraction of hydrogen-derived projects have reached operational status, underscoring the urgency for the industry to engage with fuel developers and invest in infrastructure.

To facilitate the transition, the report advocates for flexible Chain of Custody models that can trace and verify the sustainability of low-GHG fuel supplies. These models can help reduce investment needs for storage and bunkering infrastructure, ultimately supporting the growth of renewable fuel markets. As the maritime industry navigates this complex landscape, proactive planning and informed decision-making will be essential for compliance and to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the shift towards low-GHG shipping.",https://nauticalvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shipping-Industry-Faces-Urgent-Decarbonization-Challenge.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 09:58:18.496342

Initially approved in April, the London-based IMO are set to vote on Friday on formally adopting the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the first global carbon-pricing system.

However, Washington's threat to impose sanctions on those supporting it had cast doubt on the future of the framework, just as the summit where it is due to be adopted got under way.

The summit's first day on Tuesday was marked by friction between members supporting the NZF and those opposing it.

The framework would require ships to progressively reduce carbon emissions from 2028, or face financial penalties.

Last week, the United States threatened countries who vote in favour of the framework with sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies, calling the proposal a ""global carbon tax on the world"".

But several countries, including Britain, Brazil, China and the European Union, reaffirmed their commitment during Tuesday's meeting of the 176-nation IMO.

""We believe that reaching a consensus on global implementation (of the framework) is essential,"" a representative from China told members.

- Oil producers' opposition -

To be adopted, the framework needs the backing of two-thirds of the present and voting IMO members that are parties to the so-called MARPOL anti-pollution convention.

The convention has 108 members.

A majority of members -- 63 states -- that voted in favour of the NZF in April are expected to maintain their support on Friday.

The plan would charge ships for emissions exceeding a certain threshold, with proceeds used to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

Several major oil producers -- Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates -- voted against the measure, and are expected to do so again this week, arguing it would harm the economy and food security.

Pacific Island states, which abstained in the initial vote over concerns the proposal was not ambitious enough, are now expected to support it.

The United States withdrew from IMO negotiations in April and did not comment on the proposal until last week.

US threats could affect ""countries more sensitive to US influence and vulnerable to these retaliations"", a European source told AFP.

""We remain optimistic about the outcome, but it will probably be tighter than before, with a higher risk of abstention,"" the source added.

Countries highly dependent on the maritime industry, such as the Philippines and Caribbean islands, would be particularly impacted by US visa restrictions and sanctions.

Contacted by AFP, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez declined to respond directly to the US statement, maintaining he was ""very confident"" about the NZF vote.

“Creation of the North-East Atlantic emission control area will significantly reduce ships’ emissions, improve air quality, and contribute to improving public health and environmental protection in the north-east Atlantic region, including the Arctic waters around Greenland and Iceland”, said Prior.

By restricting the use of the most polluting shipping fuels, North East Atlantic Ocean emission control area would see SOx emissions cut by up to 82% and particulate matter by 64%, which will avoid thousands of premature deaths by 2050, and have a co-benefit of reducing the black carbon emissions which have a detrimental impact on Arctic snow and ice.

The proposed rules — known as the Net-Zero Framework — would for the first time impose a global fee on greenhouse gas emissions from ships, marking a major step toward ending the sector’s reliance on fossil fuels.

The talks, taking place at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters through Friday, are aimed at finalizing regulations that would gradually cut the carbon intensity of marine fuels and channel billions of dollars into developing green technologies. If adopted, the measures would be the world’s first global carbon pricing system targeting a single industry.

A Historic but Contentious Negotiation

The proposal has broad support from climate advocates and many IMO member states, but faces fierce opposition from a handful of major economies, including the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. The US delegation, reflecting the Trump administration’s stance, has warned of possible retaliation if the plan is approved — raising the stakes for a vote expected later this week.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez opened the meeting by urging nations to act decisively. “The energy and digital transitions of shipping are already underway,” he said. “Without global rules, this transformation will be slower and more expensive.”

The Net-Zero Framework: How It Works

Under the proposed regulations, ships would be required to meet progressively tighter limits on the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity of their fuels. Those exceeding the limits would pay fees based on their excess emissions, while cleaner operators could earn credits for outperforming the targets.

The pricing system sets two compliance thresholds: A base target defining allowable fuel emissions intensity, and a stricter direct compliance target, requiring deeper cuts.

Ships that emit beyond these levels would face charges of $380 per ton of CO₂ equivalent to reach the base target, and an additional $100 per ton penalty to meet the direct compliance threshold. Operators that emit less than required could sell surplus credits, creating a market incentive for low-carbon performance.

IMO estimates the fees could generate $11–13 billion annually, with revenues directed to a new Global Maritime Transition Fund. The fund would support investments in clean fuels and technologies, reward low-emission ships, and assist developing nations in modernizing their fleets.

If approved, the regulations would take effect in 2027, with enforcement beginning in 2028 for large ocean-going vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage — a segment responsible for about 85% of international shipping’s total emissions.

Balancing Costs, Technology, and Equity

Shipping currently accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, a share that has grown over the past decade alongside booming international trade. The IMO has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal that will require rapid shifts toward new energy sources.

Potential solutions include green ammonia, methanol, electrification, onboard carbon capture, and wind-assisted propulsion. However, heavy fuel oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and biodiesel are expected to remain dominant through the 2030s and 2040s unless stronger incentives accelerate the adoption of cleaner alternatives.

A Pivotal Moment for Global Climate Policy

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, has endorsed the framework, calling it essential for a level global playing field and long-term investment certainty.

Still, divisions remain. During the opening session, several nations, including the U.S., Russia, and Saudi Arabia, questioned the agenda’s focus on adopting the Net-Zero Framework this week — signaling potential delays.

Despite these tensions, environmental advocates remain hopeful. “Global momentum is on our side,” said Teresa Bui of Pacific Environment. “Most countries recognize that this is our best opportunity to align shipping with the Paris Agreement.”

Failure to reach an agreement, however, would have far-reaching consequences. “Another delay means more emissions, more warming, and more time lost,” warned John Maggs of the Clean Shipping Coalition. “It would signal that the world’s most global industry still isn’t ready to face the climate crisis.”

If adopted, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework could set a powerful precedent — proving that coordinated, enforceable international climate action is not only possible but necessary for a sustainable future.",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Imo-netzero-news.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 04:56:33.442819

If confirmed, this could be the first time von der Leyen has openly defied the second Trump administration after a series of concessions – including a recent trade agreement that saw the EU accept 15% tariffs on most exports to the US.

Net-zero shipping

On Thursday, governments are due to adopt a new Net Zero Framework within the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN body based in London whose Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) is meeting this week, ostensibly to rubber-stamp what is considered a done deal.

The framework would force ship operators who keep using the dirtiest – and cheapest – fuels to pay a gradually increasing carbon price, proportional to their excess CO2 pollution. Crucially, emissions would be measured across the entire fuel lifecycle – from production to transport – weakening the case for liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a “cleaner” transitional fuel.

The United States supports LNG as a stepping stone in the energy transition, but the proposed framework would prioritise low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels derived from renewable energy. This would favour countries like China, which have invested heavily in these technologies – placing the European Union once again between Washington and Beijing in a geopolitical tug-of-war.

Two opposing camps have emerged – camps that do not reflect traditional global alliances politically. On one side is a bloc led by the EU and China; on the other, a US-led group that includes Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Iraq, and several Gulf states.

Within the EU, maritime nation Greece initially supported the US position. However, sources have told Euractiv that Athens is unlikely to break EU unity in the final vote.

Commission’s ‘green geeks’

In practice, however, von der Leyen’s nein may prove more symbolic than substantive, regardless of any potential retaliation by the White House.

Industry experts told Euractiv there is little chance the deal, as it stands now, could ever being implemented effectively without US participation – and von der Leyen knows this. The general framework would need to be followed by a complex web of regulatory agreements, and the present fragile majorities may not hold.

Meanwhile, von der Leyen has promised Trump that Europe will purchase approximately $750 billion worth of US energy – including LNG – in order to avoid further US tariffs.

Now, if Europe supports the IMO deal, that commitment could come under threat. US officials have warned that ships flagged by countries endorsing the deal may face punitive levies – or even be denied access to American ports.

And if the EU fails to follow through on its energy purchases, it risks facing a new round of trade tariffs from Washington.

Behind the scenes, tensions are rising. Euractiv has learned that US officials are accusing a group of “green geeks” within the European Commission of pushing environmental policies that are detached from reality.

Despite the perceived shortcomings, Mr Luman said the IMO framework represents a point from which the industry can build.","A senior transport and logistics economist at ING has dubbed statements coming from the White House, relating to the effects of a global carbon price on shipping, ’weak’ and senseless.

US President Donald Trump’s administration has taken aim at decarbonisation measures under discussion at the United Nations’ specialised agency for shipping the International Maritime Organization (IMO) with open letters that include arguments against the so-called Net-Zero Framework (NZF) and threats against countries that do not side with the US in the matter.

But ING senior economist Rico Luman said in a LinkedIn post that tariffs imposed by the US President would have a far greater impact on the global economy and would result in higher prices for consumers than the IMO NZF.

""The US objects [to the IMO climate framework] and pressures other nations to reject it as well. But its arguments make no sense,"" Mr Luman said. ""If the framework were to push shipping costs up 10%, it will only translate into a fractional consumer prices increase. At least far less than the glut of tariffs [the US] is currently imposing. As such, it won’t pose a significant risk to the global economy.""

A joint statement from President Trump’s appointees, the US Secretaries of State, Energy and Transportation, claimed, ""The economic impacts from [IMO NZF] could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more,"" but then went on to threaten ’financial penalties’ and ’commercial penalties’ including port fees against countries that did not back the US attempt to prevent the passage of the IMO measure.

In April, following IMO’s approval of the text of the Net-Zero Framework for shipping, Mr Luman said the NZF regulation, which is up for adoption at an extraordinary session of IMO during October, is a starting point for the industry and outlined several places where the regulation could go further than it currently does.

""The package introduces carbon pricing for greenhouse gas emissions above a downward sloping target level and redirects the revenues for greening. This pushes shipping companies to act, but ultimately more is needed,"" Mr Luman said.

Lauding the work by the international community represented by IMO’s 176 member states to achieve an approved regulation that sets a carbon price on emissions above base target reductions that ratchet from 8% by 2030, Mr Luman said the regulation’s ’fuel agnostic’ approach risks creating high demand for biofuels, which, when not carefully regulated, can result in deforestation that can devastate ecosystems and worsen the impacts of global emissions. Also among Mr Luman’s list of shortcomings for the regulation is lack of greater ambition and a pricing mechanism for all shipping emissions included in other regulations, such as the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).

""Shippers such as Cargill and Trafigura have previously advocated for putting a price on all emissions as this could be a forceful instrument to support decarbonisation. Maersk called for a levy starting from US$150-200 and preferably even significantly higher to support the transition. However, this also raises the costs of shipping, and adopting this was probably not achievable at the global level at this point,"" he said.

""In terms of target setting, IMO previously adopted a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, striving for 30% by 2030, and 70%, striving for 80% by 2040, both compared to 2008. The adopted framework seems to focus on a reduction of at least 8%-21% by 2030, which looks less ambitious. At the same time, total absolute emissions in shipping have risen in recent years, underscoring the need for more decisive action going forward.""

The carbon tax proposal aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping sector is not perfect, but it provides an orderly shift to a greener industry, the IMO chief said on Tuesday.

“The IMO Net-Zero Framework is not perfect. However, it provides a balanced basis for our further work on a number of elements ahead of its entry into force in 2027,” the IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez said at the opening of the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee on October 14.

Nations are meeting at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters through Friday. Earlier this year, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework. The aim is to adopt it at this meeting.

In his address to the Committee, the IMO chief addressed increasingly vocal opposition to the carbon pricing mechanism by saying it will cut costs in the long run and avoid regional and national climate measures.

“The energy and digital transition of shipping have already started. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long run. It will incite a proliferation of regional and national climate measures leading to inefficiency and a myriad of emissions pricing schemes, without IMO – all of you the Member States – or the industry having a say in how to use the collected revenue. Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in IMO, your Organization,” said Arsenio Dominguez during his opening remarks at the meeting.

The IMO chief is asking member states of the International Maritime Organization to support adopting regulations to transition to green shipping.

“The IMO Net-Zero Framework is a set of goal-based provisions. No specific fuel or technology has been excluded from the Net-Zero Framework as compliance option. I am confident that the various proposals that have already been submitted regarding the reward, fuel certification, well-to-wake emissions, or the fund will address remaining concerns and provide additional certainty,” the IMO secretary-general noted.

Some IMO member states intervened to express their concerns about the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework.

During the opening session on Tuesday, Arsenio Dominguez highlighted: “I am aware that some of you may find the outcome not climate ambitious enough, and would have liked to see steeper reduction curves to effectively contribute to reducing global warming. Others, believe that the GFI reduction requirements are overly stringent and will place a burden on the shipping industry.

“Some of you are of the view that there will not be sufficient alternative fuels available to ensure compliance, whilst others believe that robust global regulations will send a clear demand signal to fuel and energy producers. Some of you would have preferred a stronger commitment to supporting developing States. Others would prefer additional support for early-movers.

“All these views continue to be valuable. And also during this week all these different positions will be respected.”

The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but it’s likely nations will vote on adopting the regulations.

Seven leading shipping associations have called for the IMO to adopt the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) at the critical extraordinary session of the IMO marine environment protection committee this week (14-17 October). Anything else would be a major setback for the green transition, they say, and risk leaving the industry with a complicated patchwork of regional climate regulations.

In a joint statement, seven associations – Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, and Danish Shipping – warned that failure to adopt the NZF would leave the industry facing a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and European Shipowners (ES | ECSA) have also issued, among other leading associations and organizations, declarations of support for the Net-Zero Framework.

On the contrary, the Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the climate deal.

Greek shipowners also voiced strong support for decarbonization in the first day of Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference on October 6, in Limassol, but warned that the current pace of regulation risks prioritizing taxation over real progress.

George Procopiou, chairman of Dynacom Tankers Management called for “doable, not desirable” measures, including slower steaming, carbon capture, and greater technical efficiency, while Semiramis Paliou, CEO of Diana Shipping emphasized that shipping’s share of global emissions remains small and that excessive costs will ultimately reach consumers.

Dr. John Coustas, president and CEO at Danaos Corporation cautioned that regional measures such as the EU Emissions Trading System threaten competitiveness and urged closer consultation between the IMO and industry.

Thanassis Martinos, managing director at Eastern Mediterranean Maritime criticized the EU’s framework as “unfair and disruptive,” arguing that it penalizes ships for voyage segments outside European waters.

The second day of the Maritime Cyprus 2025 Conference on October 7 brought together international industry leaders for discussions spanning insurance, ownership and chartering trends.

Four shipowners were invited to express their views on how they are adapting to uncertainty around decarbonization, regulation and technological change.

John A. Xylas, president and CEO at Ariston Navigation Corp. reaffirmed the industry’s support for a single global regulatory framework under the IMO, describing it as essential for predictability and fairness.

Polys V. Hajioannou, CEO, chairman and director at Safe Bulkers cautioned that the cost of compliance inevitably passes through the supply chain, reiterating that shipowners remain willing to adapt but require realistic timelines and balanced measures.

Filippos Efstathiou, CEO at Efnav Company Ltd stressed the importance of operational efficiency and prudent investment, warning that acting prematurely on unproven technologies risks “investing against a moving target.”

For shipping - a sector responsible for moving 90% of global trade - the clock is ticking loudly.

This week’s meeting at the IMO, aptly titled “Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)” will likely adopt the widely anticipated GFI (Greenhouse Fuel Index), ensuring clarity and alignment of parties. But it still won’t be enough.

Before combustion engines were invented, shipping was a great example of zero carbon technology. For the past 100 years, however, shipping has relied on fossil fuels and, over time, ended up being responsible for some 3% of the world’s total global greenhouse gas emissions.

Alternative fuels like ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen are often framed as the future of clean shipping and will undoubtedly play an important role. But these fuels are costly and not always readily available. Wind, an abundant element, is the key to driving decarbonization.

Wind propulsion is as practical as it is scalable. Wind can reduce fuel consumption and emissions between 5-25% - and in good weather conditions, for up to 70%. This isn’t a hypothetical prediction; these results are verified, repeatable, and achievable across a range of vessels, as demonstrated across the world’s biggest trade routes.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework provides a unique opportunity to embed wind propulsion in regulatory and incentive mechanisms. The International Wind Shipping Association (IWSA) calls for consistent and equitable treatment of wind propulsion within its proposed framework.

Based on the best data from our experts’ projections, Energy Cost-Emissions Curve’ measurement tool (below) shows that while adopting alternative fuel types mean lower carbon emissions, they also result in higher energy costs. As pioneers in wind propulsion technology, we know this too well. With 35 sails built and installed and 48 on order now, we see wind propulsion as the only solution that achieves both low energy costs and high GFI improvement potential.

Recognition of wind propulsion as a cornerstone technology by the IMO would accelerate adoption, ensure better overall compliance, deliver long-term investment in sustainability and most importantly, significantly reduce emissions.

Momentum is already building, with wind propulsion technologies now increasingly recognized by shipowners and operators as a proven, class-approved technology, operating successfully across global fleets.

As the MEPC convenes, decision-makers must acknowledge that the winds of change are not theoretical: they are measurable, reliable, and ready to scale.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice,” according to a joint statement issued by the Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean P Duffy.

The measure, which was approved in April 2025, is set for adoption in October 2025, during the Marine Environmental Protection Committee that is meeting that takes place until October 17.

IMO officials say 108 members are eligible to vote, including 10 from CARICOM and, if adopted, it will come into effect in 2028.

But Washington has said that President Donald Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.

It said that this week’s vote on the adoption “will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10 per cent or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security,” the joint statement said.

The NZF seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping to align with the 2050 net-zero target. Key components include a Global Fuel Standard (GFS) setting annual GHG intensity reduction targets, a two-tier carbon price mechanism, and a credit trading system funded by penalties to reward zero and near-zero emission fuels and support a just transition.

The NZF presents a new regulatory era in which ships will be required to gradually adopt fuels that are typically three to four times more expensive compared with conventional fossil fuels. Given the long lifespan of ships, shipowners should prepare now for the new net-zero GHG emission regulations to ensure cost-effective compliance, both at the ship and the fleet level.

The Framework will apply to all oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage (GT). These ships are responsible for over 85 per cent of global shipping emissions and are already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection. Ships under 5,000 GT are currently not covered.

Washington said that the NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states “to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.”

The United States says it is considering several actions against countries that support “this global carbon tax on American consumers”.

Among the measures being contemplated are pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from US ports; imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

In addition, Washington said it will impose commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts including new commercial ships, liquefied natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF;

It will also be imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework as well as evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

Estimates suggest that the Net-Zero Fund will collect revenues of between $12bn and $15bn, effectively turning IMO into a financial institution.
Among the key issues to be resolved is how the revenues collected will be distributed and according to what criteria.
For a detailed review of the NZF see Information Note 1705 (IMO approves its Net Zero Framework (NZF)).","There are 108 signatories to MAPRPOL Annex VI and adoption of the amendments requires two-thirds of the 108 parties (at least 72) representing at least 50% of the global gross tonnage.

However, several member states have signalled their concerns.

Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and Yemen have collectively submitted a detailed techno-economic analysis of the mechanism and measures proposed in the NZF and identifying their associated risks.

Their submission argues that the NZF is not achievable in current market conditions, may prove counter productive, and will not support the shipping sector to reduce its GHG emissions in a fair, equitable, and agnostic manner.

Specifically, the analysis indicates:

Significant remaining gaps and ambiguity around key elements of the measures make their adoption premature,

Steep greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) trajectories and the large gap between base and direct compliance de-incentivise the uptake of lower-carbon fuels,

There are limited incentives for the use of readily available transitional fuels as a direct consequence of the steep GFI trajectories,

The risk of excessive revenue accumulation in the IMO Net-Zero Fund due to the combined effects of steep GFI trajectories and the narrow scope of rewards towards undefined zero or net-zero fuels, and

The risk of the shipping sector segregating into ""winners "" vs others who will end up ""paying to support winners"".

In a further submission, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, and Venezuela present legal concerns regarding the adoption of the NZF, including inconsistencies with the MARPOL legal framework.

The United States has also identified issues and shortcomings that it says present unacceptable risks to the shipping sector and its energy transition goals, specifically:

The proposed measures risk imposing significant economic burdens on the shipping industry and its customers, driving inflation for consumers,

Affordable and proven transitional fuels like liquefied natural gas and biofuels are unfairly penalised under the measures, especially given the lack of clear existing alternatives,

Rapid GFI reduction targets could lead to excessive revenue accumulation without achieving meaningful environmental goals, and

The management and disbursement of revenues under the framework, which must be within the legal purpose of reducing air pollution from ships, is ill-defined and insufficient to ensure the efficacy of any emissions reduction framework.

Estimates suggest that the Net-Zero Fund will collect revenues of between $12bn and $15bn, effectively turning IMO into a financial institution. Among the key issues to be resolved is how the revenues collected will be distributed and according to what criteria. We know that some of the revenues will be used to reward the use of Zero and Near-Zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources.

For a detailed review of the NZF see Information Note 1705 (IMO approves its Net Zero Framework (NZF)).

If adopted, a series of associated guidelines will have to be developed.

Related issues include the safety of alternative fuels, such as ammonia and hydrogen, and IMO has a separate workstream on the ‘’development of a safety regulatory framework to support the reduction of GHG emissions from ships using new technologies and alternative fuels” as well as suitable training and competency standards for those handling alternative fuels onboard, which will be considered as part of the review of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW).

As member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) head to London for an extraordinary session of the Marine Environmental Protection Committee, a coordinated African position on the decarbonisation of the shipping industry has never been more urgent.

The IMO’s Net Zero Framework was agreed in April 2025 after a contentious debate that culminated in a rare vote, illustrating the high political stakes of global maritime decarbonisation. After the political wranglings, it is expected to be formally endorsed at the extraordinary session. The Framework is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry through the introduction of a two-tier global fuel standard, and an emissions pricing and reward system for ships that use cleaner fuels. It will also establish an IMO Net-Zero Fund that will collect and redistribute revenues. Of the 37 African IMO member states, only 13 voted; the remaining 24 did not participate in the vote because they didn’t attend the meeting or didn’t pay their dues. Of the 13 that voted, five voted Yes, two voted No, and six abstained. This left observers to wonder whether the abstentions reflected a lack of interest or a form of quiet protest.

Several factors help explain this poor showing: many governments give a low priority to the maritime sector, there is a lack of funding for participation at the IMO, and some countries’ voting rights have been suspended for non-payment of dues.

More concerning than basic levels of participation, however, was the absence of coordination at the continental level. Without a common position, the African bloc lacked the negotiating strength that unity brings.

This lack of coordination has weakened Africa’s collective voice to align the IMO process with its own ambitious development agenda. This includes the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement, the revised African Maritime Transport Charter, the Africa Integrated Maritime Strategy, and the African Green Industrialisation Initiative. These initiatives aim to boost intra-African trade, develop resilient regional maritime value chains, and position Africa as a competitive force in global markets.

A report published last year by the Africa Policy Research Institute, LSE’s Firoz Lalji Institute for Africa, and the African Future Policies Hub provided some initial analysis on the impact of the NZF on African countries. On one hand, aligning with the NZF could help Africa leverage green shipping and energy transitions to drive green industrialisation, attract climate finance, and strengthen its global trade position. On the other hand, rising compliance and freight costs could undermine export competitiveness and exacerbate inequalities between countries with different levels of readiness.

It is therefore concerning that the African Union has not played a stronger coordinating role in shaping Africa’s position on maritime emissions reduction. It has proved leadership in the sphere of aviation, having recently successfully championed the continent’s interests at the International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly, securing strong representation and pursuing a clear common agenda. There could be no better time for such leadership in the maritime space. In an era of geopolitical turbulence and declining multilateralism, Africa needs a steady hand to guide its 37 IMO member states through external risks.

Two issues are of particular concern: First, the US threats of retaliatory tariffs against IMO members that back the NZF. The US administrations has called the measures “a global carbon tax on Americans by an unaccountable UN organisation” and “which would benefit China”. Second, there is the risk that the EU’s unilateral measures aimed at reducing emissions from ships (the Emissions Trading System for shipping and the FuelEU Maritime regulation) may remain in place even after the NZF goes into force. If these overlapped with the NZF, the compounding compliance costs for international shipping will ultimately be passed on to African consumers.

Should the NZF be adopted this week, the next phase will involve developing detailed guidelines on critical aspects such as fuel lifecycle analysis and the operation of the Net Zero Fund. Another reason for coordination at the African Union Commission level is to ensure that African member states adopt a unified approach to implementing the NZF and mitigating its potential disproportionate impacts.

African countries would be better served if they agreed on shared priorities and advanced them collectively within the relevant working groups. Without such alignment, the continent risks missing a vital opportunity to embed equity, climate justice, and fair transition principles into the measures that will shape global shipping for decades to come.

In his seminal speech on African unity made at the inauguration of the Organisation of African Union in Addis Ababa in 1963, Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, argued that “Africa must unite or perish.” He cautioned against the continent remaining a loose collection of states with “mere charters” where weaker states are at the mercy of powerful non-African nations. He argued for an Africa that is united with a common purpose to move forward together in dealing with matters that affect us collectively. Africa must now connect the dots between the IMO Net Zero Framework and its common purpose. Under the coordination and leadership of the African Union Commission, Africa can and must unite to secure its collective interests in the global maritime transition.",https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/18/files/2025/10/19789450684_540bba44c0_c.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 22:32:59.858549

Net-Zero Framework Imperfect, but a Platform for Progress

The secretary noted that the framework represents a culmination of extensive consultations and deliberations across multiple sessions, designed to translate the strategic ambitions of the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy into enforceable rules. Opinions vary: some argue the framework lacks ambition, while others warn the greenhouse gas intensity (GFI) reduction targets may be overly demanding for shipping operators.

One prominent critique centers on uncertainties regarding the availability of alternative fuels—some stakeholders question whether viable low-carbon options will materialize in time to meet compliance deadlines. Conversely, others believe that stronger global regulation could generate clear market signals to accelerate development and supply of cleaner fuels.

Another concern is regulatory fragmentation: without uniform global rules, regional or national climate measures may proliferate in a patchwork fashion, undermining cohesive policy. Such fragmentation could complicate financing, investment decisions, and long-term planning within the shipping sector.

In response, the IMO framework is designed to be fuel- and technology-agnostic, enabling flexibility for shipowners and policymakers. Ongoing proposals aim to clarify reward mechanisms, fuel certification protocols, “well-to-wake” emissions accounting, and financial support models to assist member states—especially developing ones—in transition.

While not flawless, the Secretary-General emphasized that the Net-Zero Framework delivers a balanced starting point. Its adoption marks a significant milestone ahead of the framework’s planned entry into force in 2027. The IMO will now proceed to refine the regulatory elements and mechanisms needed to operationalize the framework and ensure that its goals are both realistic and impactful.

“But imposing fees or restrictions on ships or shipping will merely increase the cost of shipping to and from the US, and hence place the financial cost on the US exporters and importers,” he wrote.

The IMO’s NFZ was approved in April by the Marine Environment Protection Committee and would combine mandatory emissions limits and greenhouse gas pricing across the entire maritime shipping industry.

From October 14–17, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will vote on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF)—a landmark package of climate regulations aimed at decarbonizing international shipping.

If adopted, the NZF will:

Take effect in 2027

Become mandatory starting in 2028 for ships over 5,000 gross tonnage engaged in international trade, under the jurisdiction of countries that are Parties to MARPOL Annex VI

Impact vessels responsible for 90% of global shipping emissions

This vote marks a pivotal moment for shipowners, operators, and ports. The outcome will shape fuel strategies, investment decisions, and operational planning for years to come.

What’s in the Net-Zero Framework?

The NZF is designed to help the industry meet the IMO’s 2030 and 2050 climate goals. It includes:

Global Fuel Standard: Requires ships to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of their fuels using a full lifecycle approach

Performance-Based Economic Measures: Ships that exceed emissions thresholds must purchase remedial units; those that outperform targets can earn surplus units

IMO Net-Zero Fund: Supports innovation, infrastructure, and equitable transition across the sector

Why It Matters for Your Business

This framework isn’t just about environmental compliance—it’s about market positioning and long-term viability. Leading shipping associations are urging adoption to ensure a globally consistent approach that avoids fragmented regional rules.

At the same time, shipowners must prepare for:

Fuel availability and cost implications

Technology investments

Coordination with ports and suppliers

Regional regulations like the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, and North American clean fuel standards

What You Can Do Now

To stay ahead of the curve:

Explore fuel-switching options (e.g., Bio-LNG, methanol, ammonia)

Invest in energy efficiency technologies

Engage with stakeholders across the maritime value chain

Monitor regulatory developments closely

Decarbonize with Confidence

The path to maritime decarbonization is complex—but you don’t have to navigate it alone.

Anew is helping shipowners and operators simplify compliance and accelerate their transition to net zero.

The organization not only hopes to move global shipping away from LNG, but also away from biomethane and synthetic LNG.
The initiative launched as the International Maritime Organization is prepared to vote on a Net-Zero framework that may spell the beginning of the end for LNG.
Methane emissions from international shipping increased by roughly 150% between 2012-2018, primarily because of the increase in use of LNG as a propulsion fuel.
Over the coming months, MARBEM intends to work closely with the International Maritime Organization and European Union regulators during FuelEU negotiations.","A new global initiative, Maritime Beyond Methane (MARBEM), has launched with the goal of moving global shipping toward fuels without methane. The organization not only hopes to move global shipping away from LNG, but also away from biomethane and synthetic LNG.

The initiative launched as the International Maritime Organization is prepared to vote on a Net-Zero framework that may spell the beginning of the end for LNG. LNG is made from a fossil fuel known as natural gas, much of which is acquired by fracking, that is composed almost entirely of methane. It is 27-30 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas over a 100-year timeframe. It is 82.5 times more potent than CO2 over the near term. Methane emissions from international shipping increased by roughly 150% between 2012-2018, primarily because of the increase in use of LNG as a propulsion fuel.

MARBEM said it used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Social Cost of Methane for figures showing that, in 2023, ships powered by LNG released an estimated 247,000 tons (t) of methane. This amount of methane is linked to about $950 million in climate-related damages for that year. In 2016, the estimated cost was around $250 million.

By contrast, biomethane is fuel made with methane gas that is a natural byproduct of decomposing natural materials such as vegetation and manure. While growing crops for the purpose of manufacturing biomethane rather than food is considered a dangerous misuse of agricultural resources, many companies have produced fuel from farm and forestry residues. The International Energy Agency also suggested that cover crops could be used for biomethane, but admits that there is a potential shortage of stock for the fuel.

Biomethane (CH4) can be converted to methanol (CH3OH), which is a

renewable liquid hydrocarbon which is seen as the future low carbon fuel for shipping. When made with renewable energy, it is called green methanol and is considered a very low emission fuel source although some opponents argue there is not enough renewable energy to supply green methanol or green hydrogen (another fuel) to the shipping industry.

According to the Global Maritime Forum Methanol is moving towards initial scale, with around 60 methanol-capable vessels on the water, more than 300 further ships on order, and just under 20 ports offering green methanol bunkering. And the World Economic Forum noted that major players such as Maersk have already commissioned multiple container ships that will run on methanol; each expected to slash annual CO2 emissions by approximately 1 million tons.

If the methane is not converted to fuel, the IEA said, “then biomethane may be converted to hydrogen (H2) and CO2 and if this biogenic CO2 were stored underground (carbon, capture and storage) this would be a ‘negative emission pathway’. The CO2 could be used (carbon capture and use) to produce carbon-based chemicals.”

MARBEM has raised concerns that alternative methane-based fuels, including e-methane, e-LNG, biomethane, and bio-LNG, could perpetuate long-term reliance on methane, hindering progress towards international decarbonization goals.

The initiative collaborates with policy specialists, financial analysts, economists, and research organizations in 13 countries aiming to supply independent research to support policy decisions based on data and evidence.

Over the coming months, MARBEM intends to work closely with the International Maritime Organization and European Union regulators during FuelEU negotiations. The group will provide technical input to regulatory development processes aimed at keeping shipping aligned with global climate objectives.",http://blueeconomynews.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pexels-tomfisk-3223309.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 00:56:37.406148

In a joint statement by Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Duffy entitled “Taking Action to Defend America from the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax – the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) “Net-Zero Framework,” the US has leveled specific threats against any countries that vote to adopt the proscriptive mandates of the NZF at this week's meeting of the IMO Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) Second Extraordinary Session (MEPC /ES.2).

The high-profile animosity of the US to the NZF dates back to the MEPC's 83rd Session (MEPC 83) in April 2025, during which the US delegation dramatically walked out of deliberations in protest of the proposed NZF framework. Notwithstanding this unusual diplomatic maneuver, the proposed NZF was adopted by simple majority vote in MEPC 83 (63 countries approving, 16 rejecting and 24 abstaining), setting forth a two-prong framework for meeting the IMO's goal of net-zero carbon reduction from international shipping by 2050:

A global fuel standard that requires ships to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel's life cycle); and

A pricing mechanism with set prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the industry to lower emissions to comply with the global fuel standard.

Shortly after the April vote, the US expressly formalized what the delegation's walkout had implicitly symbolized in an August 2025 statement from the same triumvirate (Secretaries Rubio, Wright and Duffy) reemphasizing the US's fundamental opposition to the NZF: “Whatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization. These fuel standards would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale … Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail.”

And now, ahead of this week's vote to codify the NZF as a final, mandatory framework, the US has doubled down with a specifically enumerated range of punitive sanctions that may be levied against any countries that vote to approve the NZF:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations [both ostensibly via the Federal Maritime Commission] to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from US ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

Notably, the above list of potential retributive measures for NZF support came on the same day that the Office of the US Trade Representative issued amendments to its Section 310 Action (""China’s Targeting of the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance""). These dual efforts emphasize the Trump Administration's broad-spectrum focus on leveraging the maritime sector as a means of implementing its policy interests at the international level.

The prior April vote for preliminary approval of the NZF was opposed by 16 countries, consisting of Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the delegations of Bahrain, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Yemen. Prominent among the 63 approving nations were the European Union, China, Japan, Brazil and India.

Heading into this week's decisive approval vote, which will require a ⅔ majority (unlike the prior, preliminary April vote which only required a simple authority), prognosticators have anticipated that the approval block will retain the high-profile nations from April, as well as Canada, the UK, South Korea, Singapore, Chile, and others.

Speaking at the opening of the Extraordinary MEPC meeting on 14 October Dominguez recognised the concerns of both those who believe the NZF is not ambitious enough, and others feel it will place too much of a burden on the industry.

“Some of you are of the view that there will not be sufficient alternative fuels available to ensure compliance, whilst others believe that robust global regulations will send a clear demand signal to fuel and energy producers. Some of you would have preferred a stronger commitment to supporting developing states. Others would prefer additional support for early-movers,” he said.

The public debate over the NZF has become increasingly divisive in recent weeks with the Trump administration in the US going as far as to threaten crew visa restrictions, additional port fees, and the blocking of vessels calling the States that are flagged with nations that support the framework.

The Secretary-General tried to set a tone of diplomacy rather than conflict at the start of the meeting. “All these views continue to be valuable. And also during this week all these different positions will be respected.”

Dominguez sees the framework as better than the alternatives even though he does say it’s “not perfect”. However it provides a balanced way to work on different elements ahead of entry in to force in 2027. He said it was a set of goal-based provisions that did not exclude any specific fuel or technology from compliance.

“I am confident that the various proposals that have already been submitted regarding the reward, fuel certification, well-to-wake emissions, or the fund will address remaining concerns and provide additional certainty,” Dominguez said.

Full text below of the speech delivered on Tuesday, October 14, 2025:

""Good morning distinguished delegates, welcome to this second Extra-ordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee.

You are all well aware of the special importance of this week to the work of IMO.

As per the usual practice in this Organization, you have been intensely debating and carefully listening to each other’s proposals on how to best translate the strategic objectives of the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy into binding regulations for quite a number of sessions. This process has been inclusive and thorough.

Priorities and concerns have been duly considered in the final design of the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was approved at your last session.

I am aware that some of you may find the outcome not climate ambitious enough, and would have liked to see steeper reduction curves to effectively contribute to reducing global warming. Others, believe that the GFI reduction requirements are overly stringent and will place a burden on the shipping industry.

Some of you are of the view that there will not be sufficient alternative fuels available to ensure compliance, whilst others believe that robust global regulations will send a clear demand signal to fuel and energy producers. Some of you would have preferred a stronger commitment to supporting developing States. Others would prefer additional support for early-movers.

All these views continue to be valuable. And also during this week all these different positions will be respected.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework is not perfect. However, it provides a balanced basis for our further work on a number of elements ahead of its entry into force in 2027.

This way of working is nothing new here at IMO. It follows the long tradition of this Organization in developing global regulations for a global industry which has served both this Organization and the maritime sector well.

The energy and digital transition of shipping have already started. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long run. It will incite a proliferation of regional and national climate measures leading to inefficiency and a myriad of emissions pricing schemes, without IMO - all of you the Member States - or the industry having a say in how to use the collected revenue.

Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in IMO, your Organization.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework is a set of goal-based provisions. No specific fuel or technology has been excluded from the Net-Zero Framework as compliance option. I am confident that the various proposals that have already been submitted regarding the reward, fuel certification, well-to-wake emissions, or the fund will address remaining concerns and provide additional certainty.

Under the experienced leadership of your Chair, Mr. Harry Conway of Liberia, I have no doubt that this session will be a success, with the full support of both you and the Secretariat.

This session also marks the first MEPC meeting coordinated by Mr. David Osborn, who assumed the role of MED Director just a month ago, following the retirement of his predecessor, Mrs. Heike Deggim. I am certain that you will extend to him the support and cooperation he needs to succeed in fulfilling the duties and responsibilities entrusted to him, for which I thank you sincerely in advance.

Remember, this is IMO. Here, we are diplomatic and respectful to one another, we listen to everyone’s opinion, we take steps forward, and we are always looking to improve in this ever-changing sector.

You all adopted and agreed to stand by the IMO Code of Conduct, its purpose is clearly established: IMO is committed to enabling events, including meetings, at which everyone can participate in an inclusive, respectful and safe environment.

Have a good meeting.

Thank you, Chair.""",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/-164483.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 13:56:22.521158

Noting the dearth of zero- and near-zero carbon fuels available to shipping, Mr Wiernicki said LNG and biofuels are “mission-critical” to net zero and should not be penalised or discarded.
He concluded that without a clear path to green fuels “achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard”.
But is the Net-Zero Framework forcing the global shipping community to take a giant leap of faith by committing to use alternative fuels that are less energy dense and don’t exist?
Without clarity on zero and near-zero fuels and how this fund will be administered, shipping’s giant leap of faith could well be commercial suicide.","With the stage set for a potential vote to approve the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), some of the world’s most influential maritime stakeholders are calling for the industry to pump the brakes. The latest to voice their concern is a group of prominent Greek and Cypriot shipowners, who warned that the current pace of international regulation prioritises taxation over real progress on reducing ship emissions.

Speaking during a session at Maritime Cyprus in early October, Dynacom Tankers Management chairman, George Procopiou, said measures should be “doable, not desirable.” He pointed to operational and technical measures such as slow steaming, energy efficiency and carbon capture technology.

While saying the company is committed to decarbonisation, Diana Shipping chief executive, Semiramis Paliou, observed that shipping needed more clarity and noted that its share of global greenhouse gas emissions is small and additional costs levied on shipping would eventually be passed onto consumers.

Adding his concerns to those of the panellists, Cyprus minister of energy, commerce and industry, Giorgos Papanastasiou, was critical of Europe’s Green Deal, noting that it was well-intentioned, but at times surpassed technological capability, impacting competitiveness across industries. Mr Papanastasiou made the case for an all-of-the-above European energy policy to ensure energy security.

“Energy and competitiveness go hand in hand,” he said, warning that transitions made without viable alternatives risk deepening inequality.

And DNV Maritime chief executive, Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, has called for “pragmatism” in the pursuit of decarbonisation, including the pathway that starts with LNG and transitions to biomethane later. This is particularly important in the face of investments made in LNG-powered ships, infrastructure and supply.

“That’s quite a big statement to make from one of the world’s largest class societies”

Even more surprising was ABS chairman and chief executive, Christopher Wiernicki’s call during London International Shipping Week for IMO “to take a timeout” on its net-zero framework. Noting the dearth of zero- and near-zero carbon fuels available to shipping, Mr Wiernicki said LNG and biofuels are “mission-critical” to net zero and should not be penalised or discarded. He concluded that without a clear path to green fuels “achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard”. That’s quite a big statement to make from one of the world’s largest class societies.

Looming large over shipping are the threats by the Trump Administration to defeat the NZF which it said is “a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation.” The administration has warned IMO members that vote for the NZF would face retaliatory action.

But leading shipowning and maritime organisations are steadfast, continuing to back the adoption of the NZF. The International Chamber of Shipping, Asian Shipowners’ Association, European Shipowners, International Association of Ports and Harbors, International Bunker Association, World Shipping Council and International Transport Workers’ Federation jointly issued a press release to reiterate their strong support for adoption.

But is the Net-Zero Framework forcing the global shipping community to take a giant leap of faith by committing to use alternative fuels that are less energy dense and don’t exist? Additionally, shipping must trust IMO, a UN regulatory body, to levy and collect a global carbon tax - estimated at US$10Bn to US$15Bn annually - and reinvest that revenue into green fuels and technologies.

If the deal is adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Nations are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters through Friday. The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the climate deal.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework. The aim is to adopt it at this meeting.

That would be a major win for the climate, public health, the ocean and marine life, said Delaine McCullough at the Ocean Conservancy. For too long, ships have run on crude, dirty oil, she said.

“This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible,"" said McCullough, shipping program director for the nonprofit environmental advocacy group.

“The energy and digital transition of shipping have already started. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long run,” said Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the IMO, during his opening remarks at the meeting.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

Here's what to know:

The regulations, or “Net-zero Framework,” set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

There's a base level of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels. There's a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity.

If ships sail on fuels with lower emissions than what's required under the direct compliance target, they earn “surplus units,"" effectively credits.

Ships with the highest emissions would have to buy those credits from other ships under the pricing system, or from the IMO at $380 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach the base level of compliance. In addition, there's a penalty of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach direct compliance.

Ships that meet the base target but not the direct compliance one must pay the $100 per ton penalty too.

Ships whose greenhouse gas intensity is below a certain threshold will receive rewards for their performance.

The fees could generate $11 billion to $13 billion in revenue annually. That would go into an IMO fund to invest in fuels and technologies needed to transition to green shipping, reward low-emission ships and support developing countries so they aren’t left behind with dirty fuels and old ships.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

Ships could lower their emissions by using alternative fuels, running on electricity or using onboard carbon capture technologies. Wind propulsion and other energy efficiency advancements can also help reduce fuel consumption and emissions as part of an energy transition.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to reach net-zero around 2050.

If adopted, the regulations will enter into force in 2027. Large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, would have to pay penalties for their emissions starting in 2028, according to the IMO.

The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption.

Heavy fuel oil, liquefied natural gas and biodiesel will be dominant for most of the 2030s and 2040s, unless the IMO further incentivizes green alternatives, according to modeling from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The way the rules are designed essentially makes biofuels the cheapest fuel to use to comply, but biofuels require huge amounts of crops, pushing out less profitable food production, often leading to additional land clearance and deforestation, said Faig Abbasov, shipping director at T&E.

They are urging the IMO to promote scalable green alternatives, not recklessly promote biofuels produced from food crops, Abbasov said. As it stands now, the deal before the IMO won't deliver net-zero emissions by 2050, he added.

Green ammonia will get to a price that it’s appealing to ship owners in the late 2040s — quite late in the transition, according to the modeling. The NGO also sees green methanol playing an important role in the long-term transition.

The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but it's likely nations will vote on adopting the regulations.

At the April meeting, a vote was called to approve the contents of the regulations. The United States was notably absent in April, but plans to participate in this meeting.

During the opening session on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., Russia and a few other countries intervened to express their reservations about the meeting's agenda, which strongly focuses on adopting the Net-zero Framework by the end of the week.

Teresa Bui at Pacific Environment said she is optimistic “global momentum is on our side” and a majority of countries will support adoption. Bui is senior climate campaign director for the environmental nonprofit, which has consultative, or non-voting, status at the IMO.

If it fails, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed.

“It's difficult to know for sure what the precise consequences will be, but failure this week will certainly lead to delay, which means ships will emit more greenhouse gases than they would have done and for longer, continuing their outsized contribution to the climate crisis,” said John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, who is at the London meeting.

27 leading green fuel producers call for leaders to adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework and to provide specific incentives for green e-fuels.

27 leading green fuel producers are calling on IMO delegates to seize a ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to set shipping on a sustainable pathway.

At this week’s extraordinary session, leaders will come together in London to discuss the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) that was agreed in April earlier this year. A final vote is expected on Thursday or Friday.

The group of companies, including the likes of European Energy, Liquid Wind, ET Fuels, HIF Global and Zero Waste calls on the IMO to adopt the deal and to include specific incentives for green e-fuels which are currently at a disadvantage to LNG and biofuels. That is despite hydrogen-based e-fuels providing much greater emissions savings and being the only fuel that cannot. Together the signatories have projects in Africa, South and North America, Europe, South Asia as well as Oceania.

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO manager at T&E, said: “E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground. Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules. The current IMO Net-Zero Framework leaves e-fuels competing with cheaper and unsustainable options like fossil gas and first-generation biofuels. The message from producers is clear: to decarbonise shipping at scale, incentives for green e-fuels are essential. Without targeted incentives, shipping’s energy transition risks stalling before it begins.”

The United States says it is considering several actions against countries that support “this global carbon tax on American consumers”.","WASHINGTON, United States (CMC) — The United States (US) has issued a warning to countries, including those in the Caribbean, regarding a vote later this month in support of measures being pushed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on whether or not to support a Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NZF) aimed at reducing emissions in the maritime sector.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice,” a joint statement issued by the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of Transportation Sean P Duffy said.

The measure, which was approved in April 2025, is set for adoption in October 2025, during the Marine Environmental Protection Committee meeting that takes place until October 17.

IMO officials say 108 members are eligible to vote, including 10 from the Caribbean Community (Caricom), and if adopted, it will come into effect in 2028.

But Washington has said that President Donald Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.

It said that this week’s vote on the adoption “will be the first time that a UN (United Nations) organisation levies a global carbon tax on the world”.

“The administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10 per cent or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security,” the joint statement said.

The NZF seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping to align with the 2050 net-zero target. Key components include a Global Fuel Standard (GFS) setting annual greenhouse gas intensity reduction targets, a two-tier carbon price mechanism, and a credit trading system funded by penalties to reward zero and near-zero-emission fuels and support a just transition.

The NZF presents a new regulatory era in which ships will be required to gradually adopt fuels that are typically three to four times more expensive compared with conventional fossil fuels. Given the long lifespan of ships, shipowners should prepare now for the new net-zero GHG emission regulations to ensure cost-effective compliance, both at the ship and the fleet level.

The framework will apply to all oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage (GT). These ships are responsible for over 85 per cent of global shipping emissions and are already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection. Ships under 5,000 GT are currently not covered.

Washington said that the NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states “to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided”.

During Oct. 14-17, the UN agency's Marine Environment Protection Committee will hold an extraordinary session to discuss the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework, with a vote highly anticipated as both camps show no signs of compromising.

The US, which has opposed the regulatory piece, reiterated ahead of the meeting that its supporters could face US port fees or ban, visa restrictions, sanctions, or commercial penalties associated with US government contracts.

""The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a joint statement Oct. 10.

""We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.""

In response, the European Commission issued a statement Oct. 12, reinforcing European countries' support for the framework due to its potential to decarbonize the shipping sector and ensure a global level playing field.

""The EU views the Net-Zero Framework as a significant milestone and calls for its adoption at IMO,"" the EU's executive arm said. ""After the adoption, the European Commission will review the relevant EU regulations in place.""

Brussels has extended its Emissions Trading System to cover shipping since 2024, while imposing a cap on the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of marine energy in EU-related trades from January 2025.

This April, the IMO framework was approved in a 63-16 vote, with support from EU countries, China, Japan, Brazil, the UK, Singapore, and some of the world's largest flag states like Panama, but opposition from some Middle Eastern oil-producing countries.

The US abstained from the vote then, but a State Department spokesperson confirmed to Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, that an interagency delegation will be present this time.

Adoption of the new regulation requires a two-thirds majority of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships' Annex VI signatories, whose flag states need to administer at least half of the world's fleet in gross tonnage.

Fotini Ioannidou, director of waterborne transport at the European Commission's Directorate General for Mobility and Transport, told ship.energy that ""a large majority"" -- including all EU member states -- would back the rules again in the coming days.

Fuel economics

Some of the largest shipping and bunker industry associations have voiced support for the framework, saying a uniform set of rules would benefit companies in maritime transportation.

""Only global rules will decarbonize a global industry,"" the Asian Shipowners' Association, European Community Shipowners' Association, International Association of Ports and Harbors, International Bunker Industry Association, International Transport Workers' Federation, International Chamber of Shipping and World Shipping Council said in a statement earlier this month. ""Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonization.""

The IMO rules are designed to reduce the price gap between fossil and sustainable marine fuels by placing a cost on GHG from marine energy use from 2028, and some critics, including the US, have expressed worries over their inflationary effects.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $483.73/metric ton in Singapore last month, compared with $579.17/mtVLSFOe for LNG, $691.92/mtVLSFOe for B24 biobunker fuel with 24% used cooking oil methyl ester, and $1,897.44/mtVLSFOe for 100% sustainable methanol, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator(opens in a new tab).

Contentious debates

Last month, some of the largest oil shipping companies, like Frontline and Maran Tankers, expressed concerns that the current regulatory design would call for ""an abrupt switch"" toward decarbonization technologies that have yet to be fully developed.

Classification society DNV and American Bureau of Shipping said that the proposed regulation would punish LNG use after 2030 and offer no clear decarbonization pathway due to its flaws.

However, 26 green fuel producers, including European Energy, MOEVE and Liquid Winds, have called on IMO member states to adopt the framework and provide more incentives to use e-fuels.

""Without immediate and unambiguous signals for the production and uptake of e-fuels, the global fleet risks 'locking in' short-term fuel pathways that undermine both ambition and cost-effectiveness over time,"" the companies said in a statement Oct. 13.

Based on Boston Consulting Group's estimates, the market for low-carbon marine fuels could be over $10 billion in 2028 before a further hike to exceed $100 billion in 2035 due to the framework's implementation.

""These regulations will transform the competitive landscape not just for shippers but for developers of low-carbon fuels and players looking to invest in them,"" BCG said in a note.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-14 19:56:07.196541

Speeding up action The IMO NZF scheme is based on a greenhouse gas (GHG) fuel standard for international shipping emissions.
Ships in this category have significantly reduced their GHG emissions per unit of energy used.
Moreover, it does not consider activity growth in the international sector, meaning international shipping GHG emissions.
Yet, considering the weaknesses highlighted in the above sections, particularly the low effective carbon price, revenue flows are consequently expected to be limited, according to CMW’s forthcoming study.","The International Maritime Organisation’s Net-Zero Framework is a necessary starting point but urgently needs greater ambition and binding revenue earmarking for decarbonisation and a just transition.

The shipping sector accounts for 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This share could soar to 10% by 2050 at current growth rates.

Although the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) updated its climate strategy in 2023, the new targets remain far below what is needed to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal. Achieving that goal would require a 45% reduction in emissions by 2030, versus 20-30% in the IMO Strategy, which is, in itself, grossly overstated as our study will reveal. This means that the international shipping sector, under the stewardship of the IMO, is drifting way off course.

At its 83rd session in April 2025, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) was expected to agree on a set of mid-term measures to steer international shipping towards full decarbonisation, in line with the organisation’s updated greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy. Rather than adopting an effective carbon levy, the IMO settled on a weak compromise, which it optimistically called its ‘Net-Zero Framework’ (NZF): a hybrid approach combining a GHG fuel standard with a limited carbon pricing mechanism.

While a diplomatic success in troubled times and a starting point for action, the NZF falls far short of the ambition demanded by the escalating climate crisis. As civil society organisations warned right after the deal was sealed in April, the scheme doesn’t lead to enough emission reductions, does not price enough emissions, does not price those high enough, and does not generate enough revenue.

A forthcoming CMW study, led by Professor Michele Cincera from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), will provide data and in-depth analysis to highlight these critical gaps. The study will be published in November. This article provides a preview of the study’s main arguments and proposals before the IMO votes on the deal this week.

While the NZF falls short of what is needed to tackle shipping emissions, it is essential that IMO member states vote in favour of the deal, work to strengthen it as soon as possible, and resist attempts to dilute its provisions further. Rejecting the framework and the chance of improving it would only be playing into the hands of the Trump administration and Big Oil, and delay the urgently needed decarbonisation of the shipping sector.

We call on IMO national delegations and relevant stakeholders to close the ambition gap as soon as possible through more ambitious GHG fuel intensity (GFI) trajectories, broader emissions coverage, and binding revenue earmarking for climate action and vulnerable states.

Speeding up action

The IMO NZF scheme is based on a greenhouse gas (GHG) fuel standard for international shipping emissions. It is a command-and-control type of policy that operates through standards and penalties, comparable in its functioning to the EU’s FuelEU Regulation. Each year, it sets emissions targets through pre-determined GHG intensity reduction factors (also known as ‘Z factors’). As these emission reduction percentages become more ambitious over time, ships and fleets must lower their GHG fuel intensity (GFI), meaning the amount of GHG emitted per unit of energy used. For example, ships and fleets could lower their GHG fuel intensity with cleaner fuels.

Z factors are currently defined for each year from 2028, when the scheme is set to begin, to 2035 only. Two levels of ambition are provided: a less demanding ‘Base Target’ trajectory and a more ambitious ‘Direct Compliance’ curve. A Base Target level is also indicated for 2040. However, the IMO NZF does not refer to 2050 – the year around which international shipping must reach carbon neutrality under the IMO’s GHG Strategy.

Figure 1 outlines these trajectories and highlights the various compliance and non-compliance zones that fleets may fall into, depending on the amount of GHG emitted per unit of energy used.

The green zone is a first compliance zone (direct compliance), where ships meet the most ambitious decarbonisation targets. Ships in this category have significantly reduced their GHG emissions per unit of energy used. They earn surplus units as a reward, meaning emissions units they have not used due to outperforming the direct compliance target. These surplus units can be sold to non-compliant (tier 2) ships in the red zone, providing additional revenue for the most ambitious fleets.

It is crucial to highlight that the NZF is not designed to deliver an absolute reduction in emissions levels – unlike a universal levy or the EU ETS. Instead, it targets the GHG intensity levels of the energy used. Moreover, it does not consider activity growth in the international sector, meaning international shipping GHG emissions. Therefore, total emissions can continue to rise, provided that the GHG intensity of the energy consumed is decreasing.

CMW’s forthcoming study, based on a realistic annual emissions growth rate of 3% in international shipping, will demonstrate that the emission reductions achieved through the IMO NZF’s Z factors fall significantly short of meeting the targets set by the IMO’s GHG Strategy.

This 2023 strategy had set a base target of 20% of emission reductions, and striving for 30%, by 2030, compared with a 2008 baseline, and a base target of 70% emission reductions, and striving for 80%, by 2040. There is currently a tangible risk that the NZF hybrid scheme would lead to missing these targets, which would put the IMO completely off course to achieve its own GHG Strategy targets and even further away from meeting Paris Agreement objectives.

To tackle these shortcomings, we recommend:

→ IMO national delegations should, at the very least, significantly accelerate the reduction of GHG intensity emissions mandated by the Z factors by increasing the level of the latter to reach the IMO’s 2030 and 2040 targets.

→ Delegations should develop and agree on solutions that directly address absolute emissions, such as a universal levy or cap-and-trade system would do.

Although the IMO Net-Zero Framework includes carbon pricing, the scheme’s hybrid design weakens it by applying that price to a portion share of emissions.

The basis of the framework is a GHG fuel standard, where emissions reductions are driven by the increasing Z factors (i.e., decreasing GFI). On top of this, fleets not meeting the direct compliance and/or base target must purchase remedial units: Tier 1 Remedial Units in the former case and Tier 2 Remedial Units (or traded Surplus Units) in the latter. Tier 2 RUs or SUs act as a penalty for failing to meet the defined standard. While the Tier 2 RU price is set at $380 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, the SU price will depend on future market prices, but analyses indicate their price may settle at only around $300 a tonne.

The hybrid element of the scheme rests on the requirement for fleets to pay for a carbon price even if they meet the base target but fail to meet the more ambitious direct compliance target. In this case, fleets must pay a cheaper tier 1 RU, costing $100/tCO2eq. This is the carbon pricing component of the IMO NZF.

However, due to the narrow design of the Tier 1, Carbon Market Watch and T&E estimate that less than 15% of total emissions are being priced through 2035. This limited coverage is the main reason why NZF’s effective carbon price remains so low. Further evidence and data on this will be presented in CMW’s forthcoming study in November.

In carbon pricing schemes, revenue generation is a major co-benefit next to emissions reductions. For instance, the EU ETS generated about €40 billion of revenue in 2024 through all the sectors it covers. Regarding shipping, the EU ETS raised €2 billion from the limited routes currently covered by the scheme in 2024. With the full phasing in of the sector, this should reach about €5 billion in 2026.

Carbon pricing revenue is key because it can directly contribute to the climate goal that the mechanism was established to pursue, namely decarbonisation. This can be achieved through supporting industry in the construction and uptake of clean technologies, such as wind propulsion and green synthetic fuels, while helping to make up for some of the policies’ potential undesirable effects. These effects could include the increasing cost of, for example, food supply for the most vulnerable citizens, regions, or nations.

The IMO NZF will generate revenue through the carbon pricing element, which rests on tier 1 remedial unit and penalty payments (Tier 2 remedial units) for ships not complying with the base target. These payments will flow to a newly established IMO Net-Zero Fund.

Yet, considering the weaknesses highlighted in the above sections, particularly the low effective carbon price, revenue flows are consequently expected to be limited, according to CMW’s forthcoming study.

To ensure that adequate revenue is generated for decarbonisation and climate justice, we recommend:

→ A just and equitable transition (JET) must be a key priority for the allocation of revenue, alongside the scaling up of zero or near-zero emission fuels and technologies. This is especially important given that JET is central to the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy.",https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/emjeii-beattie-CHyQZIMPYRk-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 10:56:22.815294

This inclusive and thorough process culminated in the approval of the IMO Net-Zero Framework at the previous session, with priorities and concerns carefully considered in its final design. While some view the framework as not ambitious enough in terms of climate goals, others believe the greenhouse gas intensity (GFI) reduction requirements may be too demanding for the shipping industry.

The Secretary-General noted differing opinions on the availability of alternative fuels to meet compliance, with some expecting that strong global regulations will send a clear market signal to fuel and energy producers. Additionally, perspectives vary regarding the level of support needed for developing States compared to early adopters.

All these views continue to be valuable. And also during this week all these different positions will be respected. The IMO Net-Zero Framework is not perfect. However, it provides a balanced basis for our further work on a number of elements ahead of its entry into force in 2027.

…Arsenio Dominguez highlighted.

Furthermore, the energy and digital transitions in shipping are already underway. However, the absence of unified global regulations risks higher long-term costs and the fragmentation of regional and national climate measures, resulting in inefficiencies and a patchwork of emissions pricing schemes without coordinated oversight by IMO and its Member States.

Prolonged uncertainty may delay investments and undermine confidence in IMO. The framework consists of goal-based provisions that do not exclude any specific fuel or technology as compliance options.

This year marks an important milestone for global climate diplomacy, with the United Nations finally taking action on one of the world’s biggest polluters: international shipping.

In April 2025, governments reached a historic agreement at the UN’s shipping arm – the International Maritime Organization (IMO) – on the Net-Zero Framework.

The policy will be the world’s first and binding global emission pricing on any sector. For organisations like ours that have been following the IMO debates for several years, this result was proof that climate multilateralism is still alive and can deliver meaningful action.

What makes the Net-Zero Framework unique is that it includes an emission pricing element requiring shipping companies to pay a penalty fee for failing to comply with carbon intensity targets for the energy they use on ships. These penalties are projected to generate $10–15 billion annually from 2028 in climate finance.

Yet, while the policy’s adoption in October will mark a breakthrough, critical details that still remain to be decided will make or break this flagship climate law before it enters into force in 2027.

The most contentious issue yet to be finalised is which types of energy will be incentivised on ships as alternatives to fossil fuels – in other words, which alternative fuels will be recognised as delivering genuine, deep emissions reductions.

Gas and biofuel risk

The Framework is currently “fuel neutral,” meaning that all fuel types could qualify, regardless of their actual climate performance. This opens the door to cheap but harmful solutions, like high-risk biofuels and fossil gas, known as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG).

High-risk biofuels, like much of those derived from soy and palm oil, are especially concerning. Their production all too often is linked to deforestation, violation of land rights, especially for Indigenous peoples and customary landowners, water stress, and food insecurity, and in some cases, even higher emissions than fossil fuels.

The scale of the problem is quite staggering and the consequences could be disastrous for global food security and soil health worldwide. A study has estimated that satisfying shipping’s biofuel demand could require up to 35 million hectares of land by 2030 – an area roughly the size of Germany – and consume the equivalent of 300 million bottles of vegetable oil per day.

The impacts of high-risk biofuels have already been felt in communities and lands in Latin America, where expansion of soy production is the second-largest driver of deforestation. In South-East Asia, 45% of palm oil plantations have occupied previously forested land and have expanded by 370% between 1990 and 2023. Communities in these regions bear the brunt, often losing their land and livelihoods in the process.

Quantitative accounting

A safeguard against these harms is to quantitatively account for indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions. ILUCs occur when agricultural land is diverted to biofuel production pushing food or feed production into new areas and driving the destruction of carbon-rich ecosystems.

If ILUC emissions are ignored, cheap biofuels will inevitably flood the market making them the go-to solution for meeting the shipping climate targets, jeopardizing shipping’s climate targets.

Worse, large-scale investment in high-risk biofuels could slow the development and uptake of truly sustainable alternatives, such as green e-fuels, given the limited supply of renewable resources and investment capital.

To unlock this finance, governments should provide clear incentives for zero-emission solutions such as maximising energy efficiency and wind propulsion, batteries and solar energy, and renewable e-fuels. Only these genuinely clean alternatives will help achieve short- and medium-term climate goals while keeping transition costs down and ensuring renewable energy isn’t wasted.

Make fuel from renewables

In the long run, shipping’s decarbonisation hinges on the large-scale production and adoption of e-fuels made from renewable electricity. Growing demand for such fuels would help secure investments in future and existing projects especially in countries with strong potential for green hydrogen production, many of them located in Africa and South America.

Equally important is ensuring that the revenues generated by the Framework – billions of dollars annually – are distributed fairly. The funds must not only assist the maritime sectors of the most climate-vulnerable nations but also drive the development of resilient renewable energy infrastructure that advances the transition of the shipping sector.

This October and in the months ahead, we – the Clean Shipping Coalition, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, and WWF – will follow the IMO’s negotiations. Our role will be to provide governments with rigorous, science-based analysis to ensure decisions are taken in the interest of the climate, biodiversity, and communities worldwide.

While saying the company is committed to decarbonisation, Diana Shipping chief executive, Semiramis Paliou, observed that shipping needed more clarity and noted that its share of global greenhouse gas emissions is small and additional costs levied on shipping would eventually be passed onto consumers.

Adding his concerns to those of the panellists, Cyprus minister of energy, commerce and industry, Giorgos Papanastasiou, was critical of Europe’s Green Deal, noting that it was well-intentioned, but at times surpassed technological capability, impacting competitiveness across industries. Mr Papanastasiou made the case for an all-of-the-above European energy policy to ensure energy security.

“Energy and competitiveness go hand in hand,” he said, warning that transitions made without viable alternatives risk deepening inequality.

And DNV Maritime chief executive, Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, has called for “pragmatism” in the pursuit of decarbonisation, including the pathway that starts with LNG and transitions to biomethane later. This is particularly important in the face of investments made in LNG-powered ships, infrastructure and supply.

“That’s quite a big statement to make from one of the world’s largest class societies”

Even more surprising was ABS chairman and chief executive, Christopher Wiernicki’s call during London International Shipping Week for IMO “to take a timeout” on its net-zero framework. Noting the dearth of zero- and near-zero carbon fuels available to shipping, Mr Wiernicki said LNG and biofuels are “mission-critical” to net zero and should not be penalised or discarded. He concluded that without a clear path to green fuels “achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard”. That’s quite a big statement to make from one of the world’s largest class societies.

Looming large over shipping are the threats by the Trump Administration to defeat the NZF which it said is “a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation.” The administration has warned IMO members that vote for the NZF would face retaliatory action.

But leading shipowning and maritime organisations are steadfast, continuing to back the adoption of the NZF. The International Chamber of Shipping, Asian Shipowners’ Association, European Shipowners, International Association of Ports and Harbors, International Bunker Association, World Shipping Council and International Transport Workers’ Federation jointly issued a press release to reiterate their strong support for adoption.

But is the Net-Zero Framework forcing the global shipping community to take a giant leap of faith by committing to use alternative fuels that are less energy dense and don’t exist? Additionally, shipping must trust IMO, a UN regulatory body, to levy and collect a global carbon tax - estimated at US$10Bn to US$15Bn annually - and reinvest that revenue into green fuels and technologies. Without clarity on zero and near-zero fuels and how this fund will be administered, shipping’s giant leap of faith could well be commercial suicide.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/115/John_Snyder_Riviera_1200w.JPG,N,,2025-10-14 07:56:33.492842

During an extraordinary meeting due to conclude on Friday, the MEPC will discuss draft additions to the Marpol treaty that include the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF), a legal text which supporters claim is vital if the air pollution emitted by ships is to be minimised.

Part of a section known as Annex VI, the proposed updates would introduce a global fuel standard that limits the intensity of fuel emissions, as well as some form of pricing and compliance mechanism – for example a levy or credit trading system – for ships that exceed any agreed threshold.

One leading fresh produce shipper told Fruitnet the vote could have a massive impact on the business for years to come: “We keenly await the outcome of this weeks MEPC session – especially the decision to adopt, or not, the NZF. This decision will inform our strategies for vessels, equipment and [fuel] for the next five years at least, if not beyond.”

Critics, most notably in the US and Middle East, argue that the NZF represents an attack on consumers, energy providers, and shipping companies themselves, while also favouring other countries including China.

The US has even gone as far as saying that it will retaliate against IMO members that vote in favour of the net zero emissions plan.

In a joint statement issued in August, leading figures in Trump’s cabinet said: “The Trump Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.”

They added: “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavour fail.”

The Marpol Convention, the short name for the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, is one of the most important international treaties for protecting the marine environment.

It was adopted by the IMO in November 1973 and expanded five years later in response to a series of tanker accidents, before it entered into force in October 1983.

The proposed text stretches 120 pages and comprises six core chapters — spanning general definitions, emissions controls, carbon intensity rules, reporting, compliance verification, and the new NZF regime itself.

Beyond the NZF, the package also folds in prior decisions: MEPC 82’s multi-mode engine rules and data reporting clarifications, and MEPC 83 additions on IMO’s ship fuel data system, short-term greenhouse gas (GHG) measures, and designating the Northeast Atlantic as a new SOx/NOx/PM Emission Control Area.

Rewards are baked in too — carriers using zero or near-zero (ZNZ) fuels and technologies can receive credits drawn from the proposed IMO Net Zero Fund. The fund is tasked with disbursing revenue to support technology transfer, capacity building, and mitigation in vulnerable states.

Critics will argue the NZF is a global carbon tax by another name. Advocates counter that it’s the only path to coherent global climate rules in shipping. The most contentious issues expected are the structure of fuel intensity tiers, the pricing of emissions units, and the enforcement regime. How LNG and biofuels fit into the framework will also be a hot source of debate this week.

With more than 30 submissions in hand and cross-jurisdictional tension rising, this MEPC marks a crossroads: adopt unified regulation or risk splintered regional mandates undermining trade and fairness, with the US in particular making its disdain known for the proposed legislation.

The International Chamber of Shipping has two submissions with the IMO, with the lobby group arguing the IMO’s global approach needs to be supported now and that this requires financial incentives for early movers so that an alternative fuel market can develop and fragmentation of regulation can be avoided. The ICS is also urging the IMO to develop implementation guidelines without delay to aid the process.

Among the many submissions viewed by Splash, there appears to be a wide push for getting the IMO Net Zero Fund operational as a top priority, and a number of countries say that it should start disbursement of revenues to developing and small island countries – accumulated from remedial contributions – by 2029, not later. This, they say, is the only way to gain momentum in the transition to alternative fuels.

Splash has reported repeatedly on the US’s opposition to the proposed legislation. The Trump administration’s weaponisation of trade and shipping reached a new level on Friday, with Washington threatening to sanction nations that vote in favour of the NZF.

In a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said countries backing the IMO’s decarbonisation plan could face port bans, visa restrictions on seafarers, punitive vessel fees, and even sanctions on government officials deemed to be “sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.”

In its submission to the IMO, the US “invites” member states to oppose the IMO proposal, because it risks imposing significant economic burdens on the shipping industry and its customers, driving inflation for consumers. Affordable and proven transitional fuels like LNG and biofuels are unfairly penalised, especially given the lack of clear existing alternatives, the American submission argues, while suggesting the rapid GHG fuel intensity reduction targets could lead to excessive revenue accumulation without achieving meaningful environmental goals. The Americans also hit out at the management and disbursement of revenues under the framework, claiming it is ill-defined and insufficient to ensure the efficacy of any emissions reduction framework.

Meanwhile, six oil-producing states in a joint submission have demanded that the framework be delayed.

The joint submission from Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and Venezuela argues that the proposed framework, including the establishment of the IMO Net-Zero Fund, is out of MARPOL’s scope. The MARPOL Convention’s scope is purely technical with no mandate or provisions related to economic considerations such as establishing a framework to collect from private entities and disburse funds, and to allocate penalties for non-compliance, the submission maintains, claiming that there is no prior precedent within the United Nations system and IMO for adopting a mechanism enabling a UN body to require financial contributions to be paid to the UN body for non-compliance of private entities, such as transportation and shipping companies. The enforcement mechanisms under such bodies rely on flag states to regulate ships under their jurisdiction rather than establishing a direct accountability measure against privately owned ships, the submission from the oil producers argues.

The IMO rarely resorts to formal voting, but sources in London say a ballot looks increasingly likely. If consensus cannot be reached, adoption will require a two-thirds majority — 108 of the 176 member states that have ratified MARPOL Annex VI.

Analysts say the vote could hinge on a small number of undecided states — including several from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America — where political and economic alignments are in flux.

A significant push is underway for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to formally embed wind propulsion within its proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF), ahead of the MEPC’s 2nd Extraordinary Session (MEPC/ES.2).

Recognition of Wind Propulsion

BAR Technologies and the International Windship Association (IWSA) are leading the call for the IMO to formally recognize wind propulsion as a key, zero-emission component of the NZF. They stress that upcoming decisions will determine whether the shipping industry commits to meaningful decarbonization or faces “delay and uncertainty.”

Zero-Emission Status: The core argument, highlighted in the IWSA’s submission, is that “Wind is free at source and the only truly zero-emission energy available at scale to the global fleet today.”

Decisive Moment: Technology providers, sustainability advocates, and industry coalitions believe that consistent and formal recognition of wind energy is essential to establish a practical, cost-effective, and equitable path to net-zero.

Litmus Test for Neutrality: IWSA sees the consistent treatment of wind as a “litmus test for the IMO’s commitment to technology and energy-source neutrality.”

Building a Consistent Framework

The NZF’s potential to provide certainty, unlock finance, and accelerate innovation relies heavily on consistent accounting across all zero-emission technologies. Failure to do so risks distorting technology uptake and funding allocation.

Clarity and Cohesion: Given the “significant” workload required to implement the NZF—including lifecycle assessments, compliance guidelines, and the design of funding and pricing mechanisms—it is crucial to integrate wind from the outset, rather than treating it as a late-stage addition.

Global Signal: By systematically including wind, the IMO can deliver a framework that is neutral, transparent, and fair, positioning wind alongside alternative fuels and other energy efficiency solutions.

Practical Path Forward Principles

Industry consensus is crystallizing around four key principles to ensure wind propulsion’s successful inclusion:

Neutrality, not Exceptions: Wind must be recognized as a zero-carbon energy source with full inclusion in all intensity and compliance frameworks.

Data and Verification: IWSA proposes streamlined methods to capture and validate wind energy contributions through the IMO Data Collection System.

Fair Access to Funding: Wind propulsion should be proportionately rewarded within the NZF Fund to support early fleet-scale adoption.

Scalability and Co-Benefits: Wind offers inherent advantages, including immediate fuel savings, operational resilience, and emissions reductions for both newbuilds and retrofits.

Maintain a Global Lane: A unified NZF is preferred over fragmented national regimes to ensure competitiveness and clarity for all industry actors.

Summary on the NZF The IMO NZF is very far from perfect.
It increases the cost of shipping without creating any certainty that the funds raised will do anything to create affordable alternatives.","The main agenda item at this week’s special meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in London is to vote whether or not to adopt the organisation’s draft Net Zero Framework (NZF), the result of ten years of ever-more-intense negotiations.

Background

The IMO is an interesting beast as multilateral organisations go. Created in 1959 by UN convention, its 175 members each have one vote. Unlike other parts of the UN, the the world’s superpowers walk the halls of the IMO as equals with the smallest nations. Which seems fair, given that the three biggest global fleets by tonnage are registered in Liberia, Panama and the Marshall Islands. Mighty China comes in only 6th, and the US doesn’t make the top 20. Malta and Greece are the only European nations that make the top ten, although if all EU-registered ships sailed under one flag, the EU would be second only to Liberia.

The IMO also wields actual power. Unlike, say, the UNFCCC, its rulings are binding in law and taken seriously by members and by the maritime industry. Its decisions on low-sulphur fuels, for instance, led to huge volumes of investments in refineries and substantial changes in shipping operations.

Net Zero Framework

The NZF would apply to ships over 5,000 gross tonnage (covering around 90% of maritime CO₂), creating a binding global regime to reduce shipping emissions to net zero by 2050. It would introduces a global fuel standard requiring progressively lower lifecycle (well‑to‑wake) greenhouse gas intensity, with a pricing scheme obliging ships exceeding thresholds to buy remedial units while rewarding zero‑ and near‑zero‑fuel users. If ratified, enforcement would begin in 2028.

Revenues would go to an IMO fund that would make grants to support innovation in clean shipping, clean infrastructure, and an equitable transition for developing states. The design of this fund and its rules of engagement are yet to be decided. Small island nations in particular are concerned that it will ignore the impact of the NZF on all their imports, exports and tourism, and spray money at experimental and expensive zero-carbon fuels.

Because of this unusually democratic and legally binding process, there is a huge behind-the-scenes power play going on over the NZF. Europe (including the UK and Norway) is very much in favour; the U.S. and most of the world’s oil exporters are very much against. China, as a major shipbuilder and player in all things low-carbon, has come out strongly in favour.

At a committee meeting in April 2025 to decide whether to put the Framework to a vote by the IMO plenary, out of 103 eligible countries present, 63 voted in favour, 16 against, and 24 abstained. Since then, the U.S. has been wielding all the diplomatic weapons in its armoury to get nations to change their minds: calling it a “European-led neo-colonial export” and a “global carbon tax”, and threatening sanctions, visa restrictions and denial of port access to countries that support the NZF.

It is impossible to tell which way the vote will go this week. Whatever happens will no doubt be interpreted as evidence of the US’s ability to bend international community to its will.

The economics of low carbon shipping fuels

While I have no special insight into what IMO members are thinking this week, I can perhaps furnish a bit of insight into the economics of the low-carbon fuels that the NZF wants to promote.

Let’s start with ammonia. Ammonia has 63% of the gravimetric energy density of VLSFO. That means you need to buy 1.6x the number of tonnes of ammonia to steam the same distance. So $800 per tonne of ammonia is equivalent to $1,280 per tonne of VLSFO, a premium of around 120% to current VLSFO fuel prices.

If you can get the cost of green ammonia down to $600/T (big if, and you need to do that in a port, not in the middle of nowhere), that’s still a premium on an energy basis of 60% to VLSFO.

But also, ammonia has only 72% of the volumetric density of VLSFO. So your 1.6x as many tonnes will require 2.2x the size of fuel tanks, cutting into cargo space. And that’s before you meet your increased safety costs, both in capex and opex: double-walled refrigerated fuel tanks, ammonia spill containment systems, upgraded piping, more expensive engines, ventilation, detection systems, crew safety training, etc.

So switching the global shipping fleet to ammonia would increase fuel costs by 60% to 120% while reducing capacity and adding risk - resulting in around a 20-40% increase in total shipping costs. With total global shipping costs of around $400 billion per year, that’s an $80billion to $120 billion per year drag on the global economy - a big number, though only about 0.1% of global GDP.

Switching to methanol avoids a lot of the operational complexity of switching to ammonia, but it’s more expensive. Even with the cheapest conceivable green hydrogen and using biogenic carbon (if you can find it), its cost would be equivalent to a VLSFO cost of $1760 per tonne, around 3x as expensive as the fossil version and 2x the cost of green ammonia.

If you don’t like the idea of making your methanol using biogenic carbon, you can try Direct Air Capture. However, the resulting e-Methanol would cost around 10x the cost of VLSFO, with no pathway to the 5x cost reduction that would leave it roughly competitive with green ammonia at only twice the cost of fossil fuel.

Summary on the NZF

The IMO NZF is very far from perfect. It increases the cost of shipping without creating any certainty that the funds raised will do anything to create affordable alternatives.

Any regulation that drives shipping to zero-carbon shipping fuels will contribute to general inflation, but it will impose particularly significant costs on the shipping industry and any geography or industry dependent on it.

That’s not to say we don’t do anything about shipping emissions - of course we have to - but let’s go into the process with our eyes open about the cost and justice implications.

On balance, I am in favour of the draft NZF going through, but there is a lot of work to be done to make it effective and efficient. If that doesn’t happen - either before or after ratification - I do not expect to see the regulation survive a decade.

What can be voted in by 175 nations can also be voted out.

Coda: nuclear-powered ships

I can’t leave without mentioning nuclear powered ships.

Regular readers will know that I am perfectly happy with nuclear power, as long as it is walk-away safe and affordable. I’ll leave others to decide what walk-away safe means in the context of a proliferation of nuclear power stations on ships. In terms of affordability, yes, we have put lots of nuclear power stations on ships and submarines but, no, we have never done so for cost reasons.

A nuclear-powered ship is likely to have a huge up-front cost but there is a possible route to economic viability. It would also have a very low variable cost. So a nuclear powered ship would not be subject to the same speed limits as one desperately trying to limit its emissions or eke out its expensive low-carbon fuel.

A nuclear-powered ship could cut journey times, cutting the number of ships needed to supply a route, cutting supply chain length, and cutting supply chain working capital for whoever charters it. Interesting.

Thanks to Mikal Boe of Core Power for that insight, and I look forward to digging in over coming months.

The international shipping industry, which facilitates approximately 80% of global trade, is at a crucial turning point.

According to the World Bank, it generates around 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, a figure that would make it the sixth-largest emitter if it were a country.

UNCTAD: Review of Maritime Transport 2024

Maritime trade volumes grew 2.4% in 2023 while global GDP rose 2.7%

Between 2025 and 2029, it predicts maritime trade will average +2.4% a year and containers +2.7%.

In response, industry leaders and regulators are navigating a complex path toward decarbonisation, with major implications for the global energy market.

At the COP28 climate conference, shipping chief executives united to call for a definitive end date for the construction of new vessels powered solely by fossil fuels.

They urged the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to establish the necessary regulatory environment to accelerate the transition to green fuels.

This call to action was followed by the approval of a landmark net-zero framework by the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in April 2025, which is anticipated to be formally adopted in October 2025 and come into force by 2027.

“We have the technology and the willingness - we just need the clear regulatory framework to accelerate the energy transition in the shipping industry”

IEA: How the shipping sector could save on energy costs

Shipping’s energy intensity fell by about 30% between 2008 and 2023

Without those gains, 2023 marine fuel demand would have been roughly 1.8 million barrels per day higher

That avoided demand equated to around US$60bn in fuel costs in 2023

Average commercial ship size is now more than 50% larger than in 2008

Average operating speeds fell by about 10% versus 2008 as slow steaming became standard practice.

“We believe that a regulatory framework and clear targets are crucial to accelerating the introduction of alternative fuels and reducing our carbon footprint”

The IMO's framework introduces two primary measures for all oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnes: a global fuel standard and a pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions.

The fuel standard will progressively limit the pollution intensity of marine fuels, while the pricing mechanism is expected to apply a carbon price, potentially around US$100 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent, to incentivise emissions reduction.

A ship’s emissions will be quantified using a greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) metric, measuring emissions across the entire fuel lifecycle.

Results from the Fourth IMO Greenhouse Gas Study

Total shipping greenhouse gas emissions rose from 977 Mt in 2012 to 1,076 Mt in 2018 and CO₂ rose from 962 Mt to 1,056 Mt

Shipping’s share of global anthropogenic greenhouse gases increased from 2.76% to 2.89% between 2012 and 2018

Voyage-based international-shipping CO₂ rose from 701 Mt to 740 Mt between 2012 and 2018

Carbon intensity improved by 21% (AER) and 29% (EEOI) in 2018 versus 2008

Without stronger measures, total shipping emissions are projected to be 90 to 130% of 2008 levels by 2050.

Not everyone agrees. In late January 2025, a group of countries including Brazil, China and South Africa sent a letter to IMO warning of negative trade impacts from a universal GHG contribution.

In April 2025, the United States withdrew from the carbon pricing talks and urged others to follow. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement that US President Donald Trump’s administration will “not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people” and described the IMO’s framework as “effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation”. “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavour fail,” the statement concludes.

“Shipping is at the forefront of technological innovation when it comes to decarbonisation”

On the launch of the 2025 American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Sustainability Outlook, ABS CEO Christopher Wiernicki said that “shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories”. “There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support,” he said. “LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success and should not be overlooked, over penalised or discarded in the net zero regulation. Quite frankly, achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard.”

Hapag-Lloyd’s sustainability strategy

Hapag-Lloyd’s overarching sustainability goal is to reach net zero fleet operations by 2045.

“We have advanced our decarbonisation efforts by adding new, state-of-the-art vessels to our fleet, placing additional newbuild orders and accelerating our fleet upgrade programme,” says CEO Rolf Habben Jansen in its 2024 Sustainability Progress Report.

Hapag-Lloyd’s sustainability progress

Achieved an average annual efficiency ratio of 7.96 in 2024, down from 9.13 in 2022

Used about 195k tonnes of biofuel blends in 2024

Carried roughly 490,000 TEU of dangerous goods in 2024, detected 4,256 misdeclarations and achieved zero reportable incidents since 2020

Recycles vessels exclusively at EU-certified yards with four vessels recycled across 2023 and 2024.

The company’s Fleet Upgrade programme, launched in 2022, aims to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of its ships. It has also ordered 24 large container ships that will be built in China and equipped with “state-of-the-art, low-emission and fuel-efficient high-pressure liquefied gas dual-fuel engines”.

Rolf explains in the report: “Our sustainability journey continues. Building a just, safe and clean industry is an ongoing responsibility and requires continuous collaboration between industry stakeholders.”

Sustainability at Maersk

Maersk aims to reach net zero by 2040, and its strategy includes introducing the world’s first large dual-fuel methanol fleet. In December 2024 it completed an order of 20 dual-fuel owned vessels with a total capacity of 300,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).

Maersk’s decarbonisation highlights

Seven large dual-fuel methanol vessels joined the fleet in 2024

A further 20 dual-fuel vessels were ordered for delivery between 2028 and 2030

Methanol offtake agreements now cover more than 50% of expected 2027 dual-fuel fleet demand

Achieved an EEOI of 11.1 gCO₂e per tonne-nautical-mile in 2024, down from 11.7 in 2023

Maersk Halifax became the industry’s first large container ship retrofitted to operate on methanol, lengthened by 15 metres to 368 metres and increased to about 15,690 TEU.

The company says that dual-fuel vessels are central to its decarbonisation plans, capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 65% to 90% through the use of bio- and e-methanol compared to conventional fossil fuels. Maersk also aims to deploy dual-fuel liquefied methane vessels, aiming to use bio- or e-methane as soon as possible.

“Let's get this done,” says Lene Bjørn Serpa, Director, Head of Corporate Sustainability at Maersk on LinkedIn. “We have the technology and the willingness - we just need the clear regulatory framework to accelerate the energy transition in the shipping industry.”

MSC’s sustainability impact

MSC says that it is committed to an energy transition targeting net zero decarbonisation by 2050 and is investing in a massive newbuilding programme and far-reaching retrofit plan.

The proposal, backed by an EU-led coalition including Britain, China, and Japan, aims to create a fair and effective mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from one of the world’s most polluting industries.

The initiative, which could generate an estimated $11 billion to $12 billion annually between 2028 and 2030, is seen by environmental experts as a crucial move toward achieving net-zero emissions in global maritime transport.

The funds raised from the levy would be directed to the IMO Net-Zero Fund — a global pool designed to support cleaner technologies, greener fuels, and sustainable maritime infrastructure, particularly in developing countries.

Although the United States has expressed reservations about the measure, the broader international response has been optimistic.

European Union member states have strongly endorsed the proposal, with the European Commission emphasizing that such collective efforts are essential to achieving long-term environmental goals and meeting the commitments of the Paris Climate Agreement.

According to the draft policy, the carbon pricing system would apply to ships weighing over 5,000 tons. Those exceeding emission thresholds would either purchase offset units or pay a penalty, while ships emitting below a certain level would earn credits or “surplus units.”

This balanced approach rewards innovation and efficiency while encouraging shipowners to invest in cleaner, more sustainable technology.

Industry analysts say this policy could become a turning point for global shipping. The sector, responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon emissions, has long faced challenges in adopting environmentally friendly practices due to the lack of a unified global framework.

The IMO’s proposed emissions levy seeks to change that by establishing clear, measurable standards that apply equally to all member nations.

While the United States has cautioned that it may respond with “reciprocal measures,” the ongoing discussions are expected to pave the way for constructive dialogue rather than division. Many experts view the debate as part of a necessary global conversation on balancing economic interests with environmental responsibilities.

Several nations have also pointed out that sustainable shipping can drive innovation, create new jobs, and open markets for cleaner fuel alternatives such as hydrogen and ammonia.

European leaders have praised the initiative for combining accountability with opportunity. “The maritime sector must play its role in the green transition,” the European Commission said in a statement on October 12.

“This proposal is not about penalizing shipping but about steering it toward a more resilient and sustainable future.”

The IMO’s upcoming decision has also gained support from environmental organizations and researchers worldwide. A study by University College London estimated that the fuel emissions standard would significantly cut global maritime emissions by incentivizing operators to modernize fleets and invest in clean fuel technologies.

The revenues, if managed transparently, could accelerate the transition to net-zero operations while ensuring fairness for developing nations dependent on maritime trade.

Stakeholders from across the industry — including shipbuilders, port authorities, and energy companies — are already preparing for the shift.

The move toward cleaner fuel alternatives and energy-efficient vessels is expected to reshape global trade dynamics over the next decade, aligning the maritime industry with the world’s broader sustainability targets.

The IMO’s meeting in London thus represents not just a policy discussion but a global milestone in collective environmental responsibility. Should the carbon pricing system be approved, it will mark one of the most significant steps ever taken to make the shipping industry part of the solution to climate change.

With optimism growing among environmentalists, policymakers, and maritime leaders alike, the upcoming decision is widely seen as a beacon of hope for cleaner oceans, greener trade routes, and a sustainable global economy.",https://media.millichronicle.com/2025/10/14085119/un-shipping-ed-led.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:56:54.640156

Delegates are convening this week in London to discuss the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF), the text of which was agreed in April earlier this year.

A final vote on the measure is expected on either Thursday or Friday, and the producers, which include European Energy, Liquid Wind, ET Fuels, HIF Global and Zero Waste, are urging delegates to adopt the deal.

Together, these firms currently have green fuel projects underway in Africa, South and North America, Europe, South Asia and Oceania.

‘Policy certainty’

As industry group Transport & Environment noted, the NZF includes specific incentives for green e-fuels, which are currently at a disadvantage to LNG and biofuels, despite ‘hydrogen-based e-fuels providing much greater emissions savings’.

“E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground,” commented Dr Alison Shaw, IMO manager at T&E. “Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules.

“The current IMO Net-Zero Framework leaves e-fuels competing with cheaper and unsustainable options like fossil gas and first-generation biofuels. The message from producers is clear: to decarbonise shipping at scale, incentives for green e-fuels are essential. Without targeted incentives, shipping’s energy transition risks stalling before it begins.”

Shipping organisations

Last week, a number of shipping organisations, including Danish Shipping, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association and the Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, also urged IMO delegates to adopt the NZF at this week’s London meeting.

“Binding global regulation is crucial to achieving the goal of climate-neutral shipping by 2050,” commented Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping. “We need global regulation and a level playing field.”

Critics of the NZF, however, include the United States, with the Trump administration stating that it ‘unequivocally rejects’ the proposed measures, threatening sanctions and other punitive actions against those that support it.

The extraordinary session of the Committee is to decide on historic and globally binding measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

In April 2025, provisional agreement was reached within the IMO on a regulatory framework that would obligate the Member States to take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in maritime traffic around the world. Subject to final adoption, the regulations consist of a two-level fuel standard and contributions to be paid based on emissions above the set thresholds. The new framework is set to encourage ships to use sustainable fuels and energy sources. When implemented, the IMO Net-Zero regulation will be the first global sector-specific regulatory framework imposing an obligation to reduce emissions.

Finland finds that this global emission reduction measure will even out the imbalance in international regulation of maritime emissions and level out the competitive environment, between the EU and the rest of the world, for business and industry that depend on shipping. In case of final adoption of the negotiated solution within the IMO, Finland observes that the European Commission should assess without delay any overlap with EU law that may arise from the new emission reduction measure of the IMO and take necessary measures accordingly.

Under the new regulations, ships whose greenhouse gas fuel intensity is above the permissible annual threshold must pay for the exceeding emissions. The price to pay will correspond to the extent to which the annual threshold has been exceeded. Conversely, taking the lead will be rewarded: ships that fulfil the set requirement will earn ‘surplus units’. Such units can then be transferred to other ships subject to certain conditions, or they can be banked for use over the next two calendar years or else cancelled on a voluntary basis.

New fund to support for emissions-free fuels and technologies

The collected fees would be directed to a new international fund to be established through regulation. The resources of the Fund would then be used to encourage the development and deployment of zero GHG and near-zero GHG ship fuels and technologies around the world. The mission of the Fund is to principally support the least developed countries and Small Island Developing States in their transition towards more sustainable ship fuels and other energy sources. If realised, the Fund becomes the largest climate fund in the world.

Finland believes that the revenues of the new IMO fund should be used to rapidly develop and deploy solutions that reduce emissions from maritime transport. Moreover, special circumstances, such as operating ships in ice-covered waters, must be observed in the distribution of the funds.

The goal of the IMO is to reach carbon neutrality in maritime transport by or around 2050 in a way that considers national circumstances. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions from ships must be reduced by at least 20 per cent compared to 2008. The interim target set for 2040 is a reduction of at least 70 per cent.

Next steps

If the regulatory package is finally approved, the regulations will be further specified in rules of procedure. Finland considers it important that they take note of the safe passage of ships in ice-covered waters.

The framework requires ships to progressively reduce their carbon emissions starting in 2028, and achieve complete decarbonisation by 2050.

But the United States on Friday threatened sanctions and other punitive actions against those who support it, potentially derailing the plans.

Top US diplomat Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement the administration of President Donald Trump ""unequivocally rejects"" the NZF proposal.

They threatened a range of punishing actions against countries that vote in favour of the framework, from visa restrictions to blocking vessels registered in those countries from US ports and imposing commercial penalties.

US influence

The NZF would require all ships to use a less carbon-intensive fuel mix or face financial penalties.

In April a majority of members -- 63 states -- voted in favour, including the European Union, Brazil, China, India and Japan.

Sixteen states voted against the measure, including major oil producers Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates.

Pacific Island states abstained from the vote, deeming the proposals insufficient to meet decarbonisation goals.

The United States had withdrawn from negotiations, not commenting on the proposal until last week.

Brussels reaffirmed on Monday the full support of European Union states for the proposal, as did Britain, when contacted by AFP.

But US threats may affect ""other countries more sensitive to US influence and vulnerable to these retaliations"", a European source told AFP.

""We remain optimistic about the outcome, but it will probably be tighter than before, with a higher risk of abstention,"" the source added.

Consensus, usually the norm in this assembly, has already been ruled out.

The Philippines, which has the world's largest contingent of maritime workers and supported the NZF in April, would be particularly impacted by visa restrictions.

Caribbean islands, economically dependent on US cruises, could also be affected by sanctions.

Trump alleges climate 'scam'

Contacted by AFP, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez declined to respond directly to the US statement, maintaining he was ""very confident"" about the NZF vote.

The NZF would charge ships a tax on emissions exceeding a certain threshold, creating a fund to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

If the global emissions pricing system were adopted, it would become difficult to evade, even for the United States.

IMO conventions allow signatories to inspect foreign ships during stopovers and even detain non-compliant vessels.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has reversed Washington's course on climate change, denouncing it as a ""scam"" and encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation.

If the deal is adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Nations are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters through Friday. The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the climate deal.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework. The aim is to adopt it at this meeting.

That would be a major win for the climate, public health, the ocean and marine life, said Delaine McCullough at the Ocean Conservancy. For too long, ships have run on crude, dirty oil, she said.

“This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible,” McCullough, shipping program director for the nonprofit environmental advocacy group, said.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

Here’s what to know:

The regulations would set a pricing system for gas emissions

The regulations, or “Net-zero Framework,” sets a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

There’s a base-level of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels. There’s a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity.

If ships sail on fuels with lower emissions than what’s required under the direct compliance target, they earn “surplus units,” effectively credits.

Ships with the highest emissions would have to buy those credits from other ships under the pricing system, or from the IMO at $380 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach the base level of compliance. In addition, there’s a penalty of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach direct compliance.

Ships that meet the base target but not the direct compliance one must pay the $100 per ton penalty, too.

Ships whose greenhouse gas intensity is below a certain threshold will receive rewards for their performance.

The fees could generate $11 billion to $13 billion in revenue annually. That would go into an IMO fund to invest in fuels and technologies needed to transition to green shipping, reward low-emission ships and support developing countries so they aren’t left behind with dirty fuels and old ships.

Looking for alternative fuels

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

Ships could lower their emissions by using alternative fuels, running on electricity or using onboard carbon capture technologies. Wind propulsion and other energy efficiency advancements can also help reduce fuel consumption and emissions as part of an energy transition.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to reach net-zero around 2050.

If adopted, the regulations will enter into force in 2027. Large oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which emit 85% of the total carbon emissions from international shipping, would have to pay penalties for their emissions starting in 2028, according to the IMO.

The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, is advocating for adoption.

Concerns over biofuels produced from food crops

Heavy fuel oil, liquefied natural gas and biodiesel will be dominant for most of the 2030s and 2040s, unless the IMO further incentivizes green alternatives, according to modeling from Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The way the rules are designed essentially make biofuels the cheapest fuel to use to comply, but biofuels require huge amounts of crops, pushing out less profitable food production, often leading to additional land clearance and deforestation, said Faig Abbasov, shipping director at T&E.

They are urging the IMO to promote scalable green alternatives, not recklessly promote biofuels produced from food crops, Abbasov said. As it stands now, the deal before the IMO won’t deliver net-zero emissions by 2050, he added.

Green ammonia will get to a price that it’s appealing to ship owners in the late 2040s — quite late in the transition, according to the modeling. The NGO also sees green methanol playing an important role in the long-term transition.

The vote at the London meeting

The IMO aims for consensus in decision-making but it’s likely nations will vote on adopting the regulations.

At the April meeting, a vote was called to approve the contents of the regulations. The United States was notably absent in April, but plans to participate in this meeting.

Teresa Bui at Pacific Environment said she’s optimistic “global momentum is on our side” and a majority of countries will support adoption. Bui is senior climate campaign director for the environmental nonprofit, which has consultative, or non-voting, status at the IMO.

If it fails, shipping’s decarbonization will be further delayed.

“It’s difficult to know for sure what the precise consequences will be, but failure this week will certainly lead to delay, which means ships will emit more greenhouse gases than they would have done and for longer, continuing their outsized contribution to the climate crisis,” said John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, who is at the London meeting.

Ships whose greenhouse gas intensity is below a certain threshold will receive rewards for their performance.","The world’s largest maritime nations are gathering in London on Tuesday to consider adopting regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions.

If the deal is adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Nations are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters through Friday. The Trump administration unequivocally rejects the proposal and has threatened to retaliate if nations support it, setting the stage for a fight over the climate deal.

In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework. The aim is to adopt it at this meeting.

That would be a major win for the climate, public health, the ocean and marine life, said Delaine McCullough at the Ocean Conservancy. For too long, ships have run on crude, dirty oil, she said.

“This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible,"" McCullough, shipping program director for the nonprofit environmental advocacy group, said.

Shipping emissions have grown over the last decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

Here's what to know:

The regulations, or “Net-zero Framework,” sets a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

There's a base-level of compliance for the allowable greenhouse gas intensity of fuels. There's a more stringent direct compliance target that requires further reduction in the greenhouse gas intensity.

If ships sail on fuels with lower emissions than what's required under the direct compliance target, they earn “surplus units,"" effectively credits.

Ships with the highest emissions would have to buy those credits from other ships under the pricing system, or from the IMO at $380 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach the base level of compliance. In addition, there's a penalty of $100 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent to reach direct compliance.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy have put their names to a second joint letter containing threats against nations – the first letter came out in mid-August – which ’vote’ in support of adopting the United Nations-based IMO’s framework that aims to reduce air pollution from shipping over the next 25 years.

While it remains uncertain whether IMO member states will vote or simply adopt the Net Zero Framework on shipping emissions at the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in London, the US’ stated ""unequivocal rejection"" of the proposal makes it more likely that a vote on the measures the framework contains will take place.

The US administration’s letter said US President Trump ""has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people"".

In reality, US President Trump has routinely removed the US from international agreements, including twice withdrawing the US from a foundational United Nations climate change framework plan, the Paris Agreement, sought to discredit the United Nations and expressed overt denials of climate change and its impacts on people and the planet. US President Joe Biden, who served between Trump’s two presidential terms, oversaw immediately rejoining the US to the Paris Agreement, an action that US presidents who follow Donald Trump could mirror.

Among the actions the latest letter from the Trump administration is claiming to be ’considering’ as reprisal ""against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers"" are: investigations and potential regulations against ""certain flagged countries""; blocking vessels registered in those countries from US ports, visa restrictions and fees and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas; ""commercial penalties"" tied to US government contracts including shipbuilding contracts, liquefied natural gas terminals and infrastructure, or ""financial penalties"" on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF including additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and ""sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers"".

The EU has indicated it will review its relevant regulations following the potential adoption of the IMO’s proposed carbon tax that aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping sector.

Ahead of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London from 14 to 17 October, the European Union reiterated its support for the scheme, defying US threats to take action against IMO members who support the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework.

“The EU supports ambitious global measures at International Maritime Organization (IMO) level with a view to decarbonise the shipping sector, and ensure a global level playing field. The EU views the Net-Zero Framework as a significant milestone and calls for its adoption at IMO next week,” the European Commission said on Sunday.

“After the adoption, the European Commission will review the relevant EU regulations in place,” the EU added.

IMO members are scheduled to vote this week on the Net-Zero Framework proposal, which seeks to curtail carbon dioxide gas emissions globally.

The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) will meet for its second extraordinary session in person at IMO Headquarters in London from 14 to 17 October 2025.

The discussions will focus on issues related to the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework comprises a new set of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships. It includes two key elements: a global fuel standard and global GHG emissions pricing mechanism.

A global fuel standard requires ships to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle).

On the other hand, a pricing mechanism with set prices on the GHG ships emit, encourages the industry to lower emissions to comply with the global fuel standard.

The United States on Friday threatened to use visa restrictions, commercial penalties, additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework and sanctions on officials “sponsoring activist-driven climate policies,” to retaliate against nations that back IMO’s proposed carbon tax that aims to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping sector. The envisaged measures include potentially blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.

Officials warned they could impose visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas; commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF; and additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework.

They also threatened they will pursue investigations and consider potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potentially block vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports. They will also evaluate, among other measures under consideration, sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.

“The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a joint statement.",https://shippingtelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EUROPEAN-COMMISSION-11111111111.png,N,,2025-10-13 20:56:45.408017

It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.
“It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions.
“The IMO must use the implementation guidelines to back scalable, green e-fuels and technologies, not short-term paper fixes.
Without a parallel improved IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) driving a reduction in fuel burn, the IMO and shipping will not be able to meet the 2030 and 2040 goals of the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy.","As a special meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO, MEPC/ES.2) opens October 14 in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition is calling on IMO member states to adopt the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) – set to be the first globally binding set of policies to reduce shipping’s climate pollution.

The IMO’s NZF is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard, requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e., how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect — lacking ambition, proper safeguards against the uptake on unsustainable fuels, and failing to provide the levels of guaranteed finance needed for a just and equitable shipping energy transition — but it is a vital step forward by the IMO.

“It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions. What has been missing, until now, is a plan that countries could agree on. This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible — now.

“During this meeting, IMO Member States must not only adopt the Net-Zero Framework but agree on a realistic and robust plan for fixing the framework’s failings and putting shipping on a truly sustainable path to zero-emission shipping.

“The technology to make ships greener has long existed. This includes measures like reducing vessel speed, adding sails to harness wind power, powering ships through rechargeable batteries and fuel cells where possible, and deploying new zero-emission fuels that are safe for people and the ocean.”

Andrew Dumbrille, co-founder and director of Equal Routes, said: “Pacific Island nations, along with Mexico, have made an important attempt to reframe the commitments in the NZF within a new submission (MEPC ES.2-2-13), which should be unanimously supported, especially because it brings the shipping sector back into alignment with a 1.5 degree pathway and the foundation of a just and equitable transition.

“It also reminds IMO members of their commitments under international law and binding relevant treaties including under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Advisory Opinion on the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change.”

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, said: “During this week’s extraordinary MEPC session, IMO Member States face a clear choice.

“A yes vote signals a commitment to implement the Net-Zero Framework, the IMO’s most comprehensive regulation to cut shipping’s greenhouse gas emissions to date.

“A no vote would cast the sector adrift, wasting years of negotiation and steering it into rougher and rising seas.

“Yet the framework isn’t perfect — it lacks clear signals to incentivize green e-fuels and wind-propulsion, both essential for meeting IMO climate goals, and safeguards to prevent first-generation biofuels driving deforestation.

“The IMO must use the implementation guidelines to back scalable, green e-fuels and technologies, not short-term paper fixes. Nevertheless, let’s not throw the baby out with the ballast water. It’s time to vote yes.”

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer, Seas At Risk, said: “It’s vital that the Net Zero Framework is adopted.

“Delaying it doesn’t buy time, it kills investment certainty. Without clear rules, shipowners will lack the incentive to upgrade their fleet and fuel suppliers will stall on zero-emission fuel infrastructure.

“The entire transition will be slowed down and will keep the door open for transitional fuels to dominate well into the 2030s. It will also sideline proven solutions such as wind propulsion, which can cut fuel bills today while lowering emissions.

“This is why it is imperative the NZF is adopted and the guidelines reward clean technologies, such as wind propulsion, to give ships financial incentives to meet their decarbonization targets.”

John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at IMO, said: “The NZF is also only part of the shipping decarbonization puzzle.

“Equally important, especially in the shorter-term, is the push to improve the energy efficiency of ships. Without a parallel improved IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) driving a reduction in fuel burn, the IMO and shipping will not be able to meet the 2030 and 2040 goals of the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy.

“The CII is also key to keeping the cost of shipping’s energy transition down and making sure that shipping’s demand for new fuels made with renewable electricity doesn’t adversely impact the decarbonization of the wider economy.” The revision of the CII resumes at MEPC 84 in April 2026.

Jenny Helle, expert on decarbonization of aviation and shipping at Carbon Market Watch, said: “While the NZF falls short of what is needed to tackle shipping emissions, it is essential that IMO member states now adopt the deal in October, work to strengthen it as soon as possible, and resist attempts to dilute its provisions further.

“IMO national delegations should, at the very least, significantly accelerate the reduction of GHG intensity emissions mandated by the Z factors by increasing the level of the latter to reach the IMO’s 2030 and 2040 targets.

“IMO national delegations must significantly speed up the increase in Z factors for Direct Compliance to widen the Tier 1 zone and broaden the share of priced emissions, indirectly raising the effective carbon price on ships.

“A just and equitable transition (JET) must be a key priority for where the revenue is earmarked, alongside scaling up zero or near-zero (ZNZ) fuels and technologies. This is especially important given that JET is central to the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy.”

Emission Control Areas

During MEPC/ES.2, the IMO is set to formally adopt Emission Control Areas in the Northeast Atlantic, meaning that from 2027 ships have to switch to cleaner fuels and install exhaust aftertreatment.

Both will reduce the air pollution burden for people and the environment considerably. The measure will also raise the costs to burn fossil fuels, thereby incentivizing decarbonization and efficiency measures, from wind propulsion to e-fuels.

“When adopted, the North Atlantic Emission Control Area will be the biggest of its kind”, said Sönke Diesener, Shipping Expert at NABU. “Clean Shipping Coalition members have been instrumental in pushing this over the decision line in close cooperation with countries. Special thanks go to Portugal for leading the way.”

Maritime transport represents 80% of global trade and is responsible for 3% of greenhouse gas emissions.

The text approved in April represented a victory for Brazil, as it includes biofuels, but left a gap in the certification process.
“Brazil is already an important shipping route and is the largest producer of feedstocks that can be used in the biofuels production chain.","The UN maritime agency approved a historic agreement in April that provides for fines of $100 to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide not mitigated, as well as a billion-dollar fund to finance the energy transition. If adopted, the regulations will come into effect in 2027.

The IMO meeting begins on Tuesday (14) amid uncertainty regarding the behavior of the U.S. delegation. The United States withdrew from the previous negotiation, while Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates voted against the proposal. Despite resistance, the text reached the necessary two-thirds approval at the beginning of the year.

Now, the U.S. is threatening retaliation against countries that implement decarbonization measures. Officials and experts monitoring the issue say the discussions are likely to be tense, with debates going until the last minute, due to the American position. The White House released a statement on Friday (10) rejecting the plan and saying it is considering sanctions against countries that support it.

“The U.S. has significant weight and can pressure countries in various ways. But this measure has the support of Europeans, a large group of developing countries, and is very well represented. If the IMO doesn’t adopt it, each country will start to impose its own taxes, and it will be very bad for international trade,” says Flavio Mathuiy, advisor to the Brazilian Navy Coordinating Committee for International Maritime Organization Affairs.

The maritime industry’s targets, like those for aviation, were negotiated outside the Paris Agreement due to the difficulty in determining who is responsible for emissions from an activity conducted in international waters. Maritime transport represents 80% of global trade and is responsible for 3% of greenhouse gas emissions.

With extensive experience in IMO negotiations, Sveinung Oftedal, chief negotiator for sustainable shipping at the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, believes that momentum for decarbonization is strong in several parts of the world, despite resistance from some countries. Historical partners in initiatives such as the Climate Fund, Brazil and Norway recently established green shipping corridors.

“The momentum for decarbonizing maritime transport is strong in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa, as well as in the group that includes small island [nations],” he told Valor in June.

“Unfortunately, some members said they didn’t want to join. The result was clear, and now we need to ensure that [the text] will be adopted,” he added.

Brazil actively participated in IMO discussions to ensure that first-generation biofuels were recognized by the organization as valid alternatives to bunker oil, the fossil-based fuel used in ships. Renewable sources such as ethanol and biodiesel, however, face resistance among European countries, which advocate solutions based on fuels such as green ammonia, hydrogen, and methanol, in addition to electrification.

The argument, countered by the Brazilians, is that increased demand for products made from sugar, corn, and soybeans could affect food production and increase deforestation.

“This carries strong geopolitical weight because Europeans understand that only advanced fuels, such as methanol and ammonia, can decarbonize. But these fuels depend on a process with a high incidence of electricity and are very expensive,” says Camilo Adas, director of energy transition at the consulting firm Be8, who participated in the debates.

The text approved in April represented a victory for Brazil, as it includes biofuels, but left a gap in the certification process. This is the new front for the Brazilian delegation, which is working with 16 countries and 12 NGOs on a certification proposal for the IMO that does not exclude fuels produced in Brazil.

“Our concern is [to ensure] that there is no proposal to exclude first-generation biofuels. If the IMO doesn’t establish its own certification system, it would likely have to use internationally accepted systems from Europe and the U.S., which don’t align with Brazil’s vision,” explains Mr. Mathuiy.

A study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) indicates that Brazil has up to 25 million hectares of degraded land suitable for integration into the biofuels supply chain without competing with food production.

“Brazil is already an important shipping route and is the largest producer of feedstocks that can be used in the biofuels production chain. And the additional production has nothing to do with deforestation or competition with food [production],” observes Arthur Ramos, executive director and partner at the Boston Consulting Group.

The same report, released at Climate Week in New York in September, indicates that Brazil, considered the world’s second-largest producer of ethanol and biodiesel, could meet 15% of the global maritime industry’s energy demand by 2050, in addition to reducing 170 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year.

Experts point out that biodiesel has advantages in leading decarbonization in the short term, especially because it is compatible with existing ship engines in what is known as drop-in fuel in industry jargon.

“A ship is built to last between 20 and 30 years, so it would take a long time to replace the entire current fleet with ships with engines adapted to new fuels. If I start using biofuel, which is a drop-in [fuel], the next day I start seeing an effective reduction in emissions,” says Mr. Matuhiy.

Shipping companies also emphasize that even with prototypes already developed, there are still few orders for vessels powered by methanol, hydrogen, and green ammonia. The executive director of the Brazilian Association of Cabotage Shipowners (Abac), Luís Fernando Resano, points out that there are still issues related to safety on board.

“Ammonia has a low calorific value, so we would need to significantly increase the ship’s storage capacity to make the same voyage. Furthermore, it is extremely toxic and corrosive,” he says.

Mr. Ramos, from BCG, says that Brazil has the potential to produce hydrogen and derivatives, but emphasizes that the fuels are only expected to reach commercial viability in the late 2030s due to the need for technological development and industrial-scale plants. “That’s why, in the short term, the best strategy is to use existing and competitive technologies,” he adds.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/A8GS1fL4Wm_-u__F_4pG6KDRL1g=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/s/0/tq420tRQGGAvbHjB4VMQ/foto13bra-101-navios-a10.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 20:57:20.387659

She has, nevertheless, called on governments to stand firmly behind the IMO’s role as the industry’s global regulator.

On 14 October, a crucial meeting of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) begins in London, aiming to formally adopt new measures to decarbonise global shipping. During this meeting, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) will hold an Extraordinary Session from 14 to 17 October at the organisation’s headquarters, with the primary focus on adopting the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

While all recognise the need to decarbonise the sector and support a global, uniform approach, significant differences and concerns remain.

Melina Travlos, president of the Union of Greek Shipowners (UGS), has repeated calls for a global regulatory framework grounded in realism that promotes decarbonisation while enabling fair competition and fostering innovation.

More than a balancing act

It was during the ‘Shaping the Future of Shipping’ Summit in Athens in June that Travlos noted that “policymakers cannot regulate shipping without shipping.”

For Melina Travlos, the future of shipping can only be realised with respect for the industry’s deep know-how. “This also stands for our industry’s global regulator, the IMO,” Travlos remarked at her Athens speech, adding that “the decisions taken at the IMO should be more than a mere balancing act among the interests of its Member States. They should be rooted in a real understanding of how the industry truly operates.”

She echoed those same concerns in an interview with Lloyd’s List, warning that the last-minute decision at MEPC 83 took the industry by surprise, as it overturned the “practical, simple proposal” the industry had been working towards, alongside the IMO, that those emitting more would pay more, while those using cleaner fuels would pay less.

“We all have to admit that a lot of improvement is needed in order to become viable,” she remarked.

Nevertheless, the industry doesn’t retract its firm support of the IMO, pointing out that a global regulation is needed, but the vote will be an existential moment for the organisation, testing its credibility.

As she has pointed out, regulatory decisions and policies cannot be introduced without the sector’s institutional input. “Collaboration is the key to adopting and implementing pragmatic solutions to every challenge we face,” Travlos argued last summer.

Regulatory overlap

The UGS has identified several technical and practical flaws in the IMO proposal. Chief among them are unrealistic fuel-intensity trajectories and the “well-to-wake” emissions calculation, which holds ships accountable for emissions generated during fuel production.

Travlos also warned of regulatory overlap and double payments unless regional carbon schemes are withdrawn once the IMO framework takes effect. “The risk of fragmented application remains very high,” she said in her interview, pointing also to the risk of a new system that amounts to a tax without a direct environmental benefit, disproportionately affecting small- and medium-sized operators.

UGS’s president also criticised the framework for penalising transitional fuels such as LNG, which she called “proven, safe and readily available options” that offer immediate emission reductions.

The industry calls for clear incentives for first movers investing in new technologies and fuels, while for the existing fleet, short-term options, such as drop-in biofuels and carbon capture, are suggested.

To ensure practical implementation, Travlos supports the proposal for a new IMO subcommittee to draft guidelines in consultation with industry experts.

In a joint statement, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean P. Duffy described the initiative as a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” and cautioned that Washington is prepared to impose penalties on nations that support the measure.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF,” the statement said. “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

The Net-Zero Shipping Framework, first approved in April and slated for adoption during the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting that runs until October 17, would require major emission cuts across the global shipping sector. If adopted, the new rules would take effect in 2028.

IMO officials say 108 member states are eligible to vote, including 10 from the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). The framework proposes to align international shipping with global 2050 net-zero targets through a Global Fuel Standard, carbon pricing mechanisms, and a credit trading system to incentivize the use of cleaner fuels.

However, the Trump administration has rejected the proposal, arguing that it constitutes the first-ever global carbon tax imposed by a United Nations body and would “unfairly burden” American consumers and industries.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies, and their customers,” the statement continued. “The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10 percent or more.”

Washington also warned that it is considering several retaliatory actions against nations that vote in favor of the NZF, including:

Investigations and possible restrictions targeting vessels registered in supportive countries;

Visa limitations and higher processing fees for maritime crew members;

Additional port fees for ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries backing the framework; and

Potential sanctions or commercial penalties affecting shipping contracts and LNG infrastructure.

The U.S. said it views the NZF as a “punitive and regressive” global tax regime that threatens the stability of international trade.

The proposed IMO framework would apply to all oceangoing vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage — ships that currently account for more than 85 percent of global maritime emissions.

The IMO struck a preliminary deal in April to charge the global shipping industry for emissions after the US pulled out of associated talks, prompting Washington to threaten “reciprocal measures” against any fees charged on US ships.

The April deal is now tabled for adoption at a meeting of the IMO’s environmental committee scheduled for October 14 to 17, which is expected to include the US.

Washington has continued efforts to derail the measure since April, threatening port fees and visa restrictions against countries that support it.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the US State Department said in a statement on October 11.

European Union states, meanwhile, have called for the IMO measure to be adopted, the European Commission said in a 12 October statement.

The IMO’s proposed marine fuel emissions standard would impose a fee on ships larger than 5,000 tons that exceed a set emissions threshold, while rewarding vessels that burn so-called ""cleaner fuels"".

Ships will either buy remedial units or pay a penalty if they emit more than the threshold. Those emitting less than a separate lower threshold will receive surplus units.

Revenues from the measure would be collected by an IMO “Net-Zero” Fund to be created by the IMO Secretariat, according to draft rules. Details of how revenues will be distributed have yet to be decided.

Research from University College London suggests the highly controversial IMO fuel standard could generate between $11 billion and $12 billion per year from 2028 to 2030, as most ships are likely to pay the penalty during the early years of implementation.

Anything else would be a major setback for the green transition and risk leaving the industry with a complicated patchwork of regional climate regulations

This October, the member states of the International Maritime Organization can make history by finally adopting an agreement on climate regulation of the shipping industry – and thus becoming the first global industry to do so.

As a result of multiple years of negotiations, the Net-Zero Framework is set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale.

The backstory is as follows: In 2023, IMO agreed on a greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy stating that global shipping must become climate neutral around 2050. This was followed earlier this year by the principal agreement on the regulatory framework necessary to make the ambitious GHG-strategy a reality. This Net-Zero Framework must now be finally adopted at the IMO-meeting in London in mid-October.

The Net-Zero Framework entails concrete mandates for the reduction of emissions from ships as well as a pricing mechanism that puts a cost on undercompliance and rewards the use of alternative, greener fuels under a global fuel standard. These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions. Crucially, it will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels, and technology.

Final approval at the IMO meeting requires a qualified majority of member states that are signatories to the MARPOL Convention. It is important that such a majority comes together to shepherd the agreement across the finish line. Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation – also to address climate change.

The alternative is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks. Not only is this an entirely wrong solution for a global industry such as ours, such a scenario will also derail ongoing efforts towards the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition. We therefore also call upon the EU, which has the most ambitious climate regulation for shipping, to send a clear message of alignment with the IMO NZF when adopted to avoid double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden.

To deliver on the agreed upon GHG strategy, global regulation is a precondition. It is necessary for reducing emissions, for creating homogeneous and predictable framework conditions for the shipping industry and – perhaps most importantly – sending the strongest possible signal to investors and producers to scale up the production of the alternative fuels that the shipping industry will require to move towards zero emissions.

The industry supports the IMO Net-Zero Framework, as evidenced by the formal declaration of support of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and the clear support of the European Shipowners (ES | ECSA). The co-signers of this article appeal to the IMO member states to come together and vote for global climate measures.

Let’s take the next step and move towards net-zero together. Let’s make history in London.

About 41% of container ships on order are designed to operate with alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas or ammonia – more than half the tonnage of container ships on order.

Nearly all ocean-going ships are built outside the U.S., mostly in China, 51%; South Korea, 28%, and Japan, 15%.

“​​The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the International Maritime Organization and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.

We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security.”

The statement was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

In the U.S. statement, retaliatory measures against nations voting for the plan could include:

Blocking vessels from U.S. ports;

Probes and possible regulations over those nations’ anti-competitive practices;

Visa restrictions for vessel crews;

Penalties covering U.S. government contracts for new commercial ships and liquified natural gas terminals;

Additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by those countries;

Sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Washington had previously worked closely with the IMO on GHG regulations. The reversal is not unprecedented: The U.S. was central to the development of the International Criminal Court, but has never ratified the treaty recognizing its authority.

The new measures come as the U.S. escalates its trade war with China. Costly fees on Chinese-built and -operated cargo ships calling American ports are slated to take effect Tuesday; new tariffs more than doubling the cost of Chinese-made container cranes and other equipment are set to take effect Nov. 1.

Beijing has retaliated with port fees on U.S. shipping, also effective Oct. 14.

“[The Arctic route] greatly enhances supply chain speed, reduces required business inventory by 40 percent and cuts capital costs for businesses,” Sealegend’s Li explained.
It crossed Russia’s Northern Sea Route in just 5 days at an average speed of 17 knots.
Russia’s Northern Sea Route has set a new record for containership activity this summer surpassing more than 20 transits.","Chinese containership Istanbul Bridge is scheduled to arrive at the UK’s largest terminal Felixstowe during the afternoon of October 13. The Panamax vessel completed the 7,500 nautical mile voyage from China via the Arctic Northern Sea Route in just 20 days. A comparable voyage through the Suez Canal measures 11,000 nautical miles and routinely takes between 40-50 days.

Istanbul Bridge’s voyage is the first liner-type service via the polar region connecting Asia and Europe and calling at several Chinese and European ports. It is also the first time a container ship has traveled from China to the UK via the Arctic.

Sealegend, the operator of the Istanbul Bridge, calls the new service “China-Europe Arctic Express”. The company laid the foundation for the route with the acquisition of the Ice-1 ice-class containership last year.

The company’s Chief Operating Officer Li Xiaobin highlighted the reduced emissions of the shorter Arctic voyage. But environmental advocates warn of the local impact of emissions, especially if vessels are using heavy fuel oil resulting in black carbon emissions. It is unclear what type of fuel the Istanbul Bridge was using during its transit and if it was in full compliance with the IMO’s Polar Code.

Istanbul Bridge’s Arctic voyage aims to beat the Fall rush into European terminals when containerships arrive delivering Asian goods for the holiday season.

“[The Arctic route] greatly enhances supply chain speed, reduces required business inventory by 40 percent and cuts capital costs for businesses,” Sealegend’s Li explained.

Loaded with up to 4,843 standard containers (TEU) the box carrier departed from Ningbo-Zhoushan on September 22. It crossed Russia’s Northern Sea Route in just 5 days at an average speed of 17 knots. This late in the summer navigation season very little sea ice remains along the main Arctic shipping lane. The vessel did not receive any icebreaker escort and navigated independently along the entire length of the route.

After the Felixstowe port call the carrier will continue onward to Rotterdam, Hamburg and Gdansk. While Istanbul Bridge has received much of the public media attention in recent weeks, it is not the only container shipping company testing the Arctic waters. A least three other box carriers were active on the route at the same time conducting point-to-point voyages. Russia’s Northern Sea Route has set a new record for containership activity this summer surpassing more than 20 transits.

The first full transit of a containership came just 7 years ago in August 2018 when operator Maersk sent the feeder-class Venta Maersk from Vladivostok to St. Petersburg, with a stop in Bremerhaven. Since then Western operators have largely backed away from the route for environmental and political reasons ceding the Arctic waters to Chinese operators.

While the route remains very niche – in 2024 it saw around 100 vessel transits compared to 13,000 for the Suez Canal – a number of companies have continuously expanded their Arctic operations.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Flying-Fish-2023-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 14:57:11.767346

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice,” according to a joint statement issued by the Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean P Duffy.

The measure, which was approved in April 2025, is set for adoption in October 2025, during the Marine Environmental Protection Committee that is meeting that takes place until October 17.

IMO officials say 108 members are eligible to vote, including 10 from CARICOM and, if adopted, it will come into effect in 2028.

But Washington has said that President Donald Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.

It said that this week’s vote on the adoption “will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10 per cent or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security,” the joint statement said.

The NZF seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping to align with the 2050 net-zero target. Key components include a Global Fuel Standard (GFS) setting annual GHG intensity reduction targets, a two-tier carbon price mechanism, and a credit trading system funded by penalties to reward zero and near-zero emission fuels and support a just transition.

The NZF presents a new regulatory era in which ships will be required to gradually adopt fuels that are typically three to four times more expensive compared with conventional fossil fuels. Given the long lifespan of ships, shipowners should prepare now for the new net-zero GHG emission regulations to ensure cost-effective compliance, both at the ship and the fleet level.

The Framework will apply to all oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage (GT). These ships are responsible for over 85 per cent of global shipping emissions and are already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection. Ships under 5,000 GT are currently not covered.

Washington said that the NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states “to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.”

The United States says it is considering several actions against countries that support “this global carbon tax on American consumers”.

Among the measures being contemplated are pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from US ports; imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

In addition, Washington said it will impose commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts including new commercial ships, liquefied natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF;

It will also be imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework as well as evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/10/13/3255802/8384944.jpg?itok=Z-2FijSK,N,,2025-10-13 13:56:06.930510

The IMO’s extraordinary session (MEPC E.2) is scheduled for October 14-17, where member states are expected to vote on adopting the Net-Zero Framework—a carbon-pricing regime targeting the international shipping sector. The package combines a tightening marine fuel-intensity standard with a priced compliance mechanism that would channel revenues into an IMO Net-Zero Fund for low-carbon rewards, infrastructure, and transition support.

In a joint statement issued last Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy declared that “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.”

The administration warned that “the economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.” The statement characterized the NZF proposal as posing “significant risks to the global economy” and subjecting all IMO member states to “an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties.”

The U.S. outlined several potential countermeasures against nations supporting the framework, including pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports. The administration also threatened to impose visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

Additional measures under consideration include imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF. The administration also said it would consider imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework, and evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the statement declared. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Despite the U.S. threats, the European Union released a statement in support of the framework. “The EU supports ambitious global measures at International Maritime Organization (IMO) level with a view to decarbonise the shipping sector, and ensure a global level playing field,” the EU Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport stated. “The EU views the Net-Zero Framework as a significant milestone and calls for its adoption at IMO next week.”

The EU statement added that “after the adoption, the European Commission will review the relevant EU regulations in place.”

The framework would apply to ships greater than 5,000 gross tons, covering approximately 85 percent of international shipping emissions.Vessels that overshoot intensity thresholds would be required to acquire remedial units, while efficient ships could bank or trade surplus units.If adopted, the framework could enter into force in 2027.

The U.S. position contrasts sharply with industry sentiment. Major shipping associations, including liner and shipowner groups, have urged governments to pass the package. In a joint statement issued October 9, leading international maritime associations declared: “Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.”

The industry statement continued: “With the support of the industry, this is a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field.”

The signatories to the industry statement represent major portions of global shipping. The Asian Shipowners’ Association represents around 50 percent of the world merchant fleet.European shipowners control 35 percent of the global commercial fleet. The International Chamber of Shipping represents over 80 percent of the world merchant fleet.

Shipping accounts for approximately 90 percent of world trade and contributes roughly 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Proponents argue that a uniform price signal and enforceable standard would align shipowners, bunkering, and ports on a common decarbonization path.

Despite the U.S. warnings, backers of the framework expect sufficient votes for adoption following April’s approval in principle, though late abstentions could affect the final tally.If the framework passes, a technical group is scheduled to meet October 20-24 to finalize guidance on fuel definitions, revenue spending, and compliance rules ahead of the 2027 implementation timeline.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shutterstock_1443851123.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 12:56:22.552654

This week, IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee is holding an extraordinary session of to consider adoption of the proposed carbon tax on shipping that IMO calls the “Net Zero Framework” (NZF). The session looks set to be contentious, to say the least.

In a brief statement released yesterday, the European Commission said:

“The EU supports ambitious global measures at International Maritime Organization (IMO) level with a view to decarbonize the shipping sector, and ensure a global level playing field. The EU views the Net-Zero Framework as a significant milestone and calls for its adoption at IMO next week.

“After the adoption, the European Commission will review the relevant EU regulations in place.”

That statement was released after an October 10 announcement re-stating U.S. opposition to what Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy called a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

A statement by the three cabinet secretaries laid out actions the U.S. is considering taking should the NZF proposal succeed.

Here’s the full text of the statement.

“President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more. We ask you to join us in rejecting adoption of the NZF at the October meeting and to work together on our collective economic and energy security.

“The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.

“The United States is considering the following actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

The International Maritime Organization’s updated greenhouse gas strategy sets a net-zero ambition “by or around 2050,” with waypoints for 2030 and 2040, and an expectation that zero or near-zero fuels begin showing up in meaningful volumes by 2030. Regional policies are already operational, as is interim IMO guidance, which also locks in a well-to-wake1 view of emissions.

Multiple decarbonization pathways are advancing, through efficiency upgrades, route optimization, alternative fuels and onboard capture. But near-term progress depends on access to compliant molecules at scale, with defensible lifecycle carbon and recognized certification. Capital will back options that leverage existing assets while other technologies mature. That is where ethanol is relevant.

The U.S. operates a large, export-ready ethanol infrastructure with roughly 18 billion gallons of nameplate capacity, steady production and record exports of near 2 billion gallons last year. Plants, rail, barge and port connections exist today. That footprint can support marine supply chains now and, where needed, feed conversion processes that yield candidate blendstocks for the distillate pool.

Methanol has driven real momentum in alternative-fuel newbuilds and retrofits. Public sources indicate by mid-2024, methanol accounted for roughly 9% of the global orderbook by vessel count (about 242 ships)2. As of early 2025, around 60 methanol-fueled vessels were in operation and about 340 were on order3. Industry materials also referenced roughly 700 “methanol-ready”4 designs5. That installed base is valuable infrastructure for alcohol fuels in general, and ethanol complements it. Ethanol and methanol are both simple alcohols with similar handling and safety requirements under the IMO’s low-flashpoint rules, so the same broad tank, piping, ventilation and detection concepts apply. That platform overlap makes methanol-capable designs a logical starting point for ethanol with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) calibration and targeted material changes. On a volumetric basis, ethanol offers higher energy density, helping extend range or reduce tankage. For owners and charterers, dual-fuel optionality across both alcohols diversifies feedstock risk, broadens sourcing and strengthens the procurement stack without forcing a binary choice.

With methanol-capable platforms now common, ethanol slots in as an add-on rather than a redesign. OEMs are already running compression-ignition trials with a pilot fuel, and the same IMO low-flashpoint rules apply. The near-term fit is controllable fleets through harbor craft, inland towboats and offshore support. This is where ethanol’s ultra-low sulfur/aromatics and particulate reductions matter; the known trade-offs versus marine gasoil (materials and energy density) can be handled with selective seal/line upgrades and engine control unit recalibration, then taken through testbeds, class approval and sea trials.

With a growing global demand for the protection of subsea cable infrastructure, Luxembourg-headquartered Jan De Nul has ordered a new dedicated rock installation vessel, the George W. Goethals.

The vessel has a capacity of up to 37,000 tonnes. With a state-of-the-art flexible vertical fall pipe and an inclined fall pipe system, it will be able to install extra-large rocks in water depths of up to 400 meters and will primarily focus on projects in the energy sector. With major energy projects under development in the North Sea and Southeast Asia, these regions will form the core of its operational activity.

Designed entirely in-house, the George W. Goethals will become the third rock installation vessel above 30,000 tonnes in the Jan De Nul fleet.

“Decades of hands-on experience have given us deep expertise in subsea rock installation,” said Philippe Hutse, director, offshore, energy at Jan De Nul. We have applied this knowledge throughout the vessel’s design. The collective capacity of our subsea rock installation fleet now surges beyond 100,000 tonnes. This investment will strengthen our leading position in the industry.”

The George W. Goethals will be an ultra-low emission vessel (ULEV) with a highly advanced dual exhaust filter system which removes up to 99% of nanoparticles from emissions using a diesel particulate filter and a NOx reduction system. The system also significantly reduces exhaust gas pollutants.

With this technology, the vessel will comply with the strict European Stage V emission standards for inland waterway vessels. Additionally, NOx emissions will be reduced to an extent that will see the vessel meet the even stricter EURO VI emission limits.

The George W. Goethals will be able to operate on biofuel and green methanol, significantly reducing CO2 emissions. It will have hybrid power plant on board that combines the generators with a battery and drive technology, designed for peak shaving, load smoothening, spinning reserve and optimized engine loading.

The vessel will be equipped with four electric excavators. Among other applications, they will be used for loading large size rocks, enabling efficient operations without the need for a dedicated conveyor belt or crane on shore.

To ensure precision and efficiency in subsea rock installation, the vessel will feature key equipment supplied by Fincantieri Group member Remazel Engineering that includes a vertical and an inclined fall pipe system, as well as a rock transport system for rock installation at depths up to 400 meters and for supporting an installation rate up to 2,000 tons/hour.

“We are thrilled to collaborate with Jan De Nul on this significant project and to contribute our expertise in offshore equipment engineering,” said Remazel Engineering CEO Andrea Rosa. “This contract underscores our commitment to delivering advanced solutions for subsea infrastructure and offshore construction.”

The vessel’s namesake, George Washington Goethals (1858–1921), the son of Belgian immigrants, was an American military officer and civil engineer best known for overseeing the construction and opening of the Panama Canal.",https://www.marinelog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GeorgeWGoethals_Deployed_Vertical_4.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 11:57:05.536352

The U.S. described the proposal as posing “significant economic risks” and creating an unsanctioned global tax system.

While the U.S. remains opposed, major container shipping companies believe a global regulatory framework is essential to speed up decarbonisation in the industry. At the same time, some of the world’s largest oil tanker operators have expressed serious concerns over the proposal.

Supporters of the IMO initiative have cautioned that, without international regulation, the shipping industry could face a mix of local rules that would increase operational costs without effectively reducing emissions.

The upcoming vote is expected to play a key role in shaping global shipping, trade, and climate policy, as countries weigh economic risks against the need to reduce emissions from one of the world’s most polluting industries.

The environmental protection body said that nearly half of these failures were down to ‘poor operational management at existing treatment plants’, however it noted that delays by Ireland’s water authority, Uisce Éireann, in delivering much-needed infrastructure improvements are prolonging risks to water quality.

Priority areas

Investment in key focus areas has reaped benefits, but a lot more needs to be done, Pat Byrne, director of the EPA’s Office of Radiation Protection and Environmental Monitoring, commented, “Targeting improvements at priority areas identified by the EPA is delivering environmental benefits. The new treatment plants built to stop discharges of raw sewage from areas such as Arklow and Kilrush are clear examples of this progress.

“However, delays in designing and delivering infrastructural upgrades required at many more areas are prolonging negative impacts on water quality and the wider environment.”

The EPA said that operational and maintenance issues ‘can and must’ be resolved as a matter of urgency, while infrastructural deficits represent a longer-term challenge that will require substantial and sustained investment.

Uisce Éireann

The EPA has identified some 78 priority areas where improvements need to be made, with Uisce Éireann yet to commence works needed at half of these.

“Uisce Éireann must accelerate the pace of delivery of essential upgrades at priority areas to ensure cleaner rivers, estuaries, lakes and coastal waters and support a healthier environment for all,” Byrne added.

As the EPA noted, some 14 large towns and cities across Ireland failed to meet European-wide wastewater treatment standards in 2024, compared to six the previous year, an indication that Uisce Éireann needs to take urgent action to ‘prevent previously compliant treatment plants slipping into non-compliance’.

But it aptly describes events that will be occurring in London this week, the outcomes of which could have important long-term consequences for the future competitiveness of America’s renewable producers and farmers.

Diplomats from around the world will meet in England’s capital city October 14–17 to vote on whether to adopt a new set of international regulations focused on reducing GHG emissions from oceangoing ships. And whether the interests of U.S. fuel producers, farmers, and shippers are at the table—or on the menu—remains to be seen.

This proposed regulatory program, developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), is known as the “Net-Zero Framework” and operates similarly to a low carbon fuel standard for on-road fuels (like those already in place in California, Oregon, Washington, and Canada). In accordance with annual standards, ships must gradually reduce their GHG emissions over time by using lower-carbon fuels in place of traditional fossil-based marine fuel. Ship operators who use fuels with lifecycle carbon intensity values below the annual standard will generate tradeable and bankable credits, while ships that exceed the annual carbon intensity threshold will generate deficits. Those deficits must be offset by acquiring credits from over-compliant shippers and/or by paying into a proposed IMO Net-Zero Fund, which will be used to financially reward low-emission ships, support research and innovation, and for other purposes. Marine shipping companies around the world, including U.S. businesses, have voiced their support for the IMO program.

The U.S. ethanol industry sees the IMO Net-Zero Framework as an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made renewable fuels produced from American-grown crops like corn, sorghum, and soybeans. How enormous? Well, the ships that would be subject to the IMO regulations typically consume roughly 70–80 billion gallons of fuel per year worldwide. To put that in perspective, total U.S. ethanol production last year was 16.1 billion gallons. Even if U.S. ethanol captured just 5 percent of the global maritime fuel market, it would equate to a game-changing demand boost of 4–5 billion gallons, while simultaneously increasing corn demand by 1.5 billion bushels or more. Just imagine the economic impact that this sort of new demand would have on the rural communities where ethanol is produced and corn is grown.

Today, most (roughly 93 percent) marine fuel is petroleum-based fuel oil and diesel/gas oil (“bunker fuels”), while about 6 percent is liquified natural gas (LNG). Meanwhile, considerably less than 1 percent of current maritime fuel needs are met with biofuels or other low-carbon alternative fuels. Adoption of the Net-Zero Framework would change that—and change it quickly.

According to Department of Energy (DOE) analyses, U.S. corn ethanol used for maritime fuel could reduce GHG emissions by 61 percent compared to the traditional fossil-based marine fuels being used today. DOE’s research also shows a 66 percent GHG reduction for U.S. soy biodiesel used as marine fuel and a 60 percent reduction for soy-based renewable diesel. That means ships using low-cost, American-made ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel could generate credits and easily comply with the annual IMO standards (which, if approved, are set to take effect in 2027), through at least 2038. U.S.-produced LNG and biogas would also serve as attractive options under the Net-Zero Framework.

The IMO program represents an unprecedented opportunity for ensuring American energy dominance in an emerging global market, leveraging existing infrastructure and investments, and enhancing the economic resiliency of U.S. agriculture and rural communities.

Thus, we were more than a little surprised when Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy issued a statement in August stating that the Trump Administration “unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO.” The statement also encouraged other IMO member countries to vote against the proposal this week.

The administration’s opposition appears rooted in its notion that the IMO framework would “preclude the use of proven technologies such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biofuels.” We don’t see it that way. Again, according to DOE’s own analysis, U.S. ethanol—the lowest-cost alternative fuel available at scale worldwide—would be an incredibly competitive marine fuel option under the program. Major players in the marine engine and shipping industries are already acknowledging ethanol’s potential. Indeed, one marine engine manufacturer recently called adoption of the Net-Zero Framework “a beautiful case for those who have ethanol capabilities installed already” due to ethanol’s “handling benefits, growing availability and competitive pricing.”

But if U.S. leaders leave the table, they will most certainly cede this important market opportunity to our biofuel and agriculture competitors in Brazil, China, and Europe. They’ll also leave a leadership void that proponents of uneconomical, unproven, fantasy fuel technologies will be all too happy to fill.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/640/1000/Container-Ship.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 11:57:40.266229

The Earth has passed its first climate tipping point

A new Global Tipping Points report led by the University of Exeter warns the Earth has crossed its first catastrophic climate threshold: the irreversible decline of warm-water coral reefs. These reefs, which support a quarter of marine species and sustain the lives of hundreds of millions of people, are officially undergoing “widespread dieback” due to ocean warming. The scientists estimate reefs begin collapsing between 1°C and 1.5°C of global heating, with current warming already at 1.4°C. The report, backed by 160 scientists from 23 countries, also cautions that other critical systems, the Amazon, Antarctic ice, and ocean currents, may soon reach tipping points. The urgency for sustainable business practices and emissions cuts continues to grow as scientists discover these irreversible tipping points.

Pentagon commits $1B towards critical minerals stockpile to counter China

The U.S. Department of Defense is ramping up efforts to secure supplies of critical minerals essential for weapons, clean energy, and tech manufacturing. Through its Defense Logistics Agency, the Pentagon plans to buy up to $1 billion worth of cobalt, antimony, tantalum, scandium, and other key materials, many of which are dominated by Chinese supply chains. The ambitious plans follow Beijing’s export controls on rare earths and related technologies announced last week. The U.S. relies on critical minerals for defense, and Trump is eager to use $5B for defense department investments in critical minerals supply chains. With these bold investments, the critical question that remains is: where will these minerals come from?

New Zealand targets 24% methane cut from livestock by 2050

New Zealand has announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions from livestock, the sector responsible for nearly half its total greenhouse gases, by up to 24% by 2050. The plan emphasizes research, technology investment, and collaboration with farmers to develop low-emission feed and breeding innovations. Agriculture remains the backbone of New Zealand’s economy, but methane from sheep and cattle has made it one of the world’s highest per-capita emitters. The initiative signals a pragmatic approach to balancing economic stability with global climate commitments, though critics say the voluntary measures may fall short of what’s needed to meet the country’s 1.5°C target.

“The message from producers is clear: to decarbonise shipping at scale, incentives for green e-fuels are essential.","Twenty green fuel producers have called on delegates of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to seize a ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to set shipping on a sustainable pathway.

At this week’s extraordinary session, leaders will come together in London to discuss the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) that was agreed in April earlier this year. A final vote is expected on Thursday or Friday.

The group of companies, including the likes of European Energy, Liquid Wind, ET Fuels, HIF Global and Zero Waste calls on the IMO to adopt the deal and to include specific incentives for green e-fuels, which are currently at a disadvantage to LNG and biofuels. That is despite hydrogen-based e-fuels providing much greater emissions savings and being the only fuel that cannot.

Together, the signatories have projects in Africa, South and North America, Europe, Southeast Asia as well as Oceania.

“E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground. Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules. The current IMO Net-Zero Framework leaves e-fuels competing with cheaper and unsustainable options like fossil gas and first-generation biofuels,” Alison Shaw, IMO manager at T&E, emphasized.

“The message from producers is clear: to decarbonise shipping at scale, incentives for green e-fuels are essential. Without targeted incentives, shipping’s energy transition risks stalling before it begins.”

In related news, the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum recently published a new insight brief which highlighted that IMO’s new policy measures are ambitious enough to drive a transition to scalable zero-emission fuels but will ultimately only succeed if they include meaningful rewards and, over time, higher penalties for non-compliance.

The analysis found that e-fuels have the highest potential for shipping to achieve its long-term decarbonization targets. However, early uptake and value chain development are needed if they are to reach commercial viability in time.

IMO Meeting is Crucial Moment for Shipping Industry to Cut Its Global Climate Pollution

London– As a special meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO, MEPC/ES.2) opens tomorrow in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition is calling on IMO member states to adopt the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) – set to be the first globally binding set of policies to reduce shipping’s climate pollution.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect – lacking ambition, proper safeguards against the uptake on unsustainable fuels, and failing to provide the levels of guaranteed finance needed for a just and equitable shipping energy transition – but it is a vital step forward by the IMO”, said Delaine McCullough, President of the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC). “It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions. What has been missing—until now—is a plan that countries could agree on. This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally-binding climate action is possible—now.”

“During this meeting, IMO Member States must not only adopt the Net-Zero Framework but agree on a realistic and robust plan for fixing the framework’s failings and putting shipping on a truly sustainable path to zero-emission shipping”, said McCullough. “The technology to make ships greener has long existed. This includes measures like reducing vessel speed, adding sails to harness wind power, powering ships through rechargeable batteries and fuel cells where possible, and deploying new zero-emission fuels that are safe for people and the ocean.”

“Pacific Island nations, along with Mexico, have made an important attempt to reframe the commitments in the NZF within a new submission (MEPC ES.2-2-13), which should be unanimously supported, especially because it brings the shipping sector back into alignment with a 1.5 degree pathway and the foundation of a just and equitable transition”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “It also reminds IMO members of their commitments under international law and binding relevant treaties including under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Advisory Opinion on the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change.”

“During this week’s extraordinary MEPC session, IMO Member States face a clear choice”, said Dr Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “A yes vote signals a commitment to implement the Net-Zero Framework, the IMO’s most comprehensive regulation to cut shipping’s greenhouse gas emissions to date. A no vote would cast the sector adrift, wasting years of negotiation and steering it into rougher and rising seas. Yet the framework isn’t perfect – it lacks clear signals to incentivise green e-fuels and wind-propulsion, both essential for meeting IMO climate goals, and safeguards to prevent first-generation biofuels driving deforestation. The IMO must use the implementation guidelines to back scalable, green e-fuels and technologies, not short-term paper fixes. Nevertheless, let’s not throw the baby out with the ballast water. It’s time to vote yes.”

It’s vital that the Net Zero Framework is adopted”, said Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk. “Delaying it doesn’t buy time, it kills investment certainty. Without clear rules, shipowners will lack the incentive to upgrade their fleet and fuel suppliers will stall on zero-emission fuel infrastructure. The entire transition will be slowed down and will keep the door open for transitional fuels to dominate well into the 2030s. It will also sideline proven solutions such as wind propulsion, which can cut fuel bills today while lowering emissions. This is why it is imperative the NZF is adopted and the guidelines reward clean technologies, such as wind propulsion, to give ships financial incentives to meet their decarbonisation targets.”

“The NZF is also only part of the shipping decarbonisation puzzle”, said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO. “Equally important, especially in the shorter-term, is the push to improve the energy efficiency of ships. Without a parallel improved IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) driving a reduction in fuel burn the IMO and shipping will not be able to meet the 2030 and 2040 goals of the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy. The CII is also key to keeping the cost of shipping’s energy transition down and making sure that shipping’s demand for new fuels made with renewable electricity doesn’t adversely impact the decarbonisation of the wider economy.” The revision of the CII resumes at MEPC 84 in April 2026.

“While the NZF falls short of what is needed to tackle shipping emissions, it is essential that IMO member states now adopt the deal in October, work to strengthen it as soon as possible, and resist attempts to dilute its provisions further“, said Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonisation of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch. “IMO national delegations should, at the very least, significantly accelerate the reduction of GHG intensity emissions mandated by the Z factors by increasing the level of the latter to reach the IMO’s 2030 and 2040 targets. IMO national delegations must significantly speed up the increase in Z factors for Direct Compliance to widen the Tier 1 zone and broaden the share of priced emissions, indirectly raising the effective carbon price on ships. A just and equitable transition (JET) must be a key priority for where the revenue is earmarked, alongside scaling up zero or near-zero (ZNZ) fuels and technologies. This is especially important given that JET is central to the IMO’s 2023 GHG Strategy.”

Emission Control Areas

During MEPC/ES.2, the IMO is set to formally adopt Emission Control Areas in the Northeast Atlantic, meaning that from 2027 ships have to switch to cleaner fuels and install exhaust aftertreatment. Both will reduce the air pollution burden for people and the environment considerably. The measure will also raise the costs to burn fossil fuels, thereby incentivising decarbonisation and efficiency measures, from wind propulsion to e-fuels.

“When adopted, the North Atlantic Emission Control Area will be the biggest of its kind”, said Sönke Diesener, Shipping Expert at NABU. “Clean Shipping Coalition members have been instrumental in pushing this over the decision line in close cooperation with countries. Special thanks go to Portugal for leading the way.”",https://www.ilnautilus.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tackle-Shippings-Outsized.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 08:58:13.311339

At this week’s extraordinary session, leaders will come together in London to discuss the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) that was agreed in April earlier this year.

According to the joint letter, in the view of the signatories, the current framework does not provide sufficiently strong investment signals for e-fuels. The NZF, as currently drafted, and without additional prioritisation for e-fuels in the relevant implementation Guidelines, risks incentivising pay-to-pollute strategies while also stimulating investment in transitional fuels, such as LNG, first-generation biofuels, and blue fuels.

The group of companies, including the likes of European Energy, Liquid Wind, ET Fuels, HIF Global and Zero Waste calls on the IMO to adopt the deal and to include specific incentives for green e-fuels which are currently at a disadvantage to LNG and biofuels

This would leave scalable zero-emission e-fuels under-incentivised from a regulatory standpoint and would delay large-scale deployment of the only long-term zero-emission fuels capable of delivering deep reductions aligned with the IMO 2023 Strategy. Without immediate and unambiguous signals for the production and uptake of e-fuels, the global fleet risks “locking in” short-term fuel pathways that undermine both ambition and cost-effectiveness over time.

E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground. Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules.

…said Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E.

Globally, there are an estimated 73 million tonnes per year of green hydrogen production planned for 2030, yet only 13% of these volumes are linked to offtake agreements. In the absence of stronger policy signals, many of these green hydrogen projects may struggle to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) and thus fail to become operational.

This is a challenge shared by all e-fuels as the dynamics seen in green hydrogen mirror those across the wider e-fuels landscape.

If the IMO NZF were to place greater emphasis on green e-fuels uptake, it would provide the necessary demand certainty to unlock investment and ensure the maritime sector’s transition stays on track. Together, the signatories to this letter have projects in Africa, South and North America, Europe, South Asia as well as Oceania.

…the statement highlights.

The NZF is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. By sending clear and durable signals in favour of scalable zero-emission e-fuels, the IMO can ensure that international shipping is not only on track to transition its fuel mix to reduce GHG emissions, but that it does so in a cost-effective and sustainable way.

As disclosed, Leclanché and Century Ship Service, which provides solutions for marine power, construction, installation, operations, logistics and repairs, equipped the former company’s 4 MWh Navius MRS-3 system onto a vessel said to be part of a new class of hybrid cruise ships.

Officials from Leclanché have noted that this was the inaugural installation of the Navius MRS-3 system in the ocean cruise segment.

Now that they are fully operational, the batteries are expected to allow the vessel to operate in hybrid mode, which is aimed at enabling carbon-neutral operations around ‘sensitive’ environments like the Norwegian fjords.

As informed, the ship in question, which boasts an overall length of 140 meters, has been extended by another 11 meters in order to squeeze in the battery rooms and the hydrogen systems.

By extension, the hybrid operation mode is anticipated to allow the ship to meet environmental stipulations, such as the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as well as broader emission reduction mandates set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)—like the Net Zero Framework (NFZ)—by next year.

To remind, Leclanché received a stamp of approval for its Navius MRS-3 marine rack system from classification societies Lloyd’s Register (LR) and Bureau Veritas (BV) back in June this year.

He was speaking ahead of his appearance on Riviera’s Greywater and blackwater: improving the compliance gap webinar, which takes place on 30 October between 09:00 and 10:00 GMT.

Dr Chen traces his trajectory from land-based wastewater to two decades in maritime environmental engineering and regulation.

He said the turning point was Alaska’s cruise discharge regime, “Since 2000, state regulations have enforced compliant discharge performance from large cruise ships through independent sampling.”

He describes these as “evidence-based regulations,” adding advanced wastewater treatment systems were developed and optimised “achieving consistent, compliant discharge performance with a proven track record.”

Reflecting on that period, Dr Chen said the contrast with wider shipping remains stark.

“As it turned out, the evidence-based regulations in Alaska are the only ones in the marine world. The rest of the shipping industry is regulated by type-approval regimes that are not supported by effective enforcement of compliant discharges,” he said.

He first confronted this gap between the advanced water treatment systems developed for Alaska and STPs when leading testing and an approval application for a sewage treatment plant under an updated MEPC resolution.

He noted legacy STPs were grandfathered and new STPs tested under lab conditions “performed no better on ships,” with many “discharging virtually raw sewage.”

He said it took courage to state the obvious: elsewhere in society, approval-centred models have largely been replaced by monitoring and enforcement.

“Since the 1970s, our society has abandoned the tried and failed approval-based regulations and shifted towards evidence-based regulations.”

More than 20 green fuel producers signed the letter calling on delegates to “Seize a ‘once-in-a-generation’ opportunity to set shipping on a sustainable pathway”.

“The NZF’s effectiveness now depends on how the implementation Guidelines are designed and what signals policymakers choose to embed within them. In the view of the signatories, the current framework does not provide sufficiently strong investment signals for e-fuels,” said the letter.

According to the green fuel producers the NZF as it is currently drafted incentivises the use of transitional fuels such as LNG and first-generation biofuels, locking in short-term fuel pathways.

“This would leave scalable zero-emission e-fuels under-incentivised from a regulatory standpoint and would delay large-scale deployment of the only long-term zero-emission fuels capable of delivering deep reductions aligned with the IMO 2023 Strategy,” they said.

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO manager at T&E, said in its current form the NZF leaves e-fuels competing with cheaper, “unsustainable” fuels such as fossil gas and first-generation biofuels.

“E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground. Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules,” said Shaw.

The signatories to the letter include European Energy, Liquid Wind, ET Fuels, HIF Global and Zero Waste and the 26 signatories in total have projects providing much greater emissions savings in Africa, South and North America, Europe, Southeast Asia and Oceania.

Meanwhile, Dominguez, speaking to Seatrade Maritime News on the margins of last week’s Cyprus Maritime Conference reiterated: “There is no need for ratification of the framework under the tacit amendment procedures. So, the NZF will enter into force on 1 April 2027, but if we receive notification from more than the representation of 50% of global tonnage then it could impact the entry into force.”

However, that is not what the IMO is focusing on, when the adoption is agreed IMO is ready to move into action the week after working on the implementation and the enforcement from January 2028, he added.

“This is about taking the next steps next week when we adopt,” insisted Dominguez. “Immediately the week after, we're working on the implementation guidelines, the setting up the fund, discussing how we're going to distribute in order to support the sector, the member states, the industry to decarbonize by 2050.”

In 2025 alone, the inclusion of shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) is expected to add more than $6 billion in compliance costs, according to estimates by emissions analytics firm Siglar Carbon. By the end of this decade, as additional regional and global carbon pricing schemes take hold, that figure could surge past $50 billion annually.

The projected total reflects the combined impact of overlapping measures such as the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime, UK ETS, and the IMO’s upcoming Greenhouse Gas Fuel Intensity (GFI) regulation, due to start in 2028. Siglar warns that if these frameworks operate simultaneously — and more nations follow Europe’s lead with local emission levies — the global carbon cost for shipping could approach $100 billion a year by 2030.

Analysts at LSEG Research expect European carbon prices to reach $150 per tonne of CO₂ by 2030, significantly raising the cost base for operators reliant on fossil fuels.

The IMO’s GFI scheme will overlay a worldwide carbon compliance mechanism on all international voyages. Early projections suggest it could impose $22 billion in annual costs at launch, increasing to $33 billion by 2030.

A major uncertainty remains: will the IMO’s framework supersede existing regional regimes or add yet another layer of costs? A fragmented system could create uneven competitive pressures, with certain routes and operators facing steeper penalties.
