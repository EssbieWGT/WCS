Conclusion Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology will be tested in a tropical climate.
Therefore, Malaysia’s carbon capture collaboration with Japanese academic and industrial partners marks a significant turning point in the nation’s climate journey.","NOVEMBER 10 — Global warming driven primarily by the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide (CO₂) continues to pose one of the most urgent environmental threats of our time. CO₂, the largest contributor, traps heat in the atmosphere, disrupting weather patterns, raising sea levels, and impacting ecosystems and public health globally. Emitted mainly through the burning of fossil fuels for power, transportation, and industrial processes, CO₂ also stems from deforestation, which reduces Earth’s capacity to absorb carbon naturally.

As Malaysia pursues its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the government and key stakeholders are accelerating efforts to integrate transformative technologies into national climate policy. One such technology under active consideration is Direct Air Capture (DAC), a process that removes CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. While Malaysia has advanced its climate agenda through renewable energy, electrification, and sustainable biofuels, these approaches can only reduce emissions by 40 per cent to 50 per cent. To reach full decarbonisation, carbon removal technologies like DAC are essential.

In a major step forward, Malaysia is initiating a multinational collaboration involving local universities, key logistics hubs, a leading Japanese university, and top-tier Japanese firms specialising in climate innovation, green fuels, and carbon capture. This cross-border initiative will pilot a mini DAC prototype system aimed at reducing emissions in high-concentration areas such as international airports and seaports.

Strategic deployment at high-emission zones

Malaysia’s logistics sector including aviation, maritime shipping, and associated ground transport contributes significantly to the country’s carbon footprint. Despite progress in adopting cleaner fuels and efficiency upgrades, emissions remain high due to the sector’s energy-intensive nature. To tackle this challenge, stakeholders are evaluating pilot DAC deployments at strategic sites, with a focus on Malaysia’s busiest international airports and major seaports.

Following initial engagements, private company in Malaysia has agreed to support a pilot project aligning with its sustainability agenda. A virtual agreement has earmarked a location near the aircraft hangar and close to flight take-off zones, an area with nearly a thousand aircraft movements daily as the optimal site for DAC deployment. This placement ensures the prototype unit is exposed to high CO₂ concentrations, maximising its operational effectiveness.

A mini-DAC prototype will capture approximately one kilogram of CO₂ per day, serving as a live demonstration of the technology’s performance under Malaysia’s tropical climate. The captured gas will then be released using waste heat from airport infrastructure, and subsequently liquefied for potential commercial use or conversion into green fuels.

This small-scale deployment will serve multiple purposes: testing energy efficiency, validating environmental performance, and collecting operational data to inform future scale-up.

Importantly, the prototype also demonstrates how DAC technology can be integrated with existing infrastructure and renewable energy sources, accelerating the decarbonisation of transport and logistics hubs.

Economic and policy implications

The initiative is particularly timely as Malaysia prepares to introduce carbon pricing mechanisms, including a national carbon tax expected in 2026. DAC technologies offer not only environmental benefits but also economic opportunities such as generating carbon credits, stimulating green technology industries, and enabling compliance with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards.

The project will also explore commercialisation avenues for the captured CO₂. These include use in synthetic fuels for electricity generation, and other applications in chemicals and advanced materials. Such innovations support the vision of a circular carbon economy, where CO₂ is recycled as a resource rather than treated as waste.

Malaysia’s involvement in DAC development supports global decarbonisation targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). It also complements the country’s own National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and recent government initiatives, including a 1 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending mandate starting in 2027. Hence, DAC will be critical to neutralise residual carbon, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping.

The collaboration also fosters a long-term platform for international research, talent development, and policy innovation. Joint efforts with Japanese university and companies will generate technical knowledge, strengthen Malaysia’s green engineering workforce, and contribute to the development of national guidelines for carbon capture infrastructure.

Our opportunity to lead in South-east Asia

Globally, countries such as Japan and the European Union are already investing in DAC technologies. For Malaysia to realise its ambition of becoming a green technology hub in Asean, it must adopt a proactive policy stance on carbon removal. Incentivising R&D partnerships, supporting pilot programs, and fostering public-private collaboration are key to positioning the nation as a regional leader in climate action.

Without investments in DAC and related technologies, Malaysia may struggle to close the carbon gap and meet its 2050 targets. However, by leveraging its ports, airports, and existing infrastructure especially with access to recycled heat and solar energy the country can create cost-effective DAC solutions suited to local conditions.

Conclusion

Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology will be tested in a tropical climate. Until now, DAC systems which remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere have only been trialled in temperate regions, where seasonal changes influence performance. This new study will evaluate how the technology functions in consistently warm, humid conditions typical of South-east Asia. If successful, the findings could pave the way for wider deployment of DAC across Asean countries and other tropical regions, contributing to global efforts to address climate change.

Therefore, Malaysia’s carbon capture collaboration with Japanese academic and industrial partners marks a significant turning point in the nation’s climate journey. The pilot DAC project offers not just a path to emissions reduction, but a blueprint for integrating science, industry, and policy into a unified strategy for climate resilience.

Although the use of renewable energy has increased and, thus, likely played a part in the decline of imports of fossil fuels, they nonetheless remain high.
As noted, fossil fuel carriers still account for around 20% of all EU Shipping emissions, with the Port of Rotterdam acting as the largest importer of fossil fuels in Europe by sea.
“Transporting fossil fuels around represents a double climate blow.
Ending our dependency on fossil fuels would remove a chunk of shipping emissions, but that leaves over 80% of emissions still to be decarbonised.","European shipping emissions surged last year to their ‘highest’ level since official monitoring began back in 2018, fresh data published by the EU’s Transport & Environment (T&E) shows.

According to the EU MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) system, which measures emissions from ships of 5,000 GT and above calling at European ports, 2024 set a brand-new record with emissions jumping by 13% despite trade volumes remaining flat.

Although the use of renewable energy has increased and, thus, likely played a part in the decline of imports of fossil fuels, they nonetheless remain high. As noted, fossil fuel carriers still account for around 20% of all EU Shipping emissions, with the Port of Rotterdam acting as the largest importer of fossil fuels in Europe by sea.

T&E has also highlighted that the level of transported liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been ballooning since Russia invaded Ukraine, even though data does show a decrease in 2024. On the other hand, emissions from moving crude oil have risen to 2019 highs.

“Transporting fossil fuels around represents a double climate blow. Ending our dependency on fossil fuels would remove a chunk of shipping emissions, but that leaves over 80% of emissions still to be decarbonised. Efficiency and green hydrogen-based fuels will be needed to get to zero,” Agathe Peigney, maritime transport policy officer at T&E, commented.

It is worth noting that the EU has been pushing forward with plans to minimize dependence on fossil fuels and boost investment in clean fuel alternatives, more so since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.

Just recently, the commission officially adopted the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) to increase investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels for the maritime as well as aviation sector(s). One of the key measures of the plan aims to mobilize up to €2.9 billion for alternative energy sources.

Officials from T&E have further underscored that disruptions in the Red Sea, in particular, have pushed vessels (specifically and by the largest number containerships) to re-route onto longer journeys around the Cape of Good Hope, causing them to sail faster to maintain delivery schedules.

In essence, per the MRV data, operational pressures born out of the Red Sea crisis resulted in more emissions per boxship, a segment that was reportedly the main driver of increased pollution, recording a 46% increase.

As informed, this can potentially be explained by an 18% increase in average distance sailed, a 3% average growth in operational speeds, and an increase in the number of units needed to service longer trade routes.

To add to this, shipping emissions—especially in the EU, which is believed to control around 35% of the worldwide fleet—are “very sensitive” to operational speeds as each 1% increase in speed can result in a 3% growth in emissions.

Among the biggest polluters in the maritime transport industry are some of its largest players. Switzerland’s Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) remains the most polluting company in the EU, T&E’s report suggested, having been responsible for 15.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Beyond the container lines, Italy’s Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).

“Last year’s record pollution shows that even when trade declines, disruption can lead to increased emissions from ships. With the inadequate IMO deal being shelved, the ETS carbon price has never been so crucial,” Peigney remarked.

As disclosed, the Emissions Trading System (ETS) for shipping has been in place for nearly two years. So far, it has proven ‘effective’, with around 99% compliance reported in the first year.

The upcoming review, therefore, could be the ‘perfect chance’ for the EU to maintain its course on maritime climate regulation by ‘bolstering’ and extending the system to make sure all polluters “pay their fair share”, T&E concluded.",https://www.offshore-energy.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/Industrys-first-Maersk-ready-to-convert-existing-containership-to-methanol-dual-fuel-engine-next-year1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1687333112,N,,2025-11-10 07:16:51.292915

COSCO SHIPPING and China Classification Society (CCS) jointly hosted a high-level forum on September 16 at the London International Shipping Week 2025 (LISW25). The event, themed “Green and Smart Solutions for a Safe, Sustainable and Efficient Shipping Industry,” showcased the Chinese shipping industry’s latest technologies and practical achievements in green and smart development, underscoring its global vision in advancing the “dual transformation” of digital intelligence and green low-carbon operations.

Mr. Zhu Bixin, Director of the Board and President of COSCO SHIPPING, attended LISW and delivered a keynote speech. He affirmed COSCO SHIPPING’s commitment to integrating ESG principles into its global operations and providing customers with safe, efficient, and sustainable services.

Global Initiatives for Sustainable Shipping

Mr. Zhu Bixin proposed three key initiatives for the sustainable development of the global shipping industry:

Promoting Regulatory Uniformity: Firmly supporting the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) net-zero framework to establish a fair, efficient, clear, and definitive regulatory environment for the industry’s green transformation.

Increasing Green Energy Investment: Proposing the joint establishment of a dedicated fund for green shipping energy, supporting cross-border demonstration projects, and overcoming energy supply bottlenecks to accelerate large-scale application of green fuels. Over one-third of COSCO SHIPPING’s new vessels are already powered by new energy fuels, and the company has already launched a green shipping energy fund.

Advancing Digital Green Transition: Calling for the creation of a blockchain-based carbon footprint certification platform to cover the entire lifecycle of green fuels, ensuring data immutability, traceability, and auditability from production to combustion. The existing GSBN platform, under COSCO SHIPPING, is prepared to collaborate with international institutions to standardize global green certification data.

Technological Advancements and UK Highlights

The forum featured in-depth discussions among representatives from international maritime regulatory authorities, industry organizations, and leading enterprises. COSCO SHIPPING presented an integrated “shipping + port + logistics” green and smart supply chain solution, noting that its operational efficiency has been enhanced through the application of blockchain and AI technologies. CCS showcased its developments, including the formulation of over 30 green and digital ship standards and the establishment of a zero-carbon shipping innovation laboratory.

During the event, COSCO SHIPPING (UK) released its ESG Highlights, detailing localized efforts such as the green smart flagship warehouse project by Crystal Logistics at the Freeport of London Gateway Port. This facility achieved a 40% reduction in carbon emissions and earned a BREEAM “Outstanding” rating through photovoltaic power generation and intelligent systems. Furthermore, its subsidiary, Multimodal Logistics Ltd (MML), is advancing fleet electrification and smart fleet management, achieving an energy efficiency improvement of approximately 8%.

AXSMarine data shows that from January to October this year, global ship orders by gross tonnage (GT) totaled 78 million, down from 113 million during the same period last year.

Order volume surged to a 17-year high in 2024 as ships changed course to avoid Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, meaning longer voyages required more ships to maintain transport schedules.

Meanwhile, shipping companies are also preparing for the new environmental regulations soon to be introduced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

AXSMarine data indicates that orders for alternative fuel ships totaled approximately 29 million GT in the first ten months of this year, down from 42 million GT during the same period last year.

However, uncertainty in the shipping market surged again in October: Under pressure from representatives of the United States and Saudi Arabia among IMO member states, the organization voted to postpone the implementation of a controversial resolution for one year. This resolution would have pushed for the establishment of unreasonable global carbon reduction targets and introduced a system of penalties or incentives for compliance with these targets.

AXSMarine personnel stated: “With the IMO net-zero framework vote postponed, the future order market is most likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach. From January to October this year, over 70% of new vessels ordered by container ship and car carrier owners featured alternative fuel capabilities, while bulk carriers and tankers accounted for only 10-15%.”

LNG continues to dominate among alternative fuels, accounting for 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol represents 9%, while ammonia and other fuels collectively make up approximately 1%.

AXSMarine data indicates that methanol’s prominence in container shipping has significantly waned—its share of new orders has plummeted from 48% in 2023 and 18% in 2024 to just 10% in 2025, with fuel supply and costs remaining the primary challenges.",https://www.imarinenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110151345456.png,N,,2025-11-10 07:17:15.309850

The Busan Port Authority (BPA), the Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA), the Port of Tacoma (PoT), the Port of Seattle (PoS) and the Ulsan Port Authority (UPA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (Mou) on 5 November, according to Pacific Environment on Thursday (6 November).

Under the MoU, both agree to strengthen cooperation on green shipping corridors, decarbonise maritime shipping and accelerate the adoption of clean marine fuels.

“Pacific Environment applauds the commitment to continuing collaboration between the state of Washington’s ports and Korea,” said Fern Uennatornwaranggoon, Climate Campaign Ports Director at Pacific Environment.

“Electrifying ports and moving ships to zero-emissions reduces the health risks of air pollution for portside communities and port workers. We applaud the ports’ action to protect communities and port workers from toxic pollution and climate change impacts.”

For nearly three years, the NWSA has been working partners on the US-Korea Green Shipping Corridors Project, the goal of which is to study the feasibility of accelerating the transition to zero or net-zero (ZNZ) marine fuels in the trade lanes between the NWSA gateway and the Korean ports of Ulsan and Busan.

The studies are exploring: projected demand for ZNZ fuels; emerging ZNZ fuel supply chains on both ends of the trade lanes and globally; ZNZ fuel storage and bunkering capacities (current and potential future); safety and other regulatory frameworks; and ZNZ costs – including an assessment of the “total cost of ownership” of ZNZ fuels, the estimated price differential compared to existing fuels, and strategies for bridging that gap.

“Pacific Environment applauds Republic of Korea’s leadership and investment in zero-emissions shipping,” said Hyunju Kang, Asia Climate Campaign Director.

“The Republic of Korea has set ambitious targets at the international level, while also committing nationally to green shipping goals. I am proud to partner with Korea to showcase their expertise with maritime decarbonisation and commitment to cleaning up the shipping industry in Korea.”

These efforts aim to enhance Singapore’s maritime innovation ecosystem and support the sector’s transition towards smarter and more sustainable operations.

The MoU was signed on 5 November by Mr Ang Wee Keong, Chief Executive of MPA, and Mr Carlo Luzzatto, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of RINA.

The technology demonstration centre will be part of RINA’s Open Innovation Hub in Singapore, and serve as a collaborative platform to co-create and trial innovative solutions for maritime digitalisation and decarbonisation.

It will support the development of remote and smart maritime systems, and provide integrated platforms to validate new technologies and accelerate their deployment in real-world operations.

Additionally, RINA will work with MPA to support maritime workforce development in Singapore by participating in industry manpower programmes and offering education, training, internship, and scholarship opportunities. These initiatives will prepare the next generation of maritime professionals with the skills needed for the digital and low-carbon transition.

Mr Ang Wee Keong, Chief Executive, Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, said, “The MoU with RINA marks an important step in strengthening Singapore’s maritime innovation ecosystem. By working with international partners like RINA, as well as our local industry and research community, we aim to accelerate the testing and adoption of emerging technologies that will make the sector smarter, safer, and more sustainable.”

Mr Carlo Luzzatto, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, RINA, said, “We are honoured to partner with MPA. Scaling innovation and advancing sustainability are key priorities in our growth strategy, and this partnership aligns perfectly with those goals. By embracing an open approach with Singapore’s ecosystem, we aim to create value for its maritime sector and beyond.”

Brazil, the host of COP30 officially launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit on Thursday.
The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance.","Adaptation indicators, including the implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and the Paris Agreement, as well as the NDCs submitted so far for the 2030 period, the Just Transition Work Programme, and the delivery of climate finance, among others, may be discussed during the negotiations.

Observers and negotiators who wished to remain anonymous warned that there are strong diplomatic headwinds that parties should be wary of. It is important to recollect that pressured by the United States, member countries of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), postponed a vote on a strategic plan to move the shipping industry away from the use of fossil fuel and become ‘net-zero’ by 2050.

The US warned of retaliatory restrictions and sanctions against countries that vote in favour of an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) proposal to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, observers said. “Similar fears are there, and there may be pressure on particular parties. That is why COP30 will be diplomatically a very challenging environment,” an observer said.

On Friday, the COP30 Presidency of Brazil sent out its ninth letter to Parties, which sums up what is likely to come up. The letter invites all Parties to help turn gaps into levers.

Drawing from the latest reports, including the Global Tipping Points Report, the letter acknowledges the scale of challenges ahead and the tools to respond as the global community gathers in Belém.

Following the completion of the Paris Rulebook at COP29, the latest edition will be the first COP where the full policy cycle of the Paris Agreement is in motion. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), and the Enhanced Transparency Framework are now active instruments of global climate governance, the letter states.

While it may appear like the stakes are not as high as, say, last year when the New Collective Quantified Goal was on the table for negotiation, thepositions countries take may still send important signals, experts said.

HT reported on November 6 that the Brazilian COP30 and Azerbaijan COP29 Presidencies have released the much-awaited report on the ‘Baku To Belem Roadmap To USD 1.3T’, which documents how to deliver $1.3 trillion annually for developing countries from all international sources by 2035. But this document will not be negotiated on and remains outside the work of COP30.

“I urge all Parties to use our work under the negotiating agenda as a Mutirão (collective effort) for shifting the Paris policy cycle from design to delivery. COP30 can signal the maturation of the regime – from negotiation to coordinated implementation – anchored in equity, science, and cooperation,” André Corrêa do Lago, COP30 President, wrote in his latest letter.

China may assume a prominent role

Observers believe that China, the largest greenhouse gas emitter, is positioning itself to fill the void created by the US, especially because it also has economic interests in the green transition.

“Earlier this year, at a COP event in April 2025 - the Leaders’ Summit on Climate and Just Transitions, President Xi Jinping made a strong pitch for China to remain committed to global climate goals. Xi criticised ‘major countries’ for their unilateralism, iterating China’s support for international climate cooperation through multilateral governance platforms. Xi has called China a ‘doer’, one that has taken strong action for tangible results,” said Pooja Vijay Ramamurthi, fellow, Centre For Social and Economic Progress. “Second, Xi also called out the protectionist stances of powers of the free circulation of high-quality green products, and promotion of technological innovation and industrial transformation through cooperation. Therefore, given that these are the stances of China at previous climate events, it will certainly take up a leadership role,” she added.

China may call for the continuation of multilateral platforms, encouraging countries to engage in constructive climate negotiations. It will point out its own large-scale, rapid green transitions, positioning itself as a leader whose model can be followed. Rather than keeping a low profile, it is expected that China will portray itself a champion of green transitions, given that other major powers such as the US are backing down.

It will however, as usual, place itself into the Global South camp, calling for solidarity against ramping down coal too soon. This has been reflected in China’s NDCs, which some critics do not find as ambitious as some expected, Ramamurthi noted.

Adaptation likely to be critical for India

HT reported on November 4 that finalising adaptation indicators at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem will be an important issue for India, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said in a briefing. “Adaptation is an important issue at COP30. The adaptation indicators need to be rationalised. It will be a big issue. Indicators must be rationalised, based on national circumstances, finance, technology, capacity, etc,” Yadav said. India’s nationally determined contribution and national adaptation plan is also expected soon. It is likely to present its successful renewable energy transition at COP30. India has achieved one of its nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, 5 years in advance. It has crossed its target of installing 50% of its power capacity from non-fossil sources. India is confident of achieving the target of 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, Pralhad Joshi, minister of new and renewable energy has said.

“The time for promises is now over. COP30 must mark the shift from a bank of commitments to a true bank of actions, where delivery, not declarations, defines progress. Nowhere is this more urgent than in South Asia, a region on the front lines of the climate crisis, from the small island states like Sri Lanka to the mountains of Nepal, and the vulnerable states of India among others. For India, climate action is both a necessity and an opportunity driven by innovation and powered by partnerships. But to succeed, the world must come together through smarter, more inclusive multilateralism that rewards implementation and builds genuine coalitions of the doing,” said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and special envoy for COP30 representing South Asia.

The COP when 1.5 degree C goal became obsolete

It will be important to look at how Parties respond to various scientific indicators at COP30. Temporary exceedance of the Paris Agreement’s lower limit or the 1.5 degree C goal is now certain, the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap report, indicates. “New scenarios show that limiting warming to 1.5 degree C by 2100 remains technically possible. However, due to the continued delay in deep emission cuts, 1.5 degree C pathways now imply higher temporary exceedance of this temperature target. The magnitude and duration of this overshoot must be limited as much as possible. Each year of delayed action locks in carbon-intensive infrastructure. It results in greater losses for people and ecosystems, higher adaptation costs and a heavier reliance on costly and uncertain carbon dioxide (CO2) removal,” the report has said.

Further, The Global Tipping Points Report 2025, by the University of Exeter and international partners including the Stockholm Resilience Centre, found that widespread mortality of warm-water coral reefs is now underway as the world reaches its first climate tipping point. Forests are also an important issue. Brazil, the host of COP30 officially launched the Tropical Forest Forever Facility at the COP30 Leaders’ Summit on Thursday. The TFFF is an initiative that incentivizes the conservation and expansion of tropical forests by making annual payments to Tropical Forest Countries that maintain their standing forest. India will join the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), Brazil’s global initiative to curb deforestation, as an “observer,” Dinesh Bhatia, ambassador of India to Brazil said in his statement on day 2 of the Belem Leaders’ Summit on Friday.

“The Amazon embodies the truth that awaits us in Belém: the future of humanity and the health of the planet are inseparable. The forest is not a distant frontier; it is a living center of the global climate system, the beating heart of hydrological cycles, and a guardian of the world’s carbon balance.

There will be renewed focus on FuelEU Maritime surplus (overcompliance) markets because companies that were waiting and monitoring how the regulations would fit with the IMO Net-Zero Framework will likely now commit.
Now it’s clear again that performance within FuelEU Maritime, for example, will be a key driver of commercial competitive advantage.
“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines.
Even if these fuel and emissions savings are slightly less important for IMO compliance in the immediate term, commercially they cannot be overlooked.","“While we support the IMO in getting these vital regulations right, the vote to delay the Net-Zero Framework for a year will make progress more challenging. If global regulatory development breaks down further and the delay extends beyond 12-months, instead of one global framework, shipping could face a potential patchwork of regional emissions schemes with different compliance systems. Without the right support, this fragmentation would delay decision-making and keep current uncertainties around monitoring and reporting unresolved for the people working in shipping.

“The key here will be data management and integration. Whether it’s propulsion systems, voyage planning, onboard workflow, or design processes, the future of ship operations will favor solutions that connect data, technology and people seamlessly. Any regulation or technology that compounds the industry fragmentation will only add to the workload challenge, rather than help operators, seafarers and shoreside staff to support compliance and safe operations.

“The IMO’s decision does create more certainty that FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) will remain front and centre for longer. There will be renewed focus on FuelEU Maritime surplus (overcompliance) markets because companies that were waiting and monitoring how the regulations would fit with the IMO Net-Zero Framework will likely now commit. Now it’s clear again that performance within FuelEU Maritime, for example, will be a key driver of commercial competitive advantage.

“FuelEU Maritime has teeth and is already starting to bite bottom lines. Penalties are robustly enforced and, at €2,400 per ton VLSFO energy equivalent, they are high enough to encourage investment in alternative green fuels. With renewable fuel energy density, availability and cost in mind – this can, in turn, increase demand for efficiency technologies.

“Navigating the regulatory maze is imperative, but the reality is, many technologies already make commercial sense right now. Take wind propulsion, for example. Installations have doubled over the past two years, reflecting how operators now see this as a financially viable solution, regardless of the Net-Zero Framework, and not an experiment. Voyage optimization is another example. What was once a ‘nice to have’ is now a boardroom priority, because the savings on fuel and emissions directly impact competitiveness.

“Our joint simulation project between NAPA, Norsepower, and Sumitomo Heavy Industries Marine & Engineering, for example, has validated the emissions reduction potential of combining wind propulsion with voyage optimization. The study has confirmed that the combination can deliver up to 28% emissions reductions on average. Even if these fuel and emissions savings are slightly less important for IMO compliance in the immediate term, commercially they cannot be overlooked.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:30.454028

A jump of 13% came despite a downtick in EU-related seaborne trade, with disruption of trade through the Red Sea likely leading to longer routes. Last year’s record emissions levels show how important it is that emissions are priced by the EU, says T&E, which calls for an expansion to smaller vessels.

Container ships were the main drivers of increased emissions with a 46% increase. This is likely explained by an 18% increase in the average distance sailed and 3% average growth in operational speeds, as well as an increase in the number of ships needed to service longer routes. Shipping emissions are very sensitive to operational speeds as each 1% increase in speed can result in a 3% growth in emissions.

Agathe Peigney, maritime transport policy officer at T&E, said: “Last year’s record pollution shows that even when trade declines, disruption can lead to increased emissions from ships. With the inadequate IMO deal being shelved, the ETS carbon price has never been so crucial.”

The ETS for shipping has now been in place for almost two years and is proving effective, with around 99% compliance already in the first year. The upcoming review is a chance for the EU to stay the course on maritime climate regulation by strengthening and extending the system to ensure all polluters pay their fair share, says T&E.

MSC remains the most polluting shipping company in the EU, responsible for 15.6 million tonnes of CO2. Outside of the container lines, Grimaldi Group was the largest emitter (3.8 Mt), while Carnival had the highest emissions of any cruise company (2.5 Mt).

Despite Europe using ever more renewable energy, imports of fossil fuels remain stubbornly high. Fossil fuel carriers continue to make up around 20% of all EU shipping emissions, similar to 2018 levels.

Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory.","The tanker and oil markets are expected to face a different landscape, as a result of the latest policy choices by the US presidency. In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson said that “Trump’s second presidency started with a strong push to change US environmental policy. Right at the start, the president put in motion the plan to re-exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to “unleash American energy,” which established a framework to encourage domestic energy production and weaken the electric vehicle (EV) mandate. In the months that followed, federal lands and offshore areas previously off-limits to drilling were reopened for leasing, and several LNG export projects were reapproved. The Interior Department cleared new exploration in Alaska’s Arctic zones, while the Bureau of Land Management simplified environmental reviews for oil and gas projects in the western states. Still, several of these actions are facing ongoing legal challenges from environmental groups, and whilst headlines show US crude production reaching record levels this year, the bigger picture is that growth in output is slowing, with production expected to remain largely flat year-on-year in 2026. Companies remain cautious about spending on the back of lower oil prices and expectations of rising oversupply. The oil rig count declined in August to its lowest level in nearly four years, although a modest uptick has been seen since then. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) has recently warned that new wells are needed in order to sustain (or increase) production levels”.

According to Gibson, “Trump’s administration has also taken several steps targeting vehicle emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to roll back rules finalised in 2024 that require carmakers to sell more electric or low-emission cars from model year 2027 onward, with the process well underway. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has begun relaxing fuel efficiency targets. Separately, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” reduced or cancelled several clean-energy incentives introduced under Biden’s “Inflation Reduction Act.” In particular, tax credits for the purchase of new and used EVs are no longer available after September 30. While the reversal of these policies is being legally challenged on many fronts, the industry response is already visible. Several automakers have slowed their EV rollout plans. For example, General Motors, the largest US carmaker, recently acknowledged it is scaling back its EV ambitions by slowing production at EV plants and shifting investment toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles in response to the changing regulatory framework and weaker demand”.

“Changes to EV targets are expected to slow the decline in US oil demand. Ernst & Young now expects EVs to account for half of new US car sales by 2038, five years later than initially projected. The decline in US refining runs will also be shallower than previously envisaged, which will have implications for tanker trade. It will reduce US crude export potential, with more barrels retained domestically. At the same time, this will also add an element of support to US crude imports, mainly sourced from the Atlantic Basin. On the products side, stronger runs suggest additional CPP export potential; however, much will depend on underlying domestic demand levels”, the shipbroker said.

Meanwhile, “Trump’s environmental policy is also reaching beyond domestic borders. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has come under increasing criticism, as Trump’s administration rejects the peak oil demand theory. The agency is due to publish its long-term view of energy markets next week, where it will reintroduce the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), last published in 2019. This scenario reflects only policies already in place, without assuming new measures, announcements, or enhanced targets. The agency will continue publishing its Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which goes one step further and includes both implemented policies and officially announced plans or targets that are likely to be implemented”.

“In the maritime sector, strong US opposition to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) was perhaps the key reason why the final vote on the agreed plan has been delayed by twelve months. In the weeks preceding the vote, the Trump administration warned that nations supporting the NZF could face retaliatory measures, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and commercial penalties. As a result, the industry is now facing an increased level of uncertainty – it is unlikely that the framework will be adopted in its current form next year”, Gibson noted.",,N,,2025-11-09 18:16:50.547860

09 November 2025 - 19:00

The US is pressuring countries to reject the IMO's proposed Net-Zero Framework for shipping emissions, warning of trade penalties, reported Washington's Politico.

The framework, endorsed by an IMO working group in April, requires final approval from a qualified majority of the 176 member states. US delegates walked out of talks earlier this year and sent a letter in August urging others to block the proposal.

The letter stated that President trump opposes any international environmental agreement that 'unduly or unfairly burdens' the US or its interests. The administration has threatened tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies for countries backing the IMO deal.

Industry groups are urging the EU to clarify its position. They want assurances that shippers won't face double regulation under both the IMO framework and the EU's Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime Regulation.

European Shipowners formalised their request in a October letter to Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas. Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the EU would review its rules if the IMO deal imposes significant costs, but industry says more clarity is needed.

Major shipping nations including Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK, Norway and Denmark have signed a joint statement urging the EU to align with the IMO framework.

Some shipping groups remain sceptical. Last month, a coalition of oil tanker operators called for the IMO's approach to be reconsidered.

The IMO's Net-Zero Framework includes emissions reduction mandates and a pricing mechanism to penalise non-compliance and reward greener fuels. Global shipping accounts for about three per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite opposition from the US and some oil-producing countries, 63 IMO members expressed support for the framework in April. Alison Shaw of Transport & Environment said this shows strong momentum for cleaner shipping.

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totalled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages.

Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations' standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the UN's International Maritime Organisation, voted to postpone for one year a controversial decision that would have helped to set unreasonable global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

""With the IMO's Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a 'wait-and-see' approach now seems the most likely outcome,"" said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine's vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80 per cent of global trade.

More than 70 per cent of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15 per cent for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29 per cent of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at nine per cent, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about one per cent, he said.

In the container sector, enthusiasm for methanol has cooled, with its share of new orders dropping from 48 per cent in 2023 and 18 per cent in 2024 to just 10 per cent in 2025, as fuel availability and cost remain key challenges, AXSMarine data showed.

Money, you say?

Bingo. But the projected annual US$15 billion bill facing container shipping lines and other carriers under the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) is only one line item in the decarbonization cost projections for maritime freight movement.

Cargo ships are seen lined up outside the Port of Los Angeles, Feb. 23, 2021, in Los Angeles, (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File).

And money is only one shipping industry red flag.

As noted previously in the Substack Shipping News, the estimated annual cost to decarbonize maritime shipping ranges between US$8 billion and US$28 billion.

Make that US$90 billion if you factor in the investment in bunkering and the other energy transition infrastructure needed.

Overall, the bill for reaching the IMO’s 2050 zero-emission shipping destination is estimated at US$1.6 trillion.

But that is just a ballpark, big-picture number.

A small example of the impact on everyday operating costs was provided during an October 8 review of the main findings in DNV’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025.

Eirik Ovrum, the report’s lead author and the principal maritime environmental technology consultant for the maritime industry risk-management company, noted that the IMO’s NZF “will effectively double fuel costs by around 2036.”

That raises another NZF red flag issue: what lower-carbon fuel and what technology required to turn that fuel into efficient and financially viable propulsion power will be commercially available to shipping fleets embarked on ambitious decarbonization initiatives?

The answer today is not enough of either. That explains in part why the adoption of heavy marine oil (HMO) alternatives remains minimal.

According to DNV data, 2,851 ships out of a global fleet of 120,936 have dual-fuel technology. That is just over 2%. And only 8.9% of total gross tonnage today is powered by alternative fuels.

The HMO alternative for most of those dual-fuel ships (1,539) is liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The good news for NZF fans and decarbonization advocates is that 51% of new ship orders include dual-fuel technology.

Most of those are containerships.

But the IMO is not big on LNG.

DNV’s Maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen has taken the organization to task for erecting roadblocks that “make the pathway less attractive” for shipping to incorporate LNG in its decarbonization toolbox, even though approximately 600 ships sailing today have dual-fuel LNG engines, and another 700 on order will have that technology.

Lower carbon propulsion fuel availability is a major concern for ocean carriers.

Ørbeck-Nilssen has estimated that to hit its 2030 20% emissions reduction target, the maritime shipping sector will need between one-quarter and one-third of the projected global supply of low-GHG fuels.

More low-GHG propulsion fuel technology is being installed in containerships and other ocean-going vessels, but the percentage of dual-fuel ships in the world’s commercial fleet remains tiny | DNV

During DNV’s October 8 session, Ovrum speculated that ocean carriers could only source enough biodiesel to hit that 2030 goal if “road transportation stopped using biodiesel and gave it all to shipping.”

And that is just the fuel-use and availability side of the energy transition equation. Other challenges include the complexities and costs of refitting ships with dual-fuel technologies, allocating space aboard vessels for less energy-dense fuels, and incorporating costly and complex onboard carbon capture systems.

But another red flag raised following the U.S.A.’s NZF rejection in August is this: should a UN agency be entrusted with instituting and policing the initiative and collecting and disbursing the levies raised?

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have those member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided.”

– Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general, International Maritime Organization

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez thinks so.

At DNV’s September 16 launch of its Energy Transition Outlook 2025 report, Dominguez was confident that member states at the Extraordinary Session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London would approve the initiative.

During his discussion with Ørbeck-Nilssen, he downplayed doubts about the approval.

Dominguez told the audience that “there is a consensus to move forward” with the framework.

“There are disagreements in some areas. And you know, we have member states that have agreed to the compromise approach … on the understanding that there is further work to do. We have … concerns that we need to take note of and then act upon. But it doesn’t mean that we’re divided. So, I’m still confident that we will continue to move forward [in] October.”

Dominguez got the month right, but not the year.

Countries opted to delay the NZF adoption vote to October 2026, which could push its implementation down the road to 2030.

In the meantime, America’s NZF opposition is another example of its distrust of the UN.

Maritime industry analysts and financiers also question whether the IMO is the right organization for the job.

John Lightbourn, a commercial shipping financier and the founder of U.S.-based Cavalier Shipping, suggested that the NZF implementation delay “could ultimately lead to a more resilient decarbonization framework — perhaps an acknowledgment that the IMO and, in turn, the UN, might not be the right body to oversee such a measure.”

He added that waning U.S. financial support for the UN raises questions about where funds collected under the NZF would end up and “whether financial pressures could arise to such a level that IMO will feel compelled to divert funds collected under the NZF to cover shortfalls in the UN’s operating budget.”

Shipping consultant Darren Shelton agreed that delaying NZF implementation might be better in the long run.

In a LinkedIn post, the Moran Shipping Agencies sales director wrote that “the postponement, while frustrating, may be the only responsible choice.”

He maintained that it would provide “a pause long enough to ask whether the IMO’s traditional structure can still manage a borderless industry shaped by private enterprise and accelerating technology.”

Shelton added that “progress in shipping has always depended on realism … Ports, fuels, and safety rules evolve through collaboration between practitioners, not speeches by politicians.”

With these orders, AET will have dual-fuel capability in all the tanker sectors it operates in – Aframaxes, Shuttle Tankers, Suezmaxes and Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs). The orders reflect AET’s continued investment in cleaner and more energy-efficient shipping solutions, and its commitment to advancing the maritime industry’s transition towards lower-carbon operations in support of global net-zero goals.

Each vessel will feature advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and environmental performance, including:

Everllence 6G70ME-C10.5-GI main engine, designed for fuel efficiency and to minimise methane-slip.

SVESSEL Intelligent Smart Ship Solution, enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven optimisation of performance and safety.

SAVER Stator-D (Duct), SARB (Rudder Bulb) and SAVER-Fins to enhance hydrodynamic efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems and a hybrid vertical bow design that further improve propulsion efficiency and lower emissions.

LNG is one of several alternative fuel pathways AET is pursuing, alongside ammonia and other emerging low-carbon fuels, as part of its Energy Transition Strategy. When operating on LNG, by design dual-fuel vessels can emit between 14% to 23% less greenhouse gases (GHG) on a well-to-wake basis than those using conventional marine fuels, while significantly reducing particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOₓ) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)1.

In addition to these savings, LNG from alternative feedstocks namely Bio-LNG and e-LNG offer a long-term and scalable solution to deep decarbonisation for the industry. These forms of LNG while nascent in their use as marine fuel offer significant incremental GHG emissions savings beyond (fossil) LNG based savings and utilise the same infrastructure2.

Nick Potter, President & CEO of AET, said: “This marks another important step in building a more sustainable fleet and supporting our customers’ decarbonisation ambitions. With these newbuilds, our dual-fuel fleet will grow to 18 vessels3, a clear demonstration of the progress we’re making in delivering more energy with less emissions.",,N,,2025-11-07 23:56:11.774558

Friday, November 7, 2025

I made the case last month in “Hey Ho, IMO Has Gotta Go!” that the Trump administration, not only rightly persuaded the IMO (International Maritime Organization) to delay a pseudo carbon tax on global shipping, but they should pull out of this climate scheme or scam all together.

Another specialized agency of the UN met not long ago as well, but unlike IMO, they managed to ‘fly under the radar,’ pun intended, of the federal cabinet and right leaning media. That was the triennial meeting of ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) in September.

As the International Air Transport Association (IATA) put it: “As you can imagine, with a commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050,…CORSIA—the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation—[was] in the spotlight…[at] this critical meeting[.]”

CORSIA “is the first global market-based scheme that applies to a sector,” boasts ICAO. And ICAO “adopted CORSIA in 2016 as the global carbon offsetting mechanism for aviation, rejecting carbon taxes and levies as effective solutions,” according to IATA.

“How does CORSIA work?” asks IATA. Their answer: “It requires airlines to purchase and cancel [Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs)] to offset their emissions over and above 85% of 2019 emissions.”

IATA goes on to note: “But there’s a big challenge: There aren’t enough EEUs on the market for airlines to purchase. … The resulting scarce supply of EEUs also distorts the market and drives up the price of the EEUs.”

However, according to Forbes in 2024: “There’s no current real-world data showing a direct correlation between the price of carbon credits for offsetting and airline ticket prices. … However,…as credits become more expensive or harder to find, the cost for airlines will rise.”

Also in 2024, IATA found that fuel costs were “28.7% of total airline costs” but these vary “significantly by region” such as “36.3%” “in Latin America and the Caribbean” “compared to 25.5% in North America.” And that capital costs of “depreciation and amortization make up 9.1%.”

In addition, a 2025 historical study of the pass-through by domestic aviation of fuel costs between 2000 to 2019, found that “the estimated results for 10% firm-specific fuel price increase are 2.4%, 2.9% and 1.3%,” for legacy, low-cost, and ultra-low-cost carriers respectively.

Regarding in maritime shipping, one projection for the price rise of fuel costs is 350%. And such costs have been estimated as representing “between 50–60 % of a ship’s operating cost.” Some media reports suggested that shipping prices could, thus, increase by more than 10%.

In contrast to the price hikes expected in international shipping, those in international aviation are forecasted to be quite miniscule by comparison. For example, some 2024 modeling estimated an increment “of less than USD $2 per ticket in Phase I and up to USD $5 in Phase II.”

Barack Obama once ‘said the quiet part out loud’ in 2008 regarding all these climate schemes: “Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.” It is unclear whether that is also the aim for CORSIA, after it becomes mandatory from 2027.

CORSIA’s apparent inability to make airline fares skyrocket, so far or anytime soon, has fueled, pun intended, not only much criticism from climate lobbyists, but also increasing allegations of “greenwashing” as well as green or climate “fraud.”

Stay Grounded accused the aviation industry of being “a greenwashing best practice case” because “CORSIA covers only a tiny part of aviation emissions [and] is a way for the industry to cheaply buy themselves out of climate commitments…like eliminating…fuel tax exemptions[.]”

Transport & Environment (T&E) went even further: “Offsetting is a climate fraud, perpetuated on unsuspecting passengers by an industry resisting real climate action. CORSIA is a non-starter[.] [And] ICAO…will never rise to the challenge of aviation’s climate problem.”

Fraud is defined as “a misrepresentation of fact that was either intentional or negligent.” Elements include: “The speaker…intended…whom the statement was made would rely on it. The hearer must then have reasonably relied on the promise and [was] harmed because of that reliance.”

Such terms are not mere semantics, as Dutch airline KLM’s “environmental measures” were deemed by the District Court of Amsterdam in 2024 to be “greenwashing,” declared “misleading due to being too vague,” and ruled to “only marginally reduce the negative environmental aspects.”

As in the case of IMO’s net zero scheme, President Trump 47 has issued executive orders at odds with ICAO’s CORSIA, such as: Putting America First In International Environmental Agreements; Reducing Anti-competitive Regulatory Barriers; and Leading The World In Supersonic Flight.

T&E warns: “Did Europe really think they could pass [IMO’s] global climate deal, (wrongly) dubbed the first global carbon tax, without a huge fight? … If Europe is not willing to seriously face off with Trump, it can forget about global deals…CORSIA being the prime example.”

Comparing jet fuel PPI (producer price index) from 1975 to 2025, vis-à-vis climate alarmism, is instructive. The high, low and average prior to Al Gore’s post-2000 climate crusade were: 109 (1990); 37 (1999); and 62. Since then: high 435 (2022); low 105 (2016); and average 202.

Even though ICAO and CORSIA have appeared to have caused little-to-no direct price harm to international airlines and passengers so far, nor are predicted to, the Trump administration should embrace the “precautionary principle” so beloved by the climate “bootleggers and baptists.”

That means getting out of CORSIA, before the mandatory phase starts in 2027. That might also mean withdrawing from ICAO too, before they, as a UN agency like the IPCC, eventually try to follow IMO with a global carbon tax. This is because, paraphrasing Star Wars:

“We must move quickly. The [globalists] are relentless. If they are not all [defunded], it will be civil war without end. … We will catch them off balance. … Do not hesitate, show no mercy! Only then, will you be strong enough with the [right] side to save [America].”

The plan to step up financing for sustainable fuels in shipping and aviation by 2027 comes as the bloc is falling short of decarbonising heavy transport by 2050.

The European Commission announced a €2.9 billion plan to scale up investments in green fuels by 2027 to curb carbon dioxide emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which together account for roughly 26.4% of EU transport-sector emissions.

With the EU’s binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonise, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

“The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,” said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU’s multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

“Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

“Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,” A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission’s plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,” Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only “detract from” commitments to e-fuels.

“It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production”, T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission’s plan was a “promising first step” to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.",,N,,2025-11-07 17:56:14.544071

Cleaner fuel-burning ships accounted for 37% of cargo vessel orders in the first 10 months of 2025, unchanged from the year-ago period, as buyers were uncertain about when global rules for cutting maritime emissions will take effect, data from shipping consultancy AXSMarine showed.

Overall gross tonnage (GT), an industry measure for vessel capacity, totaled 78 million from January through October, down from 113 million from the year-ago period, AXSMarine data showed.

Orders for all of 2024 surged to a 17-year high after ships were rerouted to avoid Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea, a process that required putting more ships in use to maintain schedules on the longer voyages. Operators were also preparing for new environmental regulations from the United Nations' standard-setting authority for international shipping.

Orders for alternative fuel ships were roughly 29 million GT in the first 10 months of this year, down from 42 million GT in the year-earlier period, according to AXSMarine data.

But uncertainty spiked again last month when, under pressure from delegates from the United States and Saudi Arabia, member countries of the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization, voted to postpone for one year a decision that would have helped to set global carbon-reduction targets and to punish or reward adherence to those goals.

""With the IMO's Net-Zero Framework vote delayed, a 'wait-and-see' approach now seems the most likely outcome,"" said Alexander Hadzhigaev, AXSMarine's vice president of data, referring to future ordering.

Maritime shipping transports about 80% of global trade. The industry accounts for about 3% of climate-warming greenhouse gases, a percentage poised to climb without curbs.

Major container shipping lines like Maersk MAERSK_A and Hapag-Lloyd HLAG said they will move forward with efforts to cut carbon emissions from their ships.

More than 70% of capacity ordered by container ship and vehicle carrier operators from January to October was alternative-fuel capable, compared with only 10-15% for bulkers and tankers, Hadzhigaev said.

Liquefied natural gas remained the dominant alternative fuel, making up 29% of total orders so far this year. Methanol stands at 9%, and ammonia and other fuels combined represent about 1%, he said.

In the container sector, enthusiasm for methanol has cooled, with its share of new orders dropping from 48% in 2023 and 18% in 2024 to just 10% in 2025, as fuel availability and cost remain key challenges, AXSMarine data showed.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 14:00:37.433912

IDB Debuts “Amazonia Bond” to Fund High-Impact ESG Initiatives

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has raised $100 million from its first Amazonia Bond. This funding will support important environmental and social projects throughout the Amazon region.

This first bond comes after the Amazonia Bond platform was launched in July 2025 by the IDB and the World Bank. The platform aims to attract private investment for sustainable development in the Amazon. The IDB hopes to raise up to $1 billion with more bonds in the future.

The program will use the funds for projects that fight deforestation, land damage, and illegal mining. It will also support good governance, climate resilience, and social inclusion. Projects must meet three main goals: reduce poverty, protect natural resources, and encourage inclusive, sustainable growth.

After this bond was issued, Brazil’s National Treasury showed interest in possibly issuing its own sovereign bonds under the Amazon Bonds Guidelines.

Corporations that are focused on meeting emissions targets can seek guidance from ESG tools.

Over 20 Airlines Agree to Revise Environmental Claims After Greenwashing Probe

The European Commission has made a deal with over 20 airlines, such as Air France, Lufthansa, and KLM, to change or remove misleading environmental claims. Some airlines had suggested that paying extra fees or using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could completely cancel out flight emissions.

This decision came after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023. The group said airlines misled passengers with false “green” marketing and called for refunds of deceptive environmental surcharges.

After the complaint, the EU Commission and Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) found several examples of greenwashing. These included using unclear terms like “sustainable” or “responsible” and making net-zero promises without proof. Airlines have now agreed to make sure all environmental statements are accurate, clear, and backed by evidence.

Companies committed to clean energy and corporate transparency should use ESG solutions.

Senate Republicans voted 51 to 49 on Thursday to block a measure that would have stopped the Trump administration from taking military action in Venezuela without approval from Congress. Most Republicans opposed the measure, but Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski joined Democrats in supporting it.

Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia and co-sponsor of the resolution, said it was meant to prevent a possible land invasion of Venezuela. He stressed that the resolution addressed more than just recent U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America.

Those against the measure argued that the president has full authority as commander in chief. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, described Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro as an “existential threat” and defended the administration’s right to take military action.

The vote came after reports of at least 15 U.S. military strikes in the region since September, which have led to more than 60 deaths.

Numerous actions are being implemented at the global, regional and national level aimed at achieving that goal.

In 2021 IMO adopted the short-term GHG reduction measure, putting in place mandatory energy efficiency requirements requiring ships to progressively reduce their carbon intensity (EEXI and CII), thereby reducing fuel consumption per tonne/mile transported. Latest fuel consumption data reported to the IMO demonstrate an improvement of carbon intensity between 31 and 38% (depending on the metric used), compared to 2008, thus nearing the 40% target for 2030 as set out in the IMO GHG Strategy.

Further energy efficiency improvements can reduce fuel consumption and boost innovation in all ship segments. Rapid technological development in propeller design, air lubrication systems, wind propulsion, hull coating, and just-in-time operations lowered CAPEX and OPEX costs, and faster payback periods.

Ports continue to pursue partnerships along green maritime corridors, and currently over 60 of these corridors are at different stages of development, nourishing crucial first-mover experience in the use of alternative fuels, safe bunkering, shore-power, and forging demand for zero and near-zero emission fuels and technologies through cooperation in industrial clusters in ports areas.

IMO’s support to countries to develop National Action Plans further reinforces cooperation between the shipping, ports and energy sectors, as well as the financial sector to enhance access to finance for shipbuilding and retrofits.

Shipping plays an important role in the global energy transition, enabling the transport of low-emission fuels from their production locations to high-energy demand centers, also allowing ships to use those fuels for propulsion.

IMO is in the process of developing a next set of regulatory measures that will further chart the course of shipping’s energy transition towards net-zero, facilitating global trade, creating new opportunities for alternative fuel producing countries, supporting related maritime infrastructure development, and safeguarding reliable and affordable shipping for the many States depending on shipping as their lifeline to the world’s markets.

This event will focus on current action; and recommendations on how IMO and other stakeholders can further prompt the energy transition of shipping through

appropriate regulatory measures and broader enabling frameworks; including first-mover action and support mechanisms, notably for developing countries, in particular SIDS and LDCs, to ensure that no one is left behind.

Governments and other public entities, international organizations, industry and civil society representatives are invited to join this dialogue, and share their valuable insights on the necessary next steps in shipping’s energy transition.

The 42nd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) closed in mid-October with no progress in addressing criticisms of ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) despite producing a 26-page resolution.

A report by UK sustainability consultancy Leafr published in late October suggested most companies in Europe won’t hit their sustainability targets.","Progress on countering global warming, both tempering the rise in global temperatures and mitigating its impact, appears increasingly stalled.

The 42nd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) closed in mid-October with no progress in addressing criticisms of ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) despite producing a 26-page resolution.

It merely reaffirmed a global commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – ICAO’s ‘Long-Term Aspirational Goal’ – and endorsed Corsia as the single global market-based measure for crediting offsets.

But Corsia only applies to emissions above 85% of 2019 levels so will cover only about a quarter of international aviation emissions in Europe by 2035 and an analysis of credits issued by the middle of this year, involving a tree-planting programme in Guyana, found 84% did not represent real emission reductions.

Separately, a deal to reduce shipping’s global emissions was abandoned this month under pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia when representatives of more than 100 countries met to approve an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Net-Zero Framework deal.

This would have seen shipping, including cruise, adopt global targets for emissions reduction.

Both setbacks came as the UK Climate Change Committee, which reports to the government on progress on emissions reduction, urged ministers to prepare for 2C warming by 2050, warning Britian is “not yet adapted” to current weather extremes “let alone” those to come.

Baroness Brown, chair of the adaptation committee, wrote to Department for Environment minister Emma Hardy whose responsibilities include net zero, climate change and adaptation, saying: “Adaptation is not keeping up with the increase in climate risk.”

She urged the government to prepare “at a minimum for the weather extremes if global warming levels reach 2°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050”.

In April, the committee declared current preparations “too slow, stalled or heading in the wrong direction”.

A report by UK sustainability consultancy Leafr published in late October suggested most companies in Europe won’t hit their sustainability targets.

Based on a survey of 450 sustainability leads across UK and EU businesses, the True State of Sustainability 2025 report found only 11% confident their organisation is on track – down from 24% a year ago.

Three out of four (76%) reported their team is inadequately resourced, two thirds (67%) said their team was the same or smaller than last year, 62% cited budget constraints as a barrier, and 42% flagged lack of engagement at the top of company, double the rate in 2024.

Leafr said the findings “reflect pressures inside the companies responsible for the majority of corporate emissions"". Two-thirds of respondents represented large or enterprise-sized firms with 250-plus employees.

Gus Bartholomew, co-founder of Leafr, said: “Sustainability teams can’t deliver net zero on their own. They are under-resourced, pulled in too many directions and forced into compliance work at the expense of impact.

Fellow co-founder Nick Valenzia said: “Boards would never accept financial accounts prepared by unqualified staff yet they entrust multi-million-pound sustainability strategies to under-resourced teams.""",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/377/shuterstock-shipping-emissions11_Thumb.webp,N,,2025-11-07 16:03:11.880819

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity.
While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable.
92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks.
This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.","Scientists and civil society groups are warning COP delegations and attendees about the risks posed by a rapid expansion of global biofuel demand. While often promoted as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, biofuels, particularly those made from food and feed crops, may carry serious environmental and social consequences if their production grows unchecked.

Current demand from the road transport sector is set to rise further due to ambitious targets in aviation and shipping, including EU and national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates and the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero framework.

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity. Projections indicate that by 2030, the global cropland required for biofuels in the transport sector, excluding crop co-products, could reach 52 million hectares, a 63% increase from 2023 levels, which is roughly the size of France.

Experts note that this represents a highly inefficient use of land and agricultural resources. By comparison, only 3% of the current biofuels area would be needed to generate the same amount of energy from solar panels, which underscores the relative inefficiency of producing energy by burning crops.

While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable. 92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks. Meanwhile, even optimistic estimates of biofuel life-cycle savings are often dwarfed by the carbon opportunity costs of not restoring land to forests or other natural systems.

The expansion of crop biofuels is not a climate solution. It is a costly detour.

… the experts highlight.

As COP30 approaches—an opportune moment of global reckoning and responsibility, the signatories call on world leaders to:

Prevent an uninhibited expansion of first-generation biofuels under international climate mechanisms or national plans;

Phase out subsidies and mandates for biofuels from food and feed crops, and redirect support to more sustainable energy solutions;

Prioritise investments in electrification and energy efficiency and sufficiency as primary strategies for decarbonizing road transport;

Prioritise land restoration and biodiversity protection over land conversion for fuel production;

Establish robust global sustainability criteria, verification procedures, and sufficient enforcement frameworks that justifiably account for indirect emissions, carbon opportunity costs, and social impacts. This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.

Finally, the scientists note that truly sustainable biofuels can play a limited role in decarbonising a narrow set of hard-to-electrify sectors, such as aviation, but this must not justify a blind embrace of policies that repeat past mistakes of relentless crop biofuels expansion.

The science is clear: we cannot burn our way to net zero, especially not at the expense of forests, food, and future generations. We urge you to reflect on this science in the decisions made at COP30.
