FleetVision provides real-time visibility across the fleet, transforms video and operational data into practical AI insights, and delivers a unified operating picture for ship and shore.","In an exclusive interview with Osher Perry, CEO of ShipIn, we explore the emerging trends shaping the future of shipping and how technology will transform this dynamic sector, provided that operators embrace it not as an add-on but as a core operational strategy.

One of the most exciting shifts underway is the move toward AI-assisted operations. Osher highlights the key capabilities of FleetVision™, which provides real-time visibility across the fleet, transforms video and operational data into actionable AI insights, and delivers a unified operating picture for both ship and shore. According to Osher, the connected fleet of the future will be intelligent, transparent, and continuously learning. Data will flow seamlessly from every vessel to every stakeholder, turning ships into truly smart assets. In this environment, enhanced safety and a more proactive operational approach will become the norm, incidents will be prevented rather than merely documented after they occur. “ShipIn is the intelligent layer that makes this vision a reality,” Osher emphasized.

SAFETY4SEA: What is ShipIn’s philosophy for the maritime sector, and what are your top priorities for the next five years?

Osher Perry: At ShipIn, our philosophy is straightforward: every fleet can operate smarter, safer, and more efficiently when vessels and shore teams are truly connected. We believe that visibility is the foundation of good decision-making, and by giving shipowners and managers clear, real-time insights into what’s happening onboard, we help them shift from reactive responses to proactive operations. Over the next five years, our top priorities are to expand FleetVision™ capabilities across safety, technical, and operational domains, scale our AI models to deliver even more predictive insights, and strengthen partnerships with shipowners, operators, and insurers to establish new industry standards. At the same time, we are committed to enabling seamless fleet-wide connectivity—regardless of vessel age, type, or trade—so that every ship can benefit from the full power of connected intelligence.

S4S: What do you see as the biggest challenges and opportunities for the maritime sector over the next decade, particularly with emerging technologies and digital trends?

O.P.: The maritime industry faces several pressing challenges, including a persistent shortage of skilled crew that leads to higher workloads and greater operational risk, increasing regulatory pressure related to safety, emissions, and ESG reporting, and fragmented data silos across legacy systems that make fleetwide decision-making difficult. At the same time, there are powerful opportunities: the adoption of AI and automation can amplify crew capabilities and reduce human error; digital twins and predictive maintenance can significantly improve asset longevity; and greater standardization and data-driven collaboration between ship and shore can unlock efficiencies that were previously out of reach. The next decade will favor operators who embrace technology not as an add-on, but as a core operational strategy.

S4S: Maritime incidents can have both human and environmental consequences. How does ShipIn’s platform help prevent such incidents before they happen?

O.P.: FleetVision™ transforms onboard operators from incident responders to incident preventers. Through dedicated modules for MARPOL, Bridge, Technical, and Safety, the platform detects unsafe behaviors, equipment anomalies, and operational deviations as they occur—whether it’s a near-miss on deck, improper PPE usage flagged by the Safety module, a potential navigation or watchkeeping lapse identified by the Bridge module, an early sign of machinery or engine-room failure surfaced by the Technical module, or a possible MARPOL breach such as abnormal discharge patterns or non-compliant emissions. Alerts are sent instantly to both ship and shore personnel, enabling intervention before an incident escalates. This proactive, module-driven approach reduces injuries, downtime, and environmental exposure across the entire fleet.

S4S: What’s been the most surprising insight you’ve gained from deploying FleetVision™ in real-world operations?

O.P.: One of the most striking lessons is that small, consistent behaviors can have a disproportionately large impact on safety and performance across an entire fleet. When ships gain visibility into frequent near-misses—incidents that would normally go unreported or dismissed as routine—crews naturally start to adjust their actions on their own. In this way, transparency itself becomes a powerful safety tool and culture driver, well before any formal training programs, new procedures, or external audits take place.

S4S: Beyond performance metrics, how has FleetVision™ influenced onboard culture – for example, around safety awareness or teamwork?

O.P.: FleetVision™ helps build a culture of shared awareness and genuine teamwork on board. Instead of feeling “policed” for compliance, crews see clear, visual analytics that show how to improve everyday operations. For example, teams can review mooring operations together to spot safer line-handling practices, or analyze near-misses on deck to adjust PPE usage and housekeeping routines. Officers gain a clearer view of where coaching is needed—such as navigation procedures on the bridge or maintenance workflows—while crew members feel guided and supported rather than watched. This shifts conversations from blame to learning. Across our deployments, we’ve seen stronger safety ownership, smoother bridge communication, and better alignment between ship and shore teams. When everyone—from the master to the office HSEQ team—can see the same picture, collaboration and trust grow naturally, leading to safer, more confident operations at sea.

S4S: Maritime operations often face connectivity challenges at sea. How does ShipIn ensure reliable, real-time alerts and analytics in that environment?

O.P.: ShipIn’s Edge AI is the on-vessel “brain” behind the FleetVision™ platform—the intelligence that runs right next to the cameras, instead of depending on a distant data center. Built for maritime constraints from day one, FleetVision™ performs all critical analysis locally on the vessel, so crews receive real-time alerts and guidance even when there is no internet or satellite connectivity at all. Only summarized insights and selected events are sent ashore when bandwidth becomes available, using highly compressed data bursts designed for low-connectivity environments. Ships stay informed in real time, and shore teams receive timely information without overwhelming satellite networks.

S4S: Which innovation or technological shift in the maritime sector excites you the most right now, and why?

O.P.: The most exciting change underway is the shift toward AI-assisted operations, where technology acts as a true co-pilot for both crew and shore teams. Instead of relying solely on human vigilance, vessels can now benefit from automated situational awareness that continuously monitors equipment, environments, and workflows. Predictive failure detection flags issues before they escalate, giving teams time to plan maintenance and avoid costly downtime. By fusing data from cameras, sensors, logs, and other onboard systems, AI helps present a clearer operational picture and supports faster, more confident decision-making. This is not about automation replacing people—it’s about automation empowering people, amplifying their expertise, and enabling them to run safer, more efficient, and more resilient operations.

S4S: What does the “connected fleet of the future” look like to you, and what role will ShipIn play in making that vision a reality?

O.P.: The connected fleet of the future is intelligent, transparent, and always learning. Data flows effortlessly from every vessel to every stakeholder, turning ships into truly smart assets. Incidents are anticipated and prevented rather than simply logged after the fact. Maintenance shifts from reactive troubleshooting to planned, data-driven care. Crew workloads are reduced as routine tasks are automated, while safety, compliance, and performance steadily improve. ShipIn is the intelligent layer that makes this vision real. FleetVision provides real-time visibility across the fleet, transforms video and operational data into practical AI insights, and delivers a unified operating picture for ship and shore. With ShipIn, fleets move from hindsight to foresight, empowering teams to protect people, assets, and operations.

S4S: How are Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics transforming digital innovation across the maritime ecosystem?

O.P.: AI is transforming maritime from a paper-heavy, audit-driven sector into a real-time, insight-led industry. Instead of relying only on past reports, operators can now use data analytics to benchmark vessels, spot performance drift early, and manage safety consistently across entire fleets. When combined with machine learning, these tools reveal patterns that were previously impossible to see—from subtle navigation deviations to emerging technical anomalies—before they escalate into incidents or costly downtime. This shift is not theoretical or experimental anymore. AI solutions are already being deployed in day-to-day operations, shaping how decisions are made on board and ashore. For companies that embrace it, AI is quickly becoming a core competitive advantage, enabling safer, more efficient, and more predictable shipping.

S4S: Are there any new developments or upcoming projects at ShipIn that you’d like to share with the industry?

O.P.: FleetVision™ is also becoming smarter and more connected. By integrating data from ECDIS for navigation, onboard weather systems, engine performance sensors, and existing fleet management platforms, the solution builds a richer, real-time picture of each vessel’s operating profile. This enables more advanced predictive capabilities that can identify risks before they manifest—from navigational issues to machinery deviations and other operational hazards. At the same time, we are deepening collaborations with shipowners and insurers to embed proactive, data-driven risk management into everyday workflows. Manual processes—such as reporting near misses or updating planned maintenance records—are increasingly supplemented with automatically generated logs and reports, reducing admin burden while improving accuracy and timeliness. By feeding structured, visual, and analytics-driven insights directly into the systems they already use, FleetVision™ helps make safer, more efficient performance the industry default rather than the exception.

S4S: If you could change one thing about the maritime industry today to accelerate digital adoption, what would it be?

O.P.: I would focus on dramatically increasing standardization and data transparency across the maritime industry. Today, too much valuable information is trapped in silos—separated between vessels, departments, vendors, and even different software platforms. This fragmentation slows progress, makes benchmarking difficult, and limits the impact of digital initiatives. If we can align around common data models, reporting standards, and shared KPIs, everything else becomes easier. Digital adoption accelerates because systems can talk to each other. ROI becomes clearer as companies can compare performance on a like-for-like basis. Collaboration between shipowners, managers, insurers, and technology providers becomes more meaningful, because everyone is working from the same factual foundation. In short, standardization and transparency are not just technical goals; they are the enablers that unlock real transformation at scale.

S4S: Finally, what key message would you like to share with maritime stakeholders about embracing innovation as a driver of growth and sustainability?

O.P.: Innovation in shipping is no longer optional—it’s a responsibility to crews, customers, and the planet. With mounting pressure around safety, sustainability, and operational efficiency, digital tools have become essential to staying competitive and compliant. The approach doesn’t need to be overwhelming: start small, scale fast, and stay committed. Even targeted steps—like introducing real-time analytics, AI-assisted monitoring, or smarter reporting—can unlock meaningful gains in safety, fuel efficiency, and decision-making quality. Over time, these incremental changes add up to a step-change in fleet performance. Most importantly, they help protect your most valuable asset: your people. By embracing innovation as an ongoing journey rather than a one-off project, maritime leaders can build safer, more resilient, and future-ready operations.

Manual fire-fighting equipment, tools and procedures Existing and new fire-fighting equipment were tested in different projects as regards as EV fires.","The “Safe Transport of Alternative Fuel Vehicles on Ro-Ro Ships (STARSS)” study was conducted by Bureau Veritas and RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. The first report provides an overview of the regulatory landscape governing the safe transportation of AFVs, including a review of regulations, rules and guidelines across both maritime and non-maritime domains.

According to the report, recent fire accidents at sea, such as the fires on the Fremantle Highway and Morning Midas have further raised concerns regarding safe transportation of vehicles. In particular AFVs has received the attention of the industry as well as regulatory authorities. In response, several shipping companies have implemented proactive measures to ensure the safety of passengers and crew.

These measures include to go above and beyond the required fire safety standards, by adding fire-fighting equipment (e.g. fire blanket and thermal imaging camera), upgrading firefighters’ outfits, offering specialized fire-fighting training, and a doubling of the carbon dioxide quantity on board vehicle carriers. In some cases, transportation of EVs has even been completely banned to ensure safety before knowledge is updated.

Together with the ongoing discussions in the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Sub-Committees on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC) and Ship Systems and Equipment (SSE), this indicates the need for increased understanding of the fire behaviour of AFVs.

Key findings

#1 Regulatory review

In general, the reviewed documents tend to agree that a combination of heat and smoke fixed detection systems coupled with a water-based fire-extinguishing system are a reliable solution to detect, cool down and prevent the fire spread in case of lithium-ion batteries thermal runaway events.

However, for vehicle carriers which are generally not equipped with water-based fire-extinguishing systems or, for container carriers, where the accessibility to the batteries inside a container is complicated, alternative solutions are proposed such as increasing the capacity of the fixed gas-based fire-extinguishing system.

From the guidelines issued by the industry community and insurances, the prevention and mitigation of fire risks is also coming from operational constraints such as the verification of the battery conditions during the loading stage or crew training. These points are difficult to verify and therefore difficult to encompass in the regulatory framework.

Based on this regulatory study, some knowledge gaps are surfacing leading to the need of scientific and technical studies, experiments and modelling on specific items such as the efficiency of foam-based fire-extinguishing systems.

Lastly, from the review of the land-based documents, it was found that most of the measures for the safe transportation / use of AFVs on land are common with maritime. However, some interesting measures solely in land-based can be highlighted and further investigated for adoption in maritime.

#2 Technical and scientific review

Fire and gas detection

Research on early detection of causes triggered an EV fire, such as thermal runaway, is on-going. This research addresses technologies, such as gas detection, video fire detection, battery management system (BMS) monitoring or temperature-based detection methods.

The on-going projects will also address the performance of existing fire detection system in ro-ro spaces, i.e. spot-type smoke and heat detectors, and will compare them with the aforementioned technologies.

Fixed fire-extinguishing systems

The existing research tends to agree that the existing provisions in ro-ro spaces for fixed water-based existing systems should be sufficient. However, as the capacity of the batteries increases, it may be worth to verify their performance on larger types of battery electric vehicles.

The research related to the performance of fixed foam and gas (CO2) fire-extinguishing systems involving battery electric vehicles are scarcer. Several projects on that systems are on-going. Recent projects on the performance of outside air foam system are encouraging but performance under actual marine conditions still need to be further investigated.

A survey documented that CO2 was used in eleven of the 22 fires on ro-ro vehicle carriers occurring from 2013 to 2023. In five of these verified incidents, the fire was suppressed or extinguished.

For the cases when fire was not extinguished, a long delay time combined with the fact that the space was not sufficiently sealed may explain the poor performance. None of the eleven fires involved battery electric vehicles.

Manual fire-fighting equipment, tools and procedures

Existing and new fire-fighting equipment were tested in different projects as regards as EV fires. Based on results from field tests, existing equipment (e.g. fire hose nozzle) and new equipment such as portable water curtain were found to be complementary tactical options.

However, the crew members need to be well trained and prepared to handle them.

Research on other new equipment such as fire blankets, brine-based fire-fighting system and battery pack flooding devices progress well. Their safe deployment in ro-ro spaces still need to be further investigated.

From the review, manual fire-fighting in the space of origin of the fire was not found to be the best option in case of EV fire, even impractical in vehicle carriers, and to be rather used in complement of fixed fire-extinguishing system, e.g. for boundary cooling or for re-ignition purpose.

Some projects have developed guidelines for fire-fighting procedures and even training programmes. Those materials can be useful to ship operators in order to develop their company procedures.

Explosion risk and mitigation

Research exists on explosion risk and mitigation in Battery Energy Storage System enclosures, but no research was identified related to ro-ro space. This is clearly identified as a knowledge gap.

Numerical modelling and simulations

Several numerical models enable the assessment of AFV hazards in ro-ro spaces. Simpler tools can be used for quick and preliminary assessment but are generally limited to open air configurations with limited effects of geometry.

For more detailed assessment, in particular in enclosed spaces such as closed ro-ro spaces, CFD tools shall be used. However, such tools require specific resources and competences.

In complement to experimental data, numerical simulations were found to be necessary to understand and assess the hazards on domain such as fire and smoke spread, effect of the ventilation or tenability conditions.

Way forward

The results will serve as technical justification for the development of recommendations in the upcoming parts of the STARRS study. The STARRS study have the following plan ahead:

Experimental campaign on:

(1) high expansion foam (effectiveness), focusing on inside air foam systems, and

(2) early detection of fire root causes (e.g. thermal runaway), complemented with numerical simulations;",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shutterstock_2160640583-e1764584668563.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 06:56:17.599805

“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue,” he noted.
That should concern everyone.” Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.","Philippos Ioulianou, Managing Director of EmissionLink, has warned the IMO’s decision to delay its Net Zero Framework is creating a regulatory vacuum that threatens to fragment global shipping decarbonization efforts.

“What looks like a pause is, in reality, an open door for national governments to move ahead with their own systems,” Mr Ioulianou said. “Instead of gaining clarity, we risk creating a patchwork of unaligned carbon schemes that will make global compliance significantly harder for shipowners.”

Several countries are already moving to fill the void. The UK’s Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) will come into force in June 2026, Turkey is preparing its own version, and Gabon on Africa’s west coast has openly discussed a local carbon levy. According to Mr Ioulianou, more governments are likely to follow, driven as much by fiscal pressures as environmental goals.

“For many governments facing widening budget gaps, carbon pricing offers a quick route to new revenue,” he noted. “Without a unified global framework, carbon markets could become less about decarbonization and more about balancing the books.”

Mr Ioulianou warns that regionalized systems will multiply reporting formats, verification rules and administrative burdens, creating real operational risks.

“Good luck to the shipowner who gets it wrong. Picture a vessel calling at a West African port, unaware of a newly introduced local regulation. The port authority could detain it for non-compliance and the owner is left footing the bill”, he said.

He added that some owners are already adjusting trade patterns to avoid overlapping schemes. “We’re hearing from Asian owners who are quietly steering clear of certain European routes due to compliance complexity. That should concern everyone.”

Mr Ioulianou also raised concerns about how revenues from emerging national carbon schemes will be used.

“There is no assurance that these funds will flow back into decarbonisation,” he said. “Some governments won’t even know how much they’ll collect until year-end and once the money arrives, the temptation to redirect it to other priorities will be strong.”

With more uncertainty set to continue, Mr Ioulianou urged shipowners to strengthen their approach to monitoring and managing compliance.

“Managing this manually, port by port or across scattered spreadsheets, is no longer realistic,” he said. “Owners need real-time intelligence on regulatory changes and data they can act on — long before they reach the next port of call.”

Mr Ioulianou highlighted EmissionLink’s role in supporting the industry through this shift. “We continuously track global emissions schemes, translating fast-moving regulation into practical guidance. Our aim is to help owners stay compliant, keep trading and avoid being caught out by local policy changes.”

Without decisive action from the IMO, Mr Ioulianou warned, the trend toward regionalisation could become irreversible.

“Every new national scheme makes it harder for the IMO to rebuild a globally aligned approach later,” he said. “Once rules fracture into regional pieces, putting them back together will be extremely difficult. The delay was meant to give the industry time to adapt. Instead, it risks creating confusion, competition and complacency. The world isn’t waiting for a decision, it’s moving ahead, one emissions scheme at a time.”",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Philippos-Ioulianou-EmissionsLink.2cce14.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:56:07.724742

Shipping on its own cannot afford the green hydrogen production investments it needs to deliver carbon-neutral fuels.
So, what is Accelleron’s stake in the carbon-neutral fuel transition?
With the right regulatory and market incentives, the shipping industry is prepared to adopt carbon-neutral fuels, thanks to decades of innovation and efficiency improvements.
The path Accelleron has travelled over more than 100 years, with even greater intensity since independence in 2022, has been focused on efficiency and enabling the use of carbon-neutral fuels.","The technology for net zero shipping is ready, but the fuels are not. A new report calls for a cross-sector push to accelerate carbon-neutral fuel development and keep climate ambitions on course.

Accelleron published a report calling for deeper collaboration across industries to unlock the energy transition. The report, titled “Accelerating to Net Zero – Deadlock: What’s stopping shipping’s carbon-neutral fuel transition?,” argues that shipping alone cannot secure the supply of green hydrogen-based e-fuels it needs to meet the IMO’s ambition of reaching net zero emissions by or around 2050.

The report proposes that governments, ports, shipowners and fuel suppliers work closely to break five crucial deadlocks blocking carbon-neutral fuel development, including: fuel demand fragmentation, geographic availability, financing, regulation, and bunkering infrastructure. Alongside maritime industry efforts, a wider approach to collaboration is also needed.

Shipping on its own cannot afford the green hydrogen production investments it needs to deliver carbon-neutral fuels. Nor can any of six other hard-to-abate industrial sectors: aviation, steel, power generation, agriculture, chemicals, and cement. The solution, Accelleron argues, lies in aggregation of demand across these sectors, to deliver an investable opportunity for fuel producers.

But Accelleron itself is not a shipowner, a port or a government, and its industry reach is focused on delivering technology and services to shipping and power generation companies. So, what is Accelleron’s stake in the carbon-neutral fuel transition?

A legacy of innovation

The answer lies partly in our legacy and partly in our mission. The legacy began nearly 120 years ago when Alfred Büchi first patented the turbocharger. Since 1924, when the first commercial design was delivered, that technology has helped shipping do more with less – boosting engine power, reducing fuel consumption and consequently, though it was barely considered at the time, cutting emissions.

Accelleron has been advancing emissions-reducing technology for more than a century, and when it became an independent stock-listed company in 2022, it made decarbonization its new North Star, investing in three levers that cut fuel consumption and emissions: turbocharging, digital optimization, and fuel injection.

Up to 2030 – by which time IMO aims for at least a 20% reduction in overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping, compared to 2008 levels – investing in efficiency will be key. In fact, an IMO-commissioned report from CE Delft found that energy-saving measures alone could meet and even exceed the IMO’s ‘striving for’ ambition of a 30% emissions reduction by 2030.

Driving efficiency and optimization

The study notes that operational measures such as slow steaming and vessel/voyage optimization could constitute roughly 50% of the reduction, technical retrofits about 25%, and zero or near-zero emission (ZNZ) the remaining 25%. Given CE Delft’s contention that applying all measures could add up to a 47% reduction, which implies that efficiency could deliver up to a 35% absolute emissions reduction, surpassing the higher boundary of IMO’s 2030 target.

Efficiency retrofits and operational measures can be implemented quickly, rolled into port stays, and paid back under today’s fuel and carbon prices. For Accelleron, that means turbocharger optimization – including tailoring for slow steaming with Engine Part Load Optimization (EPLO) and, for larger engines, enabling sequential turbocharging with FiTS2 – as well as digital vessel and voyage optimization via its LOREKA360° suite of solutions.

Accelleron has demonstrated the effectiveness of its solutions: a car carrier reduced fuel consumption by 3% after engine derating and turbocharger optimization, with installation during a port stay yielding a rapid return on investment. When combined with a propeller upgrade, the vessel achieved a 25% reduction in both fuel use and emissions, improving its Carbon Intensity Indicator rating.

Meanwhile GESCO, India’s largest private shipowner, replaced manual engine performance checks with a continuous digital process – including automated diagnostics and advisory – via Tekomar XPERT, part of the LOREKA360° platform. The switch delivered annual savings equivalent to US$45,000 per vessel, and was rapidly expanded from two to 48 tankers and bulk carriers, with a cumulative savings of over $2.16 million annually.

The ships are ready

Accelleron’s next-generation turbochargers and dual-fuel injection systems are designed to handle all major fuels, including e-methanol, e-ammonia, e-methane, and hydrogen.

They are engineered for adaptability, reducing retrofit complexity and cost so that ships can pivot quickly once new fuels arrive. A turbocharger can be switched during a normal port stay, making a vessel ready for e-fuels the moment supply reaches scale.

In 2024, nearly half of all tonnage ordered was alternative-fuel capable, according to DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) tool. In 2025, that momentum has accelerated, with the same tool showing a 78% increase in the first half of the year over the same period in 2024. That investment will need to increase to meet the 2040 target, and again in the final push towards 2050.

To achieve the 2040 and 2050 decarbonization targets, further investment will be necessary. With the right regulatory and market incentives, the shipping industry is prepared to adopt carbon-neutral fuels, thanks to decades of innovation and efficiency improvements.

The fuels are missing

But a vital ingredient is missing: the fuel itself, produced at scale and at a competitive cost. This is the challenge the report addresses, proposing key steps that could help shipping find the 150 million tons in annual green hydrogen production that will be needed by 2050. All the investments that the industry – ports, shipowners, fuel suppliers and technology providers including Accelleron – have made will be for nothing unless that happens.

The path Accelleron has travelled over more than 100 years, with even greater intensity since independence in 2022, has been focused on efficiency and enabling the use of carbon-neutral fuels. Accelleron is a key link in the shipping stakeholder chain, and we share our customers’ commitment to see that those investments are not wasted. And, beyond the commercial sphere, Accelleron wants a sustainable future for our generation and future generations on this planet. With the technologies, but without the fuels, we are only halfway there.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/accelleron-net-zero-form-2880x1920-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 05:56:16.613436

Accelleron’s ACCX300-L turbocharger series addresses shipowners’ needs for flexibility and future viability, featuring a compact, modular design adaptable to lower vessel speeds and ready for green methanol and ammonia.

The new turbocharger generation integrates compressor specifications for 2-stroke and 4-stroke applications within one concept and currently comprises the ACCX365-L and ACCX370-L frame sizes.This innovation supports efficient, low-emission shipping, aligning with evolving industry standards and operational requirements.

Greater operational efficiency

Many ship operators use slow steaming to reduce emissions and comply with regulations like the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator. This also helps shipowners lower costs when using expensive, carbon-neutral fuels. Engines and turbochargers must optimize efficiency across a wider range, and the ACCX300-L series is designed for turbocharger cut-out.

Cutting out one turbocharger at low engine loads increases air pressure, compression ratio, and firing pressure, improving efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. Accelleron’s FiTS2 system automates cut-out and cut-in via a control unit, optimizing fuel use while maintaining flexibility for full engine output.

Reduced operating expenses

The ACCX300-L series utilizes a platform approach to maximize modularity. Its easily exchangeable cartridge contains all rotating parts, enabling extraction and installation of the turbocharger core without dismantling the compressor or turbine sides. All casing connections are axially accessible within the turbocharger’s box volume once the air outlet is dismantled.The cartridge, including its transport packaging, fits on a standard shipping pallet.

This cartridge concept is especially valuable for cut-out operation. Turbochargers involved in cut-out have different utilization than those not involved, resulting in varying maintenance needs on the same vessel. The ACCX300-L turbocharger series leverages this cartridge concept, allowing vessel operators to address these maintenance requirements, with major service events possible during port stays as well as dry dock.

Instead of servicing turbochargers every five years, the ability to exchange cartridges in port means the full runtime between overhauls can be used, resulting in increased service intervals and lower operating costs.

Future fuel flexibility

Accelleron’s ACCX300-L series turbochargers feature an advanced turbine and compressor stage designed with increased specific flow capacity and higher pressure ratios. They deliver high efficiency at part and full load, up to a pressure ratio of 5.0, providing optimal turbocharging for a wide range of ship power configurations.

To meet higher engine power needs, Accelleron developed the TWIN concept—parallel combinations of smaller, lighter turbochargers in unconventional pairings of ACCX365-L and ACCX370-L models. This extends cartridge benefits to higher power engines, simplifies transportation and job duration, and enables more complex engine setups and turbocharger cut-out options.

Physical verification of the final product is key to achieving this next level of power density, so Accelleron’s qualification process has included thermos-mechanical integrity testing and performance checks and confirmation of reliability against high and low cycle fatigue.

Other testing has included analysis of the sealing air system and checks for non-uniformity of the inflow into the filter silencer. An investigation into the impact of ammonia-rich gases on turbocharger materials has also been undertaken.

Through shipping’s wider impact on the economy, Håkan estimated that 1 in 5 jobs in Europe depend on the export industry.
Currently, the shipping industry accounts for around 2-3% of global CO2 emissions.
As governments and global regulators, like the IMO, work to set new frameworks and emissions targets for the industry, shipping companies are looking for ways to adapt.
This fuel, in our view, will be more for the land applications because the energy density of hydrogen is not good enough for big shipping.","But with the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) trying to introduce a levy on carbon emissions from shipping, is the industry ready to reduce its impact or face rising costs?

In this episode of The Big Question, Eleanor Butler is joined by Håkan Agnevall, CEO of Wärtsilä, to discuss the importance of the shipping industry and how to make it more sustainable.

How valuable is shipping to our economy?

One of the world’s most famous shipping routes is the Suez Canal. Built in the late 19th century, the artificial waterway bypasses the Horn of Africa and reduces shipping time, cost and emissions between Asia and Europe.

“In 2021 we had this big container vessel, Ever Given, it got stuck in the Suez Canal. The estimates are that every day the cost for the global economy of the Suez Canal being shut down was €10 billion,” Håkan told The Big Question.

According to the OECD, over 80% of global goods are transported by sea. Between 1995-2020, 22.8 million people were employed on average through maritime industries such as shipbuilding, equipment manufacturing, and maritime R&D.

Through shipping’s wider impact on the economy, Håkan estimated that 1 in 5 jobs in Europe depend on the export industry.

Can shipping become more sustainable without harming the economy?

Currently, the shipping industry accounts for around 2-3% of global CO2 emissions. That’s roughly the same as the aviation industry, or Japan — the world’s 5th largest polluter.

As governments and global regulators, like the IMO, work to set new frameworks and emissions targets for the industry, shipping companies are looking for ways to adapt.

“There are about 100,000 large vessels out there in the world and we cannot just scrap them,” Håkan explained.

To reduce the emissions of the existing global fleet, Wärtsilä has developed a carbon capture technology which can extract around 70% of the CO2 from an engine’s exhaust.

Around half of today’s fleet is propelled by diesel, and 48% is prepared for alternative fuels. Håkan highlighted that liquified natural gas (LNG) is categorised as an alternative fuel, despite being a fossil fuel.

Greener alternate fuels are currently being developed but their supply isn’t yet sufficient for sustained usage on long haul shipping.

“These vessels [are] sailing far out at sea, so you really need to find fuels and other things that can sustain that situation,” Håkan explained.

“Methanol engines are being delivered as we speak — engines are ready for the biofuel as they become available.

“Then we have the next step and those are what we call the zero carbon fuels and there you have ammonia for shipping and we are delivering our first ammonia engines as we speak.

“And then we have hydrogen. This fuel, in our view, will be more for the land applications because the energy density of hydrogen is not good enough for big shipping. You will have to have a lot of tanks and then you can carry less cargo.”

Green fuels are currently two to four times more expensive than traditional fossil fuels. A carbon emission levy would level the playing field, narrowing the cost difference between more polluting and cleaner fuels.

Despite the uncertainty around the future of fuels and an impending carbon levy, orders for new ship stocks are increasingly leaning towards green-ready vessels.

Håkan concluded: “The movement has started and I do see it's accelerating. So with a positive perspective, a lot of things are happening. But is it going fast enough? No.”

At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025 reveals that new initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya.

For the first time since the report’s inception in 2022, four corridors have now reached the ‘realization stage’ where construction and operation begin to take place. However, many corridors remain stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels.

There are now over 300 stakeholders involved in green corridors, up from 240 in the previous edition. Port authorities continue to be key leaders, with public sector and governmental actors following closely behind them. The vessel owner/operator category increased by over 30% since last year, which could indicate that port and government-led initiatives are having more success finding partners in shipping. The one category with no positive movement on the stakeholder side is financial institutions. This could be due to engagement with financiers occurring outside the core green corridor consortia.

This year’s findings also reveal that some government-funded initiatives have stalled after feasibility studies have been completed, suggesting a gap between government priorities and industry interests. While companies have leveraged government funding to explore fuel options and thereby reduce their in-house research costs, this has not yielded action in many cases. In contrast, initiatives with high industry involvement have been progressing the fastest, as indicated by the four green corridors now in the realization stage.

Methane emissions in the LNG supply chain are important, accounting for about 4% of total (Well-to-Wake) GHG emissions.","In a seismic era for shipping and global sustainability efforts, the perception of LNG as a marine fuel has shifted dramatically in recent years. Once seen as one of many ‘alternatives’ in the future fuels bucket, LNG together with liquefied biomethane (Bio-LNG/LBM/RNG) are firmly becoming mainstream options for owners and operators looking to decarbonize.

Over the past three years, investment into the fuel has accelerated driven by a number of factors, including:

Immediate regulatory compliance: LNG, in its fossil form, is currently compliant with both local emissions and greenhouse gas emissions regulations. LNG emits virtually zero SOx, NOx and particulate matter emissions and reduces GHG emissions by up to 23%.

Pathway for industry decarbonization: The use of RNG reduces GHG emissions by an average of 80% and, depending on feedstock, offers negative emissions of up to -190%. Looking further ahead, e-methane promises a scalable solution for full maritime decarbonization.

Compelling investment case: LNG dual-fuel vessels provide the lowest cost of compliance with EU regulations, such as FuelEU Maritime and EU ETS, and the IMO’s proposed Net Zero Framework. The optionality dual-fuel vessels provide protects investment returns amid fluctuating regulations and fuel prices.

Growing availability of bunkers: The infrastructure for LNG and biomethane bunkering is available in over 200 ports worldwide and counting. The LNG bunker vessel fleet is growing rapidly and increasing volumes of the fuel are becoming available on a spot basis.

Increasing industry adoption

Data from DNV shows that the number of LNG fueled vessels has increased from 159 in 2019 to more than 1,400 in operation and on order today. Adoption is seen in all vessel sectors but led by the container sector, car carriers and crude and product tankers. The cruise sector, although relatively small in terms of numbers, has been a highly influential first mover.

The majority of orders in 2025 have been for large and ultra-large container ships which use large volumes of fuel making for a compelling investment case. Examples include recent investments announced by industry giants such as MSC, CMA CGM, Hapag Lloyd and Maersk.

Biomethane bunkering is growing…

LNG bunker volumes grew 4-fold in Singapore between 2023 and 2024; 50% in Rotterdam and 65% in Shanghai. This strong growth has continued into 2025. LNG bunkering is taking off in the US and Canada in ports such as Jacksonville, Canaveral, Miami, Houston, LA/Long Beach, Tacoma and Vancouver.

Similarly, biomethane bunkering has taken off in 2025 driven by companies’ voluntary decarbonization commitments and regulations. Biomethane operations have taken place in key ports across Europe, servicing container lines, the cruise sector, car carriers amongst others over the past 12 months. This trend is extending to the USA which has an established biomethane or RNG market with massive potential for growth.

But what about methane emissions?

Methane emissions, in particular the issue of methane slip in LNG dual-fuel engines, has long been a point of contention for LNG adoption.

High-pressure 2-stroke, diesel-cycle engines which account for approximately 75% of the LNG-fuelled vessel order book have effectively eliminated methane slip. For low-pressure, Otto-cycle engines levels of methane slip have been reduced from 2.5% in 2019 to less than 1.4% today in the 4-stroke technologies and from 1.5% to 0.8% for the 2-strokes. Post combustion abatement technologies are also being piloted.

These technological advances demonstrate that the industry is well on its way to solving the matter of the slip by the end of the decade.

Methane emissions in the LNG supply chain are important, accounting for about 4% of total (Well-to-Wake) GHG emissions. Here LNG suppliers have been making progress on a voluntary basis and in response to regulations, particularly in the US and Europe. Rystad Energy’s recently published definitive study on supply chain GHG emissions finds average Well-to-Tank emissions to be 13.9gCO2eq/MJ, well below the 18.8g default emissions factor adopted by the EU in FuelEU Maritime regulations. Further reductions are expected as supply chains evolve and the use of certification increases.

Looking towards the future

LNG is not a silver bullet. In reality, shipping needs a broad suite of viable options to be made available. Solutions which not only support full decarbonization by 2050, but which cater to changing technological advances, market and geopolitical shifts, investment levels, and of course, infrastructure.

Waiting is not an option, and LNG is a pragmatic choice. It is currently the only safe, scalable and commercially viable way for the industry to comply with today’s regulations and meet tomorrow’s compliance targets. Investing in LNG enables the industry to make immediate progress on decarbonization while also providing cleaner air. Then the LNG assets the industry is investing in can incrementally switch to liquefied biomethane and e-methane as these low and zero emission versions of the methane molecule scale.

Dominguez acknowledges the pressing challenges in the maritime sector, such as climate change and security threats, emphasizing that the industry must adapt to remain efficient, resilient, and forward-thinking.

In an interview with Robban Assafina, Dominguez outlined his vision for a progressive era at the IMO, leveraging his extensive experience as a former delegate and chair of key governing bodies to facilitate decision-making and drive concrete reforms in the organization. He highlights four strategic priorities: enhancing the organization’s work, support, image, and personnel. His focus will particularly be on providing targeted support to developing nations, especially small island and least developed countries.

Dominguez stresses the importance of technological advancement in shipping, particularly the mandate for a “Maritime Single Window” that will streamline processes at ports. This digitalization is expected to significantly improve operational efficiency. He also plans to regulate the growing presence of autonomous ships to ensure safety and environmental sustainability.

Decarbonization is another major area of focus for Dominguez, with the IMO targeting net-zero emissions by 2050. He outlines a strategic pathway for greenhouse gas reductions, encouraging Member States to adopt measures such as a global fuel standard and a pricing mechanism for emissions by 2025.

Education and training in the maritime sector are also vital components of Dominguez’s vision. He highlights the need for a sufficient supply of skilled seafarers and addressing gender imbalances within the industry. The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) is under review to align competencies with technological advancements and climate objectives. Moreover, the IMO is actively enhancing training initiatives through collaborations and established institutions like the World Maritime University.

Dominguez discusses the challenges faced in international shipping due to geopolitical tensions, which can disrupt trade flows. He emphasizes the need for collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and international organizations to ensure the safety of navigation and protect seafarers amidst conflicts.

The IMO Council consists of various categories, with Category C focusing on member countries that represent key global geographies without having large shipping fleets. Alongside Indonesia, other elected Category C members include nations like the Bahamas, Belgium, and Turkey, totaling 21 countries representing diverse maritime interests.

Minister Dudy emphasized Indonesia’s dedication to enhancing shipping safety, environmental sustainability, and the welfare of seafarers. He expressed Indonesia’s readiness to collaborate with member nations to promote a safer, greener, and more resilient future in international shipping. The focus is on maximizing shared maritime opportunities to achieve sustainability on a global scale.

Indonesia’s commitment to maritime safety entails advancing e-navigation, modernizing the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), and implementing risk management strategies. A highlight of these initiatives is the Traffic Separation Scheme established in the Sunda and Lombok Straits, which showcases how international cooperation can enhance safety in busy waterways.

Regarding environmental sustainability, Indonesia is aligning national policies with IMO objectives to achieve net-zero emissions. This includes expanding on-shore power supply facilities at ports and designating the Lombok Strait as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).

Human resources are at the core of Indonesia’s maritime ecosystem, with a focus on strengthening seafarers’ rights, mental health, and well-being. Minister Dudy mentioned the development of a digital training framework intended to support seafarers through technological advancements.

Indonesia also reaffirms its support for a more inclusive and representative IMO Council, demonstrated through its ratification of the 2021 Amendments to the IMO Convention, which aims to enhance multilingualism within the organization.

During the 34th IMO session, Minister Dudy engaged in bilateral meetings with several dignitaries, including the IMO Secretary-General and transportation ministers from various countries, further emphasizing Indonesia’s active role in international maritime discussions.",https://cdn-kdmmj.nitrocdn.com/rMIbIrPSYFfiGCokvtkImuATKIjcDThC/assets/images/optimized/rev-7cde77b/maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-29 20:56:08.957830

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the global regulator for the shipping sector and a specialised agency within the United Nations (UN) who could help to guide the sector on the course for a net zero future.

That was the aim of a decade of negotiations which led to the draft regulations for the IMO’s Net-zero Framework. This framework was initially approved the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) earlier this year, but the finalisation of this agreement was delayed in a second meeting in October - facing particularly strong opposition from the US (currently under the Trump Administration) as well as Saudi Arabia.

What the new framework would bring

The measures included a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions. Ships with weights from 5,000 tonnes and above (responsible for about 85% of global shipping emissions) would have had to limit CO2 emissions per unit of energy. Those exceeding that would have had to pay a carbon fee. This raised criticism from some member states, but there would also be a reward where those outperforming the standard would earn Surplus Units that could be banked or traded.

The Net-Zero Framework would be the first to combine mandatory emissions limits and greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing across a whole sector - through a reward and repay system.

Revenues from the charges were predicted to raise billions each year from 2028 to 2030 to fund alternative fuel infrastructure, energy efficient retrofits and buildings for developing areas. For the first time, it would have established a global carbon price, along with solid greenhouse-gas standards for shipping.

It would also require owners of large international vessels to report on their emissions and use cleaner fuels, or face penalties - these requirements might have stirred things up for some decision makers.

The plans were for the framework to start from 2027 or 2028, giving a short window of preparation time for compliance. Existing investment and plans are affected by he delay - with uncertainty in what to focus on.

An uncertain investment landscape... for now

These shaky waters may make the investment landscape more unstable for alternative fuels like ammonia, methanol and hydrogen. Such investments may slow as investors reconsider their commercial case - where there are already risks.

While some may feel some relief from the delay, others do not relate. Without regulatory transparency, planning for what to expect becomes more cumbersome. Some companies had already begun preparing, whether through fuel switches, contract changes or carbon pricing models - but without clear requirements, there is little guidance and certainty in the sector. The delay may complicate compliance for global operators, making costs uneven.

Comparisons with the 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy

IMO’s 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy already set an aim to reduce emissions from shipping by a minimum of 20 per cent by 2030. The 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships had a goal for net zero by around 2050, with ambitious 2030 and 2040 emissions reductions milestones. This came with a target for zero-emission fuels and technologies to comprise at least 5 per cent (ideally 10 per cent) of energy used by international shipping by the year 2030.

It introduced a target for zero- or near-zero-emission fuels and technologies to make up at least five percent (striving for ten percent) of the energy used by international shipping by 2030

What’s next for worldwide shipping?

The Net-Zero Framework was initially approved in April but by October plans for its adoption sunk into murky waters. Though it had long been planned, by October, the new framework was not brought to fruition. Instead of being enforced, the formation adoption was delayed.

The new framework had been highly debated as it came with various criticisms, topped off by the disruptive delay on the decision in October.

These are murky waters for the framework and the future of clean fuels in shipping. Some shipowners are betting ahead anyway though by investing in newbuilds compatible with alternative fuels like methanol or ammonia.

What does this mean for shipping? Reuters shared some speculations on what will happen now after the decision on the anticipated regulatory agreement was postponed.

The Reuters article described this as leaving the shipping sector in ‘regulatory limbo’. All the while, companies, investors and insurers are still going ahead with net-zero emissions, but with a lack of clarity on decarbonisation strategies and expectations - without the map ahead the framework would have provided.

Perhaps waters will clear in time for the next meeting which will be held next year - in October 2026.

The company is driving towards achieving net zero emissions ahead of the 2050 IMO target. A major step was the retrofitting of Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) cranes with hybrid technology. Six cranes were hybridised during FY 2024/25, increasing the total hybrid fleet from 22 to 28 cranes. This project has reduced fuel consumed per machine by over 50%, contributing directly to the reduction in Scope 1 emissions.

Furthermore, the installation of a 460kW solar array generates 3-5% of the current annual electricity usage. These efforts have cumulatively reduced emission intensity by 22% since 2019/20, largely driven by reducing Scope 1 emissions. Plans include leveraging digitisation, automation, and equipment electrification to decarbonise operations further. Going beyond its operational boundaries, SAGT has partnered with the Centre for Sustainability, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, to restore five acres of the Benthara River Mangrove Complex, in addition to the five acres previously restored at the Yagirala Forest Reserve.

The company also upholds its employees as its most valued asset. This commitment was demonstrated by a 42% increase in employee training hours compared to the previous year, covering health and safety, leadership, and technical skills development. SAGT also began implementing LEAN principles with guidance from the APMT Global LEAN Academy, introducing methodologies like KAIZEN and 5S to drive continuous improvement, waste management, and employee-driven process efficiencies.

SAGT’s groundbreaking initiative on gender equality, which earned the merit certificate, focused on improving gender diversity by engaging relevant regulatory agencies to overcome archaic port rules that restricted women from entering port-controlled areas after 6:00 PM. In a major industry development, SAGT secured special regulatory approval to integrate females into night shift operational roles, onboarding 12 female graduates in January 2025 and overcoming long-standing industry barriers.

This determination to make a difference is reflected in the increase of female representation in the organisation from a previously stagnated 4% to 6% during the reporting year, representing a significant milestone in promoting gender equality within Sri Lanka’s Port sector.

The Capesize market delivered a robust and increasingly confident performance this week, with the BCI 5TC climbing steadily from the low $30,000s to close the week in the $37,000s. The Pacific set the tone early, where consistent miner participation and a busy slate of operator cargoes tightened the tonnage list and pushed C5 progressively higher, with fixtures advancing from the mid-$10s to the high-$11s to $12.00 by the week’s end. Despite occasional dips in the index, underlying demand in the basin remained firm, and sentiment strengthened as supply grew noticeably thinner.

In the Atlantic, early hesitancy gave way to a more constructive tone as fundamentals improved. South Brazil to China saw patchier enquiry and date-sensitive bids, with rates holding mostly in the mid-$23s to mid-$24s before lifting to $25 at the close. This was complemented by an increasingly active North Atlantic, where improving fundamentals and stronger fronthaul fixtures added meaningful support. The sharp rise in C8 and C9 underscored the tightening of nearby positions and a marked improvement in sentiment across the northern basin.

Panamax

The market held a steady tone through the week, supported by firm fundamentals in the US Gulf and US East Coast, while fronthaul grains continued to underpin Atlantic sentiment. The BPI timecharter average opened at $17,498 on Monday and edged up $157 to $17,655 by Thursday. In Asia, tight prompt tonnage supply and active Indonesian demand kept the Pacific well-supported, although by mid-week owners’ offers were being met rather than pushed higher.

By Thursday, sentiment had turned more mixed, with some sensing the market was becoming toppy in the Atlantic and that prompt fronthaul routes may be nearing a ceiling especially when coupled with national holidays in motion. A two-tier structure also emerged in Asia, with modern tonnage commanding premiums in Indonesia–Japan trades, while short Indonesian round voyages drew softer bids. Period activity was noted, although many fixtures remained short on detail.

Ultramax/Supramax

A staggered week with the Atlantic seeing a dip in activity with the Thanksgiving period at the end. The US Gulf saw a slight weakening in rates as the week progressed whilst the South Atlantic remained relatively balanced. A 66,000 dwt fixing delivery Recalada trip to the Arabian Gulf/SE Asia at $17,400 plus $740,000 ballast bonus. The Continent-Mediterranean lacked fresh impetus and confidence feel, although a 64,000 dwt was heard fixed delivery Continent trip via lower Baltic redelivery Brazil at $22,000.

The Asian basin remained relatively active, with brokers saying a reasonable amount of enquiry was seen from the South whilst North Asia remained relatively flat. A 61,000 dwt fixing delivery Singapore trip via Indonesia redelivery India at $21,000. Further north, a 56,000 dwt fixed delivery Dalian trip with steels redelivery SE Asia at $14,000. The Indian Ocean gained momentum, with a 63,000-dwt fixing delivery Mina Saqr for a trip redelivery WC India at $24,500.

The market remained broadly steady this week, with slight gains in some regions and subdued conditions in others. In the Continent and Mediterranean, enquiry remained limited and sentiment softened midweek as prompt tonnage increased, although rates ultimately held firm. Among the reported fixtures, a 35,000-dwt was fixed for delivery Antwerp via North France to Abidjan with grain at $12,000, reflecting the generally steady trading environment in the region.

The South Atlantic and US Gulf were firmer ahead of the Thanksgiving period, supported by healthier demand. Notable fixtures included a 38,000-dwt fixed for a trip from Recalada to West Coast South America at $26,000. In Asia, the market remained quiet throughout the week.

The report, At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025, identifies 25 new zero-emission corridor initiatives launched in 2025, bringing the global total to 84.

New initiatives in China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana and Kenya reflect expectations of significant economic opportunities in zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering infrastructure.

The publication follows last month’s postponement of the IMO’s landmark framework intended to guide the sector toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said the entrance of large economies into green corridor development is “hugely promising” and framed the initiatives as “strategic economic infrastructure.”

For the first time since 2022, four corridors have reached the “realisation stage,” where construction or operation of vessels, infrastructure or fuel plants begins. However, many of the 84 initiatives are stalled by a “feasibility wall” driven by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels—an issue the delayed framework could help address.

The report warns against a “wait and see” attitude during the coming year and encourages use of emerging national programmes such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart.

According to Fahnestock, the next 12 months can be used to build projects that create strategic advantages and position participants for future IMO incentives.

Recommendations include sustaining momentum to close the cost gap, helping shape future IMO policy, engaging cargo owners with ambitious decarbonisation goals, adapting national policies for new regions and prioritising harder-to-deploy e-fuels while maintaining collaborative principles.

The Getting to Zero Coalition is an international industry-led partnership organized to promote the development and deployment of zero-emission maritime technologies. It brings together companies and organizations from across the maritime value chain and collaborates with governments and NGOs to support long-term decarbonisation strategies.

The employment of Filipino seafarers, researchers emphasized, sustains not just the maritime sector but the broader Philippine economy.
In addition, the study revealed that the industry’s economic impact depends heavily on maintaining global confidence in the Philippine seafaring workforce.
The study emphasized that these experiences reflect how the nation’s maritime workforce profoundly shapes the Philippines’ economic and social landscape.
As the study shows, Filipino seafarers are not just navigating the seas, they are steering the Philippine economy toward growth.","The study, titled “The Overseas Seafarers’ Industry Profile, Structure, and Impact on the Philippine Economy,” found that Filipino seafarers contribute about 4% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), supporting nearly 400,000 jobs nationwide and providing ₱150.1 billion in household income.

At the heart of this economic wave are foreign shipowners who continue to rely on Filipino seafarers. The employment of Filipino seafarers, researchers emphasized, sustains not just the maritime sector but the broader Philippine economy.

For every peso a Filipino seafarer sends home, nearly three pesos ripple through the economy

… explained Dr. Winston Padojinog, UA&P Professor of Strategic Management and Industrial Economics and President of the Center for Research and Communication.

In 2024 alone, ₱331.7 billion in direct remittances from seafarers flowed into local communities, driving consumption, business growth, and tax revenues.

These remittances go through different sectors. There are industry multipliers; for every peso that they spend, it generates more than a peso after it goes through the different industries

… Padojinog explained.

But beyond remittances, seafaring also creates an extensive domestic ecosystem. The study points out that the industry supports a wide range of onshore jobs — from crewing and logistics to training, insurance, and maritime services — all interconnected with the confidence of shipowners in Filipino manpower.

In addition, the study revealed that the industry’s economic impact depends heavily on maintaining global confidence in the Philippine seafaring workforce. Should shipowners lose confidence, whether due to policy instability, skills gaps, or global competition, the consequences could be swift and severe.

“In global shipping, when confidence breaks, ships leave,” the study cautioned.

Losing that confidence, researchers noted, would endanger ₱1.06 trillion in economic activity, an estimated 4% of the nation’s GDP, a blow that would ripple across the national economy.

An industry that anchors families and futures

Behind these numbers are real human stories such as parents building homes, children completing their education, and communities strengthened by the resilience of maritime families. The study emphasized that these experiences reflect how the nation’s maritime workforce profoundly shapes the Philippines’ economic and social landscape.

It further underscored that protecting the maritime industry is not only about safeguarding jobs but also about securing the well-being of Filipino families and the country’s economic prosperity.

Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of reintegrating retiring seafarers and professionals whose years of technical experience and leadership can significantly enrich and strengthen the local maritime sector.

As the study shows, Filipino seafarers are not just navigating the seas, they are steering the Philippine economy toward growth.

The elections came at the start of the 34th session of the Assembly, which runs through December 3, and which will have an influential role as the IMO faces key issues. At the top of the IMO’s agenda is the one-year delay in its framework for decarbonization, with the goal to build greater consensus after it failed to adopt the measure last month.

Opening the assembly earlier in the week, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez told the representatives of the Member States, ""We meet today at a time when the maritime sector continues to navigate a complex international environment marked by geopolitical tensions, evolving trade patterns, and an accelerating global transition towards decarbonization and digitalization. The successes still ahead of us will depend on your decisions and your collective action in bringing together this diverse community.”

This week saw lobbying and jockeying for position, including Russia’s attempts to regain its position at the IMO, lost after the invasion of Ukraine. China also highlighted its intent to deepen exchanges, coordination, and cooperation with the IMO Secretariat and other Member States. China also marked the establishment of a permanent mission to the International Maritime Organization (IMO). During an opening celebration, Li Yang, vice minister of transport and head of the Chinese delegation to the 34th session of the IMO Assembly, highlighted that China will work to build a modern maritime transport system and contribute more to global economic growth and stable industrial and supply chains.

Voting concluded on Friday, November 28, for the new two-year terms.

Council Category A members were selected and approved based on having the largest interests in shipping services. The countries elected were China, Greece, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Norway, Panama, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Council Category B members were selected and approved on the basis of having the largest interest in international seaborne trade. The countries elected were Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.

Council Category C members were elected in effectively a competitive open category, with delegates voting secretly, but asked to choose candidate countries either having special maritime interests or whose election would balance geographic representation across the Council. This election was held last, somewhat delayed, in order for voting to take into account of the earlier Category A and B selections.

There were three changes in the Category C Council membership compared to the 2024-25 biennial term. Bangladesh, Denmark, and Kenya lost their seats, and in their place, Belgium, Nigeria, and South Africa were elected. The countries that retained their seats were Bahamas, Chile, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Turkey.

IMO, EU Launch Project to Combat Sea Violence

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the European Union (EU) have signed an agreement to launch Safe Horizons, an ambitious project aimed at promoting zero tolerance for violence and harassment within the maritime sector.

The Safe Horizons initiative is designed as a seed project to establish foundational measures that will help maritime sector prevent and address any form of violence and harassment at sea. This includes, but is not limited to, bullying, sexual harassment, and sexual assault. The project is fully aligned with IMO's commitment to safe and secure working environments and complementary to ILO's labour standards.

Project Objectives

The project supports capacity-building and experience sharing, with no compliance or assessment components and is structured to develop and implement scalable actions across the industry to ensure safer, more inclusive working environments. Key objectives include:

Promoting a Zero-Tolerance Culture: Fostering a shift in industry mindset toward comprehensive rejection of violence and harassment.

Establishing Stronger Regulatory Frameworks: Supporting target countries in voluntary national efforts to strengthen policies, where requested by Member States, and consistent with national frameworks and policies related to on-board conduct.

Improving Training and Awareness: Enhancing educational resources for seafarers and maritime stakeholders to better identify, prevent, and respond to incidents.

The project leverages updated IMO training materials and involves direct collaboration with target countries to build capacity, share best practices, and advance safe working environments across the global maritime sector.

Scope and Funding

The global project is implemented by IMO with financial support from the EU. The EU has committed 2 million Euros to support the project.

Ammonia emerges as a promising candidate for future fuel, although its production, transportation, and usage pose challenges. This landscape is evolving rapidly, particularly within the maritime sector, where ammonia is gaining traction.

Ammonia consists of hydrogen and nitrogen, which positions it as a potential zero-carbon fuel. However, the predominant form of ammonia produced today is “grey” ammonia, created through an energy-intensive process reliant on fossil fuels. This traditional production method significantly contributes to carbon emissions, undermining the zero-carbon potential of ammonia.

To mitigate these emissions, the industry is increasingly turning to two lower-carbon production methods. The first is “blue” ammonia, produced by integrating carbon-capture technology into the traditional methods. This approach reduces carbon emissions but still hinges on fossil fuel sources. The second method, known as “green” ammonia, utilizes renewable energy and electrolysis, resulting in minimal to zero carbon emissions. Both blue and green ammonia are classified as low-carbon or decarbonised ammonia.

Although ammonia is being recognized as a viable fuel in the maritime industry, its primary use continues to be in industrial applications, particularly as a fertilizer. It is also finding applications in the production of plastics and synthetic fibers. In the mid to long term, low-carbon ammonia is expected to play a crucial role in power generation.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-28 10:56:41.302089

Kazakos, Secretary General of ICS, outlines his priorities for advancing maritime decarbonisation and highlights how ICS’s collaborative initiatives – the Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM-HUBS) initiative and the Maritime Just Transition Task Force – are making significant progress to ensure that no one is left behind in this transition. A key focus, he emphasizes, is ensuring that seafarers are properly upskilled to work with new green technologies and zero-emission fuels.

He also stresses the importance of addressing wellbeing, diversity, and inclusivity – not only to retain existing seafarers but also to encourage more people to pursue a career at sea. This, he notes, is essential for moving forward and building a workforce that welcomes everyone. After all, a diverse workforce brings many advantages, Kazakos concludes.

SAFETY4SEA: What do you see as the biggest leadership challenge for ICS in this decade of transformation, and how do you plan to address it?

Thomas Kazakos: I believe the biggest challenges for the industry as a whole are two-fold. Firstly, a greatly significant concern is the current erosion of the international regulatory system. The benefits of open trade and global regulations are clear, but despite this we are witnessing a steady disintegration of the multilateral spirit that has long fortified global commerce. Secondly, decarbonising the industry and meeting the IMO goal of net zero GHG emissions from international shipping by or close to 2050. It is not impossible, and ICS and the industry fully support this ambition and stand ready to do what is necessary, but the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector. Currently there are little to none ZNZ fuels available and what is available is very expensive. At ICS we will continue to work with the International Maritime Organization, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry. Without a global mechanism, we face a patchwork of unilateral greenhouse gas charges imposed around the world.

S4S: Can you explain the Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM-HUBS) initiative and why it is important for global shipping decarbonisation?

Th.K.: ICS, in collaboration with the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), is also making great strides with our Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM-HUBS) initiative. The aim of the CEM-HUBS initiative is to accelerate the deployment of infrastructure, and to de-risk the investment needed to ensure that the whole world can have access to low-carbon fuels close to the ports for the maritime sector to transport and use. The CEM HUBS continues to build momentum with nine governments onboard – UAE, Norway, Canada, Panama, Uruguay, Brazil, Greece and most recently Malta and China. What makes this initiative unique is that the CEM Hubs looks beyond what shipping needs but ensures that shipping is not forgotten. Shipping uses only 4% of liquid fuels. We need to focus on the transportation of all fuels, the 4% for shipping and importantly the 96% of fuel that will be used by all other sectors. If we get the 96% right the 4% will have the infrastructure to support shipping’s decarbonisation. If we ignore this, we are going to make life more difficult for shipping and all sectors.

S4S: With the IMO’s delay of the Net-Zero Framework decision, how do you see ICS helping to shape a stronger and more inclusive outcome over the next year?

Th.K.: We have time, and it is important for us to use the time wisely. With the support of ICS, IMO Member States now have an opportunity to revisit the draft IMO agreement so that we can get it right and ensure, so far as possible, that it’s acceptable to everyone. What we do not want is a fragmented regulatory environment with unilateral and regional regulations and GHG charges being imposed. We need a global mechanism for what is fundamentally a global industry. ICS will continue to work with IMO, with Member States and the industry as a whole to find the best way forward to meet the IMO net zero GHG emissions target by or close to 2050. But whatever may eventually be decided at IMO, the transition to the use of new green fuels and technologies will continue and ICS will be supporting shipowners on this transition.

S4S: Many shipowners are uncertain about future fuels, regulation timelines, and financing mechanisms. How can ICS help provide clarity and stability during this transitional period?

Th.K.: Uncertainty fuels delays and caution, it stifles investment decisions, and this is to be expected. This is why ICS has been advocating for a global measure to ensure a level playing field and to avoid market distortion. What is important is that governments need to set standards for new fuels, this will give energy producers the certainty they require to invest. Shipowners and fuel suppliers need clarity to make long-term investments. Shipping is already investing billions in new ships and green technologies to be ready for the new fuels when they arrive. For now, shipowners can focus on technologies that maximises energy efficiency, reducing their emissions through energy efficiency measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving operational costs. This will be crucial to decarbonisation and reducing running costs to ensure future profitability. Shipowners are already doing this by introducing measures that address underwater radiated noise or hull friction for example. What ICS is doing is continuing to push for practical solutions that balance ambition with feasibility, as well as working with governments and industry to provide stability to the maritime sector.

S4S: In your view, what does a credible and practical system for decarbonisation look like- one that works for both developed and developing maritime nations?

Th.K.: A global system is the most credible and practical, we are after all a global industry. Importantly, whatever system is adopted it must provide support for maritime decarbonisation efforts across the globe, for example the green fuel generation and bunkering infrastructure of developing countries, as well as training in new green fuels for our workforce. We need a system that works, as much as possible, for everyone.

S4S: How should ICS support equitable access to green technologies and zero-emission fuels across the global fleet?

Th.K.: We already are supporting through different initiatives such as the Clean Energy Marine Hubs and our technical input to various proposals to the International Maritime Organization. What we must remember, and keep at the forefront, is to make sure our seafarers are upskilled in these green technologies and zero-emission fuels. They, after all, will be the ones dealing with them. The Maritime Just Transition Task Force – a collaboration between the ICS, ITF, IMO, and other leading global organisations established in 2021 – was therefore a crucial step in ensuring that no one is left behind in this transition. But we need more than global initiatives; we need direct action from companies, training institutions, and governments. This means strengthening maritime education and ensuring it remains fit for purpose.

S4S: As global maritime governance becomes more complex – and with concerns over the “dark fleet”- how can ICS strengthen transparency and accountability in the sector?

Th.K.: The move towards a fragmented trading world risks undermining the global framework that has served international trade so well for decades. Fragmentation of markets and the rules-based order will inevitably reduce efficiency and increase costs, ultimately hurting both the industry and consumers worldwide. The rise of the “dark” or “parallel” fleet is symptomatic of this fragmentation. If left unchecked, it could undermine safety, environmental standards, and the credibility of the international regulatory system. ICS is committed to working with governments and international organisations to ensure that shipping remains a rules-based, transparent, and safe sector. We continue to encourage our members to diligently comply with instruments such as the International Safety Management Code, SOLAS and MARPOL and the Industry Best Practice. These systems and instruments rely on an industry that follows protocol, which is why we are so clear in our communication that we must operate within the regulations.

S4S: How will you ensure that ICS remains the trusted voice of responsible shipowners when it comes to compliance, safety, and environmental integrity?

Th.K.: With over 74,000 ships operating worldwide, international shipping is built on legal and robust operations, supported by strong regulatory oversight and insurance systems that ensure high standards are consistently met. It is vital that shipowners, operators, and managers adhere to any and all regulations. Shipping operates within a well-established legal framework, and these regulations are essential to maintaining a high-quality, responsible industry that enables global trade to function smoothly. As the collective voice of the international shipping industry, ICS continues to articulate and advocate shipowner positions to international regulators International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization as well as to other government regulators and relevant stakeholders. Our aim is to positively influence regulatory changes while maintaining high standards of quality, safety and environmental protection.

S4S: What do you believe the next generation of seafarers needs most from both regulators and employers to view shipping as a rewarding and sustainable career?

Th.K.:

We need to take a human centred approach which means employers, unions and governments all need to cooperate to create a career path that works for our people.

In recent years there has been a damaging shift towards seafarers being viewed as commodities. We need to change this attitude to one that puts people first and creates an environment in which they want to work. This will in turn attract the attention of more people to consider a career in shipping as well as lead to higher levels of employee retention. After all, shipping is not the only industry facing a workforce shortage; we are competing against multiple sectors all trying to recruit the best and brightest candidates. Therefore, it is necessary to make us stand out amongst the crowd. We need governments to actively support the recruitment and training of seafarers. Ensuring that decent working and living conditions for seafarers are implemented, we have the opportunity to create career that offers opportunities for growth, accommodating for changes in life circumstances and taking up roles onshore. These measures will help to make seafaring the most appealing career option. I am pleased to say that ICS works closely with ILO, ITF, and other regulatory and representative bodies to create better regulations. Additionally, in 2023, we brought the industry together at our Shaping the Future of Shipping – Seafarer 2050 summit in Manila that looked at the training and education the future seafarer will need, recruitment and retention of seafarers, seafarer welfare, opportunities for national economic development. Key outcomes from the summit were collaboration and investment are key to tackling the challenges of seafarer training and seafarer recruitment and retention; and also, that we need data that shows the value of seafarers to national economies over other trades.

S4S: How do you see ICS advancing wellbeing, diversity, and inclusivity within the maritime workforce?

Th.K.: Addressing wellbeing, diversity and inclusivity is a key part of not only retaining seafarers but also encouraging more people to consider a career in seafaring.

We can and should be doing more to show that this is a career for all, that we open our arms to everyone regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. This is the only way we can move forwards and access the benefits of a workforce that welcomes everyone. After all a diverse workforce brings many benefits.

It enables shipping companies to access a talent pool wider than any restricting definition, reflect societies and demographics more accurately and have a broader range of talents and experiences. ICS has been very involved in advancing diversity and inclusivity and launched in 2023 the Diversity and Inclusion Toolkit for Shipping. This toolkit has been developed to create awareness and inspire change in the strategies, policies and practices that will enable the maritime industry to meet the needs of the diverse seafarer community. Looking more specifically at the wellbeing of seafarers, earlier this year in April, governments, shipowners, and unions met in Geneva at the International Labour Organization’s Special Tripartite Committee on the Maritime Labour Convention, to review and adopt crucial updates that reflect the evolving needs of seafarers and the maritime industry. Key amendments to the MLC aim to improve the conditions for seafarers on board ships and the MLC updates are set to enter into effect in 2027. I am pleased to say that some of the key outcomes agreed were new provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers; strengthened requirements for seafarer repatriation; ensuring visa free shore leave; and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment. These are groundbreaking and show the importance of seafarer welfare.

S4S: On a personal note, what inspired you to dedicate your career to maritime policy – and what continues to drive your passion for this industry today?

Th.K.: I was born and raised on an island nation and one that has a strong history in maritime so I was drawn to this career from a very young age. I found maritime policy and law of particular interest which is what attracted me to my Bachelor’s degree in law and a Master‘s degree in European and International Trade Law. I guess when you grow up looking at the sea it calls to you in some way, so this was my inspiration. What drives my passion now for the industry is the same as it has always been – without shipping there is no global trade, the world would stop, and the significance of that should never be taken for granted.

1. South Africa’s Historic Win Over India

In a significant upset, South Africa defeated India by 408 runs in a Test match in Guwahati, marking India’s largest-ever home loss in terms of runs. This loss resulted in South Africa winning the series 2-0, their first series victory in India since 2000. India’s performance has markedly declined, with five losses in the last seven home Tests, contrasting sharply with their historical record of only five losses in the previous 50 home Tests over 13 seasons. Head coach Gautam Gambhir faces scrutiny, currently holding a dismal win record of 36.82%. The defeat complicates India’s aspirations for the World Test Championship, dropping them to fifth place on the points table.

2. Tensions with China Over Arunachal Pradesh

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in India condemned China’s recent arbitrary actions, particularly regarding the detention of an Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh whose passport was deemed invalid by Chinese authorities. MEA reiterated that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. This incident underscores the complexity of Sino-Indian relations as both nations strive to manage their border disputes. India’s ongoing efforts to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) are now further challenged by China’s claims.

3. Growth of Green Shipping Corridors

A new report has identified an increase in green shipping corridors in emerging economies like India, China, and Brazil, which aim to develop zero-emission trade routes. The report indicates the establishment of 25 new initiatives, bringing the total to 84 worldwide. These initiatives align with national energy goals and maritime ambitions, highlighting India’s commitment to sustainability and positioning itself strategically in global trade.

4. Agnipath Scheme and Its Implications

The mother of Agniveer M Murali Naik, recently killed on duty, has petitioned the Bombay High Court for equal death benefits, challenging discrepancies between the financial security provided to Agniveers and regular soldiers. The Agnipath Scheme, designed to modernize military recruitment, faces criticism for not offering the same lifelong benefits to the families of Agniveers, raising important questions about equality and support for soldiers’ families.

5. Political Repression in Pakistan

The daughters of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan faced police violence during their attempt to meet him, highlighting ongoing political repression in Pakistan. The police assault underscores the deteriorating political situation, limited political engagement, and increasing state control over civil society, complicating the political landscape in the region.

More particularly, the discussions of the event addressed how industry and regulators can speed up credible measurement and abatement solutions across global fleets, examining also developments accross the full emissions chain. Delegates discussed the rapid advances in methane measurement and abatement and the need for stronger alignment between innovation and regulation, as well as the right mix between action and accuracy.

With methane recognised as 28 times more potent than CO2 on a 100-year scale and the second most significant GHG emission, participants underscored that methane abatement represents one of the fastest, most impactful climate solutions available to shipping today.

Led by Safetytech Accelerator, established by Lloyd’s Register, MAMII is a coalition of shipping leaders, which aims to reduce the environmental impact of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in shipping while assisting the transition to future fuel solutions.

Upstream transparency is improving through enhanced monitoring tools, enabling more informed LNG sourcing. However, tank-to-wake emissions, where combustion slip remains the dominant contributor, remain the largest challenge. Several engine types have seen 60–70% reductions in methane slip in recent years, supported by the emergence of aftertreatment systems that could scale reductions up to an additional 80–90%.

Furthermore, technology providers demonstrated solutions ranging from catalyst-based aftertreatment and advanced sensor systems to AI-driven emissions analysis and handheld methane leak detection devices for pipelines.

Shell’s Technology Manager, Stephen Brown, confirmed that the company’s in-house methane abatement catalyst system will enter shipboard trials in December. This marks the third MAMII-member aftertreatment technology trial. Early results from all member trials have been positive, and commercial readiness is expected as soon as 2027.

Industry representatives called for clearer, predictable and science-based frameworks that provide certainty for investment. They highlighted the importance of updated default values reflecting technological progress, reliable measurement methodologies, and incentives for early adopters alongside support for retrofitting. Alignment between EU and IMO regulations was seen as essential for global consistency and operational clarity.

The consensus was clear: momentum is building, solutions are advancing rapidly and reducing methane emissions is within reach for the maritime sector. We must now focus on expanding these solutions to global fleets, improving the data supporting our decisions, and guiding the industry confidently towards significant methane reduction.

This approach strengthens funding proposals for African ports but requires careful planning and technical preparation.
These policy frameworks are designed to keep African ports aligned with global shipping standards, maintain competitiveness, and reduce long-term operating risks.
The real question is not whether the transformation will occur, but how quickly African ports can prepare and how effectively they can mobilise the support required.","The global maritime industry is steadily moving towards lower emissions, driven by new regulations, evolving fuel technologies and growing pressure from international trade partners.

For many African countries, the pace of this transition is difficult to match, yet the consequences of not adapting may be far greater.

Avoiding or even ignoring the global shift to reshape shipping, is simply not an option, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stressed.

The IMO’s 2023 greenhouse gas strategy sets a clear target that the shipping industry should reach net-zero emissions around 2050, and signs of this shift are already visible.

These include green methanol-fuelled vessels entering service and major ports in Europe and Asia preparing for ammonia and other alternative fuels. Equipment such as electric cranes, digital yard systems, and shore-power connections is becoming mainstream in developed maritime hubs.

And yet, Africa’s starting point is markedly different.

Many ports still rely on diesel-powered machinery, lack green bunkering infrastructure and operate older vessels on regional routes. This creates a widening gap between global progress and local readiness. Nonetheless, the shift is unavoidable, particularly as compliance with green standards becomes increasingly linked to market access.

Although Africa contributes relatively little to global maritime emissions, it is highly exposed to climate impacts. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events affect coastal infrastructure, ports, and trade corridors.

At the same time, international regulations and market mechanisms, such as Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), are raising the importance of low-carbon transport for exporters.

CBAM will require exporters to account for emissions related to production and transport, which could increase costs for African goods entering Europe if supply chains fail to align with greener standards. Avoiding such penalties will depend partly on cleaner port operations, better monitoring systems, and more efficient logistics.

Financing the transition remains the central challenge. Shifting to low-carbon maritime operations requires long-term investment in infrastructure, energy systems and technology. For developing economies, the scale of financing required is substantial. Gareth Phillips, manager for Climate and Environmental Finance at the African Development Bank (AfDB), has indicated that the bank has become a key player in supporting this transition.

A practical example is found at the Port of Cotonou, where AfDB financed climate-resilience measures to counter rising sea levels, enabling Benin to unlock $18 million in concessional co-financing from the Canadian AfDB Climate Facility. He explained that securing this level of climate-aligned finance would have been difficult without such structured support.

Phillips has also noted that green port projects attract stronger international backing when they offer additional benefits such as community resilience, improved safety, or gender-inclusive development. This approach strengthens funding proposals for African ports but requires careful planning and technical preparation.

Regulation plays a central role in the maritime transition. The IMO’s GHG strategy, reporting obligations, emissions monitoring, and fuel standards, will directly influence port operations and vessel access in the coming years.

James Ng’ang’a, Ports and Maritime Transport expert at AfDB, has stated that the bank is working closely with African governments to align national maritime policy frameworks with these international rules.

In Seychelles, the bank is supporting the Seychelles Ports Authority in preparing the Strategic Investment Plan 2025-2030, ensuring that climate resilience and environmental sustainability are embedded into future port development.

In Namibia, Ng’ang’a has explained that AfDB and the Government of South Korea are assisting in the development of a Green Port Policy, Strategy, and Investment Plan. Implementation is expected to begin in 2026, establishing a structured pathway towards sustainable port operations.

These policy frameworks are designed to keep African ports aligned with global shipping standards, maintain competitiveness, and reduce long-term operating risks.

Africa’s ports will not complete this transition alone. Collaboration with development banks, port authorities, and global shipping companies is essential. AfDB emphasises the importance of coordinated efforts to reduce knowledge gaps, share best practices, and implement practical solutions.

Ng’ang’a has highlighted the example of AfDB’s technical assistance to Transnet in South Africa, which focuses on designing energy-efficiency measures and exploring renewable-energy options for port operations. Such partnerships help African ports enhance performance while preparing for low-carbon requirements expected from international carriers.

The cost of delaying decarbonisation extends beyond environmental impacts. Trade competitiveness is also at risk. If African ports fall behind global standards, shipping lines may shift towards more efficient or greener routes. Exporters may face higher penalties under mechanisms such as CBAM.

Cargo delays, disruptions, and insurance costs could rise if ports are not equipped to manage climate impacts or meet compliance requirements. Phillips has remarked that by adopting cleaner technologies, improving emissions reporting, and integrating climate considerations into port investments, African exporters can avoid unnecessary costs and strengthen their access to international markets.

AfDB is exploring new financing solutions to support long-term maritime sustainability. While the bank does not yet operate a dedicated maritime decarbonisation fund, its activities align with broader development priorities such as resilient infrastructure and capital mobilisation under the President’s ‘Four Cardinal Points’.

Phillips has referred to emerging tools such as the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism, which aims to channel solidarity levies from high-emitting industries into climate-resilience projects. Such tools could support ports in developing infrastructure capable of withstanding rising sea levels, extreme weather, and other climate-related risks.

Across the continent, interest in blue economy strategies is growing. These programmes integrate maritime transport, coastal tourism, fisheries, and renewable marine energy into national development plans. Over time, they could support a broader transition towards greener and more sustainable ocean-based economies.

The global shift towards low-carbon shipping is accelerating. For Africa, the transition is challenging but necessary. Although the continent has not been a major driver of maritime emissions, its ports and exporters must adapt to remain competitive as sustainability standards increasingly influence trade decisions.

Substandard shipping and ships that do not comply with the IMO regulations should not be operating,” Dominguez said.

“We maintain statistics, and when patterns emerge, my first step is to start having the conversations” with flag states, said Dominguez.","The head of the United Nations’ maritime agency warned of a disturbing rise in the criminalisation of seafarers, driven by geopolitical tensions and a surge in substandard shipping practices linked to the so-called dark fleet operating outside international norms.

Conflicts across the world that disrupt trade, growing operational costs and regulatory weaknesses have left thousands of seafarers in a 1.8 million person-strong workforce vulnerable.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is “very concerned” about worsening conditions for workers, its secretary-general, Arsenio Dominguez, told Context.

Governments must do more to ensure fair treatment and due process for seafarers caught in the growing web of unregulated shipping practices, he said.

“We’re seeing an increase in the abandonment and criminalisation of seafarers,” Dominguez said, pointing to the expansion of shadow fleets, made up of vessels that obscure their ownership and movements to bypass sanctions and oversight, often operating beyond the law.

The dark fleet routinely transports illicit cargo and sanctioned products, such as Iranian and Russian petroleum, flouts regulatory rules and employs unfair working practices, such as forced labour, according to industry experts.

“

We need to pace ourselves to maintain the quality of regulations and ensure they’re actually enforced. And if we’re really serious about attracting the new generations to seafaring, we need to start by actually treating better and keeping the seafarers right now.

Shipping analysts track between 1,300 and 1,400 vessels operating in the global shadow fleet, and about half are crude oil tankers.

“These ships are putting seafarers at risk. Substandard shipping and ships that do not comply with the IMO regulations should not be operating,” Dominguez said.

He confirmed that the IMO is now intervening in cases of seafarer abandonment, using the organisation’s diplomatic leverage to pressure governments and flag states to uphold international standards.

“Whenever there’s a case, I reach out to the member states and the flag states, and I work closely with organisations like the ITF to gather information and follow up,” he said, referring to the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which defends seafarers’ rights.

The IMO has recently adopted new guidelines on the treatment of seafarers facing criminal charges for working on board vessels found to be carrying illicit goods, despite having no control over cargo or routes. It is also reviewing its regulations to address seafarer fatigue, violence and harassment at sea.

Yet the IMO’s hands are tied when it comes to enforcement.

“It is not an intention of the IMO to engage or try to trespass into the judicial process of the countries. But I do ask for every single country to treat seafarers rightly, to provide them with due process,” said Dominguez.

Rights crisis

Ship abandonments, in which seafarers are left unpaid, often without food or repatriation, after the owner walks away from a vessel, more than doubled in 2024, according to the ITF.

The consequences can be dire. Crews may be left stranded for months, detained without charge or denied medical care.

Many of these vessels are linked to the sanctioned oil trade. The IMO does not enforce sanctions, but instead seeks basic standards for safety, environmental protection and seafarer welfare.

Owners sometimes register their ships under flags of convenience in countries with lax regulations and tax loopholes, and Dominguez acknowledged that boats flying certain flags routinely appear in databases on abandonment and violations.

Last year, 90 per cent of abandoned seafarers were working on vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the ITF said.

“We maintain statistics, and when patterns emerge, my first step is to start having the conversations” with flag states, said Dominguez.

This softer approach, Dominguez argued, is more sustainable. “Our job is to help build their capacity while ensuring they uphold their obligations.”

Dominguez is working to sign more countries onto the International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention, which sets minimum standards for seafarers. Several Middle Eastern countries and the United States have yet to ratify the agreement.

The proliferation of small ship-management companies has further complicated the picture. But expanding regulations should avoid creating rules that stifle the industry and cannot be realistically implemented, Dominguez said.

“We need to pace ourselves to maintain the quality of regulations and ensure they’re actually enforced,” he said. “And if we’re really serious about attracting the new generations to seafaring, we need to start by actually treating better and keeping the seafarers right now.”",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/49846363501_109a8737ec_4k.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-28 09:58:01.832895
