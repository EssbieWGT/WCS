In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.
Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.
Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.
Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.","EcoLog has taken an important step in the development of a liquid hydrogen import terminal in the Port of Amsterdam.

This week, the company signed an agreement in Tokyo with a group of technology partners that will supply equipment for both the future import terminal and the vessels that will transport the hydrogen.

The consortium partners,Ebara Corporation, Fukui Seisakusho, Kobe Steel, and TB Global Technologies, will provide equipment and technical solutions for EcoLog’s liquid hydrogen vessels as well as for the planned import terminal in Amsterdam.

In close cooperation with Port of Amsterdam, EcoLog is developing a terminal for the import of liquid hydrogen and the export of liquid CO₂ in the Afrikahaven.

It will be the first terminal of this scal worldwide. The terminal is expected to become operational around 2030 and, in its initial phase, will have an annual throughput capacity of 200,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and 1.8 million tonnes of liquid CO₂.

Liquid hydrogen can be transported efficiently and safely via pipelines, inland shipping, rail, and road.

Through the Amsterdam terminal, hydrogen can be supplied to customers in the region, elsewhere in the Netherlands and in Germany, for use in sectors such as industry, mobility, shipping, and aviation.

Alongside the development of the terminal, EcoLog is also working on specialized vessels for the transport of liquid hydrogen.

Both maritime transport and terminal operations require highly specialized equipment.

EcoLog has therefore entered into a framework agreement with its partners to jointly develop and integrate this equipment into the vessels and the terminal. This includes, among other things:

Pumps for loading and unloading liquid hydrogen

Safety relief valves to reduce tank pressure in emergency situations

Heat exchangers to convert liquid hydrogen into gaseous form, enabling onward transport via pipelines after arrival

Marine loading arms for the safe loading and unloading of vessels

Based on the current planning, the company is working towards realization of the terminal in 2030.

The import of green hydrogen is essential for the development of the European hydrogen economy and for the decarbonization of industry.

Earlier this year, an agreement was signed with partners from Oman, Germany, and the Netherlands to enable the import of liquid hydrogen.

The development of the terminal in the Port of Amsterdam aligns with this international cooperation and with the broader ambition to supply North-West Europe with green hydrogen.",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EL2501-S01A-PH1-250616.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 04:57:09.692176

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., today launched a new inquiry into fuel smuggling and money laundering reportedly orchestrated by Mexican drug cartels, by requesting information from 7 shipping companies about their operations and safeguards against illegal fuel trafficking.

“Drug cartels are reportedly siphoning billions of dollars’ worth of fuel to bolster their criminal empires, while they also bring drugs and violence into the United States. I want to be sure both shipping companies and the U.S. government are doing everything in their power to shut off this revenue stream. These letters are the first step in my effort to learn more about how these criminal networks operate, and where existing controls are failing,” Wyden said.

News reports this year indicate that drug cartels have diverted billions of dollars in diesel and other fuel shipments to avoid Mexican customs and operate an illegal fuel network in Mexico. Those proceeds strengthen drug cartels, which are major manufacturers and smugglers of illegal drugs into the United States, with responsibility for murders and brutal violence on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Meanwhile, Trump has diverted law enforcement officials and resources away from ongoing investigations in order to round up immigrants with little regard for due process or prioritizing truly dangerous criminals.

Wyden requested information from TORM, Teekay, Scorpio Tankers, NORDEN, International Seaways, Frontline and CMB.Tech.

“Cracking down on this illicit industry is critical to blunt cartels’ ability to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, cocaine, and other deadly drugs in the United States, and the international shipping industry must play its part to end this lawless practice,” Wyden wrote in his letters to the shippers.

This move addresses a critical component of the supply chain by guaranteeing fuel availability for the corridor's operations.
""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""
Integrating green corridors into strategy This biofuel corridor is a new component of Odfjell’s wider decarbonisation strategy.","Norwegian chemical tanker operator Odfjell has established what it calls the first operational green corridor for shipping between Brazil and Europe.

The initiative uses a certified sustainable biofuel to power vessels along a 5,000-nautical-mile supply route, signalling a major step in decarbonising deep-sea logistics networks.

Odfjell is currently running between 12 and 15 voyages each year on this transatlantic corridor with each round trip taking approximately 40 days.

This is not a one-off trial, but a sustained operational change to its service on this route. Odfjell has committed to self-funding the initiative covering the higher cost of the greener fuel without relying on subsidies.

Harald Fotland, Odfjell's Chief Executive Officer, says ""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation.""

Securing the biofuel supply chain

The green corridor relies on a B24 sustainable biofuel blend which consists of 24% renewable biodiesel from waste sources and 76% very-low-sulphur oil. To ensure a consistent and reliable supply for its vessels, Odfjell has secured a long-term offtake agreement for this B24 blend sourced from Rio Grande Brazil. This move addresses a critical component of the supply chain by guaranteeing fuel availability for the corridor's operations.

Collaboration is central to the project’s design. The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working with Odfjell to enhance efficiency and streamline port-stay processes for vessels on this route.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains. ""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The project builds upon a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil to create a green transatlantic shipping route.

From an industry perspective, the initiative is seen as a vital move toward decarbonising global logistics. According to the Norwegian Shipowners' Association, shipping is responsible for about 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

Knut Arild Hareide, CEO of the association, explains ""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050.""

Integrating green corridors into strategy

This biofuel corridor is a new component of Odfjell’s wider decarbonisation strategy. Odfjell has already achieved a carbon intensity reduction of more than 54% against its 2008 baseline, through a series of technical and operational improvements to its fleet.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" Harald says. The project aligns with the International Maritime Organization's 2030 targets and the European Union's Fit for 55 package.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime, noted that biofuels offer a pragmatic solution for the deep-sea shipping sector. ""This green corridor will show how this works in action while demonstrating how value-chain collaboration can speed the transition and help meet ambitious goals,"" Knut says.

The success of the supply chain will hinge on ongoing work with ports customers and fuel suppliers. Harald believes this will help to increase the availability of green fuels and maximise operational efficiency. Harald concludes: ""It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start.""

Through these deployments, the two winning shipping lines, Hapag-Lloyd and NCL, are redefining what’s possible in this industry:

Hapag-Lloyd will deploy e-methanol on large methanol dual-fuel containerships, on a trans-oceanic lane.

NCL will deploy the world’s first e-ammonia-powered containership, serving a northern European trade lane.

Both fuels will be made with low-carbon hydrogen produced with renewable energy and will deliver a carbon intensity reduction of at least 90% on a lifecycle basis relative to conventional high-emission fuel.

“We applaud Hapag-Lloyd and North Sea Container Line’s leadership, collaboration, and innovation, as well as the quality of their offerings in response to ZEMBA’s pioneering market signal,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, President and CEO of ZEMBA. “This voluntary private sector initiative remains on track to invest in rapid on-the-water deployment of vastly scalable, next-generation maritime fuels.”

“At a time when sourcing scalable e-fuels remains a major challenge for the entire industry, winning the second ZEMBA tender is a significant milestone for us. Deploying e-methanol is an essential step in our journey to reach net-zero fleet operations by 2045. We are very grateful for the trust that all ZEMBA members have placed in our capabilities, and we remain fully committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a greener future for global shipping,” said Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of Hapag-Lloyd.

“We are proud to be awarded together with Hapag-Lloyd the ZEMBA tender, reaffirming NCL’s commitment to shaping the future of sustainable logistics,” said Bente Hetland, CEO of NCL. “With a dedicated product for ZEMBA’s members who are ready to drive real change, NCL will continue to push the transition towards next generation maritime fuels. We are truly grateful for the strong support from the business community as we work together to deliver efficient and forward-thinking transport solutions.”

Following ZEMBA’s novel inaugural tender in 2024, ZEMBA’s second procurement focused on kickstarting a new market for scalable, low-carbon hydrogen-derived e-fuels that will be essential to achieve an economically viable whole-of-sector maritime clean energy transition.

Just as global renewable energy costs have declined significantly in recent years as the market has matured, e-methanol and e-ammonia that are produced with clean energy offer great potential for economies of scale. With this announcement, ZEMBA’s first-mover members are demonstrating support for scalable, strategic, and holistic supply chain sustainability solutions that can enable them to meet long-term goals.

This latest announcement also reinforces the importance of credible, third-party verified, and transparent book and claim chain of custody systems to activate early voluntary corporate demand and create markets for new technology solutions.

For highly distributed global sectors like ocean transportation, these systems enable demand from buyers around the world to flow to first-mover suppliers that are ready for deployment, irrespective of geographic availability constraints that would otherwise render such commercial arrangements impossible.

Ofiniti, the company behind the FuelBoss digital delivery platform and BunkerFlow, recently said it has completed more than 24,000 digital bunker operations across its network this year.

In its Impact Report 2025, Ofiniti said 2025 was the year digitalisation and decarbonisation truly converged in bunkering.

“Alternative fuels are moving from pilot stage to scaled supply, biofuels, LNG, methanol, ammonia, but they bring complexity, documentation demands and safety requirements that manual processes cannot handle,” the company said.

“That is where Ofiniti quietly became infrastructure. Before electronic Bunker Delivery Notes were mandated in Singapore or widely discussed across the industry, we had already begun digitising operations in North-West Europe.

“What is now becoming a global expectation began as a practical response to operational friction, making documentation clearer, aligning stakeholders, and reducing manual burden.”

With Ofiniti’s capability to support LNG, methanol, biofuels and ammonia, the company said its suppliers delivered 500,000 metric tonnes (mt) of alternative marine fuels, equivalent to filling 200 Olympic pools, this year.

Ofiniti also said its first deliveries of 100% bio-LNG and B100 UCOME were also completed and documented digitally in 2025.

With alternative fuels, the company said the stack of documents grows with more comprehensive checklists and documentation of the lifecycle emission profile and FuelBoss can automate that process.

“It standardises the process, gives every stakeholder the same data, and creates the digital custody chain required to validate the sustainability of new fuels,” it added.

With that, Ofiniti has reduced paperwork by an average of 28 pages per LNG delivery.

Looking ahead, Tue Nielsen, CEO of Ofiniti, said: “The next phase of the energy transition is not only about new fuel molecules; it is about proof, integrity, safety, and interoperability.

“Ofiniti is positioned as the system that enables these flows, the unseen operating layer that lets the energy transition actually work at scale.”

Singapore-based maritime electrification startup Pyxis on Wednesday (17 December) said it has secured SGD 13 million (USD 10 million) in the first close of its SGD 18 million growth funding round.

The early close underscores rising investor conviction in Pyxis’ technology and commercial progress, reinforced by continued support from Singapore government agencies such as the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and SEEDS, which operates under SG Growth Capital, the investment platform of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and Enterprise Singapore Pyxis’ fund raise comes at a time marked by an increased demand for electric vessels across Asia.

The region operates more than 70,000 coastal and in-port vessels while Singapore alone expects some 1,600 harbour crafts to transition to electric or low-carbon alternatives as part of the broader national goals.

Pyxis’ electric vessels and energy systems address this need directly – reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) by lowering both fuel and maintenance expenses, while significantly improving energy efficiency and cutting emissions.

Powered by Electra™, the company’s proprietary energy and vessel management platform, Pyxis enables real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance and fleet-level optimisation, improved reliability and reduced downtime.

To date, the company has secured 17 orders for electric vessels across multiple customers in the region, including Singapore. Concurrently, Pyxis is developing a network of ultra-fast marine charging sites, with two charging locations deployed and additional sites planned in partnership with local stakeholders. An upcoming 300KW charger location will also be launched in Q1 2026. With these deployments, Pyxis is entering its strongest growth chapter since inception.

The financing round is backed by a strong coalition of climate-tech, venture capital, and maritime strategic investors, with follow-on commitments from Shift4Good, Motion Ventures, the world’s largest maritime tech fund, and SG Growth Capital, underscoring the sustained confidence of Pyxis’ long-term partners. It also includes participation from strategic backers including Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, one of the world’s largest shipping companies, through its corporate venture capital arm, MOL PLUS.

The raise was catalysed by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)’s Expression of Interest (EOI) for electric vessel financing, which was part of Singapore’s broader maritime decarbonisation and innovation efforts to build an electric harbour craft ecosystem that supports early adopters of new electric solutions.

In addition to equity financing, Pyxis has secured green debt financing from OCBC, strengthening its capacity to scale vessel deployment and infrastructure development. This financing, to be channelled toward vessel capital expenditure, will provide capital flexibility essential for accelerating commercial rollout.

“Investor conviction in this round sends an unmistakable message: maritime electrification is accelerating, and Pyxis is leading that transition,” said Tommy Phun, Founder and CEO of Pyxis.

“The strength of this first close, anchored by strategic follow-on investments, validates the scalability of our technology and our ambition to build Asia’s leading coastal electrification ecosystem.”

“Two years ago, Pyxis was a bold vision with a great team behind it. Today, that vision is moving fast across the water: 17 vessels secured, charging infrastructure rolling out, Electra™ evolving into a true operating system for electric fleets, and international expansion underway,” said Sebastien Guillard, Co-founder and Managing Partner of Shift4Good.

“Few companies execute with this clarity and pace. We’re proud to back Pyxis again and support their rise as the leader of Asia’s coastal electrification wave.”

“SEEDS is proud to continue backing Pyxis, a fast-growing company with a capable team and strong strategic partnerships, together with our co-investment partner Shift4Good. We look forward to seeing Pyxis advance its solutions and contribute to the maritime electrification landscape in the region,” said Tan Kaixin, General Manager of SEEDS.

According to Pacific Environment’s report ‘On thin ice: Why shipping’s black carbon emissions demands urgent action’,unchecked black carbon emissions from Arctic shipping represent a clear and present danger to the integrity of the Arctic cryosphere, global climate stability and the health and wellbeing of Arctic Indigenous and coastal communities.

As highlighted by Pacific Environment, action ahead of PPR 13 – the IMO’s technical pollution prevention and response meeting – in early 2026 will allow Member States to agree on action that will help slow Arctic warming and uphold the IMO’s mandate to protect the marine environment and adjacent communities.

In a similar statement Dr. Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean Arctic Alliance explained that it is important that other Arctic and climate-vulnerable states step up to support the proposal during the discussions at PPR 13 – action to reduce emissions of super-pollutant black carbon is essential for remaining in line with the Paris climate targets and will be an important first step towards reducing international shipping’s climate impact.

The biofuel corridor represents an additional element in the company's decarbonisation approach.","Odfjell has begun operating what it describes as the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe, using certified sustainable biofuel on a 5,000-nautical-mile route.

The Norwegian chemical tanker operator is running 12 to 15 voyages annually along the route, each lasting around 40 days, using a B24 sustainable biofuel blend sourced from Rio Grande.

The initiative is entirely self-funded, with Odfjell covering the additional fuel costs without subsidies or external financial support.

""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation,"" says Harald Fotland, the company's CEO.

The B24 blend comprises 24% renewable biodiesel derived from waste and 76% very-low-sulphur oil.

How the green corridor works

Odfjell has secured an offtake agreement for the B24 blend in Rio Grande to ensure long-term fuel availability.

The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are collaborating with Odfjell to improve efficiency and optimise port-stay processes along the corridor.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains.

""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

The company emphasised this represents a sustained operational commitment rather than a one-off demonstration project.

A well supported initiative

The Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, welcomed the initiative as an important milestone.

""We congratulate Odfjell on taking the lead and demonstrating what is possible when business and public authorities cooperate across national borders to reduce emissions,"" he says.

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The corridor builds on a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil to establish a green transatlantic shipping route.

Knut Arild Hareide, who is CEO of the Norwegian Shipowners' Association, sees the launch as a highly encouraging step towards greener logistics.

""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050,"" Knut explains.

Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

Odfjell's broader decarbonisation strategy

Odfjell has reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54% compared to a 2008 benchmark through various technical and operational measures.

The biofuel corridor represents an additional element in the company's decarbonisation approach.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" Harald says.

The initiative aligns with the International Maritime Organization's 2030 targets and the European Union's Fit for 55 package.
