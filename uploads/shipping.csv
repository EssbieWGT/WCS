The conversion was on board the 20,000-teu Cosco Shipping Libra (built 2018), which has now completed its sea trials.

The vessel’s single 11-cylinder, 90-bore main engine was converted to be able to take liquid gas injection methanol or regular diesel.

The work was done by engine maker Everllence and Cosco Shipping Heavy Industries.

The project covered engineering, project management, installation, commissioning and sea trials.

As part of the project, Everllence built a dedicated testbed in Japan to validate the performance of a 90-bore engine.

Everllence PrimeServ vice president Michael Petersen said: “This milestone highlights Cosco Shipping Lines’ role as a first mover and presents a practical path for reducing emissions from Everllence S90 engine vessels.

“It also showcases Everllence’s capability to deliver large-scale retrofit projects.”

Everllence, formerly MAN, believes there are more than 300 vessels with its S90-class engines that are suitable for retrofitting.

“While the journey toward full decarbonisation will require collaboration across the industry, this achievement demonstrates that large-scale conversions are both technically proven and commercially viable,” added Petersen.

“This opens a practical pathway towards accelerating the maritime energy transition together with our customers.”

Everllence is also working on plans for large methanol dual-fuel engines for newbuilding orders.

In May this year, it said it was set to deliver its most powerful two-stroke methanol engine.

The 12-cylinder, 95-bore methanol dual-fuel engine has been developed with Chinese licensee CSSC-MES Diesel.

There are 12 of these engines destined for a series of 24,000-teu vessels.

He believes that the impacts of climate change on food security, migration and many more problems far exceed the economic costs of the shipping framework.","Negotiators from across the world met in London this month at the UN shipping agency’s headquarters to adopt landmark rules to reduce the sector’s carbon emissions.

Though the rules had been agreed on in April, the meeting at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) ended with deep division and the plans delayed for at least a year. The week-long talks witnessed complaints of intimidation and some delegates brought to tears.

Delegates said the meeting turned into a political battleground, with the US issuing public threats to nations supporting curbs on emissions. Some nations backtracked on their support for tough regulations to make shipowners pay for high-emitting vessels, and instead supported Saudi Arabia’s ultimately successful moves to delay the plans.

But this was not just about rich fossil-fuel-producing countries scuppering curbs on oil use. Some developing nations voiced fears that the IMO’s plans would spike food prices for their citizens. They said they supported decarbonisation but had not been assured the money raised by the levy would ensure an equitable transition away from oil.

The shipping industry burns 350 million tonnes of fuel oil every year as it moves over 80% of goods traded worldwide, producing 3% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in the process. Advocates for the IMO’s regulations to change this have vowed to address key sticking points and come back next year to try again.

At the IMO in London, overlooking the River Thames, Dialogue Earth spoke with delegates and observers across the debating chamber and bustling lunch-hour canteen – documenting the meeting’s highs and lows. Then, after the unexpected denouement, we asked them if there is a path forward for the net-zero plans.

A plan to move away from fossil fuels

Shipping is under huge pressure to move away from fossil fuels, especially from governments in countries threatened by climate change such as the Pacific island nations, and from Europe, where the European Union has introduced its own shipping-emission rules.

In 2023, IMO member states unanimously agreed to achieve net-zero emissions from the sector “by or around” 2050. To meet this pledge, a Net-Zero Framework was proposed to incentivise investments into greener marine fuels; construction of greener ships; and upgrades of existing vessels and ports to use fuels like green methanol and green ammonia.

The framework set out rules for vessels to reduce their greenhouse gas intensity, meaning their emissions per unit of energy used. Vessels failing to meet the base intensity target would face charges, starting at USD 100 per tonne of CO2 equivalent.

Those failing short of an even more lenient threshold would face a higher rate under the framework: USD 380 per tonne on emissions exceeding the base target. Vessels that overperform and are more efficient than required could earn “surplus units” and trade these with other ships. Any payments collected would go into a Net-Zero Fund to mitigate impacts of climate change on developing states and reward low-emission ships.

‘Unexpectedly challenging’

The overarching framework was approved in April by a large majority of nations: 63 backed it, 16 were opposed and 24 abstained. Despite strong opposition from the US, many of these countries appeared to have maintained their support heading into this month’s talks – which were supposed to consider some changes to the text and give it a final sign-off. This gave proponents early confidence that adoption was within reach.

The official adoption would mean writing the new rules into the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol). The plan was set to come into force in 2027 and be fully operational in 2028. But the outcome of this month’s meeting means it could instead be pushed back or even abandoned entirely.

Anita Mäkinen, one of Finland’s representatives to the IMO said she entered the first session on 14 October aware that the geopolitics could threaten the adoption. “But I never really thought it could be this challenging.”

Finland is part of a group of EU countries pushing for the deal, alongside other vocal proponents such as Brazil and some Pacific island countries including Tuvalu.

Their initial optimism faded midweek, when the negotiations grew increasingly tense. At one point, tension ran so high the meeting’s chair tried to cut it by asking if there was a doctor in the room.

Delegates from the US and Saudi Arabia made attempts to stall the proceedings. Their tactics ranged from challenging the plan’s adoption to proposing the IMO should require governments’ explicit acceptance for adoption, which would go against the usual IMO approach of assuming acceptance of negotiation outcomes. Meanwhile, more nations expressed doubts about the adoption as the week went on.

Country’s that had previously voted to approve the framework – including China, India and Kenya – supported delaying a vote on the adoption, while major shipping nations such as Greece and Cyprus abstained. On the final day of the meeting, 17 October, countries voted 57 to 49 in favour of delaying, with 21 abstentions.

The delay has confused a sector that plans shipbuilding years in advance. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” said Thomas Kazakos, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping.

Pressure from the US

Many delegates attributed the outcome to the US officials’ campaign to derail the framework. This included threats before the meeting to impose visa restrictions on mariners from nations that supported the deal, additional fees if ships from those nations docked at US ports, and even sanctions on officials from countries supporting what the US called “a global carbon tax on Americans”.

Delegates from a Pacific island nation told Dialogue Earth that the capitals of several Pacific states received pressure from high-level US officials, urging them to withdraw support. Mäkinen shared a similar observation, saying the targets for US lobbying were small island states and “big flag states” where large numbers of ships are registered. Many delegates could be seen huddling in private discussions on the IMO hall floor.

“There was so much politics involved and that’s why it was extraordinary,” Mäkinen adds. “We couldn’t discuss and negotiate only on the basis of technical issues of the proposed regulations.”

Leaving no one behind

US coercion was not the only concern, however. Representatives from developing countries, including small island nations from the Pacific and the Caribbean, raised questions about the framework’s impact on shipping costs and food security.

During coffee breaks, Dialogue Earth spoke to several chatty delegates in the buzzing main chamber. They said they were troubled by a lack of clarity on the Net Zero Fund’s distribution and how it could help offset the framework’s negative impacts. A study estimates that USD 11-12 billion could be raised annually by the framework between 2028 and 2030, but the implementation guidelines that address revenue-sharing are still under discussion.

Benoit Bardouille, Dominica’s ambassador and adviser to its prime minister, said that his Caribbean state, which is moving toward 100% renewable energy by 2030, supports the shipping sector being decarbonised, “but it must be done with a certain level of soberness”.

Bardouille, who represented his state at the IMO meeting, said many Caribbean states are heavily reliant on imports. He fears the framework will raise shipping costs, leading to spiralling inflation that is passed onto consumers.

Pawa Limu, Papua New Guinea’s delegate, shared similar concerns. Both Bardouille and Limu want more clarity on how money raised by the IMO scheme will be shared to drive a fair and just transition away from fossil fuels – one that doesn’t leave vulnerable states behind.

Tristan Smith, a professor of energy and transport at University College London, said such worries are “very legitimate”. This year his research group estimated that transportation costs for global trade could rise by around 5% in 2028 to at least 20% by 2035, depending on how strict the rules become.

Much of the transition is predicated on shipping that runs on relatively cheap oil shifting in a significant fashion to more expensive but greener fuels such as green hydrogen, methanol and ammonia.

Smith, who specialises in global shipping decarbonisation, stresses that the IMO cannot achieve its pledge to reach net zero by 2050 without paying a price. “You always have inflationary effects because we’re … moving from a low-cost energy source to a higher cost energy source,” he said. “The low-cost energy source has high environmental costs, but in our economy today, we don’t put a price on those costs.”

Lloyd Fikiasi, a delegate from Vanuatu – the Pacific nation known for championing climate actions – said those unpriced costs should not be underestimated.

“We look beyond those economic impacts. It’s [a matter of] survival. If we don’t take any actions to address greenhouse gas emissions, we will lose our future,” said Fikiasi.

He believes that the impacts of climate change on food security, migration and many more problems far exceed the economic costs of the shipping framework. Vanuatu abstained on the approval of the plan in April, as it said the framework is not ambitious enough to meet the IMO’s net-zero target.

Advocates remain hopeful

After the vote to delay the framework, member states continued discussions in London on implementation guidelines. These will dictate critical elements of the plan including how the Net-Zero Fund will operate and how low-carbon marine fuels will be certified.

Proponents hope that discussions such as these before the next crunch vote on the overall framework will help resolve the outstanding concerns.

Smith remains confident that a majority of the IMO member nations support the framework, even though many want more time and clarity on specific elements, or adjustments to how it will work. Fikiasi is less certain, and worries that geopolitics could still stymie agreement next year.

Mäkinen said she remains hopeful even though she too doubts that the political pressure seen this month will disappear in a year.

“I have experienced many negotiations [in which] I wasn’t exactly sure where we would end up. But they always have a happy ending we could agree on,” she said. “I have trust in the IMO miracles.”",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/10/Container-ship-moving-through-Panama-Csnall_Alamy_3CMJMMW_THUMBNAIL.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 14:56:13.109917

Quadrise PLC (AIM:QED) CEO Peter Borup talked with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion about how the recent delay by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to finalise its net-zero framework is impacting the global shipping industry and the commercial prospects of Quadrise’s cleaner fuel alternatives, MSAR and BioMSAR.

Borup said the delay has introduced more uncertainty for shipowners and regulators alike but stressed that it also opens space for independent action. “You can actually go pretty far and you can save some money at the same time,” he noted, pointing to immediate solutions including hull paint, rotor sails, and Quadrise’s own products that reduce both emissions and costs.

He also addressed the impact of lacking a global carbon pricing mechanism until 2027, saying that cleaner fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR still offer a compelling value proposition due to their economic and emissions advantages.

Borup highlighted growing opportunities within the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, with players already selling carbon credits at over €300 per tonne to global buyers such as Microsoft.

While the IMO delay may appear as a hurdle, Borup suggested it could also be beneficial, stating, “It could be in our favour,” provided Quadrise can scale adoption quickly. He emphasised the importance of a level playing field for shipowners across jurisdictions.

It has been widely reported as an unequivocal indication of divided sentiments over stepped-up environmental control of global shipping.

According to Asia Shipping Media (ASM), it has unsettled regulators, particularly in Europe.

The European Commission has expressed frustration at Greece and Cyprus’s decision to abstain from voting on whether to defer the NZF.

During the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s extraordinary session in London on October 18, delegates voted to postpone discussions for 12 months after failing to reach a consensus or call a vote on the draft amendments to Marine Pollution (MarPol) Annex VI, which contains the framework’s key provisions.

As a result, the shipping industry now faces significantly greater uncertainty and, consequently, heightened risk.

The decision delays any potential adoption of the NZF until late 2026 at the earliest, complicating the timeline for achieving the organisation’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategy agreed in 2023.

The framework, which was approved in principle at the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s 83rd session in April, provides a detailed description of a global fuel standard and an emissions pricing mechanism.

Together, the two regulations strive to enable net-zero achievement for global shipping by 2050.

Analysts at consultancy Linerlytica have produced a map illustrating how member states voted during this month’s session at the IMO’s London headquarters, revealing a pronounced divide over the NZF.

University College London (UCL) has said that while it is now certain the framework’s entry into force will be delayed by 12 months to January 1, 2029, doubts remain as to whether it will be adopted at all.

Dr Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL’s Shipping and Oceans Research Group, observed that instead of providing clarity, the outcome had left the shipping industry, and the wider trade and energy systems, facing increased uncertainty and risk. He argued that understanding the dynamics behind the October meeting was now crucial, not only for any future adoption of the framework but also for ensuring equitable and effective climate action.

Smith added that while lost momentum could still be recovered, the setback brought the world closer to the brink of dangerous climate change.

ASM adds that analysts at investment bank Jefferies suggested that one possible consequence of the indecision could be a renewed focus on conventional fuel engines for new vessel orders, as well as for many ships currently under construction.

The bank indicated that many shipowners might opt to convert their dual-fuel ‘capable’ newbuilds into dual-fuel ‘ready’ configurations to reduce capital expenditure, particularly for deliveries scheduled from 2027 onwards, when engine changes remain feasible.

Jefferies further noted that if there were any advantage to the IMO’s stalled initiatives, it might be a reduction in overall shipping costs.

The Sustainable Shipping Initiative (SSI) stated that the vote had exposed several vulnerabilities within the IMO, including growing politicisation in its decision-making processes and an increasingly fragmented regional consensus.

The SSI added that national administrations’ responses, the development of regional regulations, and the signals these sent to financial markets seeking long-term clarity could all had wide-reaching implications for the sector.",https://www.freightnews.co.za/files/styles/article_large/public/article/headline/2025-10/6-ag.jpg?itok=DbkQuk0q,N,,2025-10-28 11:16:48.920743

On 19 October, RCL’s container ship Piya Bhum, bunkered and sailed for the first time on biofuel, B24-VLSFO (Bio Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil), departing from Laem Chabang port to Ho Chi Minh City.

The 1,707 TEU capacity vessel is on its journey on RCL’s RSK2, RCL South China-Sihanoukville service route, connecting ports in China, Hong Kong, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines.

“The B24 fuel is a solution that drastically reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 15% to 19.2%,” the company said.

“The use of this biofuel reduces the carbon footprint of the RCL fleet without compromising efficiency, contributing to the company’s long-term sustainability goals. By continuously investing in a cleaner, more efficient fleet, RCL is building a more sustainable future for marine container shipping.”

Rotterdam’s B100 at wider discounts to conventional fuels

LBM rises against LNG in Rotterdam

EUA costs fall for fossil fuels

Rotterdam’s HBE-rebated B100 benchmark has dropped to $24-33/mt greater discounts to HSFO, VLSFO and LSMGO for voyages between EU ports. It is now priced $139/mt, $160/mt and $328/mt lower than these grades, respectively.

Singapore’s B100 UCOME benchmark is at hefty premiums over conventional fuels for voyages between Singapore (a non-EU port) and EU ports. Its premiums over HSFO and VLSFO have narrowed by $14-18/mt on the week to $544/mt and $481/mt, respectively. Its premium over LSMGO has plunged $53/mt lower to $286/mt.

Rotterdam’s LNG has dropped by $15/mt in the past week. That has moved it to smaller premiums of $46/mt over HSFO and $25/mt over VLSFO for dual-fuel vessels with Otto medium speed (Otto MS) engines. But compared to LSMGO, LNG is now $143/mt cheaper.

Singapore’s LNG has narrowed its premium over VLSFO to $50/mt, and to $113/mt over HSFO. Its discount to LSMGO is $145/mt.

For vessels with diesel slow speed (diesel SS) engines, Rotterdam’s LNG is at wide discounts of $93/mt to HSFO, $114/mt to VLSFO and $282/mt to LSMGO. This is because these engines have much lower methane slip than Otto MS ones and are therefore less penalised by the EU.

In Singapore, LNG diesel SS is priced $43/mt over HSFO, while at discounts of $20/mt to VLSFO and $215/mt to LSMGO.

Rotterdam’s liquefied biomethane (LBM) is $147/mt cheaper than LNG for a vessel with an Otto MS engine, and $151/mt cheaper than LNG for a diesel SS engine vessel.

Liquid fuels

Rotterdam’s HSFO and VLSFO prices are down by $4-6/mt on the week for EU-EU voyages. A $29/mt drop in EU Emission Allowance (EUA) costs for these fuels, and a $1/mt drop in FuelEU Maritime penalties have countered rises in their outright prices.

B100 has gained $27/mt in Rotterdam, as its assessed pooling value has increased by $15/mt to $661/mt, and as the outright B100 price has jumped $42/mt higher on the week.

In Singapore, HSFO and VLSFO prices have edged $4-6/mt higher, while its LSMGO price has pushed $43/mt higher. Singapore’s B100 price has gained $8/mt.

Liquid gases

LNG has shed $15/mt to $565-704/mt in Rotterdam for EU-EU voyages, and by $10-11/mt to $565-634/mt in Singapore for non-EU to EU voyages. The price spreads depend on engine types and methane slips.

The LNG prices have dropped amid $26/mt declines in EUA costs for LNG consumed between EU ports, and a $13/mt drop between non-EU and EU ports.

Rotterdam and Singapore’s outright LNG prices have gained slightly on the week amid slight upticks in TTF and JKM gas prices, and a larger assessed bunker delivery premium in Rotterdam.

LBM is up by $10-11/mt on the week to $415-557/mt in Rotterdam, depending on engine type.

LNG bunker fuel supplier Titan on Thursday (23 October) said it has completed the first delivery of liquefied biomethane (LBM/bio-LNG) to a Brittany Ferries vessel.

Hybrid-LNG ferry Saint-Malo received the supply during one of its recent regular bunker calls in Portsmouth International Port with Titan’s bunkering vessel Optimus.

“This hybrid ferry operates on LNG, battery power or a combination to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With this LBM delivery, Titan is proud to support the sustainability goals of yet another customer who chooses to lead rather than wait,” Titan said in a social media post.

The company said LBM delivers overcompliance with the FuelEU Maritime regulation, presenting benefits via pooling, banking and borrowing.

“Pooling allows operators to combine over- and under-compliant ships’ balances, so the pool offsets individual deficits or surpluses. Banking involves carrying surplus over to the next year. Borrowing means using next year’s surplus early, with interest,” it added.

LBM can also be ‘dropped into’ all established LNG bunkering infrastructure, including LNG-fuelled ships, and blended with LNG or e-methane at any ratio – with no vessel modification required. This flexibility enables operators to pursue initial emissions reductions through LNG and by introducing biomethane in line with their voluntary and regulatory emissions targets.

“Our latest LNG and LBM bunkering operation highlights that the methane decarbonisation pathway is not a future promise; it is already delivering environmental performance today,” Titan added.

Molgas Energy Group (Molgas), backed by infrastructure investor InfraVia, recently finalised the full acquisition of Titan Energy Holding, parent company of Titan Clean Fuels (Titan).

Nordic energy company Gasum on Thursday (23 October) said its fleet of gas-powered bunkering and carrier vessels have, for some time now, operated entirely on liquefied biogas (bio-LNG).

With this move, Gasum’s vessels have already generated a generous amount of compliance for the company’s FuelEU Maritime pool.

Gasum’s fleet comprises two bunkering vessels, delivering LNG and bio-LNG to ships at ports, as well as two carrier vessels that transport liquefied gas across the Nordics and Northern Europe. Each vessel is equipped with a dual-fuel gas engine, enabling the use of renewable bio-LNG as fuel.

By powering its own chartered vessels with bio-LNG Gasum is able to provide flexibility to the pool’s balance as the year is nearing its end and more regulation surplus is demanded.

“As we are now in the last quarter of the first FuelEU Maritime regulation year, there’s never been a more critical moment for ship owners to act. Joining Gasum’s FuelEU Maritime pool is the easiest and most reliable way to secure compliance. Adding our own fleet to the pool as compliance generators helps to secure more compliance surplus, but the amount is still limited”, said Jacob Granqvist, Vice President, Maritime, Gasum.

Gasum’s gas carrier vessels are chartered from Anthony Veder, who is also an offtaker in Gasum’s FuelEU Maritime pool. One of Gasum’s bunker vessels, Coralius, is jointly owned by Anthony Veder and Sirius Shipping. Gasum’s other bunker vessel, Kairos, is owned by Bernhard Schulte.

In addition to Gasum’s own vessels the pool includes other partners that are able to generate surplus with dual-fuel ships. By using bio-LNG across several gas-powered vessels, Gasum generates surplus emission reductions that can then be allocated to other ships in the pool.

At its extraordinary session held in London from 14–17 October 2025, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2) voted to delay for one year the adoption of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which would have established the world’s first global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping.

The decision represents a setback for international decarbonisation efforts, effectively maintaining the status quo for fossil fuel producers. Yet, for those already investing in clean-energy solutions—such as shipowners, ports, and private investors—the momentum toward zero-emission shipping is proving irreversible.

NatPower Marine, a major developer of maritime electrification infrastructure, says the industry cannot afford to wait.

“The IMO’s postponement is disappointing, but it cannot be a pause button,” said Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine and NatPower UK. “Shore power and near-shore electrification are proven, scalable, and capable of delivering deep emissions cuts today. Every corridor we electrify removes thousands of tonnes of CO₂, NOₓ, and SOₓ while improving air quality for coastal communities. The opportunity to lead is now, not in a year’s time.”

Innovation Leading Regulation

Sommadossi argues that technological innovation has always outpaced regulation—from aviation and automotive to AI—and shipping is no different.

“The most innovative operators have already decided to go green because it’s both a strategic advantage and a cost-saving measure. While policymakers debate, the industry is building,” he said.

NatPower Marine is pressing ahead with its plan to deliver near-shore electric propulsion and cold ironing infrastructure at 120 global locations. The company expects to invest more than £3 billion by 2030 to establish a connected network of zero-emission maritime energy hubs.

Emerging economies may lose out from the delay, Sommadossi noted, as they were counting on a global carbon-pricing system to fund sustainable port investments. However, private capital could still bridge that gap if projects are included within the growing web of green shipping corridors.

The Rise of Green Corridors

Across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, ports are rapidly electrifying, with clean energy corridors linking high-traffic routes. NatPower Marine’s Heysham–Northern Ireland corridor, built in partnership with Peel Ports Group, is already under construction and will eliminate over 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually from Irish Sea routes.

Sommadossi said the IMO delay only underscores the need for regional action. The EU Emissions Trading System, FuelEU Maritime, the UK ETS, Singapore’s corridor initiatives, and California’s at-berth emissions rules are already shaping the next phase of maritime decarbonisation.

“Global consensus is ideal, but regional regulation is getting the job done,” he said. “Decarbonisation is no longer waiting for a single mechanism—it’s happening route by route, port by port.”

Ports as the Catalyst

Recent findings from the World Maritime University (WMU) and Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI) confirm that ports are becoming central to green shipping transitions. Their Global Green Shipping Development Report (2024–2025) projects that shore power will soon become mandatory in many jurisdictions as emission standards tighten.

“This global trend validates our approach,” Sommadossi said. “Shore power and e-charging infrastructure are not optional—they’re the foundation of clean shipping. Every port that plugs into our network becomes part of the global energy transition.”

Building the Backbone of Clean Shipping

NatPower Marine’s network is supported by the broader NatPower Group, which provides 20 GW of renewable generation and over 100 GWh of battery storage. These assets, strategically located near coastlines, ensure clean power delivery to vessels through private-wire systems and smart PPAs—reducing grid pressure while enabling true zero-emission operations.

Sommadossi calls this integration “the backbone of a clean-shipping network,” linking renewable power generation directly to port and vessel demand.

A Redefinition of Green Corridors

He also called for a broader understanding of what defines a “green corridor.”

“Most have focused on fuel alternatives like e-methanol or ammonia,” he said. “But a truly green corridor must include the full chain—shore power, propulsion charging, renewable generation, and grid integration. That’s how we deliver zero-emission voyages from berth to berth at scale.”

While policymakers take another year to negotiate global consensus, Sommadossi believes the race toward clean shipping is already being won by those who act.

“If this week proved anything,” he concluded, “it’s that we cannot wait for definitions or delays. The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”",https://www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2456182077-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 11:17:08.250092

Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry.","The measure, which would mean shipowners pay a small charge on the CO2 produced by their vessels and have incentives to seek cleaner fuels and upgrade their ships, was passed in a majority vote in April. But under the complex rules of the world’s shipping regulator, that vote had to be reaffirmed at a further meeting this week.

For months, the US — which walked out of the April talks — put pressure on other countries to reject the move. In the past fortnight, this was stepped up to what some countries said amounted to an unprecedented campaign against them.

The US threatened countries and individual officials, with tariffs, penalties and visa revocations if they supported the pricing mechanism.

Dr Simon Bullock, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Yet again, powerful fossil fuel states are successfully blocking global efforts to cooperate on climate change. This is not the result the industry wanted, nor one the world’s people can afford. Progressive shipping businesses and nations can still chart a course to a clean shipping future, but Mr Trump’s aggressive, destructive lobbying has made their job much harder.”

Meanwhile, some petrostates including Saudi Arabia held out the offer of sweeteners to countries that voted against the plan, which has been several years in the making.

In the final tally, 57 countries voted in favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying and 21 abstentions. In April, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate minister, expressed the frustration of many small developing nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

After Friday’s vote, countries will have to reconvene in a year to consider the proposal again. The delay means uncertainty and confusion for companies involved in shipping and in the global trade in many key commodities.

John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “By delaying adoption of its net-zero framework, the IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown. With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Even if the measure is agreed next year, it will take years to come into force, as IMO rules mean it must be subject to a further period of technical assessment and review of how it can be implemented. That could mean a delay until near the end of this decade, at least.

Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry. Much of the money would be used to help companies upgrade their vessels and move to lower carbon fuels, or to pay for modifications to ports, rather than be allocated to poor countries to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, as many had hoped.

If it is eventually passed, the measure is not likely to place significant costs on imported goods, despite the concerns of some exporting countries.

Shipping represents about 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10 per cent by mid-century. The IMO has been working on various plans to reduce carbon from shipping for the last two decades, but progress has been slow.

The extraordinary scenes at the IMO, where discussions are normally staid and highly technical, bodes ill for further talks on ways to raise the revenues needed for poor countries to deal with the impacts of extreme weather, which will be continued at the Cop30 UN climate summit in Brazil next month.

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at the green campaigning organisation Seas at Risk, said: “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. No single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail, but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet does not have time to waste.”",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/10/26/7720563568_908f5c7b9c_h.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 06:16:29.547463

""Unchecked coal power expansion risks creating powerful vested interests that could potentially delay the energy transition in China, India and Indonesia.

The report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said China, India and Indonesia, the three largest coal growth markets and top drivers of global CO2 emissions since the Paris Agreement, are now on track to peak power sector emissions by 2030, provided they sustain their clean energy momentum.

Together, these countries accounted for 73 per cent of global coal consumption in 2024.

According to the study, India's clean electricity growth has accelerated sharply, with a record 29 gigawatt (GW) of non-fossil capacity added in 2024 and 25 GW more in the first half of 2025.

""Meeting India's 500 GW of non-fossil power capacity set by Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi could in fact peak coal power before 2030. The country has already crossed the 50 per cent mark well ahead of its 2030 deadline, even as electricity demand continues to rise in line with rapid economic and population growth.

""Strengthening grid flexibility, storage and transmission will be key to sustaining this momentum and ensuring reliable, affordable electricity,"" said Manoj Kumar, Analyst at CREA.

India's national policy framework, driven by competitive renewable energy auctions and ambitious manufacturing targets, has transformed it into a fast-growing solar manufacturing hub, the report said.

The country's annual solar module capacity stood at 118 GW by mid-2025 and is projected to reach 200 GW by 2028, reducing import dependence and supporting its clean energy goals.

CREA said China has already achieved a milestone by adding enough new clean electricity generation to cover all new demand growth.

""China has already added enough new clean electricity generation to cover all new demand growth and power sector coal use and emissions have been falling since 2024 as a result. While the coal power decline is unlikely to be linear and may experience occasional setbacks, maintaining China's current pace of clean energy growth means a coal power peak is imminent,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, Co-founder and Lead Analyst at CREA.

In Indonesia, the report said President Prabowo Subianto's 100 GW solar programme could ensure that coal power generation peaks by 2030.

""The real opportunity lies in translating this vision into a concrete delivery roadmap that positions clean energy to dominate new capacity additions,"" said Katherine Hasan, Analyst at CREA.

The report cautioned, however, that all three countries continue to expand coal-fired capacity which is a major risk to their clean energy transition.

India plans to add about 100 GW of new coal capacity by 2035, while China has 230 GW under construction.

""Unchecked coal power expansion risks creating powerful vested interests that could potentially delay the energy transition in China, India and Indonesia. Rapid reduction in power sector emissions post coal peak would not only require maintaining pre-2030 renewable energy growth rate in all three countries but also ensuring power market and grid reforms. The total reduction in power sector CO2 emissions could be equivalent to India's total 2019 CO2 emissions, compared to business-as-usual,"" Myllyvirta added.

The report said that the three countries are driven by similar motivations: improving energy security, reducing import dependence and attracting manufacturing investment.

But sustaining clean energy growth beyond 2030 will require strong policy support, modernised grids and political will to phase down coal use.

If successful, CREA said, China, India and Indonesia would join other BRICS nations such as Brazil, South Africa, the UAE and Ethiopia in having peaked their power sector emissions.",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-09/30/thumb/fitandfill/1200X630/1759199509-5563.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 06:16:39.875018

WÄRTSILÄ’S OUTLOOK

Marine

Wärtsilä expects the demand environment for the next 12 months (Q4/2025-Q3/2026) to be better than in the comparison period.

Energy

Wärtsilä expects the demand environment for the next 12 months (Q4/2025-Q3/2026) to be similar to that of the comparison period.

Energy Storage

Wärtsilä expects the demand environment for the next 12 months (Q4/2025-Q3/2026) to be better than in the comparison period. However, the current geopolitical uncertainty particularly impacts this business and may affect growth.

In general, Wärtsilä underlines that the current high external uncertainties make forward-looking statements challenging. Due to high geopolitical uncertainty, the changing landscape of global trade, and the lack of clarity related to tariffs, there are risks of postponements in investment decisions and of global economic activity slowing down.

HÅKAN AGNEVALL, PRESIDENT & CEO: GROWING ORDER INTAKE IN MARINE AND ENERGY, AND CONTINUED IMPROVED PROFITABILITY

“Wärtsilä’s third quarter of 2025 was characterised by steady activity in both the energy and marine markets. The external macroeconomic environment remained uncertain throughout the period. The OECD revised its 2025 global growth outlook upward, citing resilient emerging markets, front-loaded trade flows in response to anticipated US tariff changes, and strong investment in high technology sectors. However, it also notes that the full impact of higher tariffs remains unclear, with early signs of slowing output and consumption in advanced economies.

In the energy market, global electricity demand continues to rise, driven by accelerating electrification across sectors, growing industrial activity, and expanding data centre capacity. In parallel, the growing deployment of renewable energy is transforming power systems and increasing the need for flexible generation capacity. These market dynamics were evident in customer activity during the quarter. As an example, we secured an engineering and equipment contract to supply 12 Wärtsilä 50DF engines for a 217 MW power plant for East Kentucky Power Cooperative in the US. The plant is needed to provide additional grid capacity to meet growing demand.

In the marine market, sentiment has improved recently following a slow start to the year, supported by trade agreements between major economies, and the resilience in global trade. However, the impact on shipping demand has been uneven across segments, and growth in seaborne trade has moderated. Factors such as the ongoing uncertainty around trade policies, elevated newbuild prices, and softer demand in some segments have negatively affected new vessel orders this year. While new vessel ordering activity has slowed compared to the extraordinary levels seen in 2024, it remains above the 10-year average. Notably, activity in Wärtsilä’s key segments continued to be healthy. Also, the demand for alternative-fuel-capable vessels remained strong, representing 48 percent of contracted capacity so far in 2025.

After the reporting period, the vote to adopt the IMO’s Net Zero Framework was postponed by one year. This outcome opens the door to a fragmented landscape of carbon pricing mechanisms introduced by individual regions and countries. The EU already has its system in place, while China is signalling plans for its own programs, adding complexity to global shipping. At Wärtsilä, we offer a broad and flexible portfolio of technologies to support a wide range of decarbonisation strategies. We are helping our customers navigate the transition by optimising fuel efficiency and de-risking the future through fuel flexibility, leveraging hybrid solutions, alternative fuels, and carbon capture. Our commitment to sustainable innovation remains strong, aligned with evolving customer needs.

Order intake in the third quarter increased organically by 6%. Equipment order intake increased in Marine and Energy, while it decreased in Energy Storage. The Energy Storage business is facing headwinds from elevated US tariffs and regulatory changes particularly related to FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern), as well as intensified competition in other markets. Service order intake remained stable, supported by several new long-term agreements and renewals, while retrofits and upgrades decreased. The rolling 12-month book-to-bill ratio in service remains well above 1, indicating future growth. Organic net sales remained stable. Service net sales increased, while equipment net sales decreased primarily due to the timing of deliveries in Energy.

The comparable operating result increased by 10% to EUR 195 million, representing 11.9% of net sales. The result was supported by increases in Marine and Energy Storage, while results in Energy and Portfolio Business decreased. In Energy, the comparable operating result was mainly impacted by lower equipment sales. In Portfolio Business, the comparable operating result decreased as the ANCS business unit is no longer reported under the segment following the successful closure of its divestment on 1 July 2025.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to EUR 340 million, following the improved result and a good level of received customer payments. The current working capital position is very favourable for our business, and we expect the negative level to be sustained over the next years. We will continue our active efforts to manage working capital to maintain it well below the long-term historical average.

We expect the demand environment for the coming 12 months to be better than in the comparison period in Marine and Energy Storage, while the demand environment in Energy is expected to remain at a similar level. However, as previously outlined, the current high external uncertainties make forward-looking statements challenging. It is worth noting that order intake in Energy has been strong over the past 12 months, whereas Energy Storage has experienced weaker development. The market dynamics in Energy Storage have changed significantly following the implementation of the April 2025 US tariff measures, which were introduced shortly after the completion of our strategic review and the launch of the new financial targets. The current situation is challenging, and we need orders for next year’s deliveries. While we remain focused on profitable customer segments, we are also looking at measures that improve the competitiveness of the Energy Storage business. We anticipate ordering to pick up in the fourth quarter. We also note that the positive development in Marine and Energy combined continues, with net sales growing organically by 13% and reaching a 13.2% operating margin during the last twelve months.

We are executing our strategy with discipline and purpose, supporting our customers to succeed in the fast-changing marine and energy sectors. We are building a resilient foundation for long-term success that enables us to innovate consistently, adapt swiftly, and remain a trusted partner in an increasingly complex global environment.”

According to IUMI’s latest research, global cargo premiums for 2024 reached US$22.64 billion, marking a 1.6 percent increase over the previous year. This steady rise continues a multi-year upward trend.

Encouragingly, cargo loss ratios, the balance between premiums earned and claims paid, have improved consistently across most regions since 2018. The claims environment has also remained relatively benign, with no major catastrophic losses reported in 2024.

Brews commented: “The cargo market remains stable in terms of global premium income. We’ve seen a particularly large jump from China this year, though much of that is likely a correction of previously under-reported insurance on returns.

“That said, our sector continues to grapple with ongoing challenges, including cargo accumulations, mis-declared cargoes, the transition to net-zero and war-related risks. However, overall, 2024 brought no unexpected shocks.”

Looking ahead, however, Brews highlighted the growing impact of tariffs: “Tariffs are only just beginning to make their presence felt. In the coming months, we’ll be watching closely to see how they reshape insured cargo values and whether shippers and receivers shift to new markets and destinations to work around them. These changes could alter the entire cargo landscape.”

According to Brews, tariffs could increase insured values, and associated risk accumulations, by as much as 50 percent, particularly in North America. Other regions could also feel the effects, depending on where the transfer of risk occurs within global supply chains.

Shifting trade flows could disrupt established shipping patterns, forcing insurers to adapt to new routes, ports, and storage facilities, each bringing different risk profiles.

Brews also addressed market performance trends: “We’re definitely seeing an increase in market capacity. Some underwriters are now taking on larger risks at competitive premiums, which inevitably leads to some market softening. However, I don’t expect it to decline as sharply as some predict. Cargo underwriting remains profitable and that’s attracting fresh investment.”

Despite the current period of relative stability, Brews warned that tariffs and broader geopolitical tensions could still bring significant disruption: “If these forces reshape trade routes, costs, and volumes,” he concluded, “market stability and profitability will undoubtedly come under pressure.”

In a recent Maritime Impact article, classification society DNV highlighted infrastructure trends and transition models that can support wider adoption of low-GHG bunker fuels across the maritime sector based on its latest Maritime Forecast to 2050:

The maritime industry faces a pivotal moment as it adapts to regulation, including the new IMO Net-Zero Framework (pending adoption), aimed at reducing ship greenhouse gas emissions. DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast to 2050 offers practical insights and analysis to help stakeholders make informed decisions on ships, fuels, technologies and infrastructure for a net-zero future.

“For shipowners exploring low-GHG fuels and onboard carbon capture, knowing when and where they can refuel and offload captured CO₂ is crucial,” explains Eirik Ovrum, Maritime Principal Consultant at DNV and lead author of the paper. In this article, we highlight the latest developments and emphasize the importance of Chain of Custody models to verify the origin and sustainability of alternative fuels.

Net-Zero Framework sets new course for shipping

Shipping’s energy transition is being shaped by IMO’s revised 2023 GHG Strategy: a 20 per cent emissions reduction from shipping by 2030, a 70 per cent reduction (at least) by 2040, and full-scale decarbonization “by or around” 2050 – all compared with 2008 levels.

The Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aims to accelerate the adoption of low-GHG fuels and technologies. Maritime Forecast to 2050 describes the NZF and compares its consequences with those of relevant EU regulations.

A forthcoming DNV white paper will examine the NZF in depth following the October 2025 IMO meeting, where its adoption is expected to be voted on.

The NZF is based on a GHG fuel intensity (GFI) metric expressed in amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), or its equivalent, per unit of energy used on board in a calendar year on a well-to-wake basis.

Starting in 2028, progressively stricter GFI targets are anticipated to be introduced annually. If adopted, the NZF will affect technology choices and the operation of ships as well as the development of shoreside infrastructure and the availability of low-GHG fuels and CO2 storage.

Tracking the fuel and technology transition

Drawing on data from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight platform and S&P Global, Maritime Forecast to 2050 reveals a clear shift: LNG and methanol are gaining traction, while ammonia, hydrogen and on-board carbon capture are entering early trials.

Her speech underscored Norway’s commitment to fostering international collaboration and advancing a greener, more resilient ocean economy that benefits both industry and society.

Minister Næss began by commending the scale and vision of India Maritime Week and expressed her appreciation for the active participation of the global maritime community. She particularly acknowledged the growing strength of the Malaysian maritime sector, describing it as a complete industry cluster comprising shipbuilders, shipowners, suppliers, and a dedicated financial network.

She emphasized that such a well-integrated ecosystem is fully equipped to address both the challenges and opportunities arising from the sector’s transition toward sustainability. Næss noted that the maritime industry is undergoing a defining transformation—one that requires innovation, resilience, and shared global action.

The Minister addressed a common misconception that emission-reduction policies increase costs and disadvantage consumers. She argued that this short-term view fails to account for the far greater long-term costs of climate inaction.

“Climate change already affects us all, and it affects the most vulnerable the most,” she stated, stressing that environmental sustainability and economic growth must evolve together. The goal, she said, is not to view decarbonisation as a burden, but as an investment in a stable, inclusive, and future-ready maritime economy.

Norway’s experience in decarbonising shipping

Reflecting on Norway’s own maritime journey, Næss explained that the country’s progress in decarbonising shipping did not occur overnight. It was the result of decades of consistent policy support and public–private collaboration. Despite being a high-cost economy, Norway has maintained robust regulations and incentives to encourage innovation, foster competitiveness, and advance sustainability across the maritime value chain.

Successive Norwegian governments, she said, have understood that the maritime sector is central to national growth and identity. Maintaining consistent policies over time has enabled the industry to innovate, modernize, and lead in the adoption of green technologies—demonstrating that environmental responsibility can coexist with economic strength.

Government–Industry partnership for the green transition

A key focus of Næss’s address was Norway’s model of close cooperation between government and industry. She emphasized that the green transition can only succeed when all stakeholders—policy makers, companies, and innovators—work together toward shared goals.

In 2024, Norway signed a maritime partnership agreement with leading organisations in the shipping and fisheries sectors. The initiative aims to enhance knowledge-sharing, strengthen cooperation on green transition strategies, and assess the effectiveness of ongoing policies. Næss explained that Norway’s approach combines domestic initiatives with strong international engagement, ensuring that progress at home contributes to global maritime sustainability.

Ambitious emission targets and global leadership

Norway has set a clear and measurable ambition: to reduce emissions from domestic shipping and fisheries by 50% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. The country is also advocating for stricter international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, helping to expand the global market for low- and zero-emission solutions.

Næss reaffirmed Norway’s strong support for the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework, calling on all member states to accelerate their commitments within the next year. “This is a decisive decade,” she noted, urging global leaders to align ambition with action.

Highlighting the shared challenges faced by ocean nations such as India and Norway, the Minister called for greater unity on issues like maritime security, fair trade, sustainability, and ocean preservation. She stressed that decarbonisation must go hand in hand with social sustainability—a principle known as a just transition.

“A just transition ensures that climate policies foster shared progress rather than deepen inequalities,” she explained, adding that global fairness must remain at the heart of climate action. Shipping, being a global industry, requires collective responsibility to ensure that all countries can participate equitably in the green transformation.

India’s growing role in global shipping

Minister Næss praised India’s leadership in the global maritime landscape, citing its technological capability, digital innovation, manufacturing strength, and expertise in ship recycling. She expressed optimism over India’s increasing alignment with global environmental and climate goals, describing it as a sign of maturity and readiness to help shape the future of sustainable shipping.

Concluding her keynote, Næss reminded delegates that economic opportunity and environmental responsibility must coexist for the maritime sector to thrive. “A healthy blue economy depends on healthy oceans,” she said. “Oceans know no borders—and neither should our cooperation.”

She reaffirmed Norway’s long-standing maritime partnership with India and called for continued collaboration beyond the conference to ensure a cleaner, greener, and more equitable future for global shipping.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/default-article-banner.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 11:17:14.670234

A Bold Investment

That leadership intent is evident in the Modi government’s recent approval of a Rs 69,725 crore ($8 billion) package to reimagine, revive, and rejuvenate India’s shipbuilding and maritime ecosystem. This is not a routine budget line, but a signal of ambition. By investing at scale, the Modi government has sent a message that India will play a meaningful role in the global shift to low-carbon shipping. It will be a pace-setter.

This historic decision sets the stage for a maritime renaissance — a return to the spirit of seafaring enterprise that once defined Bharat’s trading heritage. It also aligns seamlessly with PM Narendra Modi’s vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047 — a confident, capable nation that anchors global trade routes, not merely services them.

The Global Tide Is Turning

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has set a clear course toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Europe has already moved from words to enforcement — its carbon market now charges ships for emissions, and the FuelEU Maritime regulations tighten fuel standards each year.

The direction is unmistakable: Alternative fuels such as green ammonia and methanol are shifting from pilot projects to purchase orders. This is the moment when policy leaves its footprint on the market, which, in turn, creates momentum. India’s advantages — low renewable energy costs, engineering expertise, and skilled seafarers — can convert that momentum into a meaningful market share.

India’s renewable power tariffs, discovered by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), are among the lowest globally — around Rs 2 per kilowatt hour. That translates into competitively priced green fuels. Recent bids for green ammonia have settled near Rs 52 per kg, placing Indian production costs below $650 per tonne — cheaper than many established export hubs.

This price advantage is not theoretical. Asian shipping lines and European buyers are already negotiating long-term contracts in the $550–$1,000 per tonne range. India is ready to deliver at scale.

Equally critical is our industrial ecosystem. Our country’s heavy-engineering backbone that served the oil and petrochemical sectors is now repurposing themselves for the green transition — fabricating bunkering skids, dual-fuel engines, and storage systems for clean fuels. Our geography amplifies these strengths: Ports on both coasts sit astride major global trade lanes, and our seafarers can be rapidly up-skilled to handle cryogenic and digital systems for new fuels. India can produce, handle, and export the next generation of marine fuels faster and more affordably than most.

From Vision to Bankable Demand

However, ambition alone doesn’t unlock capital — bankable projects do. That is why translating intent into investable demand is the next frontier.

A joint study by the Indian Ports Association (IPA) and RMI, Gateway to Green, identifies Deendayal, VO Chidambaranar (VOC), and Paradip ports as early candidates for green-fuel hubs. They already have the land, draft, and pipeline potential. With targeted investments in storage, grid upgrades, and multi-fuel terminals, these ports can become“green ready.”

The next step is to ensure demand. Domestic green shipping corridors — such as Kandla to VOC — and international routes linking India with Singapore and Rotterdam can aggregate fuel needs and create predictable throughput. When supply meets structured demand, finance follows. Shipowners can plan fleet conversions, cargo owners can lock in long-term charters, and lenders can assess risk with confidence. This is how India intends to position itself as an indispensable node in the global low-carbon maritime economy.

Building Confidence, Creating Value

Our ministry’s immediate priority is credibility. Early milestones — pilot corridors, port retrofits, and operational benchmarks — will prove that green shipping is not an experiment but an economic upgrade. Visible success will build investor confidence, inform future regulation, and serve as a template for replication across lighthouse ports.

The macroeconomic case is equally strong. Aligning with emerging IMO and EU standards preserves export market access and shields Indian industries from future carbon penalties. Domestic manufacturing of engines, storage tanks, and digital systems will generate skilled employment and retain value onshore. A full-fledged green maritime ecosystem will create recurring service revenue for ports, while cutting freight emissions — a strategic advantage in a carbon-constrained global economy.

Every global transition presents a narrow window where leadership is won or lost. As carbon prices rise and compliance rules tighten, vessels will choose ports that offer clean fuels and efficient services. Those who act early will shape the new trade geography. Those who delay will pay higher costs to catch up.

India’s $8-billion commitment is more than an investment — it is a declaration. It signals that we intend not just to adapt to a changing world but to shape it. In doing so, we move decisively toward realising the vision of PM Narendra Modi’s Viksit Bharat by 2047 — ready not merely to participate in the green maritime economy but to lead it through initiatives taken in Amrit Kaal.

The world was on the brink of a climate milestone: adopting a global carbon tax for the shipping industry. Countries had spent years crafting the plan, hoping to throttle planet-warming pollution from cargo vessels. They had every reason to think the measure would pass when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) met in mid-October.

Enter Donald Trump. After returning to the White House for a second term, the president and his top officials undertook a monthslong campaign to defeat the initiative. The US threatened tariffs, levies and visa restrictions to get its way. A battery of American diplomats and cabinet secretaries met with various nations to twist arms, according to a senior US State Department official, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly. Nations were also warned of other potential consequences if they backed the tax on shipping emissions, including imposing sanctions on individuals and blocking ships from US ports.

Under that Trump-led pressure—or intimidation, as some describe it—some countries started to waver. Ultimately, a bloc including the US, Saudi Arabia and Iran voted to adjourn the meeting for a year, killing any chance of the charge being adopted anytime soon.

The US “bullied otherwise supportive or neutral countries into turning against” the net-zero plan for shipping, says Faïg Abbasov, a director at the European advocacy group Transport & Environment. With its intense lobbying at the IMO, the Trump administration was “waging war against multilateralism, UN diplomacy and climate diplomacy.”

At first glance, it might look like the US has exited the climate fight. The president is once again pulling the US out of the Paris Agreement, and he may not send an official US delegation to next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil. But don’t be confused: America is still in the arena; it’s just fighting for the other side.

Since his return to Washington, Trump has used trade talks, tariff threats and verbal dressing-downs to encourage countries to jettison their renewable energy commitments (and buy more US oil and liquefied natural gas in the process). Just 10 months into his second term, the campaign is showing surprising success as key figures and countries increasingly buckle under the determined pressure.

Trump was elected to implement a “common sense energy agenda,” says White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers. He “will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Oil and gas supporters champion the president’s ambition. They say he’s helped reset the global conversation around climate change and given a welcome political opening to banks, corporations and other governments that wanted to back away from some sustainability targets in the face of growing electricity demand. “President Trump is sort of providing the banks, the European Union and others cover for tempering their climate ambitions,” says Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group. “He gives these countries the ability to say, ‘Hey, I’m just trying to go along with the United States here. That’s why I’m buying all this LNG.’”

But in the eyes of environmental advocates and leaders who depend on multilateralism as a means for global climate action, Trump is unfairly asserting his will on a world that’s running out of time to rein in emissions and avert the worst consequences of global warming. “They’re clearly casting a much wider net to the climate destruction than they did the first time,” says Jake Schmidt, a senior strategic director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “They have more people engaged in it, and they obviously had more time to plan for it.”

The strong-arming is happening on multiple fronts. Among the biggest is trade, where Trump has already compelled Japan, South Korea and the EU to pledge to spend on American energy and energy infrastructure. Japan, for instance, agreed to invest $550 billion on US projects, and talks are underway to steer some of that funding to a $44 billion Alaska gas pipeline and export site. South Korea has pledged roughly $100 billion in US energy purchases.

The EU, meanwhile, has vowed to spend some $750 billion buying American energy, including LNG, to secure lower tariffs on its exports to the US. Analysts have questioned whether those sales will fully materialize, since they’d require Europe to more than triple its annual energy imports from the US. But the public commitment by itself was a stunning move for a bloc that’s led the world in pushing policies to combat climate change—including by setting binding targets for slashing planet-warming pollution, establishing a “green deal” plan to shed fossil fuels and slapping a tariff on carbon-intensive imports.

Trump administration officials have seized on the US-EU trade deal to urge other changes. For instance, Energy Secretary Chris Wright is pressuring the bloc to relax curbs on the methane footprint of imported gas. The EU is already easing corporate sustainability requirements so fewer companies are compelled to limit their environmental harms, a retrenchment that came after pressure from Germany and other European stakeholders as well as the White House.

Meanwhile the US administration has been goading the International Energy Agency to shuffle its leadership and urged the IEA to reinstate forecasts that show a rosier outlook for fossil fuel demand. It has pressed multilateral development banks to prioritize fossil fuels over climate adaptation and clean energy projects when their financing of those green initiatives has become critical given widespread foreign aid cuts. And Trump himself has berated countries that aren’t falling in line. In a September speech to the United Nations General Assembly, he chided nations for setting policies around what he called the “hoax” and “con job” of climate change, warning that they can’t be “great again” without “traditional energy sources.” He’s also told UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to reject wind turbines and embrace the North Sea’s oil riches.

It’s a marked acceleration from term-one Trump. During his first four years in the White House, Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda amounted to rally cries of “drill, baby, drill” and slow steps to encourage more domestic oil and gas production. This time around, the president’s approach has global reach—and far fewer limits. And when it comes to international agreements relating to energy and climate, “the US has an interest in divide and rule, and thus breaking the potential for cooperation,” says Abby Innes, an associate professor in political economy at the London School of Economics.

Whether or not US officials attend COP30 in November, the US president’s influence will loom large. “Countries like Saudi Arabia feel emboldened by Trump to promote fossil fuels,” says Linda Kalcher, founder of the Strategic Perspectives think tank and a veteran of the annual UN climate summits. One European diplomat said the main goal now at COP30 is just to avoid being bullied.

To be sure, other countries haven’t followed the US exodus from the Paris Agreement, and the deployment of clean energy is still soaring globally. Even tax incentive phaseouts and project cancellations in the US are only slowing, not stopping, the country’s adoption of wind and solar power. And while multinational companies may be dialing down their green rhetoric, analysts say many are still quietly cleaning up their supply chains and operations to keep selling in California, Europe and other places demanding more sustainability.

And in a perverse twist for a US president who’s decried the world’s reliance on China, other nations are increasingly linking arms with Beijing as they bid for zero-emission energy tech. “When it comes to dealing with China, whether it’s countries or companies, politicians and executives tell me: ‘Better the devil that you know,’” says Ioannis Ioannou, an associate professor at the London Business School whose research focuses on sustainability and corporate social responsibility. “It offers more stability than the Trump administration.” —With Jack Wittels and John Ainger

The session began with a welcome address by Usha Padhee, IAS, Principal Secretary, Commerce & Transport Department, Government of Odisha, who emphasized the state’s growing maritime ecosystem and its alignment with India’s blue economy vision.

Manoj Ahuja, IAS, Chief Secretary, Government of Odisha, delivered the context-setting remarks, outlining the state’s policy framework, infrastructure development, and port-led growth strategy that aims to attract global investment.

The keynote address was presented by Bibhuti Bhushan Jena, Minister for Commerce & Transport and Steel & Mines, Government of Odisha. He underscored Odisha’s transformation into a modern maritime hub and detailed how port-led industrialization and green initiatives are driving inclusive growth across the coastal region.

The highlight of the session was the address by Mohan Charan Majhi, Chief Minister of Odisha, who graced the occasion as the Chief Guest.

Odisha Chief Minister during his speech at as chief guest at Odisha sate session at India Maritime Week 2025, outlined an ambitious vision for transforming the state into India’s Eastern Maritime Gateway.

Welcoming dignitaries including Manoj Ahuja (CEO), Trihaman Sharma (Deputy CEO), Usha Padhee (CEO, Banjara Parival Committee), P.L. Haranath (Chairman, Bharatiya Port Authority), and several leading industry figures, the Chief Minister extended his greetings and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to unlocking Odisha’s full maritime and industrial potential.

Highlighting the state’s rapid transformation, he recalled the “Make in Odisha Conclave 2025” as a milestone in the state’s industrial resurgence, signalling a shift from the export of raw materials to high-value, diversified trade.

The Chief Minister emphasized Odisha’s Vision Document 2036–2047, which targets the creation of a $500 billion economy by 2036 and a $1.5 trillion economy by 2047. “Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Odisha’s maritime infrastructure is being modernized at an unprecedented pace,” he said, adding that the state’s 575 km-long coastline positions it as a natural hub for India’s eastern maritime ambitions.

At the event’s central session on ‘Port-led Development Vision 2047’, he announced plans to increase Odisha’s current port capacity from 80 million tonnes to 500 million tonnes by 2070. The state’s multi-port network will include green hydrogen hubs, deep-sea ports at Avatar and Subala, a captive jetty at Jatada Mohan, and a satellite port at Bahuda with a capacity of 150 million tonnes.

A Coastal Economic Zone and a Shipbuilding Hub at Jandrapur, with an investment of ₹25,000 crore, are also under development, forming part of an $8 billion maritime infrastructure plan.

Sustainability was identified as a key pillar of growth. The Chief Minister noted that Odisha is spearheading India’s transition toward a zero-emission economy, led by projects such as the Gopalpur Green Ammonia Project—the largest of its kind in the country. Aligning with the International Maritime Organization’s 2050 net-zero goal, Odisha aims to play a defining role in global green shipping and energy ecosystems.

To strengthen institutional frameworks, the state has established the Odisha Maritime Board and rolled out the Odisha Port Policy 2025, which introduces innovative initiatives such as Maritime Spatial Planning and Boat Modernization Programs—the first of their kind in India.

He also highlighted tourism and cultural development initiatives, noting that Puri has been elevated to a Municipal Corporation and developed as a global heritage destination, while Chilika Lake is emerging as a major eco-tourism hub with growing investments in cruise tourism and water sports.

Recalling Odisha’s maritime legacy symbolized by the Bali Jatra festival in Cuttack, the Chief Minister said, “Our maritime heritage is not just history—it is a living inspiration for our future. Through modernization and innovation, we are transforming that heritage into a powerful growth engine.”

Concluding his address, he invited investors and industry leaders to partner with the state in building a prosperous, sustainable, and globally connected Odisha, reaffirming the vision of an inclusive blue economy that integrates industrial growth, renewable energy, aquaculture, and coastal tourism.

The vote of thanks was delivered by Bidhan Chandra Ray, OAS, Additional Secretary, Commerce & Transport Department, Government of Odisha, who expressed gratitude to all dignitaries, speakers, and participants for their valuable insights and collaboration.

The session featured initial remarks from Bibhuti Bhushan Jena and Hemant Sharma, IAS, Additional Chief Secretary, Industries and I&PR Department, Government of Odisha. The discussion was moderated by Usha Padhee, IAS, who also serves as Principal Secretary for Housing & Urban Development Department.

A distinguished panel of experts enriched the session with in-depth perspectives on the state’s maritime prospects. The panel comprised:

P. L. Haranadh, IRTS, Chairman, Paradip Port Authority, Government of India

Santosh Kumar Mohapatra, IAS (Retd.), Former Chairman, Paradip Port Authority and Dhamra & Vizhinjam Ports

Subrat Tripathy, President, Business Development, Adani Ports and SEZ (APSEZ)

The session underscored Odisha’s commitment to advancing port-led growth, green energy adoption, and sustainable coastal development. With its robust maritime infrastructure, policy support, and investor-friendly initiatives, Odisha is emerging as a pivotal player in India’s maritime future.

Opening the discussion, Santosh Mahapatra underscored the strategic importance of Odisha’s coastline, noting that while India has 28 states, only nine are coastal — making Odisha’s maritime development a matter of national relevance.

He compared Odisha’s coastal potential to Gujarat’s, highlighting its proximity to the northern and eastern hinterland, but cautioned that the state’s open coastline demands heavier infrastructure investment, including long channels, breakwaters, and extensive rail connectivity.

Mahapatra emphasized that minimum port viability in Odisha begins at 20–25 million tonnes, due to high fixed costs, and urged against “overambitious or technically unsound” projects.

He projected that, to meet India’s growth aspirations, Odisha’s port capacity must expand from 202 million tonnes to over 1,000 million tonnes by 2047, and recommended maintaining surplus capacity to prevent congestion.

Calling ports “generational investments,” he advocated for environmentally responsible development, greater use of inland waterways and pipelines, and flexible PPP frameworks. Mahapatra also suggested southern Odisha as an ideal location for deep-sea and petrochemical industries.

Sandeep Tripathi highlighted that “Odisha’s moment has arrived,” driven by its 575 km coastline, strong industrial base, and growing fiscal strength. He emphasized that Odisha and its neighboring states together form India’s industrial heartland, rich in coal, steel, and minerals — creating a natural cargo advantage for port expansion.

He called for integrated connectivity, proposing multi-utility economic corridors linking mineral belts with ports through a mix of road, rail, and pipelines, similar to the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Tripathi suggested developing Port-Led Industrial Ecosystems every 150 km, with sector-specific clusters — petrochemicals at Paradip, coal at Astaranga, and green ammonia and hydrogen industries at Gopalpur and Bahuda.

Outlining a blue economy framework, he urged a balance of economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social prosperity. Tripathi stressed the need to expand maritime education and training, aiming to increase Indian seafarers’ global share from 12% to 45%.

He concluded by positioning Odisha as the next major logistics and export hub, complementing Gujarat on the western coast.

Veteran maritime expert Capt. Ashok Mahapatra described shipping as the “gearbox of the global economy”, emphasizing that without it, “half the world would starve and the other half would freeze.”

He urged renewed focus on shipbuilding and repair facilities in Odisha, calling them potential game-changers for industrial growth and employment. Such investments, he noted, would stimulate ancillary industries and MSMEs, creating large-scale job opportunities.

Capt. Mahapatra advocated for an integrated ecosystem combining ports, shipbuilding, and shipping operations, supported by a dedicated Maritime Board to streamline governance and investor facilitation. He reiterated that true maritime development must drive both industrial growth and livelihoods.

The session concluded with a shared vision of positioning Odisha as a global maritime hub — driving sustainable growth, green energy integration, and inclusive prosperity across India’s eastern seaboard.",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Odisha-session-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-28 01:16:42.812204

In 2022, over 55 percent of the construction industry’s carbon emissions stemmed from cementitious materials, bricks, and metals, while glass, plastics, chemicals, and bio-based materials contributed six percent, and the remaining 37 percent arose from transport, services, machinery, and on-site activities.

Lead author Chaohui Li from Peking University summarizes: “The study shows that the construction sector now drives one-third of global CO₂ emissions, up from around 20 percent in 1995. If current trends continue, the sector can exceed the 2°C per annum carbon budget earliest by 2040.”

Projections are alarming

Based on past data, different future emission scenarios were projected. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the construction carbon footprint alone will exceed the per-annum carbon budget for the 1.5°C and 2°C goals in the next two decades, not considering other industries.

“Between 2023 and 2050, cumulative construction-related emissions are expected to reach 440 gigatons of CO₂. This is enough to consume the entire remaining global carbon budget for 1.5°C,” explains coauthor Prajal Pradhan, a professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.

The study shows a significant shift in emissions from developed to developing regions. In 1995, high-income countries produced half of construction emissions. By 2022, emissions in these economies had largely stabilized, while growth in developing regions was increasingly driven by reliance on carbon-intensive materials such as steel and cement.

At the same time, the use of bio-based materials such as timber has declined, underscoring a missed opportunity for low-carbon alternatives.

Call for a material revolution

The authors call for a global “material revolution” – a fundamental shift away from carbon-intensive building materials toward low-carbon, circular, and bio-based alternatives such as engineered timber, bamboo, and recycled composites. Their analysis shows that cementitious materials, bricks, and metals alone now account for more than half of the sector’s emissions, emphasizing the urgent need to reinvent how the world builds.

“The challenges and solutions for decarbonizing construction are not globally uniform. Tipping full supply-chain-scale changes ultimately requires structural shifts material-wise, reducing reliance on traditional materials like cement, steel, and bricks, while exploring new alternatives,” explains coauthor Jürgen Kropp from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).

The authors further argue that high-income regions should lead through innovation, circular design, and stricter regulation, while developing regions – where most new construction will occur – need targeted financial and technological support to leapfrog directly to sustainable building practices.

Without such a material transformation, the study warns, the construction sector alone could consume the entire remaining carbon budget for the 1.5°C goal in the next two decades. A coordinated global effort to scale up low-carbon materials and redesign construction systems is therefore essential to keep climate commitments within reach.

Global challenge

As the world continues to urbanize rapidly, reducing the construction sector’s environmental impact will be key to achieving sustainable and climate-resilient cities. The study provides the most comprehensive global analysis of construction emissions to date, tracking 49 countries and regions and 163 sectors between 1995 and 2022.

“Humanity has literally built itself into a corner with steel and cement,” says IIASA’s director general Hans Joachim (John) Schellnhuber.

“To meet the Paris goals, we must reinvent the very materials that shape our cities. A global material revolution rooted in circularity, innovation, and cooperation can turn the construction sector from a climate problem into a cornerstone of a sustainable and resilient future.”

The decision by the International Maritime Organization to delay the Net-Zero Framework by a year has exposed deep divisions. What should have been a coordinated global effort toward decarbonisation has resulted in paralysis at the very moment the industry needs clarity and unity.

The truth is that shipping’s path to net zero has been hampered by over-promised targets for an under-delivered infrastructure. The promise of a smooth, rapid transition simply doesn’t match what is actually happening. We are years away from having the global supply chains, bunkering networks, and safety systems required to support alternative fuels at scale. Yet the rhetoric continues as if the transformation is already underway.

Shipowners are responding with pragmatism. The order book for new vessels has slowed, particularly for ships designed for future fuels. Many owners are delaying investment decisions, opting instead to extend the life of existing fleets until the picture becomes clearer. That is not reluctance; it is realism. As one owner put it recently, “Why commit billions to technology that might change next year?”

Even classification societies are now urging caution. The CEO of ABS recently warned that the industry must make its energy transition “solid and bulletproof” before charging ahead. It’s a message the market understands. Investing in untested technologies or volatile fuel pathways without clear regulation or proven performance risks both capital and compliance.

The debate around LNG shows how complex these choices have become. Once positioned as a transitory fuel, LNG is now under scrutiny for methane leakage and questionable lifecycle emissions. Critics argue it should not even be considered a clean fuel at all, despite its endorsement by the IMO. Yet, LNG is far from disappearing. In reality, it will likely remain part of the energy mix for the next 30 or 40 years, simply because the infrastructure exists and the alternatives are not yet viable.

The same is true for heavy fuel oil and diesel. These fuels still dominate global shipping because they are reliable, available, and supported by decades of engineering expertise. Even with retrofits and efficiency measures, the majority of the world’s fleet will continue to rely on conventional fuels for decades to come.

Meanwhile, China has positioned itself as the frontrunner in methanol and ammonia fuel provision. It has built the production capacity, the engines, and the shipyards capable of delivering methanol-powered tonnage at scale. The IMO’s growing acceptance of methanol plays directly into that agenda. But outside Asia, most markets are nowhere near ready to follow.

What we’re witnessing isn’t failure, it’s the industry finding its balance. Net zero by 2050 remains an important goal, but the path to achieving it will be slower, costlier, and far more complex than the policymakers suggest. The industry needs time to understand which technologies work, how fuels will be supplied globally, and what regulations will actually stick.

At EmissionLink, we see this as a moment to think strategically and provide ship owners with clear, data-driven decarbonisation plans that balance compliance, cost, and practicality. That means understanding evolving regulations, selecting the right retrofit technologies, and mapping out fuel strategies that can adapt over time.

The next few years will not be about speed, but about smart preparation and navigating complexity. The companies that succeed will be those that take a measured approach, by analysing the market, investing in efficiency, and waiting for the right moment to act.

The reality is that the energy transition will take longer and cost more than most forecasts predict. But realism, not rhetoric, will move us forward. Between ambition and action lies a vast sea of uncertainty, and it is in navigating that space that the maritime industry will ultimately find its course.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cosco-Green-Methanol-bunkering.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 16:20:27.818241

Monday, October 27, 2025

The usually low-profile IMO (International Maritime Organization) was scheduled to make an unusually high-profile decision on October 17th. The question at hand was whether or not to adopt a “greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism” for shipping under their Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

However, on that same date, the member nations voted “to postpone for one year the adoption,” with 57 for, 49 against, and 29 abstaining. The U.S., Singapore, and Saudi Arabia led the way for a delay. Supposedly, “many developing countries” described this as “undiplomatic” “bullying.”

When it comes to so-called ‘climate action,’ the UN has a strong track record of not giving up. The IMO will probably wait and see which way the political winds blow over the next twelve months before once again pursuing their carbon tax on international shipping.

IMO asserts that the NZF pricing mechanism “has been widely mischaracterized as a global carbon tax.” The Trump administration is thankfully not buying what the IMO is selling, nor are many conservative media commentators and think tanks, whether Trump-friendly or not.

In a joint statement on October 10th by U.S. Secretaries Rubio, Wright, and Duffy: “The Administration unequivocally rejects … the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax … an unsanctioned global tax regime.”

All that is bad enough, but IMO is also at odds with President Trump’s 47 executive orders on Unleashing American Energy, Restoring Gold Standard Science, and Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance.

High-profile economist Stephen Moore penned, “The resolution is intended to advance the very ‘net zero’ carbon emissions standard…American voters have rejected.” And, “Since when are American businesses subject to international taxes imposed by the UN?”

The Wall Street Journal editorial board opined: “This is the first instance…of the UN claiming the ability to levy a tax — the revenues from which will be paid directly into a UN-controlled fund. For the UN system, as a whole, roughly 90% of revenue comes from governments.”

A report by Shuting Pomerleau of the American Action Forum outlined much of the details, like: “a two-tiered tax rate mechanism … two-tiered fuel standard divides vessels into three levels of tax liability … three ways in which shipping companies can pay[.]”

American Enterprise Institute’s Brett Schaefer also pointed out: “Over 90% of the current global fleet uses conventional fuels and cannot utilize greener alternatives. Consequently, fuel costs are projected to rise by 350% … and consumers will bear the brunt of the price.”

IMO’s scheme fits the Tax Foundation’s definition of tax, “a mandatory payment or charge collected by … governments from … businesses to cover the costs of general government … activities,” and carbon tax, “a price on [GHG] emissions to encourage … businesses … to produce less of them.”

And the IMO has not just ‘gone green’ and ‘climate alarmist’ in recent years. They have been moving in the latter direction for years, and in the former direction for decades.

IMO was established between 1948 and 1958 with “a focus on safety,” which it was until 1967. Their focus then shifted to “protecting the marine environment” from 1973 to 1978, and then since 2011 to 2015 to “tackling the climate crisis.”

In 2011, “the first set of international mandatory measures to improve ships’ energy efficiency were adopted” by the IMO, followed by their commitment in 2015 “to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts … to cut GHG emissions which cause global warming.”

IMO explicitly started to equate, or conflate, “energy efficiency” with “cut GHG emissions” in the “Initial IMO GHG Strategy” of 2018. It “envisages … a [total annual] reduction … at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 [as well as] pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely.”

The “Revised IMO GHG Strategy” of 2023 “includes indicative check-points for international shipping to reach net-zero GHG emissions for 2030 (by at least 20%, striving for 30%) and 2040 (by at least 70%, striving for 80%) compared to 2008.”

The 2023 strategy “emphasizes capacity building, technical cooperation, and research and development.” But the 2025 framework “refers to a new set of international regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships [of a] global fuel standard [and] pricing mechanism.”

A “comprehensive impact assessment” (CIA) was also considered in 2024. However, this did not include any risk analysis (RA) nor any cost-benefit assessment (CBA), unlike what is required, for example, in a Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) for use in the IMO rule-making process.

Sound CBA, that includes proper RA, is the ‘gold standard’ in economics to properly judge any proposed new tax or regulation. This is best done by using a ‘red teaming’ approach in order to try to counter the ‘bootleggers and Baptists’ within the IMO and without.

The 2024 CIA did include some elasticity analysis, but “one primary gap arises from the need for robust historical or empirical evidence within the shipping domain … the varied elasticities observed across different countries, commodities, types of vessels, and travel distances.”

As even a pro-carbon tax researcher reminds, “the reaction of producers [like international shippers] and consumers to changing prices depends on price elasticities of supply and demand … furthermore determines the incidence of carbon taxes on [them].”

IMO has been ‘captured’ by energy ‘bootleggers’ and climate ‘Baptists’ and is now part of the globalist ‘deep state.’ They have slightly delayed, but will not abandon, their grandiose climate vision for 2050.

Thus, the one-year pause on a global shipping carbon tax, to quote Rick and Morty, “just sounds like slavery with extra steps.” Therefore, one way or another, “hey ho, IMO has gotta go!”

Despite a recent decision to postpone the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) for a year, discussions have moved forward, focusing on the necessary guidelines for future implementation.

Progress Amidst Setbacks

Last week, the IMO’s decision to delay the adoption of the Net Zero Framework was met with disappointment. However, Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition, emphasized that this delay is not a defeat but rather a temporary setback. “During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted,” she stated. This indicates a strong commitment to the framework and a willingness to continue preparations for its eventual implementation.

The Net Zero Framework aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, aligning with the IMO’s broader GHG Strategy. Key components of the NZF include a global fuel standard (GFS) that mandates a gradual reduction in the pollution levels of ship fuels. This standard will also introduce a pricing mechanism for GHG emissions, incentivizing the shipping industry to adopt cleaner practices. John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO, highlighted that member states do not need to wait for the NZF to take action. He pointed out that at the upcoming MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026, there will be opportunities to enhance the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), a crucial measure for improving energy efficiency in shipping.

Future Directions and Innovations

Despite the postponement of the NZF, discussions at the ISWG meeting advanced on essential implementation guidelines. Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, noted that the framework’s success will depend on coherent guidance that promotes sustainable fuel production while preventing environmental harm. Many member states recognized the need for a balanced approach that considers both environmental impacts and social equity, as highlighted by Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. He stressed the importance of creating a fair pathway for the shipping sector to achieve its net-zero goals by 2050.

US Succeeds in Blocking Global Carbon Tax on Ships for Now

Wind propulsion technology has also gained renewed attention, with support from various countries and industry data reinforcing its potential. Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk, remarked that while the Net Zero Framework may be delayed, the momentum for implementing wind propulsion solutions remains strong. She urged governments to ensure that guidelines facilitate the widespread adoption of this technology, which can significantly reduce emissions and operational costs. Jenny Helle, an expert on decarbonization, warned against scaling back ambitions at this critical juncture, emphasizing the need for clear, enforceable guidelines that support the transition to cleaner shipping fuels and technologies.",https://nauticalvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cropped-Nautical-Voice-150x150.jpeg,N,,2025-10-28 02:17:29.342924

James Helliwell, commercial director for decarbonisation at V, said: “The IMO’s decision to delay the Net Zero Framework for a year marks a profound setback for global shipping decarbonisation.

One segment of the maritime industry which was particularly seeking clarification over the Net Zero Framework was LNG suppliers/users.
Again, SEA-LNG see the outcome of the IMO meeting in a more positive light than others.","Richard Berkling, CEO of PowerCell Group, was cautiously optimistic about the setback, he said: “The IMO’s decision at the recent extraordinary MEPC to postpone adoption of the Net Zero Framework by one year is a setback for the maritime sector, but not a defeat. The pause underscores the need for persistence and verifiable proof that zero-emission technologies are practical, competitive, and reliable in operation.”

He went on to say that during this delay its imperative that industry has to deliver tangible projects with verifiable performance data to persuade hesitant stakeholders including shipowners, fleet operators and the all important investors.

“The future will be shaped by pioneers who lead, project by project,” he added.

Others aren’t nearly as optimistic as PowerCell’s Berkling. James Helliwell, commercial director for decarbonisation at V, said: “The IMO’s decision to delay the Net Zero Framework for a year marks a profound setback for global shipping decarbonisation. The delay - and potential abandonment - of unified global measures opens the door to a patchwork of regional carbon schemes. This means shipowners may face multiple, overlapping carbon taxes for the same emissions whilst navigating inconsistent regional standards without the level playing field that IMO measures would have provided.”

I alluded to the issues of having regional regulations as opposed to a global standard but Helliwell has explained the problems the lack of an IMO framework presents succinctly.

He does imply that there are green shots of optimism despite the setback, stating: “The industry’s decarbonisation imperative hasn’t disappeared; it has simply become more complex and costly. The 2023 IMO GHG Strategy targets remain, even as the pathway to achieving them becomes increasingly unclear.”

He went on to say that given the outcome ship managers will now play an essential role in helping companies navigate what will inevitably become a more fragmented regulatory landscape. He points to his own company V.’s integrated ship management platform, which includes performance optimisation tools and decarbonisation initiatives, that will aid owners and operators in meeting what may be fragmented requirements whilst maintaining operational efficiency and commercial competitiveness.

One segment of the maritime industry which was particularly seeking clarification over the Net Zero Framework was LNG suppliers/users. The industry body representing that fuel, SEA-LNG, said it will use the delay time to work with its members and other industry organizations to continue to develop meaningful, scientific studies to support the IMO’s critical work.

Again, SEA-LNG see the outcome of the IMO meeting in a more positive light than others. It stated: “The industry will continue on the road to decarbonisation. The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonisation of the global maritime industry, as demonstrated by the rapid growth in the LNG dual-fuel fleet and new build orderbook.”

The group pointed to the work done by engine manufacturers to reduce methane slip as well as the growing availability of biomethane and gradual introduction of e-methane as evidence that LNG has a longer lifespan than those who dismiss it as a fossil fuel would suggest.

It said in a statement: “the pathway [to Net Zero] will continue to deliver meaningful reductions of greenhouse gases and local emissions to the citizens of the world.”",https://d3f3h35mrzf979.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/1/9/333619_steveessau_231248.jpeg,N,,2025-10-27 14:00:00.770381

“ABS Group is a recognized safety leader with world class capabilities in process safety, risk management and asset performance management,” Wechsler said. “This is a great foundation to build on. I am proud to lead their incredible team and support their mission to improve performance and reduce risk in a changing world.”

The leadership change follows Wiernicki’s announcement in April that he would retire at the end of 2025 after a 14-year tenure as Chairman and CEO of the American Bureau of Shipping. Under his leadership, ABS achieved substantial growth in 2024, with its fleet expanding to 300 million gross tons while maintaining a 22 percent global new order share.

Current ABS President and Chief Operating Officer John McDonald is expected to assume the role of Chairman and CEO starting January 1, 2026, pending Board of Directors approval.

During his tenure, Wiernicki navigated the organization through challenges including the pandemic, the marine and offshore industry downturn, and technology and regulatory changes. “In spite of these events, we were able to move forward with a number of strategic investments that have allowed us to become an industry recognized technology and safety leader,” Wiernicki stated.

In September, at London International Shipping Week 2025, Wiernicki underscored the human element in maritime operations. “Behind every smart ship, every digital dashboard, and every data stream, there is still a human being making critical decisions,” he said. “Investment in their training and continuous development is essential. It is not just about efficiency, it’s about dignity, safety, and long-term resilience.”

Wiernicki has been vocal about the maritime industry’s regulatory challenges, particularly regarding the IMO Net Zero Framework. “Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories,” he stated at the launch of the 2025 ABS Sustainability Outlook. “There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support. The industry needs a framework but we need one that marries ambition with reality.”

Riviera’s LNG Shipping and Terminals Conference returns to London in November 2026.","LNG remains a robust long-term pillar of energy security, offering unprecedented opportunity across the value chain, delegates at this year’s LNG Shipping and Terminals Conference heard.

Substantial and accelerated growth in LNG supply was forecast, expected to trigger the lower prices needed to stimulate new demand, particularly across emerging Asian economies. Lower LNG prices are also driving growth in the FSRU market, creating new opportunities to convert older LNG carriers into FSRU or FSU units.

The solid orderbook extending to 2028 reflects deep confidence in future demand. Fleet renewal is being driven by proactive responses to regulatory change, turning compliance mandates into strategic modernisation opportunities. Key discussions centred on how to navigate the complexities of the EU ETS, FuelEU Maritime and IMO’s Net-Zero Framework to future-proof assets.

BioLNG was recognised as the most cost-effective option for meeting immediate FuelEU requirements, providing a practical pathway to decarbonise fleets. Delegates also examined continuous emissions monitoring systems, which can deliver immediate EU ETS cost savings through more accurate data. Further optimisation is being achieved via AI and virtualisation in route and terminal operations, while wind-assisted propulsion systems, such as rotor sails, are achieving estimated fuel savings of 5–7 tonnes a day on LNG carriers.

Methane slip, which varies widely by engine type and load condition, is prompting manufacturers to guarantee engine performance and accelerate the development of abatement technologies. Solutions under consideration include converting existing engines to spark-ignited gas systems to reduce slip immediately. At the same time, concerns around LNG heavies, the heavier, long-chain hydrocarbons (C6+ compounds) present in LNG cargoes, highlighted the need to standardise testing protocols and address legal gaps in charter parties related to cargo quality. There was also considerable interest in a new approach for safer, simpler, smarter LNG transfer put forward by Trelleborg, built around tighter training, better data and smarter co-operation.

As always, the conference delivered valuable networking opportunities, including a lively drinks reception and dinner. Attendees gave high marks to the conference app, which enabled networking, access to presentations, and live participation in Q&A sessions. Some 267 questions were submitted over the two days.

On this symbolic day, the UK reminded departing delegates that the IMO stands as a testament to what nations can achieve together. The Chair, Sveinung Oftedal, closed the meeting by reminding Member States that they are united by a shared cause, rooted in expertise and mutual respect.

We have a year – time that can be used to strengthen, align, and advocate for a robust global framework. The Center will use this year to continue our support for the development of guidelines, to broaden consensus, and to maintain industry momentum toward a global framework that can provide certainty, incentives, and a just transition.

According to MMMCZCS, though the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) was not adopted, the Chair reassured delegates that real progress was made and that the next intersessional will go further still. While the decision to postpone by one year was not the outcome that was hoped for, it is far from defeat for decarbonization.

The NZF was built upon the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy, which was unanimously adopted in 2023 and was approved by an overwhelming majority back in April. The NZF remains a sound market-based policy, broadly supported by industry, that can provide the needed certainty of a single global framework, while supporting a just transition for developing countries.

In an exclusive interview to SAFETY4SEA, Kasper Møller Nielsen, Sustainability Partner at Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, emphasized that collaboration is essential to addressing the challenges of the transition.

Furthermore, developing the comprehensive guidelines necessary to implement a framework of this scale was always going to be a daunting task. The coming year provides time to make sure that these guidelines are robust and that more countries can be confident in supporting adoption. The productive intersessional discussions on guidelines following the extraordinary MEPC showed that constructive dialogue remains at the heart of the IMO.

Commitment to decarbonization will continue to shape the industry – especially with existing regional and national measures supporting the business case for sustainable investments. Postponement does not change the need to invest, experiment, learn, and begin to scale solutions that reduce emissions, MMMCZCS explained.

Over the next year, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping underlines its support IMO Member States in developing effective guidelines, provide clarity to the industry where possible, and engage in global dialogue to address concerns. The process will be challenging, but the Center remains committed to fostering collaboration among Member States and the maritime sector to enable the adoption of the NZF.

We are disappointed with the decision to postpone this crucial meeting by one year. The effects of climate change do not wait, and our dedication and work continue stronger than ever. We appreciate the leadership of many Member States in the room and stand ready to continue our work to support the IMO.

That’s not a distance problem – that’s a consistency problem. Voyage-level visibility turns those hidden differences into actionable insight for shippers and forwarders

… Eduardo Ramos, Senior Data Analyst at OceanScore, added that short-sea operations are less predictable than long-haul ones, with every delay or underutilized sailing compounding emissions and cost exposure.

Carrier consistency: The new benchmark for Scope 3 efficiency

Carrier selection therefore plays a decisive role on feeder-dominated routes. Opting for high-volume, lower-intensity operators can materially reduce Scope 3 exposure, while reliance on volatile feeders risks inflated totals.

Carriers with narrower, more stable distributions offer predictable Scope 3 outcomes, whereas those with wider spreads increase reporting uncertainty and cost pass-through risk.

“Consistency is the new benchmark,” said Smith. “You can’t control if a ship sails full or half-empty – but you can choose carriers who operate predictably and efficiently.”

Key Area Data Point Takeaway Variability 9–80 gCO₂/t-km range (10× gap) Operational consistency drives efficiency, not ship size. Feeder Impact 40–60 gCO₂/t-km vs 7–16 for larger ships Feeder volatility inflates Scope 3 totals. Delays 9.3 → 38.1 gCO₂/t-km (2-day idle) A single port delay can quadruple emissions. Carrier Performance Arkas (17.8), MSC (20.3), Maersk (19.8), CMA (24.0), X-Press (30.3), Boluda (30.1) Consistency matters more than size or distance. Utilization & Speed 70% load = 20–30% less CO₂; +1 knot = +5% CO₂ Steady utilization and speed discipline are key reduction levers for Scope 3 emissions. Reporting Accuracy EU ETS & FuelEU make averages obsolete Voyage-level data prevents cost overstatement.

OceanScore data reveals that most voyages operate between 37–67% utilization, with higher load factors strongly correlating with lower carbon intensity per tonne. CMA CGM records the highest proportion of heavily loaded voyages (52–72%), MSC shows wider variability, and Maersk maintains the most balanced performance, clustering between 57–67%.

A vessel operating at 70% utilization emits roughly 20–30% less CO₂ per tonne-kilometre than one at 50%. Across the corridor, MSC generally shows better efficiency, CMA CGM higher average intensity, and Maersk steady mid-range performance.

For shippers, benchmarking carriers by utilization supports more predictable Scope 3 reporting and lower carbon-cost exposure over time.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_2296105877-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:26.999157

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than three thousand times that of CO2 over a 20 year period.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced.
The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised.","NGOs call on ministers meeting in Stockholm to back IMO regulation on polar fuels

Ahead of next week’s session of the Nordic Council, the Clean Arctic Alliance today called on Nordic governments to adopt a resolution on polar fuels during the meeting, and together commit to support an International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulation that would require cleaner maritime fuels, which would result in lower emissions of black carbon by ships when operating in the Arctic.

The deadline for concrete proposals for such a regulation to be submitted to the thirteenth session of the IMO’s technical committee that addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13, February 2026) is December 5th.

“Ahead of a crucial meeting of the IMO next February, the Clean Arctic Alliance is calling for the Member States of the International Maritime Organization to develop and adopt a mandatory regulation which would require that only polar fuels can be used by shipping in the Arctic”, said Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisorto the Clean Arctic Alliance. “A resolution on polar fuels adopted by Nordic governments next week would send a strong message to IMO Member States that action is urgently needed to protect the Arctic from the impacts of shipping emissions.”

“Black carbon is a climate superpollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned”, said Prior. “Black carbon has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts and when near to the Arctic it settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which continue to absorb more heat. It is the loss of the planet’s reflectivity – or albedo – which is contributing to the fast pace of warming seen in the Arctic.”

“Black carbon emissions from ships burning oil-based fuels have more than doubled in the last decade, yet a simple and easy solution is to require shipping to use widely available distillate fuels with lower black carbon emissions when operating in and near to the Arctic”, said Prior.

About Black Carbon, Polar Fuels, and the Arctic

Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant, produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, with an impact more than three thousand times that of CO2 over a 20 year period. It makes up around one-fifth of international shipping’s climate impact. Not only does it contribute to warming while in the atmosphere, black carbon accelerates melting if deposited onto snow and ice – hence it has a disproportionate impact when released in and near to the Arctic.

The melting snow and ice exposes darker areas of land and water and these dark patches then absorb further heat from the sun and the reflective capacity of the planet’s polar ice caps is severely reduced. More heat in the polar systems – results in increased melting. This is the loss of the albedo effect.

Declines in sea ice extent and volume are leading to a burgeoning social and environmental crisis in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting global climate and ocean circulation. Scientists have high confidence that processesare nearing points beyond which rapid and irreversible changes on the scale of multiple human generations are possible. Scientists say it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, and research has shown that “preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.”

Black carbon also has a negative impact on human health including premature death and harmful effects on the cardiovascular system (heart, blood and blood vessels), and recent research has found black carbon particles in the body tissues of foetuses, following inhalation by pregnant mothers.

The need to reduce emissions of black carbon because of both the climate and health impacts has been long recognised. On land, considerable effort has been made to ban dirtier fuels in power stations, to install diesel particulate filters on land-based transport, and to improve the burning of dry wood – all to reduce emissions of black carbon and improve air quality. However, at sea the same efforts have not yet been made.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-Project-5-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:32.890776

The IMO’s proposed global carbon tax should be a wake-up call to the U.N.-EU attempt to impose a sweeping radical climate agenda on all countries.","The United States should take necessary action to kill off the IMO global carbon tax.

T he United States should be an international leader in the fight against energy poverty and for energy freedom.

Because, as of now, many countries are using their power through international bodies to impose their harmful, anti-energy climate agenda on countries who don’t share their ideological objectives.

This problem has recently been highlighted by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed global carbon tax on the shipping industry. Until just a few days ago the IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations, was set to impose its “Net-Zero Framework,” what is in effect a tax on carbon dioxide emissions from ships that exceed certain thresholds to be paid for by shipping companies. The IMO would have collected the revenue and then distributed it for such things as rewarding “low-emission ships” and for U.N. income redistribution schemes to “mitigate negative [climate] impacts on vulnerable States.”

This tax is especially egregious because it is a violation of the sovereignty of the U.S. and other nations. A U.N. international body would be imposing a tax on Americans, something that appears to be a first. The tax, according to the State Department, could increase global shipping costs by 10 percent or more.

It’s also yet another example of Europe and the U.N. trying to dictate the domestic climate policies of other countries. The State Department made it clear that it understood the fundamental problem this posed when it stated that the U.S. would penalize nations “that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

Fortunately, the Trump administration helped to delay a vote on the IMO tax plan for a year, but it is still looming. A tax delayed is not a tax canceled.

The IMO tax, though, is far from the only effort to impose climate policies on other countries. This past July, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, issued a nonbinding advisory opinion that reads more like a climate manifesto than an example of logical legal reasoning. It concluded that member states have a duty to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It also stated the “failure of a State to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG [Greenhouse Gas] emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that State.”

While a nonbinding opinion, there is a very real possibility that this opinion will be used in various ways to justify greenhouse gas regulation in policy contexts across the world, as well as in litigation in other jurisdictions.

Then there’s the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, which is in effect a carbon tax imposed on goods based on their carbon intensity (i.e. how much carbon dioxide is emitted during production). The EU’s reason for the tax is clear: “to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.”

Once again, here’s that “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” The EU isn’t imposing a tax based on the specific attributes of a good itself. Instead, it’s trying to use trade to influence and change the climate policies and production methods of other countries, in part to protect what remains of European industries as decarbonization bites.

It isn’t enough that EU nations have adopted harmful policies that punish energy use and increase prices for their own citizens. They need to make sure other countries hurt themselves too, including developing countries that need fossil fuels to advance the well-being of their citizens.

The world can go down a misguided path of restricting energy to address climate change. Or nations can collaborate to unleash energy, innovation, and abundance to improve the lives of individuals today while also being in a much better position to address any real environmental challenges that arise, including any connected to climate change.

The United States should certainly take whatever action is needed to kill the IMO global carbon tax as well as the climate hysteria that is engrained right now in almost all of the work of the U.N. It also shouldn’t tolerate the EU’s carbon tax on goods.

But our country can’t just be on defense, we need to be on offense, too. This requires leading nations in an effort to reject climate extremism and to help solve energy poverty by allowing countries to use energy as they deem fit to meet their own objectives.

There are around 750 million people in the world without electricity. According to the World Bank, there are about 2 billion people “without access to safely managed drinking water services.” There are also about 700 million people who live in extreme poverty, defined as surviving on less than $2.15 per day.

Developing countries have more important issues to worry about than climate change. Getting rid of affordable and reliable energy isn’t just unjustified, it is, given the struggles of so many of their people, immoral. And the need for affordable and reliable energy is certainly not limited to developing countries. It’s a necessity for all nations.

The IMO’s proposed global carbon tax should be a wake-up call to the U.N.-EU attempt to impose a sweeping radical climate agenda on all countries.",,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:45.156120

Green Shipping Corridors: the model for immediate progress Through its investment in true Green Shipping Corridors, NatPower Marine is connecting high-traffic maritime routes with clean electricity for propulsion and cold ironing, replacing fossil-fuel use both in port and on near-shore legs.
NatPower Marine believes the IMO’s delay could, paradoxically, open space for innovation and collaboration.
Redefining the Green Corridor Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.
The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”","Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have voted to delay for one year the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which would have created the world’s first truly global carbon-pricing mechanism for shipping. The decision, taken at the second extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC/ES.2) held in London from 14–17 October 2025, marks a setback for international decarbonization efforts, in favor of a status quo that benefit oil and gas producers but not shipowners, investors and ports already under pressure to meet tightening emissions targets.

The postponement leaves the sector without a formal global market framework just as regional regulation is gathering pace, from Europe’s maritime carbon pricing to new clean-port standards in Asia and North America. NatPower Marine said the outcome underlines the growing gap between political negotiation and industry action, as ports and shipping lines continue to invest in clean-energy infrastructure despite the lack of a global mechanism.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine and NatPower UK, said: “While the IMO’s postponement is disappointing, it cannot be a pause button for the industry. Shore power and near-shore electrification are proven, scalable and capable of delivering deep emissions cuts today. Every corridor we electrify removes thousands of tons of CO2, NOx and SOx from the system while improving air quality for coastal communities. The opportunity to lead is now, not in a year’s time.”

He continued: “No sector has got regulation before innovation, it has always been the other way round. Airplanes, cars, radio, Internet, AI were invented and adopted before regulation, and regulation followed the path set by innovators.

It is clear that the larger players and most innovative shipping operators and owners have already decided to go green because it is a strategic advantage and a cost cutting option in the years to come. So innovators and initiators will progress during this regulatory postponement. We at NatPower are accelerating our plan to deliver near shore electric propulsion and cold ironing in 120 locations globally.”

The potential losers of this postponement are the emerging countries that were relying on IMO global carbon pricing to finance investments. The good news is that those investments can be made with private capital, provided that their locations are included in the green corridors and routes of the initiators.

New electric fuel for ships is already benefitting from the sheer convenience and it is a low hanging fruit for decarbonization, and it is happening right now. Without waiting to choose among different alternative cleaner molecules (e-methanol, ammonia and hydrogen), the immediate opportunity is near shore electric propulsions and cold ironing.

The existing regulations in EU and China, and their ambitions to become the powerhouses of Energy Transition, are more than sufficient to trigger adoption and change.

Across Europe, Asia and the Americas, a wave of electrification projects, from single-port upgrades to full Green Corridors, is building a global network of clean maritime routes. It shows what genuine international cooperation can achieve when backed by real infrastructure and investment.

Green Shipping Corridors: the model for immediate progress

Through its investment in true Green Shipping Corridors, NatPower Marine is connecting high-traffic maritime routes with clean electricity for propulsion and cold ironing, replacing fossil-fuel use both in port and on near-shore legs. The company is planning to invest more than £3 billion to deliver 120 clean-port locations by 2030, creating an integrated global network of zero-emission maritime energy hubs.

For example, the corridor between Heysham Port and Northern Ireland, developed in partnership with Peel Ports Group, has started construction. It will eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually from Irish Sea routes and forms part of a wider £250 million UK rollout of shore-power and e-ship-charging infrastructure.

Sommadossi said: “The IMO’s delay underlines the challenge of reaching consensus at a global level. But while negotiations stall, regional regulation is accelerating, and the landscape is becoming more fragmented. The EU Emissions Trading System now prices maritime emissions, and FuelEU Maritime sets carbon-intensity limits for vessels trading in Europe. The UK is preparing to bring shipping into its own ETS, Singapore is expanding its network of green corridors, and California is already enforcing at-berth emission rules. The message is clear: decarbonization is no longer waiting for a single global mechanism, it is happening route by route, region by region.”

This patchwork of regional measures is driving urgency for practical, scalable solutions that can operate across multiple regulatory systems. As global policy tightens, the infrastructure to deliver compliance and emissions reduction is struggling to keep pace, creating both challenge and opportunity for the industry.

That urgency is echoed in new research showing the accelerating pace of green-shipping regulation and innovation worldwide.

According to the World Maritime University (WMU) and the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI) in their Global Green Shipping Development Report (2024–2025), regulatory pressure on ports and shipping is now accelerating across all major economies.

The WMU/SISI report also confirms that ports are increasingly being recognized as the key enablers of maritime decarbonization, with shore power expected to become a mandatory standard in many jurisdictions. The study highlights that “ships in ports will use more shore power or zero-carbon energy in the future” as emission requirements tighten, a view strongly echoed by NatPower Marine.

“This global trend validates our approach,” said Sommadossi. “Shore power and e-charging infrastructure are not optional extras; they are the foundation for clean shipping. Every port that plugs, in our standardized network, becomes part of the global energy transition.”

Energy integration: powering the maritime transition

To ensure clean electricity is available where and when vessels need it, NatPower Marine is supported by 20 GW of renewable generation and over 100 GWh of battery-storage capacity developed by its parent, NatPower Group. Located in strategic coastal regions, these assets deliver stable, low-cost renewable power through private-wire connections and smart Power Purchase Agreements, supporting vessel charging and port operations without burdening national grids.

This integrated approach forms what Sommadossi describes as “the backbone of a clean-shipping network,” linking renewable generation directly to maritime demand and enabling real decarbonization today.

NatPower Marine believes the IMO’s delay could, paradoxically, open space for innovation and collaboration. While waiting for a global mechanism, countries, ports and fleets can lead the way and show what success looks like by developing their own clean-energy routes, projects that cut emissions while creating industrial and economic growth.

Redefining the Green Corridor

Sommadossi said the events of the past week should also trigger a broader rethink of what constitutes a truly green shipping corridor.

“So far, most green corridors have been defined around alternative fuels and fuel-supply routes,” he said. “But that only addresses part of the challenge. A true green corridor must include the full chain of clean-energy infrastructure, from shore power and propulsion charging to renewable generation and grid integration. That is the only way to deliver zero-emission voyages from berth to berth, at an affordable cost.”

He added that NatPower Marine’s approach, combining e-ship charging, port-grid integration and large-scale battery storage, offers a practical blueprint for this next generation of corridors.

“If the past week has shown anything,” he concluded, “it is that we cannot wait for definitions and policy to catch up with reality. The future of green shipping will be built, not negotiated.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower.jpg,N,,2025-10-27 13:00:54.934057

This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.” The NZF is aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, in line with the GHG Strategy.
John Maggs, CSC’s representative at IMO, said: “IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis.
“The NZF may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick.
“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonization.","As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships (ISWG-GHG 20) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC) applauds IMO member states for rising above last week’s rancor, when the IMO decided to hold off on adoption for one year, by pushing ahead with preparations for adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

Delaine McCullough, CSC’s president, said: “While last week’s IMO decision to delay its NZF was unwelcome, let’s be clear – this is just a postponement and not the end of the NZF.

“During this week’s ISWG meeting, IMO member states have constructively engaged in preparing the guidelines that will be necessary once the NZF is adopted. This indicates broad support for the NZF and that progress can still be made on preparing for implementation.”

The NZF is aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships, in line with the GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e., how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

John Maggs, CSC’s representative at IMO, said: “IMO member states also don’t have to wait a year for the NZF to tackle shipping’s contribution to the climate crisis. At the IMO’s MEPC 84 meeting in April 2026 they will get a chance to slash GHG emissions and the cost of the energy transition by strengthening the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure.

“By transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse, the IMO and its member states can quickly get shipping climate action back on course.”

Dr Alison Shaw, IMO manager, Transport & Environment, said: “While adoption of the IMO NZF was paused last week, negotiations this week advanced on the implementation guidelines nonetheless.

“The framework’s success will hinge on strong, coherent guidance that both incentivizes long-term green e-fuel production and use, and safeguards against unsustainable fuels with uncaptured environmental impacts. Many member states acknowledged the importance of both aims, though uncertainty over the framework’s eventual adoption remained a clear backdrop to discussions.”

Andrew Dumbrille, co-founder and director, Equal Routes, said: “This week’s meeting signaled that IMO member states will inevitably need to account more comprehensively for not only potential environmental harms but also human, health, social, Indigenous Peoples’ rights and community well-being of the full well to wake marine fuels energy pathway.

“Despite the implementation delay of the IMO’s GHG framework, work continues in earnest to create a just and equitable path for the shipping sector to meet its 2050 net zero ambitions.”

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer, Seas At Risk, said: “Wind propulsion is back in the spotlight at the IMO this week, with countries voicing support and industry data strengthening the case.

“The NZF may be delayed but the work hasn’t stopped, and when adoption comes next year, implementation can be quick. Governments must now ensure that these guidelines enable a global scale up of wind propulsion: One of the few solutions that cuts fuel bills, slashes emissions and keeps shipping competitive. The technology is here, now the rules need to catch up.”

Jenny Helle, expert on decarbonization of aviation and shipping, Carbon Market Watch, said: “The global shift toward cleaner shipping fuels and technologies is already happening.

“Scaling back ambition at this critical moment would risk slowing the momentum needed to achieve meaningful progress in maritime decarbonization.

“This week, the IMO member states have shown support for the development of clear, enforceable, and science-based guidelines, robust life-cycle emissions accounting, a reward scheme for clean fuels and technologies, as well as revenue distribution to support the transition in small island developing states and least developed countries.”

The new IMO regulation, which would place a cost on bunker fuels’ GHG from 2028, is designed to reduce the price gap between conventional and sustainable fuels.
Vassilis Kikilias, Greece’s Minister of Shipping, said after the vote that the framework has “unfair treatment of LNG fuel” and would likely cause serious disruptions in global trade and lead to inflation.
In a recent study commissioned by SEA-LNG, Rystad Energy estimates the well-to-tank GHG intensity of LNG bunker at 13.9 grams of CO2e/megajoule in 2024, compared with 18.8 grams of CO2e/Mj in 2019.
But some industry participants said whether the IMO regulation is adopted or not could depend on geopolitics, rather than its content per se.","Fossil fuels could remain the preferred marine energy at the expense of low-carbon fuels, with the International Maritime Organization’s new decarbonization rules hanging in the balance, according to industry participants.

Supporters of the UN agency’s Net-Zero Framework were hoping the regulatory piece could kickstart the industry’s energy transition from conventional, oil-based fuels to methanol or ammonia with much lower greenhouse gas emissions intensity.

But IMO member states earlier this month voted to delay the framework’s adoption by a year, and those involved in the talks said its implementation could be rescheduled towards the end of this decade — if it ever occurred.

“The delay will in reality lead to a reopening of text because a revision of dates is required,” Danish Maritime Authority’s Chief Advisor Thomas Blomgren-Hansen said, as the regulation can only enter into force 16 months after adoption based on international law.

“That could lead a complete renegotiation, putting the whole deal at risk [and] delaying the transition for an even longer period,” Blomgren-Hansen said on LinkedIn.

S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates oil-based fuels made up 97% of the global bunker mix in 2024, followed by LNG at 2%.

The new IMO regulation, which would place a cost on bunker fuels’ GHG from 2028, is designed to reduce the price gap between conventional and sustainable fuels.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $483.73/metric ton in Singapore in September, compared with $579.17/mt very low sulfur fuel oil equivalent for LNG, $691.92/mtVLSFOe for B24 biobunker fuel with 24% used cooking oil methyl ester, and $1,897.44/mtVLSFOe for 100% sustainable methanol, according to the Platts bunker cost calculator.

The IMO’s decision to delay the adoption has created uncertainties among shipping and bunker companies in pursuit of a low-carbon transition, even though member states will have a chance to improve the framework’s design, many industry participants said.

“After what happened … I can understand why people don’t want to double down on net-zero fuels,” Cargill’s shipping head, Jan Dieleman, said during the Global Maritime Forum on Oct. 21.

Delayed adoption

In April, EU member states, Singapore, Brazil and some others won a 63-16 vote to approve the new rules, which still need to be adopted based on the IMO’s regulatory process.

The US, Russia, Venezuela and some Middle Eastern oil-producing countries have maintained their opposition to the framework, which they argue is attached with punitively high carbon costs, overly stringent decarbonization requirements, and harsh on transition fuel consumers.

Saudi Arabia proposed to postpone the framework’s adoption amid the deep rift, and its motion is backed by a slim majority including China, India and some major flag states like Panama and Liberia that supported it in April.

Despite an EU mandate to adopt the IMO regulation, Greece and Cyprus — two EU members that are among the world’s top shipowning nations — abstained from the postponement vote.

Vassilis Kikilias, Greece’s Minister of Shipping, said after the vote that the framework has “unfair treatment of LNG fuel” and would likely cause serious disruptions in global trade and lead to inflation.

IMO member states will continue to develop implementation guidelines to address concerns over the framework, including how the carbon revenue would be used and a lifecycle assessment methodology for GHG, according Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez.

“The framework is in place, what we need to do is to develop the guideline,” Dominguez told the GMF. “What we paused is the adoption itself, not further work.”

Classification DNV estimates LNG could be a non-compliant fuel at the turn of this decade based on the current regulatory design, but IMO member states could in theory prolong its use by setting a low default emissions factor.

“LNG just got another improvement in its relative competitiveness versus the fully green fuels,” consultancy Vespucci Maritime CEO Lars Jensen said, citing increased uncertainty over the investment case for green fuel production due to the framework’s delayed adoption.

Outlook

LNG can reduce emissions by 20%-30% compared with oil-based fuels, and its supporters said ships with LNG-capable propulsion can later switch to bio-LNG or e-LNG for deep decarbonization when the low-carbon fuels become widely available.

“The methane pathway is currently the only practical, realistic and scalable solution to the decarbonization of the global maritime industry,” according to a statement from SEA-LNG, an industry association set up to promote marine LNG with Shell and TotalEnergies among its members.

The association will work with others to “continue to develop meaningful, scientific studies to support the IMO’s critical work” in the coming year, SEA-LNG said following the postponement vote.

In a recent study commissioned by SEA-LNG, Rystad Energy estimates the well-to-tank GHG intensity of LNG bunker at 13.9 grams of CO2e/megajoule in 2024, compared with 18.8 grams of CO2e/Mj in 2019.

But some industry participants said whether the IMO regulation is adopted or not could depend on geopolitics, rather than its content per se.

His new book, Making Waves: PR strategies to transform your maritime business, will be published by Rethink Press on Amazon on November 4.

The sound of screeching breaks can be heard around the world. There can be little doubt the bruising confrontations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) earlier this month are thrusting maritime further into the mainstream and the optics are not great.

Splash reported that shipping has suffered its biggest setback in 40 years as delegates at the IMO, under pressure from the US, voted to delay the IMO Net Zero Framework for a year. A measure backed by many in the IMO six months ago is now on life support.

Maritime has hardly taken its public relations in the mainstream media seriously for decades and now there is a reckoning. Check this stinging rebuke from the Wall Street Journal: “This week we warned that a United Nations agency you’ve never heard of was about to impose the first global carbon tax—on shipping. We’re pleased to report it blinked. The whole project smacked of the taxation without representation that America was founded to resist.” Ouch.

We cannot say we did not see this coming. There were clear signs of fracturing relationships during last month’s London International Shipping Week when ABS CEO Christopher Wiernicki dropped a bombshell saying: “Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories.”

Many have warned you cannot choose to be low profile. The news can come to you. And if you have not built a reputation communicating good behaviour you cannot expect the mainstream to give you the benefit of the doubt when a story like this breaks and a schism within the sector develops.

This is now a massive public relations challenge for maritime. If the sector does not stand up for itself the vacuum will be filled by negativity and misinformation.

As we all know the decarbonisation question is incredibly difficult for our sector. And maritime must now up its game and educate the mainstream about its “emissions Everest”, setting out the immense cost to decarbonise the industry – up to $1.9trn. And further explain how difficult it is to find an alternative fuel to power ships the size of the Empire State Building with 120,000 hp engines.

Failure to get this right risks a deeper reputational backlash. Today, as is well documented within the industry, shipping is responsible for 3% of global emissions but that could rise to 18$ by 2050 as other sectors like road, rail and aerospace decarbonise much more quickly and easily leaving maritime exposed as the laggard.

In addition, maritime should now double down and highlight the billions being invested in decarbonisation and innovation. The industry can point to some seriously impressive results: between 2009 and 2019, carbon dioxide emissions fell by approximately 14%, according to Clarkson estimates, despite a roughly 40% increase in cargo volumes. Quite an achievement, and one we should be shouting from the rooftops, thanks to slow steaming and new greener technology. In comparison, emissions from road transport rose by about 20%, while those from air transport grew by around 25%.

Maritime can further point to the huge efforts it is making to tackle emissions, from wind power to retrofits deploying batteries, to greener alternative fuels, to high-tech AI routing efficiencies and weather mapping, as well as hull cleaning.

For all the trials and tribulations at the IMO, this is an incredible effort and should now be championed, not just in the maritime press but celebrated across mainstream and social media. Now in light of the crisis engulfing the IMO this campaign is needed more than ever.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMO-HQ-building-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 17:16:28.539669

Saudi Arabia had joined with the United States, pressuring the member states before Singapore tabled the adjournment to give the IMO more time.
Many had left the first session, saying the IMO was giving confusing signals and creating more problems than solutions for the industry.
Many wondered if the framework would even be adopted, or if it was the first step in its death knell.
The feeling was that the workgroup moved forward, “moving past obstruction and into real progress,” said Jamie Yates, Climate & Renewable Energy Manager for Pacific Environment.","The IMO’s International Maritime Organization’s Intersessional Working Group on Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships wrapped up a week of closed-door meetings with observers agreeing there had been progress and a promising outlook for the future. Observers said the working group had been able to rise above the rancor of the prior week’s special session of MEPC (Marine Environment Protection Committee) and get back to work on the Net-Zero Framework.

“We observed constructive participation from all parties — including those with prior concerns — which led to real progress on key technical guidelines,” said Dr. Annika Frosch, Research Fellow at UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group. “Even previously contentious topics, such as the Net Zero Fund, experienced broad and active involvement from many delegations, helping to clarify priorities like establishing the Governing Board and fundamental principles to guide the fund’s future work.”

Many others, especially in the NGO community, expressed a renewed sense of optimism at the close of the working session on Friday, October 24. Delaine McCullough of the Clear Shipping Council highlighted that it had become clear that the adjournment was “just a postponement and not the end” of the framework. Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green, noted that countries had come together to work on the supporting guidelines that will provide the much-needed clarity.

The week before, member states that had supported the Net-Zero Framework in April 2025 moved away, and became cautious, in part due to strong pressure and threats from the United States and others. Saudi Arabia had joined with the United States, pressuring the member states before Singapore tabled the adjournment to give the IMO more time.

Many had left the first session, saying the IMO was giving confusing signals and creating more problems than solutions for the industry. Many wondered if the framework would even be adopted, or if it was the first step in its death knell. Even those who believed there would be progress had to concede that the regulation was now likely not to come into force till January 1, 2029.

“Understanding what happened at the IMO in October and why is now central not just for any chance of future adoption, but for just and equitable climate action generally,” commented Dr. Tristan Smith, Professor of Energy and Transport at UCL Shipping and Oceans Research Group. “This lost momentum can be recovered, but we have taken a step closer to the abyss that is dangerous climate change.”

The working group tackled the key challenges in the framework, and while there were no formal decisions, observers are saying there was steady progress in the discussion of the details for the implementation. Hot topics included how the regulation should incentivize energy transition, how the fund should be set up, and how the lifecycle and sustainability of different fuels should be evaluated and certified. Lifecycle analysis was widely discussed, and support seemed to be emerging to support differentiating rewards for different fuels. The role of biofuels was also a key topic.

Wind propulsion was also back in the spotlight, notes Anaïs Rios, Shipping Policy Officer for Seas at Risk. The International Windship Association highlights strong momentum for wind-assisted propulsion, reporting that there are nearly 100 large vessels with wind propulsion, representing around five million DTW. They expect the fleet will roughly double in the next 12 months and that this momentum will carry into the framework discussions. Similarly, John Maggs, Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at IMO, is calling for transforming the CII into an energy efficiency powerhouse to get shipping’s climate action back on course.

Christiaan de Beukelaer, Senior Lecturer in Culture and Climate at the University of Melbourne and an IMO observer, noted that the obstructionist states in the first week opposed adoption due to a lack of detail, and the second week opposed discussing details ahead of adoption. However, “under the conciliatory guidance of Working Group Chair Sveinung Oftedahl, the vast majority of delegations in the room worked on ensuring that the IMO can deliver on its unanimously-adopted 2023 GHG Strategy through the Net-Zero Framework. This made the saboteurs sound like a broken record, which the room quietly ignored.""

The feeling was that the workgroup moved forward, “moving past obstruction and into real progress,” said Jamie Yates, Climate & Renewable Energy Manager for Pacific Environment. Natacha Stamatiou, IMO GHG Lead, Global Shipping for the Environmental Defense Fund, agreed, noting, “Luckily, this week, more voices joined the conversation, and the discussions took on a constructive and more respectful tone. It was a meaningful step toward rebuilding the confidence, transparency, and integrity we need to deliver the pollution cuts future generations deserve.”",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Navy_Govt_CoastGuard/imo-hq-flags.jpg,N,,2025-10-26 17:16:33.383808

This can be attributed to the marked increase in geopolitical risks post-2021, driven by a higher frequency of global geopolitical events (see Fig.","Global shipping, accounting for ~3% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions1, poses an urgent climate challenge in a world striving for deep decarbonization2. As the world intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), responsible for regulating global maritime transport, has continuously updated its objectives. The current goal is to achieve zero-carbon emissions by 2050, thereby deepening shipping’s contribution to climate mitigation3. However, decarbonizing global shipping faces significant challenges4. Some challenges have been widely discussed. For example, long-term projections under different scenarios for global trade reveal a 1–5-fold increase in future seaborne trade5,6. This growth implies that the shipping sector will require amounts of alternative energy, low-emission technologies, more efficient design, and upgraded port infrastructures to offset the effects of trade growth and meet the IMO 2050 goals7,8. However, the development of these alternatives remains nascent, requiring substantial investments of time and financial resources from nations to bridge the current implementation and ambition gaps9,10,11,12.

Geopolitical risks are emerging as another critical challenge to decarbonization efforts in global shipping. Geopolitical risk denotes systemic disruptions arising from interstate conflict, territorial disputes, economic sanctions, regional instability, or armed confrontation, and is commonly classified into action risks (e.g., military interventions, sanctions) and threat risks (e.g., terrorism, regional instability, and rising nationalism)13. These risks disrupt global trade flows, alter shipping routes, and affect fuel supply chains14,15,16, all of which contribute to fluctuations in maritime carbon emissions. For instance, recent geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the tensions in the South China Sea, and the Palestine-Israel conflict, have forced vessels to take longer, less efficient routes, thereby increasing carbon emissions17,18. Additionally, geopolitical crises force countries to focus on domestic and regional issues, particularly basic security concerns like energy and food. This shift in focus could lead to a slowdown in global technological development, casting doubt on future progress and investment in decarbonization technologies9. Beyond physical disruptions, more critically, geopolitical risks could influence nations’ willingness to collaborate on decarbonization initiatives, undermining collective efforts to achieve climate targets19.

Recent work examines the localized impact of geopolitical events on maritime operations and concerns about the decarbonization process20,21. Studies by Lyu et al.22, and Xu et al.23 quantified CO₂ increases from rerouted shipping lanes during the Russia–Ukraine conflict and Red Sea crisis, while Shapovalova et al.24 and Hoffart et al.25 demonstrated how sanctions, disrupted fuel corridors, and geopolitical uncertainty alter fuel procurement patterns and delay emissions reduction strategies. However, systematic analyses remain scarce regarding how geopolitical risks reshape national decarbonization commitments across diverse contexts, which is a critical gap given that policy ambition drives sectoral transitions26,27.

However, quantitatively assessing the impacts of geopolitical risks on shipping decarbonization efforts is constrained by two main obstacles: First, establishing a robust causal link requires moving beyond traditional spatial emission attribution to actor-level time-series data, which is essential for causal verification. Existing studies have primarily examined localized shipping emission shifts around major geopolitical events28,29. Although extensive Automatic Identification System (AIS)-based ship emission datasets can capture immediate changes30, they fail to establish causality and remain largely observational. Second, the delayed effects of geopolitical risks are difficult to capture, resulting in a notable gap in longitudinal and cross-national comparative studies. Geopolitical risks exert a long-term impact through structural shifts in global trade and energy markets, reshaping national decarbonization strategies such as maritime operations, fuel procurement strategies, green technology investments, and international climate cooperation31. Nations’ decarbonization efforts vary due to differing geopolitical pressures and environmental priorities, further underscoring the need for research on their evolving and heterogeneous impacts.

This study addresses these gaps by answering a research question, to what extent do geopolitical risk influence the willingness of countries to reduce emissions in the maritime sector? We constructed a dataset of 518,190,352 words from 52 countries and ten major shipping media outlets between January 2010 to April 2024. Using natural language processing (NLP), we assessed attitude shifts towards decarbonization at both general and national levels. We then employed quasi-experimental causal inference to evaluate the effects of geopolitical risks including benchmark, multi-period and heterogeneity analyses. We validated the effects by analyzing actual CO2 emissions of global vessel navigation based on the updated Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) model. The algorithmic framework and model evaluation are described in the Methods.

Our findings indicate that geopolitical risks can reduce national willingness to decarbonize, with heightened geopolitical risks contributing to the further deterioration of decarbonization attitudes. To validate this causal relationship, we analyzed global shipping carbon emissions and found that geopolitical risks escalate emissions and reshape long-term emission patterns. Moreover, the effects of geopolitical risks vary across countries. Nations with substantial maritime trade, advanced economies, and high carbon intensity are more likely to prioritize economic stability and security over environmental goals. When combined with existing research32, our results suggest that this decline in decarbonization ambition could potentially delay the IMO’s zero-carbon target by up to 50 years. In so doing, this research provides critical insights for policymakers seeking to navigate the complex intersection of climate action and international relations.

Temporal trends in attitudes towards shipping decarbonization

To examine the spatiotemporal evolution of the shipping decarbonization attitudes under varying geopolitical risks exposure, we utilized nation-level decarbonization attitude scores derived from NLP-based sentiment analysis of news text big data alongside the Geopolitical Risk Index developed by Caldara and Iacoviello13. The national decarbonization attitude score ranges from −1 to 1 and is proxied as the ratio of the total sentiment score of all text documents in that country for the year to the total sentiment score of all countries worldwide. It reflects the overall attitude of stakeholders or practitioners in the country’s shipping industry toward decarbonization goals, ranging from positive to negative or neutral, which affects the efficiency of their subsequent decarbonization actions. Figure 1a reveals a strong correlation between major geopolitical events and shifts in decarbonization attitudes. Before 2019, attitudes exhibited moderate fluctuations, reflecting a gradual alignment with climate goals. However, post-2019, geopolitical tensions increasingly overshadowed environmental priorities, underscoring the challenge of sustaining momentum amid crises. The 2022 Russia–Ukraine conflict marked a turning point, triggering a pronounced and sustained decline in attitude scores across many nations from an average of 0.707 to 0.556. Subsequent events, including the Nord Stream pipeline explosion and the Palestine–Israel conflict, further exacerbated negative trends.

Figure 1b illustrates the geographical variations of geopolitical risk and annual decarbonization attitude across selected countries. The geopolitical risk index exhibits a general increase, with a more pronounced rise in the Global North compared to the Global South. Specifically, regions such as Europe, East Asia, and North America display increases in geopolitical risk, with countries like Russia, and the United States exhibiting particularly high levels of risk escalation. This disparity underscores differing geopolitical pressures between the Global North and Global South.

The line graphs for each country reveal the temporal dynamics of national decarbonization attitudes. Key observations indicate greater volatility and frequent changes in decarbonization attitudes until 2018, likely reflecting evolving policy responses and strategic adjustments as nations established frameworks for shipping sector decarbonization. However, the shipping industry’s attitude toward decarbonization has improved since 2018. This is mainly due to two factors: the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has catalyzed relevant international green shipping policies, and green shipping investment has undergone a structural transformation. Specific instances include: the launch of the global ship financing initiative known as the “Poseidon Principles” and the active response from financial institutions; the signing of the “Clyde Bank Declaration” by 22 countries to jointly build a “green shipping corridor”; and the rapid development of green shipping finance—the issuance of the industry’s first green bond by Japanese shipowner NYK Line is a clear testament to this. Nevertheless, a discernible deceleration in decarbonization momentum is observed post-2020. This slowdown is particularly evident in several Global North countries, such as European nations and Middle Eastern states, where heightened geopolitical risks appear to coincide with a diminished commitment to decarbonization. In Europe, for instance, countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and France exhibit a decline in the growth rate of decarbonization attitudes after 2021. Similarly, Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates display a notable decline. Conversely, countries in Southeast Asia (such as Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia) display more consistent and less volatile decarbonization attitudes, with comparatively subdued changes.

Detecting the impact of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes

We quantify the causal relationship between geopolitical risk and national decarbonization attitudes using a difference-in-differences analysis with staggered treatment (staggered DID) analysis (see “Methods”). Figure 2 presents the empirical regression results and parallel trends test results. Figure 2a reports the main estimates, incorporating nation-level control variables. The coefficient of Geo_risk×Intensity is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. Specifically, the result indicates a decrease of 14.38 percentage points in decarbonization attitudes following the treatment.

Figure 2b provides support for parallel trends, the main causal assumption of DID designs, which requires that treatment and control groups follow similar outcome trends before the intervention, thereby allowing post-treatment divergence to be attributed to the causal effect. Prior to the occurrence of geopolitical risk (−1 Period), the coefficient estimates are insignificantly different from 0, indicating no significant difference between the treatment and control groups before the shocks. Following the onset of geopolitical risk, the decarbonization attitudes decrease significantly in the sample experiencing geopolitical risk, consistent with the benchmark regression results. Figure 2b further illustrates a persistent negative shift in decarbonization attitudes following major geopolitical disruption.

Figure 2c provides the detailed benchmark regression results, with all regressions controlled for country and time fixed effects. The estimates remain consistent across different controls, underscoring the detrimental effect of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes. Columns (1) to (2) show the effect of non-intensity geopolitical risk, measured as the average risk level for each country over the study period. Columns (3) to (4) examine the impact of intensity geopolitical risk, measured by multiplying the mean value by the corresponding annual geopolitical risk level. The coefficients of intensity geopolitical risk (columns 3 and 4) amplify both the significance and scale of the observed impacts, emphasizing the instantaneous impact of geopolitical risks on national decarbonization attitudes. Columns (2) and (4) include nation-level control variables to account for additional factors that may simultaneously affect a country’s decarbonization attitude. All coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level or better. Specially, the coefficients of Port development and Carbon peak are negative and significant at the 1% level, indicating that countries with higher port throughput and peak carbon dioxide emissions are more susceptible to geopolitical risks, causing them to waver their decarbonization stance. This finding provides empirical evidence for the Tragedy of the Commons in the current climate actions of the shipping sector.

Comprehensive robustness tests reinforce the reliability and validity of our findings (see Supplementary Results 2).

We also observe pronounced temporal volatility in national maritime decarbonization attitudes in Fig. 1b, which may reflect the sensitivity of sustainability commitments to evolving geopolitical dynamics. To further explore this relationship, we performed a staged regression analysis to examine how the causal relationship between geopolitical risk and national decarbonization attitudes evolves over time. We divided the time period into three distinct time spans: 2010–2013, 2014–2017, and 2018–2021. As shown in Fig. 3, geopolitical risks had no significant impact on national decarbonization attitudes in the first stage (Column 1). However, in the second and third stages (Columns 2 and 3), the coefficients of Geo_risk×Intensity are all negative and statistically significant at the 1% level, with geopolitical risks in the third stage exerting increasingly detrimental effects. This suggests that geopolitical risk has a significant impact on national decarbonization attitudes, and this impact deepened over time.

We conducted another two-stage regression analysis, excluding the initial period of 2010–2013. The remaining time period was divided into two equal spans: 2013–2018 and 2018–2023. The coefficients of Geo_risk×Intensity are consistently negative and statistically significant (Columns 4 and 5), indicating a causal relationship between geopolitical risk and diminishing national decarbonization attitudes. We observe a statistically significant relationship at the 1% level in the later stages, reflecting a stronger causal link between geopolitical risks and declining decarbonization attitudes over time. It suggests that heightened geopolitical risks substantially contribute to the deterioration of decarbonization attitudes. This can be attributed to the marked increase in geopolitical risks post-2021, driven by a higher frequency of global geopolitical events (see Fig. 1a). However, this effect diminishes in the second period, comparing −0.1591 and −0.1285. As discussed in reference to Fig. 1b, IMO has adopted a more comprehensive and frequent set of climate-responsive measures since 2018. This suggests that climate policies need to be continuously strengthened and monitored to effectively counteract external risks.

The heterogeneity in national decarbonization attitudes

Building on the benchmark and multi-period regression analyses, we proceed to examine how national decarbonization attitudes vary across countries when confronted with geopolitical risks, thereby providing a deeper understanding of heterogeneous responses. To examine these differences, we classified countries into two groups: the top 50% and the bottom 50%, which enables us to highlight the variations between nations with differing economic scales, military strengths, and cultural backgrounds in their responses to geopolitical challenges. Detailed indicator settings and regression results are provided in Supplementary Results 2.

Figure 4 illustrates the heterogeneity analysis of national decarbonization attitudes in response to geopolitical risks, highlighting how different countries are variably affected by national characteristic factors. The coefficients for almost all groups are significantly negative, revealing that increased geopolitical risk correlates with a decline in decarbonization willingness. However, the degree of this effect varies significantly across nations.

First, we examined the level of economic development, degree of openness, and carbon emission intensity to analyze the heterogeneity of national decarbonization attitudes influenced by national macroeconomic and institutional factors. The coefficients for all groups are significantly negative, with the high groups being significant at the 1% level and lower than those of the low groups. This indicates that countries with higher levels of economic development, greater openness, and higher carbon emission intensity are more likely to scale back their decarbonization ambitions in response to geopolitical risks. This trend underscores the complex relationship between economic structures, energy intensity, and climate policy willingness, especially in the context of global geopolitical volatility.

Second, we explored the heterogeneity of national decarbonization attitudes influenced by national military capabilities and social stability by examining three indicators: military expenditure (MEP), quantity of weapons purchased (QWP), and the origin of refugees (ROI). The coefficients for all groups are significantly negative. Notably, the coefficients for Low_MEP and Low_QWP show greater reductions, with average decreases of ~20.21% and 17.73%, respectively. The coefficient of High_ROI is lower than that Low_ROI, with an average decrease of ~17.17%. This indicates that countries with certain military and social stability characteristics are less prone to reduce their decarbonization ambitions in response to geopolitical risks. It suggests that countries facing greater social and political pressures prioritize maintaining social stability, potentially limiting the impact of geopolitical risks on their decarbonization commitments.

Finally, we investigated the impact of religious and cultural factors, including religious populations (RPO), power distance (PDI), and uncertainty avoidance (UAI). The findings highlight the importance of religious and cultural factors in shaping national responses to geopolitical crises, revealing that such factors can influence policy decisions in diverse and complex ways. The coefficients for RPO groups are all significantly negative, with a decrease of 18.91% for Low_RPO compared to a 14.74% decrease for High_RPO. The coefficients of Low_PDI and Low_UAI are negative and significant at the 1% level, while no significant causal effects were found in the high groups. The results indicate that cultures with more evenly distributed power and higher risk tolerance may be more adaptable in adjusting their decarbonization policies in response to external geopolitical factors. In contrast, no significant causal effects were found in the high groups of PDI and UAI, suggesting that countries with higher PDI (more hierarchical societies) and higher UAI (greater resistance to change) may be less responsive to geopolitical risks when altering their decarbonization objectives.

Verifying the association between carbon emissions and geopolitical risks

Building on our earlier findings on the evolving attitudes toward shipping decarbonization and the disruptive role of geopolitical risks, we provide empirical evidence linking these risks to actual shifts in global shipping emissions. Drawing from a comprehensive dataset of over 100,000 vessels, we quantified the impact of geopolitical crises on maritime CO₂ emissions and carbon intensity (DIST). This analysis demonstrates how geopolitical instability reshapes shipping CO2 emission patterns (see “Methods”).

Figure 5 highlights that geopolitical risks have led to an overall increase in carbon emissions, reinforcing the observed decline in decarbonization ambition. While regional conflicts, such as the Russia–Ukraine conflict (Fig. 5a) and the Nord Stream pipeline explosion (Fig. 5b), resulted in moderate emission increases, disruptions within major shipping corridors induced far greater surges in both total CO₂ emissions and carbon intensity across vessel types worldwide (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Figs. 12–17). This pattern reinforces our earlier findings that nations with high trade dependence tend to deprioritize decarbonization efforts amid geopolitical uncertainty. This is evidenced by increased emissions along key shipping corridors and a heightened reliance on carbon-intensive trade routes following geopolitical disruptions.

Specifically, the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compounded by the Nord Stream pipeline blast, triggered a 1.5% increase in global shipping CO2 emissions (Fig. 5a, b). This pattern was reflected across most major shipping chokepoints, where emissions rose by 1.4% to 15.3%, with energy transport vessels being particularly affected (detailed in Supplementary Figs. 12–17). The outbreak of the Palestine–Israel conflict led to a substantial increase in carbon emissions from vessels compelled to navigate alternative routes around the Cape of Good Hope on Pacific and Indian Ocean routes (Fig. 5c). Carbon emissions from vessels transiting the Cape of Good Hope (chokepoint 12 in Fig. 5c) increased by 61.3% over a six-month period. Notably, shipping emissions between October 2023 and April 2024 rose by 1.36 million tonnes compared to the same period in the previous year.

Concurrently, the carbon intensity indicators DIST and TIME experienced increases of 9.40% and 35.96%, respectively, reaching 28.71 tonnes CO₂ per nautical mile and 0.51 tonnes CO₂ per hour. Simultaneously, ship carbon emissions exhibit a distinct north-south divergence. Carbon emissions from vessels originating in Europe declined, whereas emissions from vessels from West Africa saw a increase. These findings reinforce our earlier analysis, which highlighted the heterogeneous nature of national decarbonization responses to geopolitical risks. While some nations intensified their reliance on carbon-intensive trade routes, evidenced by rising emissions along major shipping corridors and increased energy transport disruptions.

Natural language processing to analyze decarbonization attitudes

Assessing and quantifying the decarbonization attitudes of the global shipping sector and countries relied on seaborne trade is essential for evaluating the feasibility of current climate targets, beyond mere economic and technical assessments. To achieve this, we compiled a comprehensive dataset from the top 10 global shipping industry news websites, as well as national data from Google News and government policies from 52 countries, spanning the period from 2010 to 2024. This extensive dataset comprises 518,190,352 words. The national-level data was analyzed by categorizing publishers such as corporations, industries, and government agencies, within their respective countries. Further details on data sources, collection methods, and processing steps can be found in Supplementary Methods 1 and 2.

This study explores attitudes toward shipping decarbonization on two levels. First, by assessing the industry’s perceptions and responses to decarbonization efforts, it captures the industry’s general attitude, defined as the perceived feasibility of meeting decarbonization targets, ranging from highly negative to highly positive. Second, national attitudes and their evolution are analyzed using NLP on news data, reflecting policies, strategies, and official positions adopted by governments to address climate change and promote sustainability in shipping. National-level data is analyzed by categorizing publishers from corporations, industries, and government agencies as nested entities within their respective countries, with sentiment scores ranging from extremely negative to extremely positive.

Sentiment analysis, a widely used tool in NLP, is particularly valuable in the context of increasingly accessible online text data. It enables the examination of emotional responses to specific events and the evolution of attitudes over time. To conduct the sentiment analysis, we evaluated four NLP methods for model selection, including Lexicon-based models, machine learning, BERT-based open-source models, and transfer learning-based closed-source models. Given the complexity and emotional nuances of our text data, we ultimately chose a closed-source large language model (LLM) based on transfer learning. By designing prompts, building application programming interfaces, and leveraging the Zero-Shot task processing capability of the LLM, we enabled the model to interpret and complete specified tasks, producing the required information. Due to the complexity of the language and the subtlety of sentiment expression, we applied a transfer learning-based model for sentiment classification. This method was selected for its enhanced capacity to capture domain-specific semantic variation and to identify attitudes within nuanced discourse. Benchmarking against annotated data demonstrated an average 9.897% improvement over alternative approaches. A detailed account of model selection and comparative analysis can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Accordingly, our modeling scheme is designed as shown in Supplementary Methods 2. First, we preprocessed all texts and transformed them into a format readable by the LLM. We designed customized prompts for both global and national text data, enabling the LLM to assess their relevance to the decarbonization topic. The LLM then evaluated the decarbonization attitude of each text, categorizing them as positive (1), neutral (0), or negative (−1), and provided supporting reasons for these assessments. Finally, we generated normalized output; a sample of the output can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Next, we grouped the national text data outputs by year and country. By calculating the mean sentiment scores for each group, we captured the comprehensive decarbonization attitudes of each country in a specific year. This process yielded in a 15\(\times\)52 dataset (encompassing 15 years from 2010 to 2024 and 52 countries) along with corresponding mean scores. A detailed sample of our processing results can be found in Supplementary Methods 2.

Impact evaluation using staggered difference-in-differences analysis

(1) Model specification

To evaluate the impact of geopolitical risk on national attitudes towards emission reduction, we employed a staggered difference-in-differences model to analyze changes in national attitudes towards decarbonization before and after geopolitical risks. Details on the method selection are presented in Supplementary Methods 5. The following benchmark regression model was constructed.

$${Attitud}{e}_{{it}}={\alpha }_{0}+{\alpha }_{1}{Geo}{{\_}}{ris}{k}_{{it}}\times {Intensit}{y}_{{it}}+\gamma {Contro}{l}_{{it}}+{\mu }_{i}+{\upsilon }_{t}+{\lambda }_{{it}}$$

(1)

Where \({Attitud}{e}_{{it}}\) represents the attitude of country i towards decarbonization in year t; \({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\) represents whether country i is exposed to geopolitical risks in year t; \(Intensit{y}_{it}\) represents the geopolitical risk intensity of country i in year t; \({Contro}{l}_{{it}}\) are a set of country-level control variables to control for country characteristics. \({\mu }_{i}\) indicates individual fixed effects, \({\upsilon }_{t}\) represents time fixed effects, and \({\lambda }_{{it}}\) is a randomized perturbation term. Considering the strong correlation between decarbonization attitudes of a country in different years, we also performed country-level robust clustering standard errors. We focus on the coefficient \({\alpha }_{1}\). If \({\alpha }_{1}\) is significantly smaller than 0, it indicates that geopolitical risk substantially reduces a country’s incentives to decarbonize, potentially leading to delays in achieving decarbonization targets.

(2) Measurement of key variables and data description

The explained variable is the country’s decarbonization attitude, derived from sentiment analysis results.

The core explanatory variable in our study is geopolitical risk. When conducting the DID analysis, it is essential to divide the sample into treatment and control groups based on their exposure to policy shocks. However, geopolitical risks invariably affect all countries, making it impractical to create strictly separate treatment and control groups. To address this challenge, we constructed a policy-like experimental DID model that incorporates risk intensity. To determine whether a country is affected by geopolitical conflict (\({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\)), we calculated the mean value of the geopolitical risk index for each country during the study period. Countries with an index above the mean were assigned to the treatment group, while those below the mean were placed in the control group. Furthermore, we set the treatment intensity indicator \({Intensit}{y}_{{it}}\) as the corresponding geopolitical risk level for each year. Thus, the interaction term \({Geo\_ris}{k}_{{it}}\times {Intensit}{y}_{{it}}\) serves as the treatment effect variable.

The fundamental premise of a staggered DID model is the parallel trend assumption, which requires the treatment group (subject to geopolitical risk) and the control group (not subject to geopolitical risk) exhibit parallel trends in their changes over time prior to the onset of geopolitical risks. This study employed an event study approach for parallel trend testing, detailed in Supplementary Results 1.

We employed seven control variables to account for potential confounding factors that could influence the relationship between geopolitical risks and national attitudes toward decarbonization. Each variable was selected based on its potential impact on decarbonization efforts and its relevance to the specific context of our study. Descriptive statistics for these variables are presented in Supplementary Methods 5.

(3) Causality tests

In addition to verifying the parallel trend assumption, we conducted multiple robustness tests to ensure the validity of our results. Details of these tests can be found in Supplementary Results 2.

Test 1: placebo tests

To eliminate the possibility that the observed differences between treatment and control groups were due to time changes, we advanced the impact times of geopolitical risk by 1–8 periods and re-ran the regressions. The result showed that the coefficients of all assumed cross-terms were insignificant, indicating no systematic time trend differences between the treatment the control groups. This confirms the robustness of our benchmark regression.

Test 2: heterogeneity treatment effect test

Although our benchmark regression accounted for national-level characteristic variables, unobserved variables might still introduce estimation bias. To address this, we performed a constrained mixed placebo test using a randomized trial approach with fake treatment units and fake treatment times. The results demonstrated that all coefficients were near zero and followed a normal distribution, indicating that most regression results were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the average treatment effect was insignificant at the 1% level, confirming that our benchmark regression is robust against estimation bias due to omitted variables.

Test 3: propensity score matching (PSM) estimation

The robustness of a staggered DID also relies on the homogeneity assumption of treatment effects. If these effects vary over time or across countries, the regression results may be biased. We addressed this by testing the weights of our benchmark regression estimators. Furthermore, considering the complex entry and exit processes in our model, we adopted the counterfactual estimation method for causal inference to construct imputation estimators for regression. Both tests reported insignificant coefficients, confirming that heterogeneity bias in the treatment effects does not compromise our main conclusions.

To mitigate potential biases arising from significant differences in observable characteristic variables between the treatment and control groups before the occurrence of geopolitical risks, we employed a propensity score matching (PSM) method. This approach enabled us to identify and match control samples with observable characteristics most similar to each treatment group sample. The results showed that all coefficients remained significantly negative, demonstrating that our benchmark regression results are robust even after accounting for potential selection bias.

Test 4: variable transformations

We conducted four additional robustness tests on variable transformations. These included reconstructing the core explanatory variable, standardizing the geopolitical risk index to a range of 0 to 1, and excluding samples from periods 1 to 2 before and after the occurrence of geopolitical risks. The results showed that the core explanatory variables remained significant at the 1% level, further confirming the robustness of our benchmark results.

Bottom-up estimation of the shipping CO2 emissions

The CO2 emission inventory of shipping here is estimated using the updated STEAM. The inventory contains CO2 emissions from the main engine, auxiliary engine, and boiler of ships. We applied AIS data from January 2021 to April 2024 and updated ship technical specification data to the emission calculations. The AIS data underwent noise reduction treatment, including the removal of duplicate signal points, eliminating drifted points, etc. We corrected and interpolated missing and erroneous data in the specification information of ships using regression analysis. For more details, please refer to the Supplementary Methods 6. A global day-by-day shipping CO2 emission inventory (0.05° × 0.05°) was constructed primarily based on the following formula.

$$E={E}_{{ME}}+{E}_{{AE}}+{E}_{B}$$

(2)

$${E}_{{AE}}={P}_{{AE}}\times {\left(\frac{{V}_{{actual}}}{{V}_{{design}}}\right)}^{3}\times {T}_{v}\times E{F}_{{AE}}$$

(3)

$${E}_{{AE}}={P}_{i,{ae}}\times {T}_{v}\times E{F}_{{AE}}$$

(4)

$${E}_{B}={P}_{i,b}\times {T}_{v}\times E{F}_{B}$$

(5)

Where \(E\) represents the total emissions of the ships; \({E}_{{ME}}\), \({E}_{{AE}}\) and \({E}_{B}\) represent the emissions (g) of the main engine, the auxiliary engine, and the boiler, respectively; \({V}_{{actual}}\) is the ship’s real-time speed (knot h-1); \({V}_{{design}}\) represent the ship’s design speed (knot h-1); \(\frac{{V}_{{actual}}}{{V}_{{design}}}\) represents the load factor of the main engine of the ship according to the propeller law; \({T}_{v}\) represents the duration (h) of the ship’s voyage at the speed \({V}_{{actual}}\); \(i\) represents the four operational modes of the ship (berthing, anchoring, maneuvering, or cruising); \(E{F}_{{ME}}\), \(E{F}_{{AE}}\) and \(E{F}_{B}\) represent the emission factors (g kW-1 h-1) of the main engine, auxiliary engine, and boiler, respectively, and their reference values are given in IMO (2021).",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02852-7/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2852_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-26 08:16:28.491484

The administration also moved to pull the U.S. from discussions with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in February, ordering federal scientists to halt work on all climate assessment-related activities.

More recently, Trump and his Cabinet have taken aim at several European Union- and United Nations-backed climate-focused rules and regulations.

While EU leaders have publicly defended these policies, vowing not to roll them back completely, ramped up pressure from the Trump administration appears to have created more wiggle room in some negotiations.

The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive

Just this week, the Department of Energy sent a letter to EU officials urging the bloc to roll back the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.

This directive, set to take effect for some companies in 2027, would require those affected to provide reports on ESG effects and establish liability for ESG violations. The primary aim of the rule is to limit harm to the environment and human rights throughout EU and non-EU supply chains.

Under the current language, companies that fail to comply with the regulations will face a fine of 5% of the company’s global net turnover.

The rule has been heavily criticized by U.S.-based companies, who claim it would cause major barriers to trade between the U.S. and the EU.

“[T]he CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright wrote in the letter sent this week, which was cosigned by the Qatari government.

However, while the EU has given no indication that it plans to walk back the directive, European officials appear willing to negotiate some provisions.

Earlier this week, the European Parliament said it would further negotiate changes to the rule during a scheduled vote and hopes to finalize any amendments by the end of the year.

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

The EU is just weeks away from imposing the world’s first large-scale carbon border tariff, much to the chagrin of the Trump administration.

The bloc’s carbon border adjustment mechanism will go into effect in January 2026, with the aim of lowering greenhouse gas emissions associated with its foreign imports.

In early September, Wright said this rule would create “huge legal risks” for U.S. firms selling oil and gas across the pond, threatening trade negotiations established between the administration and the EU during the summer.

“The whole trade talks would fall apart if Europe or the U.S. don’t hold up their end of the deal,” Wright told the Financial Times. “So I think those regulations significantly threaten the ability to implement the trade deal that was agreed to.”

All members of the EU agreed to support plans to modify the carbon tariff in May by exempting any companies that import less than 50 metric tons annually of its covered goods. This change, which was adopted last month, exempts roughly 90% of importers from the carbon fee.

Deforestation ban

The Trump administration is also facing pressure from the U.S. paper and pulp industry to block the EU’s deforestation ban, set to take effect in a matter of months.

The deforestation law, first approved by the EU in June 2023, aims to reduce the number of products consumed in Europe that contribute to deforestation while also lowering carbon emissions and tackling deforestation worldwide.

Under the law, any products made from commodities such as coffee, palm oil, soy, cocoa, cattle, wood, and rubber must not have been imported from recently cleared forests and must not have contributed to forest degradation.

The law, which was delayed last year, was set to take full effect at the end of this year.

EU leaders further moved to soften the rules earlier this week, proposing delaying reporting requirements.

Under the latest proposal, the deforestation ban will still go into effect on Dec. 30, but will offer relief to small operators and larger businesses in low-risk countries, such as the U.S., by not requiring full checks and enforcement for an additional six months to one year, depending on the company’s size.

The European Commission announced it was considering delaying the entire rule by another year earlier this month — a move many liberal members of the European Parliament said was to appease Trump.

International carbon shipping tax

The Trump administration clinched a major win last week by successfully blocking a vote on a carbon tax on the global shipping industry.

The administration had for months said it would impose unfair burdens on the U.S., as it would impose a minimum tax of $100 for every ton of carbon dioxide emitted over the lowest threshold of emissions set. Those that exceed higher thresholds will be forced to pay a $380 fee.

The measure, which was included in a net-zero framework put forth by the International Maritime Organization, had appeared poised to pass.

However, the Trump administration heavily lobbied IMO members to consider punting the vote approving the tax by one year.

On Wednesday, Wright revealed that he called nearly 20 countries, saying the U.S. has “the world’s most influential megaphone by far.”

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins also said she lobbied nations such as Antigua and Jamaica, calling the administration’s efforts to block the vote “all hands on deck.”

As part of this ramped-up pressure, administration officials levied threats against nations that planned to vote in favor of the measure, including imposing tariffs, visa restrictions, and port controls.

Steve Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, told the Washington Examiner that the administration should continue to use these tactics to further push the EU on other climate-related policies.

TRUMP PREVAILS AGAINST GLOBAL SHIPPING CARBON TAX PLAN, DELAYING VOTE BY A YEAR

“We should basically say we’re out of the United Nations … that puts a lot of pressure on these countries to heed our advice,” Moore said.

“I think that Trump’s stern opposition to these climate change measures is going to force a lot of countries to realize that they’re futile,” he added.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25296747887024-e1761323471227.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-26 06:16:28.149501

Around 80% of all the goods we trade, from oil and iron ore to cars and clothing, move by sea. Every day, huge ships connect producers and consumers across continents.

In this episode of Beyond the Charts, we’re unpacking how this massive system works and how it’s changing, based on insights from the UNCTAD Review of Maritime Transport 2025. We’ll look at what’s driving global shipping today, from shifting trade routes and new technologies to the growing pressures of geopolitics and climate goals, and what all of this means for the future of trade.

Let’s start with the big picture.

Growth amid volatility

After the pandemic shock, maritime trade has bounced back, but not quite the way it used to. In 2024, global seaborne trade reached 12.7 billion tons, up 2.2% from the year before. That’s slightly above the average growth of the past decade but well below the boom years of the early 2000s. In other words, shipping recovered, but the long-term trend points to slower, more uneven growth. UNCTAD expects trade to rise by just 0.5% in 2025, essentially flat.

Why the slowdown? Global trade faces a tricky mix of headwinds: weak demand, persistent inflation, and tighter financial conditions. Even the WTO projects that overall merchandise trade will grow barely 0.1% this year.

Beyond short-term shocks, there’s a deeper story: the link between global trade and GDP is weakening. Economies are growing, but each unit of GDP now generates less cross-border trade than before. That’s why shipping volumes aren’t surging even as recoveries take hold.

And yet, volatility remains the defining feature. Think about it: trade collapsed in 2020, roared back in 2021, slowed again with the Ukraine war, energy crisis, and inflation in 2022–23, and then was disrupted once more by the Red Sea crisis. These stop-start cycles make life hard for shippers and ports, which swing between capacity crunches and quiet docks.

Here’s a fascinating detail from the UNCTAD report: in 2024, while total trade volume rose 2.2%, shipping output in ton-miles jumped nearly 6%. That means ships were sailing farther on average—a direct effect of longer detours and rerouted trade. So even modest growth in trade can mean much higher demand for shipping if supply chains stretch out. But if routes shorten again, the same ships could suddenly be in excess supply.

For now, those longer voyages are keeping ships busier and freight revenues higher. The question is, what happens when the world’s sea lanes normalize?

Geopolitics redrawing the map of trade

Not since the Suez Canal crisis of the 1960s has the geography of global shipping been this disrupted.

Geopolitical tensions and climate shocks are literally redrawing the world’s sea routes, forcing ships to take longer, costlier detours.

Take the Red Sea. It’s one of the most important arteries of global trade, linking Asia and Europe through the Suez Canal. But since late 2023, escalating conflict around the region has made it too risky for many vessels to pass through. By May 2025, traffic through the Suez Canal had dropped almost 70% from 2023 levels. Instead, ships began sailing thousands of extra miles around Africa’s southern tip—the Cape of Good Hope.

The Panama Canal has faced its own crisis, not from war, but from climate. A historic drought lowered water levels and forced authorities to restrict the number of ships passing through in 2024. Between the Red Sea and Panama disruptions, vessels were suddenly traveling much longer routes, causing massive delays and driving up costs.

The numbers tell the story. While total trade volume in 2024 grew just 2.2%, total shipping output in ton-miles jumped nearly 6%. Container ships saw an even sharper rise,

up almost 19%.

In short, the same cargo now needed more ships and more sailing time to move. That kept freight markets tight, even without a surge in trade volumes.

But there’s a trade-off. Longer voyages mean higher fuel and insurance costs, more emissions, and slower deliveries. According to UNCTAD, global shipping emissions rose 5% in 2024, partly because of these extended detours.

And it’s not just the Red Sea or Panama.

The war in Ukraine has completely reshaped energy routes. Russian oil that once flowed to Europe now travels on longer-haul voyages to Asia, while Europe imports oil from the U.S. and the Middle East instead. That “shuffle” has pushed up average voyage distances for tankers.

Meanwhile, tensions around the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 11% of world maritime trade and over a third of all seaborne oil, continue to keep the world on edge. The flare-up between Iran and Israel in mid-2025 sent tanker freight rates soaring due to rising war-risk premiums.

Even trade policy is reshaping shipping lanes.

In 2025, the U.S. introduced new tariffs and proposed port fees on certain foreign-built or -operated vessels. These measures are still evolving, but they could change how global fleets are deployed and which ports they frequent.

All this is driving a deeper shift in how supply chains are organized. Companies are diversifying production and sourcing, moving away from over-centralized models. We’re already seeing stronger export growth from Southeast Asia—countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia—as well as from India and Mexico.

ow, it’s important to separate what’s temporary from what’s structural.

Some of these detours, like the Red Sea reroutes, will probably end when security improves. But others may be here to stay. Climate-driven water shortages, like those at the Panama Canal, could become more frequent. And geopolitical rivalries aren’t going anywhere. That means global shipping might have to stay permanently more flexible, adapting to an era of shifting trade corridors.

The impact of all this isn’t shared equally.

For businesses, longer routes mean higher logistics costs and more uncertainty.

For policymakers, it highlights the need for secure trade corridors and better regional connectivity. And for consumers, it often translates into higher prices for imported goods.

But the harshest impact falls on developing countries, especially small island and landlocked nations. As UNCTAD’s foreword puts it:

“Small island developing States watch their import bills soar while their export competitiveness erodes. Landlocked developing countries sometimes pay transport costs three times the global average, and that gap widens with each disruption.”

In other words, the great rerouting of global trade isn’t just a story about ships and canals. It’s a story about how distance, politics, and climate are reshaping the cost of being connected to the world.

Container shipping: Navigating new routes and capacity shifts

If you’ve ever seen those giant ships stacked high with colorful containers, you’ve seen the workhorses of global trade.

Container shipping keeps the world’s supply chains running, moving everything from electronics to furniture to clothing in standardized steel boxes that make global trade possible.

But after a wild few years, this sector is now in the middle of a reset, adapting to new trade routes, new partnerships, and a lot of uncertainty.

Let’s start with how trade routes themselves are changing.

The big East–West corridors, connecting Asia with Europe and North America, still dominate global container traffic. But growth is shifting elsewhere. South–South trade routes like Asia–Africa, Asia–Latin America, and intra-Asia were the most dynamic in 2024. As developing economies industrialize and trade more with one another, we’re seeing more direct shipping links between these regions.

This isn’t just about new markets; it’s also about resilience. Shippers are deliberately diversifying routes and building more flexible supply chains to avoid dependence on any single chokepoint or trade lane. In other words, global trade is learning to hedge against shocks.

Now, the industry side of the story.

After the pandemic, container lines made record profits as freight rates hit historic highs. From 2021 to 2022, they went through what UNCTAD calls a “cash-flow boom.” Carriers used that windfall to order a wave of new, larger ships.

Those vessels are now being delivered just as demand growth is slowing. In 2024, total container shipping capacity jumped nearly 10%, the biggest annual increase since 2008, raising fears of too many ships chasing too little cargo. When that happens, freight rates usually fall.

And rates have indeed been swinging wildly.

The Red Sea crisis in early 2024 sent them soaring close to pandemic peaks. By the end of the year, they had cooled, but they stayed well above pre-crisis levels. Then, in the first half of 2025, they spiked again, this time because exporters rushed to ship goods ahead of possible tariff changes and amid rising geopolitical risks.

The report sums it up neatly: trade policy uncertainty, new domestic shipbuilding programs, and shifting alliances are making this one of the most volatile periods in container shipping history.

Speaking of alliances, the industry map is being redrawn.

The long-standing 2M alliance between Maersk and MSC ended in 2025. Maersk joined Hapag-Lloyd to form the new Gemini Cooperation, while ONE, HMM, and Yang Ming created the Premier Alliance.

Meanwhile, MSC, now the world’s largest carrier, has decided to go solo.

These new partnerships aim to match capacity with shifting trade flows, but they’re also causing short-term confusion for shippers about routes, schedules, and reliability.

So where does that leave the industry?

The container sector is coming down from the extreme highs of 2021–22 and entering a more balanced but uncertain phase. Fleet capacity is growing faster than trade volumes. Routes are becoming more diverse. Alliances are reshaping.

UNCTAD expects containerized trade to keep expanding, though at a slower pace than fleet growth. For businesses, that could mean lower freight costs than in the boom years, but also more volatility as carriers adjust.

Energy cargoes: fossil fuels down, gas up

The makeup of what the world ships by sea is changing—and nowhere is that more visible than in the energy trade. For decades, bulk energy cargoes like oil and coal dominated maritime shipping. Today, decarbonization goals and geopolitics are reshaping those flows, some changes temporary, others structural.

Let’s start with coal.

Despite the global shift toward cleaner energy, coal remains a heavyweight in dry bulk shipping. In fact, 2024 saw a 3.3% jump in seaborne coal trade, reaching its highest level since 1980. The main reason? Strong demand from Asia—especially China and India—and industrial stockpiling by several importers.

But as UNCTAD points out, this is a “temporary rebound” rather than a comeback. In the long run, coal’s share in maritime trade is flattening out, while gas and cleaner fuels slowly gain ground. The center of gravity has decisively moved eastward: European and North American imports are shrinking, and Asia now dominates both demand and trade routes.

That means longer voyages, for instance, coal shipments from Colombia or Russia traveling farther to reach Asian ports. Yet, even with occasional demand spikes, the broader trend is clear: a gradual decline in coal’s role as climate policies tighten over the coming decade.

Oil tells a similar story: long-term pressure from the energy transition, but short-term turbulence from geopolitics. In 2024, seaborne crude oil shipments fell by 1.5%, and refined petroleum products slipped 0.7%, extending a pattern of stagnant growth seen since 2010. But interestingly, ton-miles, which measure both cargo and distance, rose: up 1.6% for crude and 6.5% for refined products.

Why? Because the war in Ukraine and related sanctions have forced a massive reshuffling of routes. Europe has cut pipeline imports from Russia and is now buying oil from the U.S. and the Middle East, while Russia sends its barrels east to Asia.

So even though less oil is moving overall, ships are sailing much farther. Tanker markets stayed firm in 2024, not at the wild peaks of 2022–23, but still profitable thanks to those longer hauls. And new players like Brazil and Guyana are emerging as exporters, driving even more long-distance shipments to Asia.

Then there’s liquefied natural gas, or LNG, the most dynamic fossil fuel in maritime trade right now.

Often seen as a “bridge fuel” in the energy transition, LNG has become central to global energy security. In 2024, LNG trade volumes rose 1.1%, but ton-miles surged a massive 12.2%. That means much longer voyages, from Africa and the U.S. to Asia and Europe, as new export terminals came online in both regions.

UNCTAD expects this momentum to continue in 2025 as more liquefaction capacity ramps up. The LNG fleet is growing fast, with a record order book and new routes forming as the U.S. joins Qatar and Australia among the top exporters.

And beyond these fuels?

There’s already talk of hydrogen and ammonia as potential clean-energy cargoes of the future. But for now, UNCTAD notes, they’re more relevant as alternative ship fuels than as major traded commodities.

Critical minerals

For most of the 20th century, oil was the world’s “strategic commodity.” In the 21st, a new set of materials is taking that title—critical minerals. These are the metals that power clean energy and high-tech industries; think about lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and more. They’re what make electric-vehicle batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, and smartphones possible. And as demand for all these products soars, seaborne trade in these minerals has surged, turning ships into the new arteries of the green economy.

The report calls this one of the defining shifts of our time. Asia, and especially China, has become the central destination for many of these minerals because that’s where most of the processing and manufacturing happens. Meanwhile, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania are the main sources. Think copper from Chile and Peru, cobalt from the DRC, bauxite from Guinea, and nickel ore from Indonesia almost all flowing toward Asia.

But here’s the catch: production and trade are highly concentrated.

The report notes that global trade in critical minerals “remains concentrated in a handful of exporters,” which makes supply chains vulnerable to both political and logistical shocks. One striking example: in 2023, the DRC accounted for more than 80 percent of all seaborne cobalt exports. That level of dependence mirrors the old reliance on a few oil producers decades ago.

Naturally, this has set off a geopolitical scramble. Importing countries are racing to secure supply.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Critical Raw Materials Act both aim to diversify sources and expand domestic processing. On the other side, resource-rich countries are asserting more control, imposing export restrictions, as Indonesia has done for nickel, or adding local-content rules to keep more value at home.

For maritime trade, this means bigger cargo volumes and new routes. UNCTAD reports steady growth in seaborne shipments of bauxite, nickel ore, manganese ore, and copper concentrates, mostly carried by bulk carriers.

Strategically important lanes now link Africa, Latin America, and Australia with Asia’s industrial centers, above all, China. If you trace copper and cobalt flows on UNCTAD’s maps, Asia clearly sits at the heart of this new network.

Is this shift temporary? Hardly.

UNCTAD’s projections show global demand for these energy-transition minerals could nearly triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040. That means decades of expansion in mining, processing, and, crucially, shipping.

While recycling and technology might ease the pressure later, the near-term reality is clear: the ocean trade in critical minerals is entering a long-term growth phase. And just like oil once did, these materials are already reshaping alliances, with countries forging new strategic partnerships around minerals to secure their place in the clean-energy supply chain.

Decarbonizing the fleet

Even as ships carry the materials needed for the world’s green transition, the shipping industry itself faces one of its toughest challenges yet: decarbonization.

Maritime transport is incredibly efficient for moving huge amounts of cargo, but because of its sheer scale, it’s still a major emitter. Big ships burn fossil fuels, and the sector accounts for about 3% of all global emissions. UNCTAD calls this “the gap between ambition and reality”, a gap the industry now has to close.

And it’s not getting easier. In 2024, shipping emissions rose about 5%, partly because vessels had to take longer routes and sail faster to meet delivery schedules. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global fleet still runs on conventional fuels. Only 8% can currently use cleaner alternatives.

To change that, regulators are moving fast. In July 2023, member states of the International Maritime Organization adopted a climate strategy aiming for net-zero emissions from shipping by around 2050, with interim goals for 2030. Then, in April 2025, the IMO’s environment committee approved draft measures under a new Net-Zero Framework, a global system that combines technical and economic tools to drive change.

Here’s how it works:

First, a fuel standard: ships will need to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel they use over time.

Second, a pricing mechanism: ships that exceed emissions targets will have to buy “remedial units,” contributing to a new Net-Zero Fund, while cleaner ships could earn rewards. That fund would then help finance innovation, port infrastructure, and a just transition for developing countries.

So, what does a low-carbon future look like at sea?

It won’t be one single fuel or technology, but a mix. LNG is already being used as a transition fuel, making up over a third of all new ship orders in 2024. Methanol is gaining ground quickly, while ammonia and hydrogen are seen as the next generation of zero-emission fuels, though technical and safety hurdles remain. At the same time, efficiency improvements—better hull design, slow steaming, smarter routing, and even wind-assist technologies—are helping ships burn less fuel.

The orderbook shows how fast the industry is pivoting.

As of May 2025, more than half of all ships on order, about 53% by tonnage, are being built to run on alternative fuels. But this creates a “zero-carbon fuel dilemma.” Ships last 20 to 30 years, and no one knows which future fuel, be it ammonia, hydrogen, or something else, will win. That uncertainty makes it challenging for shipowners to commit today.

Existing regulations are also tightening. Since 2023, measures like the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) have forced ships to meet efficiency benchmarks. Those that don’t must either slow down or retrofit—both of which affect costs and capacity.

And if the IMO’s carbon-pricing plan is approved, operating costs will rise further for high-emission vessels, giving shipowners another reason to go green.

But going green won’t be cheap. UNCTAD estimates annual investment needs between $8 and $28 billion for new or retrofitted ships and an additional $30 to $90 billion a year for onshore infrastructure, things like green-fuel production, storage, and port refueling systems. Many older ships will likely be recycled, converted, or replaced in the coming decade as the fleet turns over.

In short, the decarbonization of shipping is no longer a distant goal; it’s a massive industrial transformation already underway. And while the road to zero-carbon seas will be long and costly, the direction is now set: global shipping is finally starting to clean up the cargo that makes the world go round.

Ports and People

Maritime trade isn’t just about ships and cargo. It’s also about the ports and the people that keep this massive system running. The last few years have stress-tested both, pushing ports to become smarter l and more efficient while also reminding the world just how vital human labor is to global trade.

Ports are where sea meets land, and they’ve been under pressure. Even in 2024, congestion was rising. UNCTAD data show that the average vessel waiting time increased from 5.2 to 6.4 hours in developed countries and from 10.2 to 10.9 hours in developing ones. Those few extra hours may not sound like much, but across thousands of ships, they ripple through the entire supply chain, adding costs and delays that businesses and consumers ultimately feel.

To fix this, ports are going digital. Tools like Maritime Single Windows and Port Community Systems are transforming how information flows—allowing ships, customs, and port authorities to exchange data electronically instead of relying on paper or siloed systems. This means faster cargo clearance, smoother vessel scheduling, and more predictable turnaround times. UNCTAD’s data even show that ports using these systems tend to score higher on logistics and trade facilitation indicators. Automation, from yard cranes to container tracking, is speeding things up even further.

But digitization brings new risks. As ports become more connected, they also become more vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cripple operations.

Then there’s the human side of the story. Ports depend on people, and the workforce itself is evolving. There’s been progress on gender diversity; in 2024, women held 39% of management and administrative roles in reporting ports. But in hands-on operational jobs like cargo handling, that figure drops to just 2%. Automation could help change that by making physically demanding roles more accessible, but it’ll take active policy support to close the gap.

At sea, the situation is even more urgent. The industry faces a growing seafarer shortage, worsened by the tough conditions exposed during the pandemic. The report highlights that protecting seafarers’ rights, fair treatment, shore leave, repatriation, and safe working conditions under the Maritime Labor Convention is essential to attract and retain skilled crews. Without them, global trade literally stops.

As automation advances and autonomous ships edge closer to reality, the kinds of maritime jobs will change. Some traditional roles may disappear, but new ones, in technology, data, and remote operations, will emerge. Managing this transition fairly, through training and upskilling, is key to keeping the system both efficient and humane.

Digitalization and human welfare now sit side by side as priorities. “Smart ports” using data, AI, and IoT are becoming the norm, enabling faster, cleaner, and more reliable trade flows. And international frameworks, from the IMO’s Facilitation Convention, which mandates digital port systems, to the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, are pushing for universal adoption, especially in developing countries that risk being left behind.

Looking ahead

Maritime trade has always been called a barometer of the global economy, sensitive to every breeze or storm. And right now, it’s sailing through both: short-term turbulence and long-term transformation.

The challenge is knowing which is which.

Structural shifts are the deep, lasting changes: a slower pace of global trade, new routes shaped by emerging markets, the reshaping of energy cargoes as the world goes green, the rise of critical minerals, and the twin revolutions of decarbonization and digitalization within shipping itself. These are the forces that will define maritime trade for decades to come. To stay ahead, shipping lines might focus on high-growth routes in the Global South, invest in dual-fuel vessels, or build expertise in moving new cargoes like critical minerals.

Meanwhile, cyclical forces, like geopolitical uncertainty, will keep testing the system. The trick is to stay resilient enough to ride out those waves without losing sight of the horizon. A port might expand and digitize, but it also needs contingency plans for sudden disruptions. A shipping company might enjoy a temporary freight spike, but if it rushes to order too many new vessels, it risks repeating an old mistake and being caught in the next downturn.

Ultimately, maritime trade isn’t just about ships or cargo; it’s about connection. It reflects how economies rise, adapt, and endure through change. If the industry can stay steady through today’s turbulence, it won’t just weather the storm; it’ll help steer global trade toward a more resilient and sustainable future.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework was designed as a key step in the United Nations’ efforts to tackle climate change by targeting one of the world’s most polluting sectors — global shipping. If adopted, the framework would have required vessels to drastically cut emissions by switching from fossil fuels to greener alternatives such as renewable energy-based fuels and wind-powered systems.

The framework also proposed a pricing system for shipping emissions, often described as a carbon levy, which would have encouraged investment in cleaner technologies while funding climate adaptation in developing nations, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) like Saint Lucia.

A sudden shift in course

The measure was expected to pass easily during the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)’s meeting in October, following months of negotiations and a breakthrough in April 2025. However, optimism faded when the United States’ White House issued a public statement on October 10, calling the proposed emissions pricing “an unsanctioned global tax regime” that would place “unfair burdens on shipping and the American people.”

The United States’ rejection of the proposal prompted immediate reactions from other major players. The European Union reiterated its support for the deal, while the IMO’s Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez urged countries to act “in good faith” and maintain a united front in combating climate change.

But behind closed doors at the IMO’s London headquarters, negotiations began to unravel. With Saudi Arabia and Russia joining the US in opposition, the once strong coalition in favour of the deal began to splinter.

In a surprise move, Saudi Arabia proposed an adjournment of the meeting for one year, effectively halting progress on the framework. The motion passed with 57 countries voting in favour, 49 opposing, and 21 abstaining.

The decision means the framework, and any formal commitment to reducing shipping emissions, will now be delayed until at least October 2026, when the committee reconvenes.

Island nations left at anchor

The postponement has significant implications for small island nations that are already facing the brunt of climate change. St. Lucia Times understands that the majority of SIDS had initially expressed support for the framework, viewing it as an important step towards securing climate financing and promoting sustainable maritime trade. However, following opposition from major economies, some island states reportedly backed away from endorsing the deal amid uncertainty over its financial implications.

Neighbouring St Vincent and the Grenadines publicly confirmed its decision not to support the proposed framework. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves argued that while his country remains committed to tackling climate change, the proposed measures could place additional strain on small, import-dependent economies.

“While we are committed to addressing climate change, international regulations must recognise the unique vulnerabilities of economies like ours,” Gonsalves said, warning that compliance penalties and increased shipping costs could ultimately “be transferred to consumers, potentially destabilising fragile economic ecosystems.”

The Bahamas and Antigua and Barbuda, both of which agreed to the deal’s terms in April, were two countries that abstained

For Saint Lucia, the government’s official position on the matter remains unclear. However, regional observers note that small island nations are often placed in difficult positions during such global negotiations. They are forced to balance their commitment to climate action with the economic realities of their dependence on maritime imports and exports.

Charting the next course

Although the NZF has been delayed, work on its technical guidelines will continue later this month when the IMO’s Intersessional Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions meets to refine the framework’s implementation strategies.

Climate policy experts say that while the adjournment represents a setback, the year-long pause could allow for renewed dialogue between developed and developing nations — provided that consensus remains the ultimate goal.

For the Caribbean, and for Saint Lucia in particular, the delay highlights a familiar challenge: the struggle to have the voices of small and climate-vulnerable nations heard in global decision-making arenas.

Oct 24, 2025 (Bloomberg) –US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum floated the concept of storing natural gas produced in Alaska’s North Slope and shipping it directly from there, a proposal he said has drawn interest from unnamed foreign investors.

“It could be a second project, just tapping into that gas field and figuring out a way to move it out by ship,” Burgum said Friday during remarks at an event held by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington nonpartisan research institute.

Shipping the gas would require the fuel to first be liquefied through an export facility, which requires billions of dollars to build. Icy North Slope conditions would most likely make it difficult to construct an export plant there, though Burgum said there are months at a time when there is a path through the ice.

The planned Alaska LNG project currently under development includes a new pipeline about 800 miles (1,288 kilometers) long that would deliver the gas from the North Slope to an export facility in Nikiski, Alaska, as well as the residential area of Anchorage, which is facing a decline in domestic gas. The plant would have a capacity of 20 million metric tons per year.

Developer Glenfarne Group is leading the Alaska LNG project. A spokesperson for Glenfarne did not immediately respond for requests for comment on the possibility of shipping gas from the North Slope directly.

The long-proposed Alaska LNG project has been pitched for decades and revived under the Trump administration. The state of Alaska has a stake in the current project along with Glenfarne, through the Alaska Gasline Development Corp.

Burgum last told reporters this week that the front-end engineering and design study for the project, including the pipeline, was still underway and could be finished by December. A formal decision to move forward with Alaska LNG has not yet been made.
