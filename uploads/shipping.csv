“We have a heavy variety of oil and we know there are three [South] Korean refineries that are tooled to be able to receive that,” Smith told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in Abu Dhabi late Nov. 2. “China clearly is another very thirsty consumer and they are looking for more products.”

India too is “another potential” primarily due to Reliance Industries Ltd’s refinery on India’s West Coast that has the capability to process heavy crude, she said.

There, they committed to aligning their operations with the Paris Agreement.
Yet even in the financial world, which is currently dumping its own low climate targets, there is no shortage of warnings about the economic consequences of climate disasters.
As Pakistani climate expert Ali T. Sheikh has commented, the climate is the first victim of militarism.
This can contribute to give new life to climate protests where Fridays for Future was interrupted by the pandemic.","A UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report released in November 2025 warns that the world is on a path to warm by approximately 2.8C this century if current policies are followed.

At a time when the world’s capitalist governments are completely preoccupied with rivalry between the imperialist superpowers, the military arms race, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, nationalism, trade wars, and a spectacularly authoritarian and anti-science development in the US, the climate issue is one of the first victims.

With Donald Trump in power, the US has done everything it can to give the climate threat the finger. Under the mantra of “drill, baby, drill,” Trump, who was supported in the presidential election by huge contributions from oil companies, has ensured that the US has left the Paris Agreement and, in his much-publicized speech to the UN General Assembly in September, declared the climate issue to be “a hoax.”

Despite the fact that 70 percent of the world’s emissions can be traced to 100 global corporations, Trump has not only opened up oil exploration in nature reserves and on the seabed. He has also abolished 31 environmental protection regulations at home and stopped the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from even reporting on emissions from the US’s largest sources of emissions. As Politico and other media outlets have reported, the Department of Energy has even been banned from using words such as “climate change,” “green,” “emissions,” “energy transition,” “sustainability,” “clean or dirty energy,” and “carbon/CO2 footprint.”

This, as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has cheerfully stated, drives “a stake through the heart of the climate change religion.”

Trump’s trade war has also secured a series of agreements on increased exports of oil and natural gas from the US, not least to Europe. Under threat of sanctions from the US and opposition from Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other oil-producing countries, a UN-led attempt to reach an international agreement on reducing emissions from global shipping within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) was halted as recently as October. This would have meant the first global tax on carbon dioxide emissions. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called this a “huge victory for the White House.”

After Trump’s frontal attack on everything related to climate policy, the banks and oil and gas companies that pretended to play along for a few years after the 2015 Paris Agreement have quickly and brutally returned to “business as usual.” Despite the International Energy Agency (IEA) stating that no new oil and gas fields can be opened if the Paris Agreement targets are to be met, there has been a significant increase in investment in fossil fuels, supported by the world’s banks. As a result, oil and gas production, led by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Norway, will continue to increase in the coming years, while the US and Canada will mainly increase natural gas production and China and India will mainly increase coal production.

Russia, for its part, is trying to circumvent sanctions by increasing exports to China and India to finance its war in Ukraine.

When American banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and the whole of Wall Street, saw which way the wind was blowing after Donald Trump’s election victory, they quickly jumped ship from the so-called Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), which was launched at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021. There, they committed to aligning their operations with the Paris Agreement. Canadian, Asian, and European banks such as HSBC, UBS, and Barclays quickly followed suit, until the NZBA was quietly shut down last month.

In the UK, where oil company BP has dumped its supposedly green ambitions, Keir Starmer’s Labour government is also expected to approve two new oil fields in the North Sea, Rosebank and Jackdaw, despite a Scottish court declaring them illegal. In Norway, where 100 new licenses have been granted in recent years, investment in oil and gas will reach a new record in 2025.

Even the major Swedish banks Nordea, SEB, and the AP7 pension fund have continued to invest heavily in new Norwegian oil. According to a review by Fair Finance Guide and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, Nordea has also removed previous restrictions on lending to particularly climate-damaging activities such as oil sands, shale oil, and exploration in the northern Arctic.

Incidentally, the Swedish oil family Lundin is a major shareholder in the oil company AkerBP, which has just discovered a huge new oil field in the Yggdrasil area of the Norwegian North Sea – according to AkerBP’s CEO, one of the largest commercial discoveries in a decade.

Although everyone knows that this paves the way for future climate disasters, investments already made and capitalism’s competition-driven profit requirements are forcing capital owners to act until the very end according to the same motto that Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince is said to have uttered in the summer of 2007, just before the subprime mortgage market blew up the financial system: “As long as the music is playing, you have to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” This is made possible by the lack of massive popular and political resistance.

Few of the world’s media outlets have even bothered to report on the UN Climate Summit 2025, held shortly after the General Assembly meeting where UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on world governments to close the yawning gap to the Paris Agreement targets at COP30 in Brazil.

Shortly before the opening of COP30, only a third of the world’s states have yet managed to present their national contributions to updated targets that should have been submitted long ago. Of those that have done so and are included in the count, the US has withdrawn.

Among those that have not yet managed to do so are the EU, which for decades has paraded as the climate leader of the capitalist world, and India. If the new climate plans submitted so far are implemented, which is unlikely, global emissions could be reduced by 17% by 2035 compared to 2019, according to a brand-new UN report.

But to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting warming to two degrees, a 60% reduction is needed. None of the UN chief’s five priority measures have made any progress that comes close to what is required.

Guterres’ call for a “supercharge” of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, in line with the COP28 statement in Dubai on a “transition away” from fossil fuels, has had almost no effect. Despite rapid development of solar, wind, and electric cars, primarily in China, which is simultaneously building many new coal-fired power plants, this is not enough to break the capitalist world’s dependence on fossil fuels. The picture is equally bleak when it comes to “drastically reducing methane emissions.”

Nor is the world anywhere near the goal of “halting deforestation by 2030,” the destruction of the largest carbon sinks in land-based ecosystems. In Europe, logging is on the rise.

There is little prospect of “climate justice” for developing countries, in the form of financial support for debt relief, contributions to the “loss and damage fund”, or climate adaptation, which will be a central issue for the world’s poor countries at COP30, since the US left the Paris Agreement and phased out USAID. Despite increasingly frequent and severe climate disasters, most recently manifested by Hurricane Melissa’s rampage in Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, aid is being cut sharply in the shadow of the arms race, even from European countries such as Germany, France, and Sweden.

“The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5C in the next few years. And that going above 1.5C has devastating consequences. Some of these devastating consequences are tipping points, be it in the Amazon, be it in Greenland, or western Antarctica or the coral reefs”, Guterres admits to the Guardian. To the Amazon-based news organization Sumaúma, he emphasizes the need for a decisive shift.

But despite the fact that, according to the European State of the Climate 2024, Europe is the fastest warming continent, with 413,000 people severely affected by storms and floods, 335 deaths and 42,000 people affected by fires, the EU is undergoing a right-wing-driven loosening of the union’s already hopelessly inadequate “Green Deal”. All to meet the demands of companies for deregulation, clearly backed by the US, and increased competitiveness.

Yet even in the financial world, which is currently dumping its own low climate targets, there is no shortage of warnings about the economic consequences of climate disasters.

“The world is rapidly approaching temperature levels where insurance companies will no longer be able to offer protection for many climate risks,” says Günther Thallinger, board member of Allianz SE, one of the world’s largest insurance companies. Without insurance, which is already being withdrawn in some places, many other financial services will become unprofitable, from mortgages to investments.

COP30 was supposed to be a particularly important stage in the annual negotiations under the UN Climate Convention, where new and enhanced national climate plans would be developed, a global framework for climate adaptation would be established, and a new fund to protect tropical forests (TFFF) would be created. But with the 1.5-degree target already shattered, the governments of poor countries in particular have shifted their focus to demands for financial support for adaptation and reconstruction after climate disasters.

But even on that point, they are likely to be disappointed. As Pakistani climate expert Ali T. Sheikh has commented, the climate is the first victim of militarism. “The axe will fall on climate finance,” he said. “It will turn the world upside down and undo 30 years of climate cooperation since the first COP.”

Where governments fail, however, the new alarm raised by scientists and the thousands of participants from climate movements and indigenous peoples, who for the first time in several years will make their way to the negotiations in the heart of the Amazon, may serve as a wake-up call after several years of closed summits in authoritarian states. This can contribute to give new life to climate protests where Fridays for Future was interrupted by the pandemic.

Clearly inspired by the Gaza flotilla, indigenous leaders from across Latin America have boarded a flotilla from the banks of the Napo River in Coca, Ecuador, bound for Belém, Brazil, with the goal of reaching the UN climate summit. According to Democracy Now, members of the so-called Yaku Mama Amazon flotilla are demanding an end to fossil fuels, protection of indigenous territories and ecosystems from oil, mining, and industrial agriculture, and a ban on fossil fuel extraction in the Amazon rainforest.

For them, it is enraging that Brazilian President Lula da Silva himself has given hypocrisy a new face by defending the permit for new oil exploration near the mouth of the Amazon River with the argument that it is necessary to finance the transition to green energy.

In the shadow of warmongering and right-wing radicalization, awareness will sooner or later grow of the need for an anti-capitalist mass movement that can unite young and old climate and peace activists, trade unions, indigenous peoples, and social movements.

More and more people will realize the need to challenge the power of banks, big business, billionaires, and warmongers over the economy in order to begin a democratically planned and fundamental transformation of both production and how we live in balance with nature. The socialist insight that we cannot control and democratically plan what we do not own together, will grow.",https://internationalsocialist.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-logo-square3-250x250-1-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:00:52.074577

In addition, disruptions in the Red Sea forced ships onto longer routes, highlighting the urgent need for stronger carbon pricing and targeted climate policies.

Record emissions, flat trade volumes

Although trade volumes have remained practically unchanged, emissions continue to rise. This indicates that ships are becoming more polluting independently of the cargo they carry. The question arises: why is the shipping sector emitting more without transporting more goods?

Container ships drive the increase

Container ships are responsible for the entire increase in EU shipping emissions, with their emissions rising by 46%. Several factors contribute to this spike:

Longer routes: Red Sea disruptions have forced container ships to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope.

Higher speeds: To maintain delivery schedules, vessels are sailing faster, which increases fuel consumption and emissions.

More ships in operation: Additional vessels are deployed to meet operational demands.

These pressures have resulted in higher emissions per container ship, emphasizing the need for policies that address operational behaviors, reward energy efficiency, and support the use of e-fuels. Only through such measures can fuel consumption be reduced without slowing down global trade.

The role of fossil fuel transport

Shipping emissions are also influenced by the type of cargo transported. A large share of Europe’s shipping emissions comes from crude oil, LNG, and other fossil fuels. Key trends include:

Fossil fuel carriers: They continue to account for around 20% of EU shipping emissions.

Crude oil: Emissions from transporting crude oil imports have returned to 2019 levels.

LNG: Shipments had been growing since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but decreased slightly in 2024.

The Netherlands, home to the Port of Rotterdam, is Europe’s largest importer of fossil fuels by sea. As Europe accelerates its green transition, companies reliant on transporting fossil fuels could face stranded assets. Importing fossil fuels keeps European shipping emissions high, highlighting the urgency of decarbonizing the energy supply.

The record emissions in 2024 show that operational pressures and fossil fuel transport are driving up EU shipping emissions. While trade volumes remain flat, the sector’s carbon footprint continues to grow.

Addressing emissions requires policies that target operational practices, support cleaner fuels, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, ensuring sustainable shipping without disrupting trade.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/shutterstock_1417504217-e1762511721414.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 09:00:56.745035

The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement” – and in many ways it is.","The International Maritime Organisation convened this October 2025 to vote on a framework that could reshape global shipping and redefine climate justice.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework, agreed upon this past April at MEPC 83, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee, represents the first legally binding global regulation to decarbonise international shipping, a sector responsible for emissions equivalent to those of major economies like Japan or Germany.

Yet, as this historic moment approaches, a critical question hangs in the balance: Will this framework deliver both the ambitious emissions reductions and the equitable transition that our planet and its most vulnerable communities desperately need?

The answer depends entirely on decisions to be made in the coming weeks and months.

Framework

The IMO Net-Zero Framework introduces an innovative two-tier system that sets increasingly stringent greenhouse gas intensity limits for ships while creating economic incentives through a carbon pricing mechanism.

Ships that fail to meet targets will incur penalties: US$100 per tonne for moderate non-compliance and a steep penalty of US$380 per tonne for those falling furthest behind.

These fees are expected to generate an estimated US$10-12 billion annually, flowing into a novel IMO Net-Zero Fund designed to support the transition.

On paper, this is groundbreaking. The framework will drive shipping toward zero-emission fuels, with modelling from University College London and UMass indicating that e-fuels (particularly green ammonia) will become the dominant solution by the mid-2040s.

Yet, here lies the framework’s central tension: while it will eventually drive the right technological outcomes, it may arrive too late for a smooth transition, risking that the world’s most vulnerable countries will bear disproportionate costs along the way.

The IMO’s own 2023 greenhouse gas strategy established two equally important objectives: reaching net-zero emissions by or around 2050 and achieving this through a “just and equitable transition”.

A United Nations Trade and Development analysis reveals that ship transport costs may increase by 80%, with broader maritime logistics costs (which would affect imports) potentially rising by 30%.

For Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), which already bear the brunt of climate impacts they did little to cause, these increases threaten food security, economic development and the basic quality of life.

The framework’s projected revenue of US$10-12 billion annually, while significant compared to other climate finance mechanisms, pales in comparison to the estimated trillion dollars of additional investment needed by 2050.

Every dollar must work extraordinarily hard to serve both decarbonisation and equity.

Beyond shipping

The IMO framework is more than a shipping policy.

It serves as a test case for global climate governance in sectors operating beyond national boundaries.

International shipping accounts for roughly 90% of global trade.

How we decarbonise it will shape economic development pathways for decades to come.

Moreover, shipping’s transition challenge mirrors that of other transport sectors but with unique complications.

A ship’s route is often unpredictable, following wherever cargo demands and therefore requiring fuel infrastructure in numerous global locations.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: ship owners will not invest in new fuel technologies without infrastructure, and infrastructure will not materialise without demand.

The solution requires parallel progress on supply and demand.

Countries with potential for renewable energy production (including many in Africa) could become major green fuel producers, but they face higher costs of capital and infrastructure deficits.

Strategic deployment of Net-Zero Fund resources could help build this infrastructure while creating economic opportunities in regions that have historically been excluded from the benefits of the energy transition.

What adoption must deliver

When IMO member states gather in October, they must adopt a framework that explicitly commits to resolving these tensions.

The adoption process should:

Affirm the dual mandate: clearly restate that just and equitable transition is coequal with emissions reduction, not subordinate to it.

Establish guardrails for guidelines: Provide clear direction that reward mechanisms must preserve adequate resources for supporting vulnerable countries, that distribution boundaries must be interpreted to address shipping’s full climate impact, and that credit trading must include safeguards against perpetuating inequity.

Commit to transparent, inclusive guideline development: The negotiations that begin immediately after adoption must meaningfully include the voices of SIDS, LDCs and civil society organisations representing vulnerable communities, not just industry and major maritime nations.

Set review mechanisms that maintain ambition: Ensure that the 2032 revision of targets for 2036-2040 incorporates both updated climate science and assessments of progress toward a just transition.

Reflection

The transition away from fossil fuels in shipping is inevitable. The only question is whether it will be orderly or chaotic, equitable or exploitative, a model for climate cooperation or another instance of the powerful protecting their interests while externalising costs onto the vulnerable.

The close of the extraordinary session of the MEPC demonstrated that the IMO has, sadly, become vulnerable to political capture.

The Net-Zero Framework, which had been approved by 64 countries in April with only 16 opposed, was deferred for one year despite having clear majority support.

The process was reportedly bent to the will of certain influential actors through threats and intimidation, rather than genuine consensus-building.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement” – and in many ways it is. But achievements are measured by outcomes, not intentions. Without clear regulatory signals, the industry will continue to procrastinate on investments in zero-emission technologies.

The deferral creates regulatory uncertainty that could delay the transition by years, making it even more challenging to meet the 2030 and 2040 targets.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.","The Commission published this morning the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan putting forward an action plan for investments in clean fuels.

European Shipowners welcome the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan as a good first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework.

STIP clearly recognises the need for more investments in clean fuels for shipping and identifies possible next steps and concrete action points. It prioritises the production of clean fuels in Europe as a matter of urgency for the transition to net zero and for reducing energy dependencies.

“We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

European Shipowners welcome STIP’s suggestion to use national ETS revenues to support the uptake of clean fuels for shipping. The EUR 9 billion generated from the contribution of shipping to the EU ETS should be used to bridge the immense price gap with clean fuels that are on average four times more expensive than conventional fuels.

STIP correctly points out that clear requirements are missing for European suppliers to make clean fuels available in the market for shipping. As a first step towards the introduction of a binding mandate on fuel suppliers, European Shipowners welcome the commitment to further incentivise the uptake of clean fuels to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime.

“STIP takes a major first step towards the use of the national ETS revenues to make clean fuels for shipping available at a competitive price. National ETS revenues have contributed substantially to the scale-up of renewables in Europe. We need to see the same happening for shipping. The use of the ETS revenues should also be matched by a binding mandate on European suppliers to make clean fuels available for shipping” Raptis added.

European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping. Therefore, European Shipowners welcome the commitment of the Commission to assess the burdensome reporting requirements for shipping companies and simplify rules.

The concept vessel, to be developed by China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) in partnership with the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), will feature a next-generation reactor designed to deliver zero-emission propulsion with extended operational endurance. According to early design reports from Shanghai Merchant Ship Design & Research Institute (SDARI), the ship will operate without the need for conventional bunker fuels, relying entirely on a closed-loop thorium MSR system expected to generate several hundred megawatts of thermal energy.

Project sources suggest the design phase will be completed in 2026, with construction potentially commencing towards the end of this decade at a CSSC-affiliated yard. If realised, it could become the world’s first container vessel powered by thorium molten salt technology—a breakthrough long championed by Chinese nuclear engineers for its safety, efficiency, and scalability advantages over traditional uranium reactors.

Chinese authorities have reportedly greenlit preliminary safety assessments for the project, though international regulatory hurdles remain significant. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has yet to finalise specific frameworks for the operation of nuclear-powered merchant vessels.

State-run Jiangnan Shipyard unveiled a design for a 24,000 teu ship incorporating molten salt reactor technology (pictured) at the last edition of the Marintec China exhibition two years ago, a show due to return next month.

China State Shipbuilding Corp’s (CSSC) Jiangnan Shipyards unveiled the initial 24,000-TEU box ship design at the Marintec China maritime exhibition in Shanghai in December 2023.

The original 24,000-TEU box ship design has become smaller, at 14,000 TEU, according to the latest reports from the Chinese press.

English-language paper the South China Morning Post noted, “What makes this ship truly groundbreaking is that it will be powered by a thorium-based molten salt reactor (MSR) with a thermal output of 200 MW – matching the power level of the S6W pressurised water reactor used in the US Navy’s most advanced Seawolf-class nuclear attack submarines.”

Thorium, an abundant, naturally occurring metal is a clean, efficient fuel with extraordinary energy density. One tonne of it produces the same energy as 3.5M tonnes of coal. Its byproducts are significantly safer than uranium (in that plutonium is not produced under fission) and, with shorter half-lives, degrade far faster. It does not need to be enriched and is not difficult to access. It is also a completely zero-emissions fuel, and reports have shown that China has large reserves of thorium.

“The ultra-large nuclear container ship is designed to truly achieve zero emissions during the ship’s operating cycle,” China State Shipbuilding Corp said on Weibo, back in 2023 when the project was first announced.

Proponents of MSRs say the reactors are safe, efficient and operationally proven solutions. They work by dissolving thorium in liquid salt. The ensuing chain reaction heats the salt, producing steam to drive a turbine and create electricity. Although developments of MSRs on land are well documented, its potential for delivering clean maritime power is still untested in real-world scenarios.

Speaking about the suitability of thorium MSRs as an energy source for maritime applications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology professor Jan Emblemsvåg, an expert in the field of thorium and nuclear power generation, noted, “MSRs have enormous potential for enabling clean shipping. There is so much uncertainty over future fuels, but here we have an abundant energy source that, with the right approach, can be safe, much more efficient, cheaper, and with a smaller environmental footprint than any existing alternative. From my perspective I see this as the most viable, and potentially the only credible solution for a zero-emissions fleet that can operate under commercial terms and cost levels.""",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/156/maritime-china-weibo_Main.png,N,,2025-11-06 20:56:15.888895

Carriers and shippers must prepare for overlapping compliance obligations that will fundamentally reshape maritime operations, say the authors of a report from emissions tracking firm, VesselBot, titled ""Decoding Maritime Emissions, Q3 2025: Containership Emissions and Traffic on the Rise.""

The study analysed 73,353 containership voyages completed by 4,750 vessels between July and September 2025, examining maritime performance across multiple dimensions — vessel size, age, shipbuilding origin, and specific trade.

Key findings include that there is stabilization in emission despite traffic growth. Total containership emissions reached 50.3 million tons in Q3 2025, remaining virtually unchanged (-0.2%) compared to Q3 2024 despite a 2.3% increase in voyages. Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

However, well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for Feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for Very Large Container Ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while VLCS completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km, which reflects their significantly higher efficiency levels.

Further, analysis of route-specific performance variations demonstrates the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days. In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days, highlighting how aggregate metrics obscure critical operational differences.

""The regulatory landscape is growing more complex rather than simplified, as evidenced by the European Parliament rejection of the Omnibus simplification effort, and the IMO's postponement of the Net-Zero Framework,"" noted C. Komodromos, CEO & Founder of VesselBot. ""With CBAM certification requirements beginning in weeks and Scope 3 reporting deadlines approaching, maritime stakeholders require granular, real-time data to navigate diverging compliance requirements across multiple jurisdictions. Industry averages fail to capture the significant performance variations between vessel sizes, ages, and routes that directly impact both compliance costs and operational efficiency.""

“Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible,” Antonio Guterres told delegates. “Failure to contain global heating amounts to moral failure and deadly negligence.”

1.5°C Goal Under Threat

Guterres cautioned that humanity is on course to temporarily exceed the 1.5-degree threshold by the early 2030s, citing decades of denial and inaction. “Even a temporary overshoot will unleash far greater destruction and costs for every nation,” he said, calling for a “fundamental paradigm shift” to limit the overshoot’s magnitude and duration.

Warming Trends at Record Levels

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that greenhouse gas concentrations have reached their highest levels in 800,000 years. WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo reported that from January to August 2025, the Earth’s average temperature was 1.42 degrees above pre-industrial levels, with ocean temperatures also hitting record highs.

The State of the Global Climate Update 2025 issued by WMO projects that 2025 will rank among the two or three warmest years ever recorded. The period from 2015 to 2025 will also be the hottest 11-year span since records began 176 years ago.

Climate Impacts Accelerating

The WMO report details a cascade of worsening climate impacts. Arctic sea ice hit a record low for winter coverage, while Antarctic sea ice remained well below average. Global sea levels are rising nearly twice as fast as in the 1990s, driven by ocean heating and ice melt.

Extreme weather events – from deadly floods and hurricanes to prolonged heatwaves and wildfires – continue to disrupt food systems, displace communities, and strain economies, particularly in developing nations.

‘A Red Line for Humanity’

Reaffirming the urgency of the moment, Guterres described the 1.5°C limit as “a red line for humanity.” He called on countries to accelerate emissions reductions, phase out fossil fuels, and strengthen protections for forests and oceans.

He noted that the clean energy transition is gaining momentum, with global renewable energy investments now exceeding those in fossil fuels by 800 billion dollars. “Clean energy is winning in price, performance, and potential – but what is still missing is political courage,” he said.

The IMO has delayed the Net-Zero Framework. The Red Sea crisis caused a 14% rise in 2024 shipping emissions as vessels rerouted around Africa. Carbon performance is beginning to improve, with carriers investing in LNG-powered vessels to reduce emissions and advance sustainability.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has announced that members have agreed to adjourn the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), originally convened for 14-17 October 2025, to consider the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

According to the latest IMO statement, the session will reconvene in 12 months’ time. In the interim, Member States will continue working toward building consensus on the proposed Net-Zero Framework.

Approved during MEPC 83 in April 2025, the IMO Net-Zero Framework is set to form a new Chapter 5 of the Draft Revised Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The framework establishes a comprehensive regulatory package designed to align the shipping industry with the IMO’s 2023 Strategy on the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Ships.

It consists of two core elements:

a global fuel standard

a global GHG emissions pricing mechanism

Progress Slows as Red Sea Crisis Drives Emissions Up

While discussions on the IMO Net-Zero Framework are set to resume next year, major ocean carriers have already made significant strides toward decarbonisation. However, geopolitical instability in the Red Sea has derailed some of this progress.

Global container shipping emissions rose by 14% in 2024, reaching 240.6 million tonnes of CO₂ and surpassing the previous record of 218.5 million tonnes in 2021.

According to Emily Stausbøll, Senior Analyst at Xeneta, this spike should not be viewed as a failure of the shipping industry. Instead, it reflects the operational impact of vessels rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope after the escalation of conflict in the Red Sea in December 2023.

“A new record high is the inevitable outcome of these diversions — both due to increased transport work and the surge in demand for laden containers in 2024, as shippers frontloaded imports in response to the Red Sea crisis,” Stausbøll explained.

Indeed, overall transport work — measured as tonnes of cargo multiplied by nautical miles sailed — rose by 18% in 2024.

Emissions Trend Turns Positive as Index Falls Below 100

Despite the ongoing crisis, recent data from Xeneta and Marine Benchmark suggest that ocean container shipping’s carbon performance is beginning to improve. The Carbon Emissions Index (CEI), which tracks emissions across Xeneta’s 13 major global trades, fell below 100 points for the first time in 12 months, registering 97.4 in Q2 2025.

This represents a 4.5% decline from Q1 2025 and a 7% drop from Q4 2024, when the index peaked at a record 104.8.

Source: Xeneta

The Q2 2025 score marks two consecutive quarters of improvement, signalling a positive trend in emissions reduction. Although the index remains slightly above the 96 points recorded in Q2 2024, it is only 1.5% higher than the Q2 2023 level (95.9) — a period before the Red Sea conflict significantly disrupted trade routes.

This narrow gap, despite continued diversions around the Cape of Good Hope, indicates that a resolution to the conflict could yield a substantial decline in global maritime emissions, potentially pushing performance well below 2023 levels.

LNG-Powered Fleet Expansion Gains Momentum

One of the most significant developments in the pursuit of more environmentally friendly shipping is the increasing deployment of greener vessels across global trade routes. Major and niche ocean carriers alike are continually expanding and upgrading their dual-fuel LNG container-ship fleets to reduce emissions and advance sustainable maritime transport.

In a notable recent move, CMA CGM has signed a Letter of Intent for the construction of six new 1,700 TEU dual-fuel LNG-powered containerships to be built in India. With this agreement, the French shipping group becomes the first major international container carrier to commission LNG-powered vessels from Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL).

“The newbuilds demonstrate CMA CGM’s commitment to more sustainable shipping, as they can run on LNG and are ready for low-carbon fuels, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the Group’s ambition to be Net Zero Carbon by 2050,” the Marseille-based carrier said in a statement.",https://webapi.czapp.com/api/v1/attachments/6e70dd63-c4fe-46f5-aa0b-354fb383aeb5.png,N,,2025-11-06 13:59:59.138425

""The STIP - underlined the Secretary General of the association, Sotiris Raptis - is investing in Clean fuels at the heart of the competitiveness agenda.
In addition, European Shipowners welcomed the proposal STIP to use the national revenues of the EU ETS, the Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading System to support the adoption of clean fuels for maritime transport.
""The use of ETS revenues - specified Raptis - should also be accompanied by a binding mandate for European suppliers to make clean fuels available for maritime transport"".
'Ensuring a level playing field at the - Raptis underlined - is essential for the competitiveness of European maritime transport.","The European Shipowners' Association welcomed the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) presented today by the European Commission ( of 5 November 2025). In particular, European Shipowners (ECSA) has noted that STIP boosts the uptake of fuels clean, is a good first step that identifies numerous Gaps and shortcomings in the current European political and financial framework clearly recognising the need for greater investments in clean fuels for maritime transport, and identifying possible next steps and concrete action points and, in addition, prioritizes the production of clean fuels in Europe as an urgent issue for the transition to net zero emissions and to reduce dependency Energy. ""The STIP - underlined the Secretary General of the association, Sotiris Raptis - is investing in Clean fuels at the heart of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary to maintain capacity improve competitiveness, reduce the energy dependence and achieve net zero emissions"".

In addition, European Shipowners welcomed the proposal STIP to use the national revenues of the EU ETS, the Carbon Dioxide Emissions Trading System to support the adoption of clean fuels for maritime transport. In this regard, ECSA reiterated that the Nine billion euros generated by the contribution of transport ETS should be used to bridge the huge price gap with clean fuels, which - he recalled - are on average four times more expensive than fuels Conventional. ""The STIP - Raptis pointed out - makes a first An important step towards the use of national ETS revenues to make clean fuels available for maritime transport at a competitive price. The national revenues of the ETS have contributed substantially to the increase in energy renewable energy in Europe. We must see the same happen for the maritime transport'.

Observing then that the STIP correctly points out that there are no clear requirements for European suppliers on the implementation of availability of clean fuels on the transport market the European Shipowners' Association specified that it welcome the commitment to further incentivise the adoption of clean fuels to achieve the objectives of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime Programme as a first step towards the introduction of a binding mandate for fuel suppliers. ""The use of ETS revenues - specified Raptis - should also be accompanied by a binding mandate for European suppliers to make clean fuels available for maritime transport"".

Finally, ECSA pointed out that European shipowners support reduction of administrative burdens, in particular for SMEs that represent the backbone of maritime transport and therefore welcome the commitment of the European Commission to assess the onerous obligations of reporting for shipping companies and to simplify the rules. However, the EU should make a significant contribution to the further step forward and also send a clear message about the full alignment of EU climate legislation with measures once the UN agency has Taken. 'Ensuring a level playing field at the - Raptis underlined - is essential for the competitiveness of European maritime transport. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will align its policy framework to international measures adopted at IMO level'.

Transport & Environment (T&E) has also welcomed the STIP plan which - noted the association, which aims to promote sustainable transport in Europe - contains promising measures to increase the production of e-fuel. For T&E, however, the EU will have to proceed quickly if it wants to maintain its industrial leadership in this technology. In the EU - explained the association - the projects for the production of e-fuels, in fact, have yet to materialize in due to the high costs and lack of supply agreements to long term.

Transport & Environment noted that if the commitment to establish an EU-wide bilateral auction of fuel for air and sea transport, based on an e-SAF pilot auction, will provide concrete resources to start production, however, this should be limited to e-fuels. In the short term - he T&E again noted - the STIP proposes to rely on the existing instruments - the Hydrogen Bank and the Fund for Innovation - which are starting to support the projects of e-fuel, including e-SAF. Although this sends a signal positive - observed the association - these tools alone have so far been unable to reduce the risks to production of e-fuels on an industrial scale. In T&E's view, therefore, the More effective measures than the plan could go too far delayed, as it is necessary to take initiatives for the e-fuel by 2026.

T&E also welcomed the intention of the European Commission to start preparations for the creation of a market intermediary to manage bilateral auctions, taking over that this tool is necessary to stimulate the nascent and to reconcile the needs of e-fuel manufacturers e-fuel in terms of long-term certainty with high-speed contracts used in the aviation and marketing sector shipping.

Noting that for the first time the EU will develop a effective financial instrument to boost the production of e-fuel, Antony Froggatt, Senior Director for Aviation, navigation and energy of T&E, highlighted that ""the EU must now follow up on these commitments if it is to contribute to Preserving European technological leadership in e-fuels. Leave The open door to biofuels - he said - will not make than weaken it."" The association has in fact reiterated its opposition to the use of biofuels for the decarbonisation of transport and expressed concern about the that the STIP plan leaves the door open to the inclusion of biofuels in bilateral auctions. ""Biofuels - warned T&E - are a more mature sector and could monopolize the limited resources of the market intermediary. It is It is essential - argued the association - that only e-fuels are eligible for auctions, as there are no barriers to market for the production of biofuels"".

He also noted that the STIP promotes the continued use of the biomethane in the shipping sector, T&E noted that limited stocks of biomethane should rather be considered for sectors that are currently dependent on fossil gas and which urgently need to reduce their dependence on such as domestic heating and heavy industry. ""This is particularly worrying - he said T&E detected - why ships currently only buy green certificates for biomethane, while the fuel is actually burned in domestic boilers and other sectors'.

Noting that the STIP plan is limited to encouraging Member States to use revenues from the ETS carbon market to decarbonising maritime transport and air transport, T&E highlighted the need for the revision of the ETS in the 2026 should consider the inclusion of a requirement to use ETS revenues for investments in e-fuel. In addition, the association complained that the STIP does not recognises the untapped potential for increased revenues from the ETS if carbon markets are expanded. Especially T&E estimated that last year there could have been raise more than seven billion euros by extending the ETS to all long-haul flights and found that around €2.4 billion per year of additional revenue could be generated between 2028 and 2035 including small transport ships.

Finally Transport & Environment complained that the STIP did not recommended the obligation to supply e-fuel for maritime use in ports European countries, which most EU countries do not yet have introduced despite the clear indications of the European directive renewable energy, and that the plan missed the opportunity to mobilise the European Investment Bank to invest in the production of e-fuels.

The other important initiative to accelerate the development of of high-speed rail in the EU presented today by the European Commission has been very well received by the ERC, the European association representing companies railway infrastructure managers and their national associations. ERC found that for the success of the European high-speed rail plan is It is essential to clearly define new infrastructures and strengthen them as this will not only ensure the ability to more commuter and freight services, but will improve even drastically the quality of existing services, making travel more comfortable, reliable and considerably more Quick.

In addition, ERC commended the Commission for approving standard speeds of 250 km/h or significantly higher for new high-speed lines, a benchmark that - underlined the association - guarantees that the transport rail can compete effectively with short air travel and attract traffic to the railway. The association has highlighted that this will also bring the same level of high-speed rail excellence across Europe and will maintain competitiveness with countries such as Japan and China.

""The real ambition of the current high-speed agreement - commented the Director General of the ERC, Alberto Mazzola - It is not just an investment in infrastructure, but a direct investment in quality and competitiveness of European travel. With a credible definition of infrastructure high-speed rail now specified, attention must be paid to the move on the speed of implementation. The ERC encourages Member States and the EU institutions to prioritise funding and coordination needed to develop European high-speed rail network and exploit its enormous advantages for all citizens"".",https://www.informare.it/IMAGES/facebook/inforMARErettangolare200x200.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 09:56:24.833275

Emissions in Q3 2025 were 4.2% higher than in Q1 2025 and 2.2% higher than in Q2 2025. However, relying on industry averages can be misleading, as vessels vary in size, characteristics, and routes. Achieving efficiency requires close monitoring of supply chain changes and disruptions.

The notable increase in emissions during the first quarter of 2025 is mainly due to vessel rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope. The changes in routing had not fully materialized by the end of Q1 2024. Therefore, the impact was very profound when comparing Q1 2024 and Q1 2025 emissions.

The average well-to-wake (WTW) intensity of the 73,353 voyages that were completed during Q3 2025 was 195.9, 1.6% reduced compared to Q3 2024. Intensity is mainly affected by the following factors:

Voyage duration – The higher the time spent steaming, the lower the intensity. In contrast, spending more time in port negatively impacts the intensity, as the vessel burns fuel without producing transport work.

Utilization – A metric that reflects the extent to which a vessel’s capacity is utilized. Efficient voyages have high utilization rates, as emissions are allocated to more containers.

TEU carried – Another metric that is typically examined, coupled with the utilization. The more TEU carried per voyage, the more efficient the voyage is. Therefore, larger vessels, while emitting more emissions, tend to be more efficient.

Distance – As distance increases, compared to the minimum feasible distance needed to complete a specific voyage, the intensity of the voyage increases as well. Subsequently, voyages with multiple port calls will have a higher intensity.

Speed – The speed a vessel cruises at during a voyage plays a vital role in fuel consumption. Speed is a complicated metric, with each vessel engine being designed with a specific optimal speed range. When a vessel cruises at speeds outside that range, fuel consumption increases, and so do emissions, negatively impacting the voyage’s intensity.

The factor of vessel age

Younger vessels tend to be more efficient, since their designs are up to date with the latest developments and their engines are younger. Therefore, it is worth exploring how voyage performance changes between different age groups. Voyages based on vessel age have been divided into these five categories:

• Vessels up to 5 years old

• Vessels between 6 and 10 years old

• Vessels between 11 and 15 years old

• Vessel between 16 and 20 years old

• Vessels older than 20 years old

It is observed that the distribution of vessels per age group does not differ substantially from that of voyages per age group. The most considerable divergence is recorded in the 11 to 15-year-old age group, where 19.3% of vessels, but only 16.3% of voyages, belong.

Once again, the influx of newly built vessels in the fleet is apparent: in Q3 2024, only 463 vessels were up to 5 years old, while in 2025 the number went up to 712.

Vessel speeds do not vary significantly between different age groups. The highest speeds are recorded in the age group of vessels up to 5 years old, where the average voyage speed reached 13.8 knots during Q3 2025, compared to 13.3 knots for all quarter voyages. The lowest average speeds were recorded in voyages completed by vessels that were more than 20 years old.

This is not surprising; older vessels turn to slow steaming to minimize fuel consumption. However, that does not make those voyages more efficient. On the contrary, those voyages recorded an average emissions intensity of 233.1, compared to 195.9 for all Q3 voyages.

Most efficient voyages were completed by vessels that were between 11 and 15 years old. Voyages completed by ships belonging to that age group recorded an average emissions intensity of 155.4, which is the lowest among age groups and slightly improved compared to the respective intensity in Q3 2024 (158.3).

Regarding the other characteristics of those voyages, the average steaming time plays a vital role, being equal to 4.4 days, compared to 3.5 days for all voyages completed during the third quarter. That duration is also the highest among all age groups. In each voyage, an average of 3,712 TEU was carried, while the utilization (ranging between 67% and 69% among all age groups) was 69",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1972988039.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 08:16:34.102532

The Financial Times lays it all bare: to kill the net-zero shipping pact, Trump didn’t just lean on the usual diplomatic muscle—Washington went full gangster. Think raised port fees, outright bans on ships passing through America, and direct threats, and even personal intimidation of diplomats and their families, with entry bans waved in their faces like warning flags.

The Financial Times lays it out: over a dozen diplomats, foreign officials, and industry insiders watched the US throw diplomacy in the mud at last month’s London summit. Washington came armed with bullying tactics, determined to smash the net-zero shipping pact by brute force.

US Bullying Blocks IMO’s Green Shipping Deal—Vote Delayed a Year. IMO website image.

US officials didn’t bother with backroom deals—they stalked the halls, cornering diplomats from Africa, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. The message was simple: cross the United States, and your ships might not reach America. Rock the boat, and your family could be locked out. These weren’t idle whispers. The intimidation played out in broad daylight during coffee breaks.

Social Media Taunts, Policy Upends

Trump didn’t bother hiding his true feelings. On social media, he slammed the agreement as a “global green shipping tax scam.” But this wasn’t just venting. In April, most countries had already green-lit the framework. It was set to become real policy—until Trump’s team blew it up, forcing a one-year “pause.” The global momentum froze on the spot.

One diplomat cut to the heart of it: “It’s like the streets of New York.” His country got the warning firsthand—keep backing the deal, and watch your sailors’ visas disappear. US port fees? Those would rise too. Another attendee was even more blunt: IMO bigwigs were left gobsmacked. “It’s like dealing with the mafia,” they said. “You don’t need details. You just know: cross us, and you’ll pay.”

The US State Department kept mum on the intimidation claims. Instead, American officials handed out praise to Greece and Cyprus. Those two broke rank from the rest of the EU—they cast abstention votes in the big one-year adjournment, even after they already gave the framework the green light back in April.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ahead of the IMO meeting in London, issued a joint statement with senior Trump officials warning that the administration was ""evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration."" As Greece and Cyprus sided with the U.S., much of Europe—and the world—reacted with surprise.

Global Rules or American Muscle?

Chatham House’s head of global economy Creon Butler didn’t mince words. The US, he said, has ditched long-standing diplomatic etiquette. Instead, Washington's now muscling countries into backing its stance—especially on climate.

America Threatens: Support This, Your Crews and Ports Pay.

“In the very short term this might work, but in the medium term it increases the chances that non-US countries will conclude they cannot work with the US, making agreements independently among themselves which simply work around the US,” he said. Sooner or later, the rest of the world will ink deals that leave America in the dust.

The pushback reached fever pitch at the IMO. Brazil, among others, called out the methods “that should not ever be used among sovereign nations”. Washington wasn’t just rattling individuals—entire capitals, from Bangladesh to Japan and Indonesia, got notes threatening diplomatic smackdowns.

But let’s step back. The drive for a net-zero shipping pact isn’t about feel-good climate slogans.

As Niu Tanqin from Xinhua puts it: The pact itself is a brass-tacks response to global warming’s mounting cost. Whether you like it or not, global warming is simply an undisputable fact. Everyone is scrambling to stall off the climate catastrophes looming on the horizon.

So, in order to squeeze carbon emission: if your ship emits less than the set limit, you’re rewarded. Above the cut-off, you pay. China, the EU, Japan, India, Brazil—all were in. Even the big shipping companies joined the chorus.

Only a handful of oil states—think Saudi Arabia, Russia, the UAE—pushed back. Pacific island nations, unconvinced the pact was tough enough, simply abstained.

Trump Says Global Warming’s a Scam—US Walks Out.

Then, everything changed. Once Trump 2.0 manifested, the US flipped from supporter to saboteur. In his mind, climate change is a hoax—or worse, a Chinese plot to corner American interests. Stopping this agreement wasn’t just policy—it was personal. He didn’t mind stooping low—pulling out every trick in the high school bully’s playbook: pressure, threats, and outright intimidation to make sure America got its way.

One official wasn’t shy: “It was completely exceptional. I have never heard of anything like this in the context of an IMO negotiation. These people [being threatened] are just bureaucrats, they are civil servants.”

If international law becomes a mere cheap disguise, you can bet real power will be the one pulling the strings.

Pause Button Pressed—World Left Reeling

Now, the deal waits on ice for another year, while “the world stares, shell-shocked”—witnesses to a new era of American brinkmanship.

Not the first time, either. Just look at tariffs: if Washington’s unhappy, it writes its own tax bill—no debate required. Venezuela and Nigeria have both fielded threats of military action; Canada and Panama know the taste of territorial intimidation. Lawless? That’s par for the course.

But payback, as always, has a funny way of coming due. Today, the US bullies island nations and slaps down climate claims. Tomorrow, who’s next? When “might makes right” replaces rules, every nation that depends on order will lose out. True justice may come late—but it never skips its date. Chip away at the pillars of fairness, and sooner or later, you bury the very house you live in.

The real question: how long can America’s strong-arm show go on before the world walks out?

Deep Throat

** The blog article is the sole responsibility of the author and does not represent the position of our company. **

CNN just laid out the evidence in four charts, which explained why China had the upper hand at the Busan summit.

On November 2, the network pulled official data from China's General Administration of Customs and the US Department of Agriculture to show exactly how Beijing outmaneuvered Washington in this trade standoff. By the time Chinese and US leaders sat down in Busan, South Korea, on October 30 to hammer out what observers are calling a one-year ""ceasefire,"" China had already shifted the playing board.

Xi and Trump face off in Busan—numbers speak first. AP Photo

The data confirms it—China followed through on its promises to reduce dependence on US markets, and American negotiators had to adjust accordingly.

US Market Share Shrinks

CNN's first chart tracks a stark shift: “The US now accounts for around 10% of Chinese exports, down from more than 15% a year ago.” The decline started before Trump's second term even began, then accelerated sharply in recent months. September's numbers tell the story—China's exports to the US hit $34.3 billion, down 27% from $47 billion the year prior.

The network's reporting confirms what trade watchers suspected: Beijing wasn't bluffing about pivoting away from US dependency.

Despite the US trade plunge, China's overall exports grew 6.1% this year, with September posting an 8.3% year-on-year jump. CNN's second chart makes the point visually—while US trade cratered, exports to the EU and ASEAN surged. China didn't just survive the trade war; it found new customers and expanded market share elsewhere.

The data shows China successfully executed its diversification strategy while US farmers and ranchers watched their market access evaporate.

The Soybean Shift

CNN's third and fourth charts zero in on two agricultural commodities that matter: soybeans and beef. The network notes that US soybeans have long been central to trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington. The September 2025 data marks a milestone—for the first time in years, China imported zero US soybeans that month. Not a single bushel.

Instead, Brazil and Argentina stepped in to fill the gap. Both South American countries saw continuous export growth to China throughout the period. When Argentina temporarily lifted soybean export taxes in September, China promptly purchased approximately 1.2 million tonnes from the country.

Chicago soybean futures—a benchmark for global prices—rose in the days before the Busan summit. After the leaders met, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on Thursday, October 30, that China agreed to purchase 12 million tonnes of soybeans this season and committed to buying 25 million tonnes annually for the next three years.

Beef Exports Collapse

The beef numbers reveal an even more dramatic collapse. China ranks as the third-largest buyer of US beef, but purchases dropped like a stone in recent months. According to US Department of Agriculture data, China bought $481 million worth of US beef from January to July this year—just 8% of total US beef exports. That's a 47% decline from the same period last year, when Chinese purchases accounted for 15% of US exports.

September's figures are even starker. China's General Administration of Customs reported importing just $11 million worth of US beef last month—a 90% plunge from the $110 million imported in September last year. Australia and Argentina picked up the slack, increasing their beef shipments to China as US ranchers lost access.

These four charts provide a straightforward answer to why the side that initially escalated tensions—the US—eventually ""backed down"" and pursued constructive dialogue with China. The data shows Beijing meant what it said about diversifying trade partners and proved capable of executing that strategy.

Belt and Road Delivers

The Economist reported this month that China's ""thriving"" Belt and Road Initiative played a positive role in this round of US-China competition. The publication noted that the initiative promoted China's trade diversification on two fronts: Chinese component manufacturers expanded their export markets through factories established in Belt and Road countries, while those same countries developed their own industrial export capabilities—further strengthening China's resilience in global supply chains.",https://image.bastillepost.com/640x/wp-content/uploads/global/2025/11/FB-Image_Deep-Throat-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 08:16:40.184492

Caught in the middle is shipping – the world’s most globalised industry, dependent on global rules, now watching those rules fragment.
The NZF is a structural package that would reshape fuel use, reporting and the economic backbone of climate policy in shipping.","The decision at the recent Extraordinary Session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to postpone the adoption of the so-called Net Zero Framework (NZF) by a full year is not a sign of the industry dragging its feet – it is a reminder that political manoeuvring still trumps progress.

The NZF, designed to give legal force to IMO’s “net-zero by or around 2050” goal, was on track: in April 2025, 63 states voted for adoption in principle. By October, the vote was expected to turn that agreement into binding text. Instead, procedural disputes and geo-strategic posturing derailed the process.

The industry’s position has been consistent. Owners are ordering dual-fuel and methanol-ready tonnage, ports are building infrastructure for low-carbon fuels, and cargo interests increasingly treat decarbonisation as non-negotiable. What’s missing is regulatory certainty – and that’s exactly what the NZF was meant to deliver.

The plan would have introduced fees for non-compliance with tightening carbon-intensity targets, with compliant ships rewarded and surpluses tradable. Revenues could have reached up to US$15Bn annually by 2030.

But the path toward adoption veered off course. The trigger was a dispute over the procedural rules behind IMO law-making. Since 1973, amendments to the Marpol Convention – the core environmental treaty for shipping – have entered into force through ’tacit acceptance’, meaning they take effect automatically unless a threshold of objections is reached. During the October session, however, the United States – backed by Saudi Arabia and others – pushed for ’explicit acceptance,’ a far more cumbersome process that would require active ratification by each state and could delay or block the framework indefinitely.

As the week unfolded, procedural wrangling turned into geopolitical theatre. The US reportedly threatened tariffs, port access restrictions, or visa limits for officials from states backing the NZF. Under pressure, many large flag and tonnage states either abstained, changed their positions, or withdrew support. The motion to delay passed with 57 in favour, 49 against, and 21 abstentions.

That vote matters. The NZF is not a minor tweak to existing IMO rules but a far-reaching package that would redefine how ships use and report fuels while introducing an economic mechanism – effectively a global shipping climate fund. Without adoption, the original 2027 entry-into-force target is now uncertain, possibly slipping toward the next decade.

IMO has become a stage for competing agendas. The EU presses ahead with its Emissions Trading System and FuelEU Maritime – measures that accelerate regional action but undermine faith in global regulation. For developing nations and petro-states, Brussels’ unilateralism offers a convenient excuse: why agree to a global carbon price when Europe is already imposing its own?

Across the Atlantic, the US and Saudi Arabia have played their own part in the stalemate. Washington’s hesitation is increasingly driven by domestic politics, with a revived Trumpist narrative eroding support for climate multilateralism. That shift is already complicating the EU’s broader COP30 strategy – and it is seeping into IMO. Riyadh, meanwhile, continues to defend its petro-economic position by slowing any attempt to put a meaningful price on carbon.

Caught in the middle is shipping – the world’s most globalised industry, dependent on global rules, now watching those rules fragment. Regional carbon regimes and national carve-outs will not deliver decarbonisation; they will only create a two-tier system, with compliant fleets in wealthy jurisdictions and carbon-heavy fleets everywhere else. The NZF is a structural package that would reshape fuel use, reporting and the economic backbone of climate policy in shipping. Losing momentum now risks losing the framework altogether.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/183/Germany-dr_martin_kroger-2022-21_Main.png,N,,2025-11-06 07:16:29.824340

Scientists warn that expanding crop-based biofuels to sectors like shipping could undermine global net-zero goals, displace communities, and drive deforestation.
Despite being branded “green,” crop-based biofuels emit on average 16% more CO2 than fossil fuels once land use change impacts are included.","Transport & Environment (T&E) released an open letter signed by 100 scientists urging world leaders at COP30 to recognise the climate, social and environmental risks of an unchecked expansion of global biofuels demand.

The scientists call for governments and international bodies, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to focus on genuinely sustainable, scalable fuels rather than doubling down on crop-based biofuels.

The letter lands just as leaders gather in Belém for the COP30 summit, where Brazil is expected to launch a global pledge to quadruple the use of “sustainable fuels,” including doubling biofuel consumption.

At the IMO, Brazil – currently the second largest biofuels producer worldwide – has been promoting the use of biofuels as a way to decarbonize the shipping sector.

Global shipping is at risk of expanding into harmful biofuels, if unregulated. Both the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) and the 2023 Revised GHG Strategy, which commits to full decarbonisation by 2050, currently lack any safeguards or sustainability criteria for biofuels.

This gap means that as the IMO works to define its net-zero pathway, crop-based biofuels could rapidly expand without any environmental or social protections in place. Scientists warn that this would undermine climate progress, worsen deforestation, and deepen global food insecurity the very impacts climate action seeks to avoid.

Biofuels have become a live issue at the IMO as countries define the fuels and technologies that will be part of the green future of shipping. As biofuels are cheap and largely available, they have been looked at by the shipping industry as an easy way to meet its decarbonization targets. But without sustainability criteria, according to experts, this pathway risks replicating the same environmental and food security crises already seen in the road and aviation sectors.

Scientists warn that expanding crop-based biofuels to sectors like shipping could undermine global net-zero goals, displace communities, and drive deforestation.

Already, growing crops for fuel uses 32 million hectares of land, an area about the size of Italy, to meet just 4% of transport fuel demand. By 2030, this could rise to 52 million hectares, roughly the size of France.

Despite being branded “green,” crop-based biofuels emit on average 16% more CO2 than fossil fuels once land use change impacts are included. These same crops – soy and palm oil, in particular – could otherwise feed up to 1.3 billion people. Today, about a fifth of the world’s vegetable oil supply is burned in cars instead of being used for food.

At last month’s IMO meetings (ISWG-GHG-20), member states remained divided on biofuels’ role in the maritime transition. Brazil, Indonesia and several African countries pushed for a “technology-neutral” approach that would allow food and feed-based biofuels to count toward emissions targets. The EU and Pacific Island states countered that this risks repeating the mistakes seen in road transport and aviation, arguing instead for a shift toward renewable e-fuels.

However, discussions have stalled: the US, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries argued against further work on these sustainability safeguards until after the NZF’s adoption, despite previously citing the absence of such clarifications as a reason for delay.",,N,,2025-11-06 07:16:41.069275

This transformative partnership is designed to unlock massive investment in sustainable port infrastructure and accelerate the maritime sector’s just transition to net-zero.

The initiative establishes the first global framework specifically tailored to deploy Sustainability-Linked Loans for port decarbonisation projects worldwide. By combining C40’s network of nearly 100 cities and dozens of ports, IFC’s expertise in structuring climate finance transactions, and IAPH’s global alliance of 201 ports, the partnership will deliver comprehensive market guidance, capacity-building programmes, and direct access to finance for port authorities, particularly in the Global South where financing barriers have hindered green infrastructure deployment.

Maritime transport carries over 80% of global goods and accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. Ports, as nodes of global trade, require an estimated $1-2 trillion in cumulative investment through 2050 for shore power electrification, alternative fuel bunkering infrastructure, and zero-emission cargo-handling equipment. Yet approximately $200 billion in sustainability-linked capital remains untapped due to technical, financial, and regulatory barriers facing port authorities.

The C40-IFC-IAPH partnership directly addresses this climate finance gap through:

Standardised SLL frameworks that tie loan terms to ambitious sustainability KPIs, reducing transaction costs and improving investor confidence

Technical advisory support helping port authorities structure investment-ready projects and access to a global network of development banks and commercial lenders

Blended finance mechanisms combining concessional climate funds, development bank capital, and commercial investment to de-risk early-stage green technologies

Capacity-building programs including regional workshops and Port SLL Academies targeting Global South participants

The projected impact will drive C40’s efforts to:

Prepare more than 50 zero-emission port and shipping projects for investment by 2030

Mobilise resilient and sustainable maritime infrastructure finance for at least $1 billion within three years, leveraging IFC’s mobilisation capacity

Reduce maritime and port-related emissions in participating cities by 25-40% by 2035

Generate up to 4 million new jobs globally by 2050 through maritime decarbonisation, with significant concentration in Global South port cities

Support achievement of C40 cities’ commitment to drive creation of 50 million good, green jobs by 2030

Facilitate equitable access to competitive infrastructure financing for IAPH member ports in the Global South and Small Island States

The initiative builds on extensive groundwork including comprehensive market assessments and lender outreach to 30 commercial banks confirming strong support for standardised port SLL frameworks. The partnership formalises the Memorandum of Understanding signed between IFC and C40 in September 2024, moving beyond information-sharing to active co-leadership of sector-wide financial mobilisation.

The initiative will provide critical support for port authorities in the Global South, which handle more than half of seaborne exports and 60% of imports and face acute challenges including limited fiscal space, higher perceived investment risk, and weak credit ratings that drive up borrowing costs.

The partnership’s next steps include regional workshops and capacity-building programmes, commencing in 2026.

C40 Cities Managing Director of Climate Finance, Knowledge, and Partnerships Andrea Fernandez said, “Ports are gateways of international trade, and this global framework sets a new precedent, sending clear signals to the market and accelerating the pace and scale of climate finance for critical investments in zero-emission port infrastructure.

“This joint initiative delivers many wins: it de-risks commercial investments in port infrastructure and green fuels, it advances a just transition by enabling ports, particularly in the Global South, to address fiscal challenges, and also enhances technical assistance and capacity-building programmes.

“Crucially, the Global Port SLL initiative makes a compelling case to ramp up maritime decarbonisation and accelerate climate resilience, protecting the people and places we love.”

IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven said, “The Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative marks an important step forward for further collaboration between ports, loan providers, and regulators. These land-based investments can fund long-term infrastructure and support offtake agreements for low and zero-carbon shipping fuels and liquid bulk transport.

“Access to finance can equip ports with the necessary infrastructure to handle future low and zero-carbon energy molecules produced from renewable energy sources. This initiative complements IAPH’s work on the Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM HUBS) initiative, which aims to import, export, bunker, and where feasible, produce clean energy sources and zero and near-zero emission fuels.",,N,,2025-11-06 07:16:49.048639

Mobility and transport are vital to the EU’s industrial growth and competitiveness, however, the sector remains a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To address this, the EU aims to reduce transport-related GHG emissions by 90% by 2050. Adopted on 5 November, the STIP focuses on promoting renewable and low-carbon fuels for aviation and maritime transport, aiming to mobilize investments and expand production of sustainable fuels.

European Shipowners have welcomed the plan as a first step that identifies many gaps and shortcomings in the existing European policy and finance framework. As stated, STIP recognises the need for more investments in clean fuels for shipping and identifies possible next steps and concrete action points.

We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero.

…said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

Moreover, European Shipowners support the STIP proposal to use national Emissions Trading System (ETS) revenues to promote clean fuel adoption in shipping. They emphasize that the €9 billion generated from shipping’s ETS contributions should help offset the high cost of clean fuels, which are about four times more expensive than conventional ones.

STIP also highlights the lack of clear requirements for European suppliers to make clean fuels available for the shipping sector. As an initial step toward establishing binding mandates for fuel suppliers, European Shipowners welcome the commitment to further incentivize clean fuel use in order to meet the targets of the Renewable Energy Directive and the FuelEU Maritime initiative.

However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at IMO level.

…said Raptis.

In addition, the World Shipping Council (WSC) has welcomed the decision, highlighting it as a promising first step toward accelerating the energy transition in Europe for shipping.

WSC has called for the funding outlined in the STIP to focus on:

Price-bridging measures that make renewable fuels competitive, enabling their use by dual-fuel ships.

Targeted incentives for renewable fuels to bring production to scale.

De-risking market investment mechanisms connecting producers and buyers to de-risk investments and accelerate market development.

The plan sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) proposed the Net-Zero Framework (NFZ) to reduce “global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector.”

The U.S. secretaries stated, “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.”

They continued, “The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.”

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.”

The U.S. then successfully garnered support to block the adoption of the NFZ in London. Another vote on the measure is anticipated next year.

Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

Direct China-U.S. voyages showed pronounced volatility, declining 3% in the first nine months of 2025 but spiking 15% in July before dropping 10% in September. China's retaliatory port fees targeting U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels introduce additional complexity to carrier deployment strategies.

Chinese-built vessels completed 36% of Q3 voyages, while 53.1% of vessels under five years old have been built from Chinese shipyards. South Korean-built vessels carried out 24.6% of all Q3 containership voyages, but 41.3% of all VLCS. South Korean built vessels' voyages recorded the lowest emissions intensity at 152.7 g CO2e/TEU km due to larger capacities and long-haul trade deployment.

Well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for very large container ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while very large container ships completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km, which reflects their significantly higher efficiency levels.

Major fronthaul trades demonstrate the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days, highlighting how aggregate metrics obscure critical operational differences.

Given the recent delay to the NZF and the framework’s weaknesses, it is up to individual countries and regional blocs to strengthen climate efforts

A recent extraordinary session of the International Maritime Organisation, which was meant to turn the tide on the global shipping sector’s poor climate performance, ended in acrimony. Instead of launching the IMO’s flagship Net-Zero Framework, pressure from the United States and oil-rich countries led, by a slim majority, to the 12-month postponement of the vote.

Although it was vital that the IMO pass the NZF, our latest study and briefing, released today (Thursday 6 November), reveal that the NZF is woefully inadequate to bring down the carbon footprint of the shipping sector.

Carried out by industrial economics professor Michele Cincera, our analysis projects that the NZF, had it been adopted, would have led to emissions cuts of only 8-10% compared with the 43% that would be necessary to bring the maritime sector in line with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5°C.

“Despite the procrastination at the IMO, governments need to face the reality of rising emissions from the shipping sector and support the transition to clean fuels and technologies,” says Jenny Helle, CMW’s expert on shipping decarbonisation and author of the policy briefing. “They should deploy all the tools in their arsenal to tackle the role of the shipping sector in fuelling the climate crisis. With the delays facing the IMO framework, the climate cost is bound to rise.”

Regional rescue mission

In light of both this delay and the low ambition of the Net-Zero Framework, our forthcoming briefing recommends that IMO member states strengthen the NZF in the meantime so as to make up for lost time.

We also recommend that national governments and regional blocs salvage the lost momentum by launching or shoring up their own measures to cut shipping pollution, such as by introducing a shipping component to their cap-and-trade carbon markets or expanding its coverage. For example, the EU can enlarge its Emissions Trading System to cover 100% of emissions from ships entering and leaving the European Economic Area, instead of the current 50%.",https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/theo-eilertsen-photography-9bOHP92SPck-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 18:56:16.950106

In 2023, Asyad Drydock launched a floating dock capable of servicing vessels ranging from 50,000 to 80,000 DWT, a size that constitutes a significant portion of global maritime traffic.
Dr. Al Rabbani emphasized, “Asyad Drydock is the second-largest facility of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa.
Asyad Drydock specializes in the installation of exhaust gas scrubbers to eliminate sulfur oxides and other pollutants from ship emissions.","MUSCAT, NOVEMBER 5 — Asyad Drydock, a subsidiary of Asyad Group—Oman’s integrated global logistics provider—announced plans to invest in a second floating dock. This initiative is part of its strategy to enhance the capacity for maintenance and repair of small to mid-size vessels at its state-of-the-art facility in the Port of Duqm.

Dr. Abdulsalam Omar al Rabbani, Chief Operating Officer of Asyad Drydock, stated that the new floating dock will surpass the current Panamax-size facility, which was acquired and initiated at Al Duqm two years ago.

At the recent Duqm Economic Forum 2025, held in the Special Economic Zone, Dr. Al Rabbani highlighted that this new facility is part of annual investments averaging RO 4–5 million. These funds are dedicated to modernizing, expanding, and optimizing the yard’s capabilities to manage all types of maritime vessels and crafts requiring drydocking and repair services in Duqm.

In 2023, Asyad Drydock launched a floating dock capable of servicing vessels ranging from 50,000 to 80,000 DWT, a size that constitutes a significant portion of global maritime traffic. This addition has increased the yard’s overall capacity by approximately 20%, allowing the facility to accommodate around 40 more ships annually, raising its total repair capacity to about 240 vessels each year.

Dr. Al Rabbani emphasized, “Asyad Drydock is the second-largest facility of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to our capacity for handling some of the world’s largest ships, we provide a comprehensive range of ship repairs, onboard fabrication, and related services. Our annual capital expenditure of around RO 4–5 million bolsters our technical capabilities and boosts overall efficiency.”

The yard is also focusing on environmentally sustainable practices to align with international environmental standards and Net Zero objectives. Asyad Drydock specializes in the installation of exhaust gas scrubbers to eliminate sulfur oxides and other pollutants from ship emissions. Additionally, it implements ballast water management systems that comply with IMO regulations, and employs robotic blasting and painting technologies to reduce the environmental impact of repair operations.

“By committing to these initiatives, we ensure that repair work is performed safely while maintaining superior quality and craftsmanship—essential elements that enhance customer satisfaction, loyalty, and competitiveness in pricing,” he added.

Kaushal said HPCL’s strategy over the next 5 to 10 years and beyond is closely aligned with India’s growth targets, as the nation progresses toward becoming a $5 trillion economy and ultimately achieving developed nation status by 2047.
The complex is jointly built by HPCL and the Rajasthan government, with equity stakes of 74% and 26%, respectively.
“Every time we go to the crude oil market, we see there is an adequate supply,” Kaushal said.
That is, lowering our own footprint to reduce emission intensity, while enabling customers in transition,” Kaushal said.","India’s oil demand growth is expected to remain strong over the next couple of decades, fueled by robust consumption of oil products such as gasoline and LPG, and sustained by resilient economic growth, according to Vikas Kaushal, chairman and managing director of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp.

“I expect overall demand to remain strong for the rest of this year and next year as oil demand is related to core economic activity, and economic growth is showing a lot of resilience,” Kaushal told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, on the sidelines of the annual Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, or ADIPEC 2025, on Nov. 5.

India’s refined oil products demand is projected to increase by 78,000 b/d year over year in 2025, with growth in 2026 expected to reach nearly 218,000 b/d, bringing total demand to about 5.65 million b/d, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“Diesel demand growth had been somewhat muted due to seasonal factors, but we are positive about the overall outlook,” Kaushal said.

S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts India’s real gross domestic product to expand by 6.3% in fiscal year 2025-26 (April-March), driven by strong consumption, rationalization of goods and services tax rates and moderating inflation, despite global policy uncertainty. It projects India’s real GDP growth of 6.2% in FY 2026-27.

Kaushal said HPCL’s strategy over the next 5 to 10 years and beyond is closely aligned with India’s growth targets, as the nation progresses toward becoming a $5 trillion economy and ultimately achieving developed nation status by 2047.

“Over the next decade, we see our role not just as a supplier of energy but as a key enabler of India’s economic and social transformation,” Kaushal said. “Our vision at HPCL is to be a trusted, future-ready integrated energy company that supports India’s growth story, while enabling its decarbonization and transition pathways.”

HPCL’s broad vision rests on three pillars: ensuring energy security and access; readiness for the energy transition and a focus on sustainability; and emphasis on innovation, technology and digital leadership, according to Kaushal.

Refinery expansion

HPCL’s two refineries at Mumbai and Visakhapatnam processed a record 6.57 million mt in the July-September quarter, up 4.3% year over year, the company said in a regulatory filing Oct. 29. Total imported crude volumes were 5 million mt, or 396,739 b/d, during the second quarter of the financial year.

Kaushal said HPCL’s overall refining capacity — including joint venture refineries — is set to rise to 45 million mt/year from the current 36 million mt/year, following the completion of the HPCL Rajasthan Refinery Ltd. project.

The complex is jointly built by HPCL and the Rajasthan government, with equity stakes of 74% and 26%, respectively.

“We are on track to complete the project and aiming for crude cut-in over the next few months,” Kaushal said.

HPCL is transitioning to a crude sourcing model that optimizes both term and spot contracts, as upgrades and expansions in refinery technology enable the processing of a broader range of feedstocks, allowing the company to capitalize on abundant market supplies, he said.

“Every time we go to the crude oil market, we see there is an adequate supply,” Kaushal said. “We are having a lot of interactions with oil suppliers here at ADIPEC. The question is about finding the right price and the right grade — heavy or light — depending on the need for our oil products output.”

“In the long run, crude supplies will depend on how much upstream investments are taking place, but in the short run, there is enough supply.”

Energy transition focus

Kaushal said India’s energy transition represents both a national imperative and a significant opportunity, and HPCL is dedicated to leading this transformation.

While ensuring the availability of affordable energy to support India’s rapid growth, he said HPCL is actively reshaping its portfolio to focus on cleaner, more sustainable fuels and low-carbon pathways.

“HPCL will be a pragmatic transition enabler — and have a two-fold approach. That is, lowering our own footprint to reduce emission intensity, while enabling customers in transition,” Kaushal said.

“We are executing a clear plan to net zero (scope 1 and scope 2) by 2040, with a finalized road map guiding investments in efficiency, renewables, green hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage/carbon capture and utilization for hard-to-abate emissions.”

HPCL aims to reduce energy intensity and emissions at its refineries by enhancing efficiency, switching to alternative fuels, adopting renewables, utilizing low-carbon hydrogen, and minimizing flaring — initiatives that are anchored in its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, Kaushal said.",,N,,2025-11-05 17:56:14.091070

The EU measures under this plan are expected to mobilise at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.
European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping.
“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping.","The European Commission has adopted its communication on the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out a roadmap to rapidly accelerate the energy transition of aviation and waterborne transport sectors.

To meet the fuel targets set out in the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime Regulations, a significant volume of around 20 million tonnes of sustainable alternative fuels (13.2 Mt of biofuels and 6.8 Mt of e-fuels) will be needed by 2035. This calls for substantial investments from the market, with an estimated €100 billion required by 2035 to drive production.

Regulatory stability is key for attracting investments into renewable and low-carbon fuels. With the STIP, the Commission sends a clear signal to investors that its targets are stable, and that it will support the sector throughout the transition.

The Commission says: By accelerating the production of EU-made sustainable fuels, Europe can significantly boost its competitiveness, reduce its energy dependency on fossil fuels and lead this industrial transition, on the way to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Europe is already a global leader and holds most of the know-how and industrial leadership in this sector.

The EU measures under this plan are expected to mobilise at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027.

The Commission will propose €300 million by end of this year to support the production of hydrogen for sustainable aviation (SAF) and maritime (SMF) fuels through the European Hydrogen Bank.

The Commission will support R&I projects with around €133 million under Horizon Europe.

The Commission will mobilise €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and €293 million for maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

In the medium-term, the EU needs an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to provide revenue certainty and de-risk investments. The Commission will work towards establishing such a mechanism.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated: ""Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future. It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport. This ambitious plan shows the Commission’s firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport. Success will depend on close cooperation among Member States, industry, financiers and civil society to turn this challenge into a strategic opportunity for Europe.""

ECSA responds

European Shipowners welcomed the STIP as a good first step.

“We’ve got ambitious climate targets but not the clean fuels we need for the energy transition. STIP is putting investments in clean fuels at the centre of the competitiveness agenda. These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net zero,” said Sotiris Raptis, Secretary General of European Shipowners | ECSA.

European Shipowners welcome STIP’s suggestion to use national ETS revenues to support the uptake of clean fuels for shipping. The EUR 9 billion generated from the contribution of shipping to the EU ETS should be used to bridge the immense price gap with clean fuels that are on average four times more expensive than conventional fuels.

“STIP takes a major first step towards the use of the national ETS revenues to make clean fuels for shipping available at a competitive price. National ETS revenues have contributed substantially to the scale-up of renewables in Europe. We need to see the same happening for shipping. The use of the ETS revenues should also be matched by a binding mandate on European suppliers to make clean fuels available for shipping” Raptis added.

European Shipowners firmly support reducing administrative burden, especially for SMEs which are the backbone of European shipping. Therefore, European Shipowners welcome the commitment of the Commission to assess the burdensome reporting requirements for shipping companies and simplify rules. However, the EU should go a step further and send a clear message on the full alignment of EU climate legislation with the IMO international measures, when adopted.

“Ensuring an international level playing field is essential for the competitiveness of European shipping. We expect a clear message from the Commission that the EU will fully align its policy framework with international measures when adopted at IMO level” said Raptis.

Danish shipowners respond

For Danish Shipping, the current lack of fuels must be addressed urgently.

“The EU is in imminent danger of being overtaken by China and other ambitious players when it comes to the production of the green fuels we need to power our ships. It is therefore very positive that the Commission has focused on this issue in the STIP. The Commission proposes several sensible action points and investments, and we look forward to seeing these move from strategy to reality,” said Anna Vejlby Ib, Head of Danish Shipping’s EU Representation.

Danish Shipping has previously proposed that part of the DKK 3.8 billion that Danish shipping alone is expected to contribute annually once the sector is fully included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2026 should be earmarked to bridge the price gap between fossil and green fuels — both in production and consumption.

The organization says it is therefore encouraging that the European Commission is now urging Member States to allocate sufficient ETS revenues to the maritime and aviation sectors, including for the production of sustainable and low-emission fuels. The EU itself should follow suit and earmark ETS revenues for the green transition of shipping.

“The EU must focus on ensuring supply, price stability, and competitiveness when it comes to green fuels. The EU should, among other things, set common European targets for the production of green fuels. At Danish Shipping, we view positively the Commission’s proposal on de-risking long-term contracts and introducing two-sided auction mechanisms to reduce the price gap between fossil and green fuels. This is simply a prerequisite for implementing the EU’s own initiatives such as FuelEU Maritime and ReFuelEU Aviation, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Ib.

Danish Shipping also strongly supports the Commission’s ambitions to strengthen cooperation with partner countries such as Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt — where there is abundant sun, wind, and robust energy infrastructure.

“It is positive that the Commission maintains its focus on com­petitiveness and the green transition at the same time — not least at a time where other forces are pulling in the opposite direction. Shipping is — and must remain — part of the solution. But that requires the EU to dare to invest massively in the green transition now. The world is not standing still — and neither must Europe,” said Ib.

World Shipping Council (WSC) responds

WSC says financial measures are key in EU's STIP implementation to make renewable fuels competitive.

“The European Commission’s publication today of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) is a promising first step toward accelerating the energy transition in Europe for shipping,” says Jim Corbett, WSC’s Environmental Director, Europe.

“The plan sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization.”

World Shipping Council is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the STIP translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers. Without this, production and uptake will stall despite significant fleet investments already made by the liner shipping sector.

WSC calls for the funding outlined in the STIP to focus on:

• Price-bridging measures that make renewable fuels competitive, enabling their use by dual-fuel ships.

• Targeted incentives for renewable fuels to bring production to scale.

• De-risking market investment mechanisms connecting producers and buyers to de-risk investments and accelerate market development.

These measures are essential to help unlock the estimated €100 billion investment needed by 2035 and to ensure that funds mobilized through InvestEU, the European Hydrogen Bank, and the Innovation Fund deliver maximum impact.

Demand for renewable maritime fuels is growing. WSC’s Dual-Fuel Fleet Dashboard shows the readiness of liner fleets, with over €150 billion invested in dual-fuel ships, ready to run on zero/near-zero fuels by 2030. These investments will only translate into GHG emissions reductions if renewable fuels become available at competitive prices.

While the STIP focuses on investment, Europe must not lose focus on additional measures critical for the transition:

• Fit-for-purpose certification of global fuel production to ensure environmental integrity and support early uptake.

• Strategic port infrastructure investments for green fuel bunkering and onshore power supply, to be outlined in the upcoming EU Port Strategy.

SASHA responds

Aurelia Leeuw, Director of EU Policy at the Skies and Seas Hydrogen-fuels Accelerator (SASHA) Coalition, said: “The Commission deserves credit for taking concrete steps to finance and de-risk e-fuel production – especially through the creation of a double-sided auctioning system that can finally bridge the price and contract gaps between fossil and e-fuels, which marks a real stride forward.

""But the STIP still falls short where ambition matters most. An extension of the ETS is still missing, and without it, we won’t generate the revenues needed to truly accelerate decarbonisation in aviation and maritime. And while it’s positive to see recognition of zero-emission aircraft and hydrogen’s role, support for zero-emission technologies across the board remains limited.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/doganmesut-adobe-165213.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 16:56:07.949838

The MoU was signed by Valdo Kalm, CEO, Port of Tallinn and Anders Nordlund, Harbour Master, Ports of Stockholm.
Magdalena Bosson, CEO of Ports of Stockholm, highlighted the joint responsibility and ambition that unite the two countries.","Joint targets for greener port operations

The Memorandum covers a range of joint activities and targets to be implemented across four ports, focusing on reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and promoting circular economy practices. Among the key goals is the installation of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) systems for ro-pax vessels in Paldiski South Harbour and the Port of Kapellskär by 2030, enabling ships to connect to shore power while at berth and thereby reduce CO₂ and noise emissions.

According to Valdo Kalm, CEO of the Port of Tallinn, the collaboration aims to reduce the environmental impact of maritime transport while offering passengers and cargo operators future-oriented, sustainable solutions. In addition to environmental goals, the cooperation also seeks to increase passenger numbers, cargo flows, and ship calls.

Investment in renewable energy solutions

Both ports are also investing in renewable energy solutions. The Port of Tallinn plans to transition to CO₂ emission-free heating and electricity systems at the D-Terminal in Old City Harbour and at Paldiski South Harbour, as well as to deploy solar panels, LED lighting, and other green energy sources.

Ports of Stockholm, in turn, are exploring opportunities for more solar cell installations in Värtahamnen and Kapellskär and explore the possibilities to provide fast charging options for heavy vehicles in the port areas.

Enhancing waste management and circular economy practices

A key focus area of the collaboration is enhancement of waste management and circular economy practices. The Port of Tallinn aims to increase the proportion of ship-generated waste directed to recycling through improved sorting and handling, while Ports of Stockholm are developing solutions for the separate offloading and processing of food waste to produce biogas and reduce hydrogen sulfide levels in sewage treatment systems.

The partners will also assess possibilities for reusing treated greywater, for example for quay flushing, within an ongoing project.

Transition to energy-efficient and zero-emission port operations

Another important goal is the transition to energy-efficient, zero-emission port machinery and transport. The Port of Tallinn will continue the complete conversion to energy-efficient and zero-emission port equipment and promote the use of green taxis, public transport and bicycle infrastructure in port areas.

Ports of Stockholm will follow their port truck strategy for zero-emission cargo handling in the Port of Kapellskär and support further electrification in Värtahamnen to reduce air and noise pollution.

Modernising port terminals with high environmental standards

The cooperation also includes the modernisation of port terminals in line with high environmental standards. The Port of Tallinn will share best practices from the renovation of the D-Terminal and the construction of the new A-Terminal in Old City Harbour, while Ports of Stockholm are rebuilding the Värtahamnen terminal in accordance with the sustainability requirements of Stockholm.

To remind, almost a year ago, Port of Tallinn has announced plans to develop Muuga Harbour and Paldiski South Harbour into leading energy hubs, focusing on sustainable and efficient energy solutions. Around the same time, Ports of Stockholm announced a project that combines onshore power supply (OPS) and microgrid technology to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency and increase port capacity.

The MoU was signed by Valdo Kalm, CEO, Port of Tallinn and Anders Nordlund, Harbour Master, Ports of Stockholm.

Magdalena Bosson, CEO of Ports of Stockholm, highlighted the joint responsibility and ambition that unite the two countries.

Sweden and Estonia share the same sea and the same responsibility to protect it. By working together, we can accelerate the green transition across the Baltic Sea region and make maritime transport cleaner, and more efficient

This detailed study analyses 73,353 containership voyages completed by 4,750 vessels between July and September 2025, revealing critical patterns in containerships fleet performance as the industry approaches crucial compliance deadlines.

Using enriched primary data captured at the vessel and voyage level, the report examines maritime performance across multiple dimensions - vessel size, age, shipbuilding origin, and specific trade routes - providing stakeholders with the granular analysis necessary for informed decision-making in an increasingly complex operational environment.

Key findings from VesselBot's vessel-level monitoring and analysis reveal:

Emissions Stabilization Amid Traffic Growth: Total containership emissions reached 50.3 million tons in Q3 2025, remaining virtually unchanged (-0.2%) compared to Q3 2024 despite a 2.3% increase in voyages. Average well-to-wake emissions intensity improved to 195.9 g CO2e/TEU km, down 1.6% year-over-year, driven by longer steaming times and reduced port dwell times.

Trade Tensions Reshape Routing: Direct China-U.S. voyages showed pronounced volatility, declining 3% in the first nine months of 2025 but spiking 15% in July before dropping 10% in September. China's retaliatory port fees targeting U.S.-owned, operated, or built vessels introduce additional complexity to carrier deployment strategies.

Persistent Vessel Size Efficiency Gaps: Well-to-wake emissions intensity varies dramatically by vessel size, from 252.1 g CO2e/TEU km for Feeder vessels (up to 2,999 TEU capacity) to 61.4 for Very Large Container Ships (at least 17,000 TEU capacity). Feeder vessels completed 62.1% of all Q3 voyages yet accounted for only 10.3% of total TEU km, while VLCS completed just 2% of voyages, accounting for 17.2% of total TEU km, which reflects their significantly higher efficiency levels.

Shipbuilding Origin Influences Deployment: Chinese-built vessels completed 36% of Q3 voyages, while 53.1% of vessels under 5 years old have been built from Chinese shipyards. South Korean-built vessels carried out 24.6% of all Q3 containership voyages, but 41.3% of all VLCS. South Korean built vessels' voyages recorded the lowest emissions intensity at 152.7 g CO2e/TEU km due to larger capacities and long-haul trade deployment.

Route-Specific Performance Variations: Major fronthaul trades demonstrate the importance of route-level analysis, with Asia-Northern Europe voyages averaging an intensity of 55.3 g CO2e/TEU km and a duration of 30.6 days In contrast, industry-wide average steaming time was only 3.5 days, highlighting how aggregate metrics obscure critical operational differences.

""The regulatory landscape is growing more complex rather than simplified, as evidenced by the European Parliament rejection of the Omnibus simplification effort and the IMO's postponement of the Net-Zero Framework,"" noted C. Komodromos, CEO & Founder of VesselBot. ""With CBAM certification requirements beginning in weeks and Scope 3 reporting deadlines approaching, maritime stakeholders require granular, real-time data to navigate diverging compliance requirements across multiple jurisdictions. Industry averages fail to capture the significant performance variations between vessel sizes, ages, and routes that directly impact both compliance costs and operational efficiency. VesselBot's voyage-level analysis reveals that containership intensity can vary significantly depending on vessel characteristics; insights that are invisible in aggregated data but critical for strategic decision-making in an increasingly carbon-constrained environment.""

We’re bridging maritime expertise and modern technology, delivering solutions that mainly help ship owners and charterers secure the best possible conditions for profitable growth, while reducing complexity and operational costs.

For many years, bunker procurement has been characterized by inefficiency and outdated practices. Manual quotation requests, fragmented communication across email, reliance on spreadsheets, and rapid decision-making without access to comprehensive data have long been standard procedure. This approach is time-consuming, stressful, and inherently risky. XMAR identified these challenges and developed a platform that streamlines the entire process from end to end. The system integrates strategic fuel procurement with intelligent voyage planning, providing real-time supplier visibility, optimized routing, and bunker scheduling that adapts to port availability and weather conditions. This results in fewer deviations, reduced idle time, and minimized fuel waste — ultimately lowering emissions and increasing operational efficiency. Importantly, XMAR’s platform has been designed to serve the full spectrum of industry stakeholders. It is accessible not only to large fleets with dedicated procurement and technical teams but also to smaller operators with lean organizational structures. By democratizing access to digital tools, XMAR enables broader industry participation in the transition toward more sustainable and data-driven operations.

Fincantieri S.p.A. received the 2025 GREEN4SEA – EUROPORT Initiative Award for its ‘’Wave 2 the Future’’ which is a flagship innovation project to pioneer hydrogen-based propulsion systems for maritime applications. Other short-listed nominees were: BERG Propulsion, Columbia Group, NatPower Marine, Port of Rotterdam, Tallinn Shipyard | BLRT REPAIR YARDS.

Accepting the award on behalf of the winner, Enrico Bigi, VP Special Projects, Fincantieri S.p.A., said: ‘’ For over 240 years, we’ve been building ships and – more than that – we’ve been keeping the edge of innovation building best-in-class ships. Innovation is part of our DNA, and we’ve always seen challenges, not obstacles, as opportunities to move forward.

Today, one of the challenges we face is making that future of maritime sustainable. “Wave 2 the Future” is how we’re stepping up. It’s not just a project, it’s how we answer ambitious challenges.’

‘’Wave 2 the Future’’ is part of a broader European initiative to accelerate the green transition through strategic industrial ecosystems. The project focuses on the development of hybrid propulsion systems powered by hydrogen (e.g. fuel cells or reciprocating engines) and on the design of hydrogen-powered combined cycles for onboard power generation. Promising technologies are tested under operational conditions, onboard real ships. As a first result of developing hydrogen technologies, on April 8th, 2025 Fincantieri and Viking announced the first cruise ship in the world to be powered by hydrogen stored onboard for both propulsion and onboard electricity generation, the “Viking Libra”. The vessel is currently under construction at the Fincantieri Ancona shipyard, with delivery scheduled for late 2026. ,Wave 2 the Future initiative is a cornerstone of Fincantieri’s decarbonization roadmap, which anticipates the IMO’s 2050 net-zero targets by 15 years, aiming to achieve them by 2035. Wave 2 the Future is part of the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on Hydrogen, a framework that supports breakthrough innovation across the EU. Within this context, Fincantieri is developing this comprehensive program structured in H2Tech, the first of the 4 IPCEI “waves” on Hydrogen. Together, the 4 IPCEI waves form a complete ecosystem to enable and scale hydrogen adoption in the maritime sector.

Deltamarin received the 2025 GREEN4SEA – EUROPORT Ship Design Award for leading the EU-funded Project CHEK that explored ways to create a more sustainable maritime industry, listed as a Research and Innovation Project success story. Other short-listed nominees were: Besiktas Shipyard, Damen, Fincantieri S.p.A, Norden Shipyard, Ulstein.

Accepting the award on behalf of the winner, Mika Koli, Sales Manager, Offshore, Deltamarin, said: ‘’This recognition means a lot to us, because energy efficiency and smart ship design has always been part of what we do. Today, that same mindset guides our work on future-proof vessels, combining hybrid propulsion systems, advanced energy management and optimized hydrodynamics into balanced, complete ship concepts.

In the CHEK project, our role has been to develop two conceptual ship designs that demonstrate significant energy savings and readiness for new clean fuels.

In May 2024, Deltamarin finished the three-year long EU-funded project called CHEK. Project CHEK involved 15 consortium partners with a focus on decarbonising long-distance shipping. Deltamarin played a central role in the project by orchestrating the decarbonisation methods for the conceptual vessel designs. A future-proof vessel (FPV) design platform was the tool and focus of the development, which allows holistic evaluation of ship energy and environmental efficiency as early as at the ship conceptual design stage. The FPV design platform consists of several digital layers such as ship volume and structural layer (DeltaWay), ship operational propulsion power layer (DeltaSeas) and ship system level energy model (DeltaKey). The various layers have strong connections to each other, but independent analysis can be performed, which is typically necessary in practical project work. The digital design layers are an input to the latest dimension in Deltamarin’s toolbox: life cycle assessment (LCA). The numerous design variations studied during ship conceptual design can now also be analysed in terms of their impact on the ship life time, also considering the upstream energy and material flows and end-of-life stage.

Concluding the event, the winners of the 2025 GREEN4SEA Europort Awards participated in a dedicated panel discussion, sharing their perspectives on the latest green shipping trends shaping the industry. During the session, they reflected on the significance of this recognition for both themselves and the wider maritime community, outlined the key priorities on their sustainability agendas, and discussed the sector’s ongoing progress in improving environmental performance. The panel also examined the actions still required to accelerate the transition to a greener future and highlighted the one change that could deliver a truly profound impact on shipping’s environmental footprint.

After a successful collaboration in 2019 and 2023, SAFETY4SEA and Europort once again this year joined forces to present a total of 15 Awards at special events during the exhibition days.

The winners were those who attracted the most votes by the end of a voting period which was held online during a three-month period. The process included a combination of open nomination and voting which provided a unique opportunity for all nominees to get acknowledged for the hard and good work they put into their projects and initiatives, worth to be awarded.

The existence of an Environmental Policy has risen to 99%, and for the first time, 100% of ports report having defined environmental improvement objectives. Communication of environmental policies has also reached new records. 95% of ports share their policies with stakeholders, and 91% publish them online, underscoring the sector’s commitment to transparency and public engagement.

Regulatory imperative

The Fit for 55 regulations, particularly AFIR and FuelEU, are having a significant impact on ports and present considerable challenges. The growing availability of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) connection points across ports reflects long-standing efforts by the sector, independent of regulatory obligations.

While this indicator does not measure member states’ compliance with the 2030 targets, it clearly shows that ports have been proactively working on OPS since well before the introduction of current regulations.

New indicators in 2025 on the availability of alternative fuels in ports shows that port managers are actively supporting the energy transition in line with their landlord and community building functions. This figure is expected to rise further, provided there is sufficient demand for these fuels.

At a time of increasingly stringent environmental requirements—both in terms of reporting and compliance—it is essential to demonstrate how ports voluntarily strive to improve their surroundings and reduce the environmental impact of port activities

… commented Tim Verhoeven, ESPO Senior Policy Advisor and EcoPorts Coordinator.

Environmental monitoring

The monitoring section tracks how ports assess environmental aspects such as air quality, noise, water quality, and energy use, while also highlighting progress in climate adaptation. In 2025, 95% of ports report conducting environmental monitoring, with the most frequently monitored issues being port waste (87%), energy efficiency (84%), ship waste (84%), and water quality (79%).

A growing share of ports now faces operational disruptions due to climate change (69%), with 77% adapting existing infrastructure and 86% integrating adaptation into new developments, demonstrating a strong shift toward climate-resilient planning, an important trend for the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy and the European Oceans Pact.

Zero-emission ambitions

This year’s report introduces a new focus on ports’ zero-emission ambitions, in line with Europe’s broader climate objectives, including the forthcoming EU Ports Strategy on decarbonisation and energy transition, and the European Green Deal. The results show that 80% of ports have established their own GHG reduction targets where required, while 66% have defined air emissions reduction targets and report compliance with local authority requirements.

However, only 37% of ports report the existence of low-emission zones or emission standards at berth.

These measures often require coordination with local and national authorities, and their implementation raises concerns about ensuring a level playing field between ports and Member States.

The implementation of FuelEU Maritime Regulation will provide an EU-wide framework, requiring certain vessels to connect to Onshore Power Supply (OPS) from 2030-2035, which is expected to address this issue more consistently.

Encouragingly, 53% of ports have adopted zero-emission targets for port-related activities, signalling an increasing commitment to contribute to climate neutrality by 2050.

Top environmental priorities

This year’s report also provides insights into the top 10 environmental priorities identified by ports. Climate change, air quality and energy efficiency are the top three concerns, reflecting the sector’s focus on decarbonisation and resilience. Other high-ranking priorities include port development, noise and water quality.

This year’s results confirm the continued expansion of green services to shipping, such as Onshore Power Supply (OPS), LNG bunkering, and environmentally differentiated port dues.

In 2025, 62% of ports offer OPS, 50% of them with high voltage, and 51% provide LNG bunkering, reflecting strong progress in alternative energy infrastructure.

For the use of new fuels for shipping, such as hydrogen and biofuels, is starting to gain relevance. Environmentally differentiated dues, used by 61% of ports, reward cleaner shipping and reinforce ports’ role in maritime decarbonisation.

Clean fuels for road transport

The report also tracks developments in clean fuels for cars and trucks, reflecting ports’ growing role in supporting the decarbonisation of road transport. As of 2025, 95% of ports report having electricity charging stations for cars and trucks, up from 85% the previous year, demonstrating strong momentum in electrification efforts.

In contrast, hydrogen fuelling infrastructure remains limited, with only 8% of ports offering this service.

Conclusion

According to ESPO, together, these findings confirm that European ports are making meaningful strides toward improved environmental performance, stronger governance, and climate action.

Continued progress in areas such as climate adaptation, clean energy infrastructure, and staff training will be essential to maintain momentum and meet the EU’s sustainability goals in the decade ahead.

ESPO’s Environmental Report is a cornerstone of the EcoPorts initiative, designed to champion environmental sustainability in European ports. This year’s edition draws upon data collected from 77 European ports across 18 countries. Through the EcoPorts Self-Diagnosis Method (SDM), ports submit a wide range of environmental data, providing the basis for the report.

The 2025 Environmental Report once again highlights the positive progress ports are making in environmental management. It introduces new and relevant indicators and outlines the top priorities for EcoPorts

And that 3% is the terminal being able to provide one berth for shore power.","Collaboration, shore power and getting the industry to net zero are among the main focuses for Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) chief executive Bud Darr.

Mr Darr joined CLIA as president and chief executive in February 2025, marking a return, having previously held the post of senior vice president of technical and regulatory affairs from 2010 to 2017. Prior to his return to CLIA, Mr Darr served as executive vice president, maritime policy and government affairs at MSC Group for nearly eight years.

PST caught up with him at the annual Interferry conference, held in Sorrento, in October 2025, where Mr Darr gave a keynote speech.

“I’m thrilled to be back at CLIA,” he says. “Every day is better than the day before. It’s a great group of people. I took time and effort to go round the world and meet every one of our staff so I’m glad I did that; I’m more in touch with our people and connected to leaderships and local communities.”

He says having worked for a cruise line on his return means he has “extensively more knowledge and experience. It helps me to keep the broader picture in my mind and look at opportunities to work at a higher level with others in the maritime community”.

Some 12 years ago, CLIA grew rapidly through a consolidation of various entities to create greater efficiency and alignment across the cruise community, reflecting the direction and priorities of its member lines. This forms part of Mr Darr’s vision for the association. “I want to complete the transformation, so we look and feel and move as one organisation globally that shares resources among the areas we operate in around the world.”

Another focus for Mr Darr is collaborating with other sectors of the maritime community. Indeed, a clear example is his attendance and speech at Interferry’s conference. And straight after, he was flying to International Ports and Harbours Association’s (IAPH) conference in Kobe, Japan, to ink an MoU between the former and CLIA.

He expands, “I am focused on building higher levels of collaboration with other organisations, such as the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association.” He also singles out CLIA’s recent 10-year agreement with Seatrade.

“Our MoU with IAPH is a co-operation to identify areas of mutual interest, of which they are many. I have an open mind as to how to work together. I have also stayed very close to the International Chamber of Shipping and BIMCO, looking to better enhance what we bring to the table. I want to put serving the needs of our members front and centre and think about what we grow into.”

Turning to some of the challenges facing the industry, he speaks about shore power. Some 60% of CLIA’S members’ fleet (166 ships) have shoreside power, a number that is expected to grow to 273 ships by 2036. But by contrast, less than 3% of ports that cruise ships call at provide shore power, and they provide power for only one ship.

Mr Darr says, “The first and most obvious thing is that our members must ready themselves and have done the engineering so that when it becomes available, they have the equipment installed. We are helping to make sure the regulations are fit for purpose and are working with ports to determine which ones are the best candidates. On top of this, shore power needs to meet the technical standards that are well developed, be offered at a competitive price and come from a source that is environmentally sound. We are helping to bring these pieces together and make connections,” Mr Darr says, adding, “It is difficult to suggest 100% readiness on ships when there is 3% readiness in places we are going to call. And that 3% is the terminal being able to provide one berth for shore power. On the shipboard side there is a very high degree of confidence. On the shore side, if society and the political leadership think it is important, it will happen.”

But there is, he points out, a large challenge to overcome, the availability of grid density. “If smaller communities need the power, those ports are not going to have the extra grid density available. Some large ports sometimes have challenges here – it is not just about the equipment, it is having the electrons available while still serving the community.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/Bud_Darr_photo_MSC_Group1_Main.png,N,,2025-11-05 09:56:19.282724

Maritime transport carries over 80% of global goods and accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. Ports, as nodes of global trade, require an estimated $1-2 trillion in cumulative investment through 2050 for shore power electrification, alternative fuel bunkering infrastructure and zero-emission cargo-handling equipment. Yet approximately $200 billion in sustainability-linked capital remains untapped due to technical, financial, and regulatory barriers facing port authorities.

C40 Cities, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) launched on 4 November the Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan (SLL) Initiative at the C40 World Mayors Summit. The partnership as stated, aims to unlock investment in sustainable port infrastructure and accelerate the maritime sector’s just transition to net-zero.

Ports are gateways of international trade, and this global framework sets a new precedent, sending clear signals to the market and accelerating the pace and scale of climate finance for critical investments in zero-emission port infrastructure.

…said Andrea Fernandez, Managing Director of Climate Finance, Knowledge, and Partnerships, C40 Cities.

As explained, the initiative establishes the first global framework specifically tailored to deploy Sustainability-Linked Loans for port decarbonisation projects worldwide.

The initiative builds on extensive groundwork, including market assessments and lender outreach to 30 commercial banks, confirming strong support for standardised port SLL frameworks. Furthermore, the partnership formalises the Memorandum of Understanding signed between IFC and C40 in September 2024, moving beyond information-sharing to active co-leadership of sector-wide financial mobilisation.

The Global Port Sustainability-Linked Loan initiative marks an important step forward for further collaboration between ports, loan providers, and regulators. These land-based investments can fund long-term infrastructure and support offtake agreements for low and zero-carbon shipping fuels and liquid bulk transport.

Container vessels now command 65% of all alternative-fuel orders, with dual-fuel configurations dominating 79% of the current orderbook.

LNG-fueled container vessels represent more than a technical fix for carbon emissions.","As global shipping navigates the treacherous waters between decarbonization mandates and geopolitical upheaval, liquefied natural gas has emerged as the container industry’s fuel of choice a pragmatic wager that’s reshaping maritime energy politics.

LNG-fueled container vessels are positioned for continued expansion despite regulatory uncertainty, driven by practical advantages over methanol and immediate decarbonization benefits.

However, this growth trajectory intersects with escalating geopolitical tensions around energy security, trade protectionism, and shipping infrastructure vulnerabilities.

LNG-fueled container ship orders nearly doubled from 194 vessels in late 2023 to 362 by mid-October 2025, even as overall alternative-fuel orders dropped to just 52% of the previous year’s levels.

Container vessels now command 65% of all alternative-fuel orders, with dual-fuel configurations dominating 79% of the current orderbook.

Container operators are betting on LNG’s practical advantages over competitors like methanol, which remains constrained by limited supply and stubbornly high prices.

LNG delivers immediate benefits: a 20% reduction in carbon emissions, widespread infrastructure availability, and operational flexibility that proves invaluable when trade routes shift unexpectedly.

The Ukraine war accelerated what climate policy alone couldn’t achieve. Desperate to replace Russian pipeline gas, Europe built seven new LNG terminals in the Baltic region between October 2022 and March 2024. Germany alone commissioned five facilities a breakneck pace enabled by emergency legislation that swept aside normal bureaucratic procedures.

This infrastructure boom creates a virtuous cycle for maritime LNG adoption. As terminals proliferate, bunkering becomes easier. As more ships burn LNG, terminal economics improve. The container industry finds itself riding a wave of geopolitical necessity disguised as energy transition.

Yet this transition unfolds against deepening US-China antagonism that threatens to reshape global shipbuilding.

China controls 53.3% of global shipbuilding capacity while the US limps along at 0.1%. Chinese yards lead in constructing LNG-capable vessels, but Washington’s proposed docking fees targeting Chinese-built ships introduce a costly dilemma for carriers.

The Red Sea crisis exposes how regional instability can upend even the best-laid plans.

Houthi attacks forced container ships to reroute around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, adding 70% to journey lengths and fuel consumption. For LNG vessels, this means burning more gas to achieve the same emissions reductions a reminder that geopolitics can erase technical advantages overnight.

The disruption also highlights dual-fuel vessels’ strategic value. When routes lengthen unexpectedly or fuel prices spike, the ability to switch between LNG and conventional bunkers becomes a critical hedge against uncertainty.

The market’s trajectory depends on which forces dominate.

If the IMO delivers regulatory clarity by October 2026, orders could surge past 500 vessels. But protectionist escalation could choke supply, stalling growth around 380-400 vessels as Western yards struggle to fill the gap.

A prolonged Red Sea crisis validates dual-fuel flexibility but strains LNG supply chains.

Chinese economic weakness might slow orders while maintaining long-term momentum. Most likely, extreme energy price volatility driven by multiple conflicts will accelerate adoption as operators prize fuel-switching capability above all else.

LNG-fueled container vessels represent more than a technical fix for carbon emissions. They’ve become strategic assets in a fragmenting global order, where energy security, trade tensions, and maritime chokepoints intersect with climate imperatives.

The International Maritime Organization’s delayed Net-Zero Framework symbolizes this complexity industry momentum for decarbonization persists despite regulatory uncertainty, driven by commercial logic and geopolitical necessity rather than policy mandates alone.

What emerges is a shipping sector navigating by multiple stars: environmental targets, fuel economics, infrastructure availability, and the hard realities of a world where trade routes can become battlegrounds overnight.

In this environment, LNG’s dominance reflects not perfection but pragmatism a transitional solution for transitional times, when the destination remains clear even as the path keeps shifting.

The container industry’s LNG bet will likely pay off, but not quite as planned.

Gustad Hormazdi, Business Development Director, Maritime, DNV made the following observation during ‘The Rise of LNG as a Sustainable Marine Fuel’ panel discussion session at the Asia Gas Markets Conference 2025 on Tuesday (28 October).

Hormazdi highlighted the complex interplay between demand, supply, and regulatory clarity as hurdles for the maritime industry’s transition towards decarbonisation, including for the adoption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a bunker fuel.

While there has been a large number of LNG-fuelled vessels on order, the supply infrastructure for LNG bunkering needs to keep pace. He observed shipyards in China and Korea are demonstrating a strong appetite for building LNG Bunker vessels, indicating scaling up production can be achieved once demand solidifies.

However, he cautioned investor hesitation persists due to regulatory uncertainty, despite motivators such as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).

“DNV actively works with energy companies, charterers, and owners to analyse various scenarios and has even submitted a white paper to the IMO (Report of the Comprehensive impact assessment of the basket of candidate GHG reduction mid-term measures) on tariffs and penalty schemes to help shape acceptable policy routes,” he shared.

Addressing DNV’s stance, Hormazdi explained its Maritime Forecast to 2050 and Energy Transition Outlook reports advocate for a balanced and pragmatic approach to the life cycle assessment of marine fuels. This position aims to support early adopters by preventing overly theoretical approaches that could hinder investment in renewable and near-zero fuels.

Regarding the IMO’s decision to delay the Net-Zero Framework, Hormazdi described it as an delay in decision making noting while April 2025 targets were initially well-received subsequent discussions revealed numerous unresolved technical and governance issues.

These included questions about compensating for near-zero fuels, correction factors (within the guidelines related to GFI), specific lifecycle assessment methodologies, and the management of a proposed fund of between USD 10 to 15 billion annually.

He noted 57 countries voted in favour of adjournment, 49 countries opposed, and 21 abstained – underscoring divided opinions towards adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

Moving ahead, Hormazdi suggested “book-and-claim” mechanisms for biomethane could accelerate decarbonisation provided if issues of trust, assurance, and tagging are adequately addressed.

He also acknowledged the positive impact of the EU ETS and other decarbonisation measures on marine fuel choices, leading to immediate offsets for using energy.

Global marine insurer NorthStandard on Monday (3 November) shared more information regarding the one-year US-China port fee suspension:

The United States and China have agreed to a one-year suspension of their respective port service fees on vessels with a US or Chinese nexus, effective 10 November 2025. The agreement follows trade discussions and aims to stabilise maritime and economic relations between both nations.

Further to press reports of a trade deal reached between the United States and China on 30 October 2025, the White House has published a Fact Sheet dated 1 November 2025, available here.

The Fact Sheet confirms that a “trade and economic deal” was reached in the Republic of Korea between U.S. President Donald J. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China. It includes the following statement regarding suspension of the US service fees imposed on vessels with a Chinese nexus:

The United States will suspend for one year, starting on November 10, 2025, implementation of the responsive actions taken pursuant to the Section 301 investigation on China’s Targeting the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance. In the meantime, the United States will negotiate with China pursuant to Section 301 while continuing its historic cooperation with the Republic of Korea and Japan on revitalizing American shipbuilding.

The PRC Ministry of Commerce has also reported on the agreement (Chinese version only), available here.

According to that report, the United States will suspend its Section 301 measures first, after which China will reciprocally suspend its special port fees on vessels with a US nexus.

Accordingly, if the United States duly implements its suspension on 10 November 2025, China is expected to suspend its countermeasures against vessels with a US nexus for the same one-year period.

Further clarification is awaited, including whether fees will continue to be charged in the interim period up to 10 November 2025. No details have yet been published on this or on any potential refund or claw-back mechanism for fees already paid or payable in the interim period, although there are reports that some ship operators are engaging U.S. counsel to seek guidance from the relevant US authorities.

As advised previously, should members be unsure about how the port fees will affect them, they should seek US or PRC legal advice as appropriate, or contact the Club’s dedicated US-China Tariffs team or their usual Club contact for further assistance.

French shipping giant CMA CGM on Tuesday (4 November) announced the entry into the fleet and registration under the French flag of ten Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) dual-fuel vessels, each with a capacity of 24,212 TEUs, among the largest and most energy-efficient in the world.

By choosing France, CMA CGM said it is making a powerful statement in favour of French maritime and logistical sovereignty on the global stage.

Rodolphe Saadé, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the CMA CGM Group, said: “CMA CGM has decided to register ten new 24,000 TEU vessels, among the largest in the world, under the French flag starting next year.

“Powered by liquefied natural gas, they reflect our confidence in France’s maritime sector and its people, with the recruitment of 135 French seafarers and a strengthened partnership with the French Maritime Academy (ENSM).

“These vessels will serve two major French ports, Le Havre and Dunkirk, on the Asia–Northern Europe route, reinforcing our presence in France at a time when the sea plays an increasingly strategic role in global economic and geopolitical dynamics.”

These vessels, among the largest container ships in the world, will operate under French law in terms of safety and working conditions, thus upholding the excellence and influence of the French flag.

These LNG dual-fuel vessels are compatible with biomethane and e-methane, two low-carbon alternative fuels that reduce CO2 emissions by 67% and 85% respectively, while significantly cutting atmospheric pollutants, including sulfur oxides, fine particles, and nitrogen oxides.

Thanks to their large capacity, which improves carbon intensity, these vessels concretely illustrate the CMA CGM Group’s commitment to more sustainable and responsible shipping.

Each will bear the name of an iconic French monument or landmark:

CMA CGM NOTRE DAME, CMA CGM PANTHÉON, CMA CGM ORSAY,

CMA CGM LUXEMBOURG, CMA CGM PONT NEUF, CMA CGM VERSAILLES,

The revised discussion on 19 November 2025, IMO MEPC 83: What next?, addresses how the delay reframed industry thinking on carbon and shipping, the likely effects on tanker operations and trade, the weight of regional regulation during the pause, how the framework could still progress despite the adjournment, and what the sector should anticipate heading into MEPC 84.

The confirmed line-up comprised ABS manager, global sustainability Ilias Soultanias; Braemar global head of decarbonisation and fuel transition Joey Ng; DNV senior vice president and global segment director for tankers Catrine Vestereng; IPTA general manager Mike Beviss; and MOL (Asia Oceania) general manager – carbon solutions (A) Capt Ashutosh Kumar.

The adjournment stemmed from the need to complete guideline work, including financial architecture, rather than a reversal of direction.

That interpretation shapes the panel’s new brief: tanker stakeholders should plan on the basis that the overall trajectory persisted while the detail matured.

Commercial contributions to the briefing emphasised that regional measures would continue to shape exposure during the interval, and that includes ongoing obligations linked to regimes in the UK, Turkey, parts of Africa and the EU.

The delay following MEPC 83 also highlights immature credit markets for low-carbon fuels, uneven operating experience with biofuel pathways and upward pressure on biofuel costs.

These elements, taken together, reinforced the message that owners and charterers needed to price compliance, not pause it.

The delay at MEPC 83 does not impact other regulations, and the panel will discuss short-term compliance levers within EU regimes.

Flexibility mechanisms under FuelEU Maritime – including pooling, banking and borrowing – were presented as tools that could reduce aggregate exposure when applied across mixed fleets.

This includes the documentation and data-management demands for operators whose trade lanes created EU touchpoints, including voyages by non-EU operators that triggered regulatory obligations through port calls.

The purpose of this panel is to give tanker market participants a clear reading of the adjournment’s operational implications and to set expectations for the period leading to MEPC 84, and the working assumption is that owners could not defer choices until a final vote and that disciplined preparation – technical, commercial and administrative – would be required while guideline work continued.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/181/IMO_Building_source_IMOwebzhgf_Main.png,N,,2025-11-04 13:56:41.788612

It's already identified new wetlands and rewetted peatlands as ""areas of opportunity"" to pull more carbon out of the atmosphere.

Climate Change Minister Simon Watts released the new 'Assessment Framework for Carbon Removals' on Tuesday night.

It signalled the coalition's desire to amend the Climate Change Response Act (CCRA) to recognise new carbon removal activities in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

""Now change that we're proposing won't automatically mean that that will be effective, but it creates an effect, a mechanism for us to be able to in a future point in time, recognise and reward those activities in the ETS which will make it faster and simpler as and when we do that,"" Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said.

The minister said New Zealand needed to be more ""agnostic"" about how the country removed carbon, scoping out past just forestry.

""At the moment the market only recognises forestry, particularly exotics and some forms of natives, as the only mechanism that sequesters carbon. We know that scientifically, that's not the case.

""There are other aspects within the broader ecosystem that do sequester carbon, including quite significant areas of opportunity in the blue carbon space in terms of oceans, soil sequestration, wetlands and other considerations like that.""

The government was still working out how new methods of carbon removal could be rewarded, Watts said.

""You could recognise or reward sequestration either through the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme or thorugh a voluntary carbon market using a biodiversity credit.

""We're not set on this one or the other,"" he said.

The minister said the framework released this week was ""a first step"" and he was committed to proceeding with caution, given the range of scientific criteria other countries had adopted.

""We want to make sure that if we do put this in place that it's done so in a credible way.""

Changes to the Climate Change Response Act

On top of the carbon removals framework, the government set out a raft of changes it would make to the CCRA.

They include:

Removing or fixing unnecessary, complex or duplicative requirements in the Climate Change Response Act. This includes removing the need for the Climate Change Commission to provide advice on policy direction prior to an emissions reduction plan being developed by the government and removing duplicative consultation requirements, for both the commission and the government.

Improving functions of the NZ ETS (amending the Industrial Allocation settings, changing the annual ETS settings process to a biennial one, removing the requirement for ETS Settings to accord with Nationally Determined Contributions)

Expanding opportunities for other types of carbon removals to be recognised in the NZ ETS in the future.

Other technical updates to make it easier for stakeholders to comply with the requirements of the CCRA.

Watts said the CCRA had been in place for a while and needed to be changed to ""increase the efficiency and reduce the amount of bureaucracy and duplication"" embedded in it when it was drafted.

""We now know and have experience across multiple climate ministers and multiple governments of the reality of what this legislation is in terms of operationalising that.

""I think it would be fair to say that a wide range of climate ministers, since the implementation of this bill, would have had a degree of appetite and also identification that there's some aspects within the bill that are not necessarily deriving the intended outcomes of the bill and are unnecessary or duplicative.

""So we are simply using the opportunity to make those changes and clear it up and as a result of that, it creates more capacity within our system and particularly our public system, to focus on the actions required in order to meet our targets and reduce emissions.""

The government would introduce an amendment bill to the Climate Change Response Act to make these changes next year.

It's also decided to change the neutrality goal for the Carbon Neutral Government Programme from 2025 to 2050.

""This change acknowledges that the original 2025 deadline was too soon for organisations to reduce their emissions enough to meet carbon neutrality,"" Watts said

""The new deadline also aligns with New Zealand's broader, legislated 2050 net zero target.""",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--bsvIFbeg--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1759259731/4K087UG_Image_2_jfif?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-11-04 13:01:08.563135

For the rest, the 17M tonnes, you are on Mozambique to the rest of the world, and the shipping intensity is probably 0.9 or 1 ship per million tonnes.
The number, according to Mr Berterottière’s educated estimate, is 151 new vessels.","French liquefied gas tank specialist GTT’s chief executive Philippe Berterottière foresees the need for another dozen-dozen or so LNG carrier (LNGC) newbuilds to ferry the millions of tonnes per annum (mta) of LNG that is due to hit markets in the late 2020s and early 2030s.

The newbuilding prediction rests on final investment decisions (FIDs) taken on LNG projects through the middle of 2025. In total, those projects are expected to produce some 84M tonnes of LNG each year.

Mr Berterottière’s estimations of the need for ""close to around 150"" new LNGCs is a better than back-of-the-envelope calculation by one of the companies that stands to gain sizeable contracts associated with the uptick in newbuild orders.

The majority of the LNG volumes expected will come from projects sanctioned in the US, with US President Trump following through on a campaign promise to end a Biden-era moratorium on granting LNG export permits if elected to a second term.

According to Mr Berterottière, about 80% of the total volume of LNG that’s been sanctioned in 2025 has come from the US, and the export of those volumes is linked to a higher ’shipping intensity’, or more vessels needed to carry the same amounts that fewer vessels carry on projects enacted in other areas of the world.

""On the number of ships, what we can say on the 84 mta is that 17 [mta] are not from Gulf of Mexico or Gulf of America, so to speak, to the rest of the world,"" Mr Berterottière said.

The cranes will run entirely on onboard batteries charged by grid electricity, ensuring efficient energy consumption and zero tailpipe emissions. The order was booked in Q3 2025 and delivery is scheduled for Q1 2027.

The greenfield container terminal is designed to set new benchmarks for container handling in India. The 30 Konecranes RTGs will underpin yard operations and drive the terminal’s eco-efficiency mission.

All of the cranes will be fitted with Konecranes’ E-Hybrid technology, which can be configured in different ways for fully electric operation with zero tailpipe emissions. The terminal has selected a busbar-and-battery configuration. The RTGs are fully powered by onboard battery packs, allowing continued operations even if grid power is lost. The batteries are charged dynamically by the busbar power supply based on need during operation.

Konecranes’ E-Hybrid technology reduces peak power demand to only 60 kW per RTG, compared with up to 400 kW for traditional electric RTGs. This eases pressure on the local grid and reduces capital expenditure on electrical substations.

“This greenfield project shows how far Konecranes E-Hybrid technology has come. We’re demonstrating to the wider container handling industry that large terminals can now launch with fully electric operations, even if their grid supply is unreliable. This is a new reference point for terminal design and investment in Ecolifting,” says Shyam Pathak, Sales Director, Konecranes, Port Solutions.

Ecolifting is Konecranes’ vision to increase its handprint – meaning the beneficial environmental impact that can be achieved with our product and service portfolio – while reducing customers’ carbon footprints. From eco-optimizing diesel drives, to hybridization and fully-electrified fleets, we will continue to do more with less.

__________________ Fueling the Conversation, a weekly column by IER President Tom Pyle, offers a principled take on energy events.","Fueling The Conversation, Week of November 3rd, 2025

From the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has a long history of setting strict global climate goals, requiring countries to forgo energy freedom and adopt net-zero mandates with no consideration of their effect on our pocketbooks.

While the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has played the most prominent role in pushing the transition to net-zero, the most recent effort comes from a lesser-known agency: the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Established in 1958 with the stated purpose of facilitating international cooperation on the high seas, the IMO has re-oriented its focus on safety, efficiency, and pollution mitigation to include “tackling the climate crisis.”

Citing the UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 — which directs all countries to “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts” — the IMO adopted a “GHG Strategy” that sets a goal of net-zero shipping by 2050. In doing so, the IMO included some “mid-term” measures to try and achieve this goal, which involve setting a marine fuel standard and greenhouse gas emissions pricing mechanism — i.e., a first-of-its-kind global carbon tax targeting global shipping. With almost no one paying attention, the IMO tried to reach beyond its scope of authority and reinvent the shipping industry. In April, the IMO approved a draft regulation for the carbon tax. They would’ve gotten away with it if not for President Trump.

Carbon taxes are a red line that most self-respecting U.S. politicians have been unwilling to cross, as evidenced by the failure of the 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act, an attempt to implement a greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system. It’s no surprise, therefore, that the IMO’s proposal relies on heavy support from climate catastrophists in the European Union.

Proponents point out that the $11-13 billion in annual revenue generated from the tax by 2030 would go towards IMO investments in helping the industry transition to greener shipping. But there is a reason why the industry hasn’t already invested in this transition. Low-carbon fuel alternatives, such as ammonia and methanol, have lower energy densities than traditional fuels, which requires ships to have larger storage capacity or refuel more than twice as often as conventional ships, according to the Global Maritime Forum. All this extra space and stoppage make each trip longer and less fruitful; when applied to the world’s fleet, these consequences would be disastrous.

Shipping is the most essential transportation mechanism for the global economy. Representing around 90% of global trade, over 50,000 merchant ships are responsible for transporting many of the products and raw materials people across the world rely on, ranging from automobiles to liquified natural gas. With the industry accounting for only 3% of global carbon emissions and 11% of life-cycle carbon emissions for the transportation sector, while also being instrumental to avoiding supply chain disruptions, it’s clear that the economic effects of forcing a transition to lower-carbon alternatives would heavily outweigh any climate benefits derived from the tax.

Even if Europe could shoulder these costs (though why they would want to is beyond me), the reality is that much of the world remains energy poor, meaning that any additional fee on transporting the vital products they require could cost lives — not just far in the future, as climate extremists predict, but now.

People across the world should be grateful that the Trump administration had the conviction to stand up to Europe and oppose the tax. Via a joint statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, the administration threatened to impose visa restrictions, port fees, and sanctions on the individuals and states supporting the IMO’s net-zero framework, calling it a “neocolonial export of global climate regulations.” This pressure contributed to the body voting 57-29 to postpone a decision on implementing the regulation by another year.

The IMO’s attempted carbon tax continues a long line of UN efforts to push a green agenda by punishing countries for continuing to rely on natural gas, oil, and coal. President Trump did the world a tremendous service by fighting back against this EU-led initiative. However, the war is not yet won. The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee will reconvene in October 2026 to vote again on formally adopting the tax.

The Trump administration needs to remain vigilant, using any available leverage to ensure the world doesn’t decide to change course and allow the tax to go into effect next year. Moreover, the administration should look more closely at our relationship with the UN and, without significant reforms, consider whether the more than $13 billion we give to the UN every year is worth the headaches we get in return.
