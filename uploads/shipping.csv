A major breakthrough in methane slip reduction technology was announced yesterday by Kanadevia Corporation, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL), and Yanmar Power Solutions. Full-scale demonstration trials conducted since May 2025 have achieved a remarkable 98% methane slip reduction rate in real-world conditions, far exceeding their initial 70% target. The trials are being conducted on the LNG-fueled coal carrier REIMEI, operated by MOL, on routes between Japan and Australia.

This development comes at a crucial time as SEA-LNG, the industry coalition supporting the methane decarbonization pathway, highlighted recent progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from LNG as a marine fuel ahead of next week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) session at the UN International Maritime Organization.

“The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognizes the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway,” said Peter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG.

Landmark Study Reveals Lower Emissions for LNG Marine Fuel Than Previously Thought

With approximately 95% of vessels still using oil-based fuels, LNG has emerged as the leading alternative, now representing nearly 20% of the global vessel orderbook.

The technological breakthrough addresses one of the primary criticisms of LNG as a marine fuel—methane slip, which occurs when a portion of methane in LNG fuel is emitted into the atmosphere unburned. Methane has a higher greenhouse effect than CO2, making its reduction essential from the perspective of GHG reduction.

The project, funded under the Green Innovation Fund Project “Development of Next-Generation Vessels” led by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), combines methane oxidation catalysts with engine improvements. According to the developers, the technology achieved a 93.8% methane slip reduction rate in land-based trials, which has now been surpassed by the 98% reduction achieved in actual maritime operations at 75% load.

These developments align with SEA-LNG’s position that the LNG pathway offers immediate and future benefits. Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer of SEA-LNG, noted: “Independent studies by Sphera and Rystad Energy confirm a steady decline in well-to-tank emissions from LNG over the past decade. With further reductions expected as supply chains evolve, and with LBM and e-methane scaling, the pathway is both credible today and vital for the industry’s long-term transition.”

The timing of these announcements is particularly relevant as the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) prepares to meet for its 2nd extraordinary session from October 14-17, at IMO Headquarters in London. The committee will consider the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework, which was approved by MEPC 83 in April 2025.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework represents a significant shift in maritime regulations, featuring two key elements: a global fuel standard requiring ships to gradually reduce the GHG intensity of their fuels and a pricing mechanism with set prices on GHG emissions. If adopted, these regulations are expected to enter into force in March 2027.

Ship emissions under the framework are measured using GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI), which calculates greenhouse gas emissions for each unit of energy used, expressed in grams of CO? equivalent per megajoule. This “well-to-wake” approach covers emissions from the entire fuel lifecycle—from extraction and production to use onboard.

For LNG proponents, the advancements in methane slip reduction technology could significantly improve the fuel’s GHG Fuel Intensity profile. This comes as the framework defines “zero or near-zero” emission fuels (ZNZs) as those with a GFI of no more than 19.0 gCO?eq/MJ through 2035, after which the threshold tightens to 14.0 gCO?eq/MJ.

The Yanmar-led project aims to continue onboard trials through the end of FY2026 to evaluate overall system performance and catalyst durability, with the goal of social implementation from FY2027 onward—coinciding with the expected enforcement timeline of the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

For the maritime industry, these developments suggest that LNG—with its established infrastructure and growing technological improvements—may continue to play a significant role in shipping’s decarbonization pathway, particularly as a transition fuel while other zero-emission technologies mature.

The question now facing industry and regulators is whether these technological advancements will be recognized within the IMO’s framework and how they might influence the trajectory of maritime decarbonization strategies as the industry navigates toward increasingly stringent emissions regulations.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Demonstration-vessel-REIMEI.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 15:56:52.206221

Part 1 addressed international policy and politics, Part 2 efficiency measures. This part looks at alternative fuels.

In mid-October, more than 100 nations will gather at a London meeting to decide whether to enshrine a set of carbon reduction rules into international shipping law. If they do, high-emitting conventional shipping fuels will be heavily penalized within a few years. But the rules don’t specify how they’re to be replaced; industry members would get to decide which low- and zero-carbon fuels to use instead.

And so, spurred largely by these pending global regulations, the race is on to develop alternative fuels and scale up their use. Shipping accounts for about 3% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, and activity is expected to rise in coming decades. Efficiency measures to reduce fuel use of any kind, such as in hull design, will help but aren’t anywhere near a complete solution.

“You’re not going to get to zero” with just efficiency, Lee Kindberg, former head of environment and sustainability for the North America division of Danish shipping giant A.P. Møller-Mærsk, often known simply as Maersk, told Mongabay.

“Think about moving this huge mountain of metal with all these boxes of cargo on top of it,” she added. “It takes a lot of energy to do that, so it’s going to take low-carbon fuels.”

Experts may disagree on the best alternative fuels, but they generally agree on which ones should be in the discussion. There are “bridge fuels” that could be used during a transition period or in a limited way for the long term, such as biofuels, and then there are options that are more sustainable at scale, such as green methanol and green ammonia.

Bridge fuels?

Alternative fuels are currently in limited use. More than 90% of the fuel burned on ships is an oil-derived marine fuel such as heavy fuel oil, which is a “bottom-of-the-barrel” derivative of the fossil fuel refining process.

The next most common fuel in current use, accounting for a small percentage, is in fact another fossil fuel: liquefied natural gas (LNG). Fossil-based LNG can emit roughly 20% less greenhouse gas than conventional fuels, but methane leaks can effectively undo the gains. New forms of LNG, such as bio-LNG, offer more savings, but only if the feedstock is sustainable, a caveat that applies to all biofuels. LNG, like many alternative fuels, requires a different engine than conventional fuels, so resources are required to make the switch.

Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, told Mongabay that fossil LNG has “absolutely no contribution” to make to decarbonization efforts and is a “dead end,” and that other forms of LNG are also bad options. He said one problem is that once shipping companies have invested in something like LNG, they tend to lobby for a regulatory system that continues to allow it.

“Money has power,” he said. “Once you’ve sunk capital into a molecule, you’re going to defend it to the hilt.”

Some biofuels do have a role to play as bridge fuels, experts generally agree. However, as with bio-LNG, the climate benefits they offer depend on where the feedstock comes from. Biofuels are controversial, and not just in shipping, because demand for them can spur land use change and raise food prices. For example, when forests are cleared or peatlands drained in Southeast Asia to grow oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), some of which goes to make biofuel. The problem exists elsewhere, as well.

“If you want to be hyperbolic, there’s a risk to burn the Amazon,” Felix Klann, a maritime transport policy officer at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based advocacy group, told Mongabay with regard to biofuel use.

Experts regard biofuels that come from waste-derived biomass, such as used cooking oil or agricultural residues, as more sustainable than “first-generation” biofuels that come from soy or corn. (They are especially skeptical of “renewable diesel,” which has been linked to deforestation in Brazil.) They say the main problem is scale: There is only so much waste-derived feedstock available.

Quantifying the full life cycle carbon emissions of biofuels, as with other fuels, is complicated. The text of the net-zero framework, which is the set of global regulations that could be adopted in mid-October by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the U.N. agency that oversees shipping, doesn’t fully specify how such life cycle assessments will be made. If the framework is adopted, technical discussions on these and other contentious issues remain to be completed.

Better long-term options

In recent years, Maersk has launched 17 cargo vessels that can run on green methanol, which is produced from non-fossil sources. The vessels have “dual fuel” engines that can also run on conventional fuels, as needed. Meanwhile, green methanol production facilities are coming online in Denmark and China.

Green methanol is a squishy term that generally refers to either “e-methanol” made from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide or “bio-methanol,” a biofuel that can be produced from, for example, the anaerobic digestion of organic waste. (“E” because production of the hydrogen requires electricity.) Like other fuels, the degree of climate benefit offered by green methanol varies widely depending on how it’s produced. Some experts feel it’s generally a good option.

“I am betting on methanol, for the intermediate term, at least,” said Kindberg, who spoke as an independent expert, not on behalf of her former employer, Maersk. She said the future will involve multiple fuels.

“I don’t see really one fuel winning out,” she added.

For his part, Smith of UCL said methanol was not a good long-term option because of the amount of carbon required. The most sustainable way to source carbon is to suck it out of the atmosphere: direct air capture, as it’s called. Producing methanol this way — the only green methanol worth its name, in Smith’s view — virtually eliminates life cycle emissions if the production is powered by renewable energy. But scale is a challenge because direct air capture is an expensive, energy-intensive process, as carbon dioxide is very diffuse in the atmosphere.

Smith criticized Maersk for its investment in green methanol, saying it drew attention away from green ammonia, which his team’s research indicates is a better solution.

“They’ve distracted everyone with a molecule which is not a long-run solution and delayed the onset of ammonia,” Smith said of Maersk.

In response, a Maersk spokesperson whom the company did not name told Mongabay in an emailed statement that “we envision a future with multiple technological pathways.”

“No single fuel is likely to meet the diverse needs of global shipping, given diﬀerences in vessel types, routes, infrastructure availability, and regulatory frameworks,” the spokesperson said. “A portfolio approach, combining different low GHG [greenhouse gas] emission options, offers the flexibility to optimize emissions reductions, manage costs and mitigate the risk of lock-in to any one fuel.”

Maersk has indicated publicly that ammonia may be the best long-term option. Green ammonia contains no carbon, but rather nitrogen, which is easier and cheaper to source at scale. (E-methanol and green ammonia both require the production of hydrogen, a major energy and cost driver; bio-methanol can get its hydrogen from biomass feedstock, reducing that particular energy requirement.)

Price listings as of September 2025, adjusted for energy density, show that green ammonia is already slightly less expensive than green methanol; however, other associated costs such as storage could make ammonia more expensive to own in total. China and India have ramped up production of green ammonia using renewable energies, which could drive prices lower. Both green ammonia and green methanol are more than three times the cost of conventional fuels.

Jasper Verschuur, an assistant professor in engineering systems and climate security at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, said green methanol is the most viable solution for the next 10-15 years, but green ammonia has the potential to “become the most viable longer-term solution.” He said his thinking was “fully in line” with a new report issued by the DNV, a Norway-based ship classification society, outlining ammonia’s pros and cons. He told Mongabay that even if green ammonia becomes widely produced, the shipping industry will have to compete with other industries for its use and may not be able to afford it without government support. He also said building up the infrastructure and supply chain for green ammonia would be hard.

There are relatively few ammonia-fueled vessels on the water today. However, dozens have been ordered and dozens more, including container ships and other types of vessels, are being made “ammonia ready” so they can be easily retrofitted to use the fuel later, according to the Ammonia Energy Association, a trade group.

This is a positive development, according to Agustin Valera Medina, co-director of the Net Zero Innovation Institute at Cardiff University in the U.K. He considers green ammonia to be the most promising alternative fuel.

“The reason is that you don’t have any CO2 in the molecule, and therefore, if you just burn it properly, the only thing that you get out is nitrogen and water,” he told Mongabay.

Still, it’s not without risks. Without proper design and controls, burning ammonia can emit nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas, threatening local air quality, the ozone and the climate. And all experts who spoke to Mongabay agreed that the use of ammonia presents safety concerns, especially when vessels are at port. Ammonia, even more so than methanol, is highly toxic and corrosive and can cause severe respiratory damage if inhaled.

“You could kill people,” Kindberg said in explaining the stakes.

Ammonia has long been used in refrigeration and as a fertilizer feedstock, so there are well-established protocols for carrying it as cargo, and recent work has been done to prepare guidelines for its use as a marine fuel, including by the IMO.

Transition to any alternative fuels will involve design, retrofitting and storage costs. Port authorities will have to decide which fuels to stock as the fuel mix diversifies.

The fuel transition could come alongside other technological developments. Fuel cells could replace combustion engines for many fuels, especially those that contain hydrogen, while electrification and battery power could become more widely used for certain ship functions, especially at ports.

The rollout of alternative fuels does not depend entirely on the outcome of the London IMO meeting: There are national and regional regulations also driving change, most notably at the European Union level. But the transition would be weakened if the deal doesn’t go through, Smith of UCL said.

“[W]e would still see incentives creating energy transition, but not in as … coordinated and equitable [a] way as if [the] IMO drove the transition. And quite possibly as a result, not such a fast ramp-up [or] switch of energy,” Smith said in a text message.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit.","ABAKALIKI – In early September, African leaders convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Second Africa Climate Summit, which focused on overcoming the obstacles to climate-resilient development on the continent. In their efforts to devise solutions, drive innovation, and attract financing, these leaders are reshaping global climate action. As part of that process, they are increasingly recognizing that decarbonizing shipping – an industry that generates nearly 3% of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions – could be a powerful catalyst for Africa’s green industrialization.

African governments have already emerged as key players in negotiations over reductions in shipping emissions. Earlier this year, they helped secure the approval of the Net-Zero Framework at the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations’ maritime regulator. Included in the framework is the world’s first binding pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from ships. This measure, which the IMO is expected to adopt formally at its upcoming October session, represents an important victory for multilateral climate action and signals the beginning of the end of shipping’s dependence on fossil fuels.

But the real test will be how this pivotal policy is designed and implemented over the next few years. For African governments, the biggest question is how the revenues generated from the IMO’s pricing mechanism, projected to be $10-15 billion per year by 2030, will be used.

If distributed equitably, these funds could help Africa close its huge energy gap, upgrade its port infrastructure and fleets, and invest in transmission networks and grids that could unlock our vast renewable-energy potential, especially in geothermal, wind, and solar. A resilient grid is also essential for the production of renewable hydrogen and other green e-fuels – the most promising long-term clean-energy solution for the shipping industry. This would likely provide a boost to Africa’s existing green-hydrogen projects and spur new ones, in the process accelerating industrialization, boosting GDP, and positioning the continent as a global energy exporter.

Until now, Africa has faced challenges in developing its abundant renewable resources largely because of the high cost of capital. African economies remain weighed down by unsustainable debt burdens and low credit ratings, which make it prohibitively expensive to invest in clean energy. Given the perceived risks, the continent currently receives only around 2% of global investment in renewables. But the revenues raised from the IMO’s new carbon-pricing mechanism could be used to lower initial costs, de-risk clean-energy investments, and pave the way for Africa to power global shipping.

Crucially, the IMO must support this drive to harness Africa’s renewable resources by creating strong incentives for e-fuels. Otherwise, cheaper options such as liquefied natural gas, which is far more destructive to the planet, and crop-based biofuels, which increase pressure on food systems, risk undercutting green hydrogen and impeding African countries’ efforts to achieve sustainable growth and development.

The increased use of biofuels would be particularly catastrophic for African countries. In my country, Nigeria, where millions of people already face acute hunger, diverting crops to create fuel for ships – often carrying goods and supplies bound for wealthy countries – would be both immoral and economically reckless. Generating biofuels would likely worsen food insecurity and increase deforestation, GHG emissions, and land degradation – in some cases, to a greater extent than fossil-fuel production.

Like many other African countries, Nigeria has everything it takes to become a leader in sustainable shipping fuels, including abundant sun and wind, and a young workforce. Now it just needs the right investments. If designed properly, the IMO’s framework could help provide the funds that Africa needs to ramp up its renewable-energy capacity. Failure to create an ambitious, equitable policy risks limiting Africa’s prospects.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit. Ensuring that the continent reaps the benefits of the IMO’s new mechanism would be a remarkable example of international cooperation. A climate-resilient future is within reach, so long as African voices are heard, and taken seriously, on the global stage.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/a6021a09b6dd07ed8793a73621e57b4a.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:12.917999

Krystyna Tsochlas, Head of Maritime Transport Division at James Fisher & Sons Plc made the welcome and opening remarks; she was joined on the panel by Alessio Sbraga, Partner at HFW; Julia Harrowsmith, Head of Maritime Decarbonisation Policy at Department for Transport (DfT); Jacob Damgaard, Divisional Director, Head of Loss Prevention at Britannia P&I Club and Kenny English, Marine Engineer and LNG Consultant at Waves Group.

The panel and delegates left no stone unturned as they examined the vast array of issues arising from the subject.

They discussed the UK policy landscape including UK policy and developments at the IMO; the insurance perspective (impact of new emission rules, alternative fuels adoption, safety and spill concerns); the commercial and contractual view (regulatory pressures, challenges and opportunities in deploying low-carbon fuels) and technical and operational insights (adoption of dual-fuel technologies, comparative assessment of LNG, ammonia, hydrogen, and biofuels).

They also covered the intricacies of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which became the world’s first international emissions trading system in 2005.

This regulation aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a cap on emissions for certain sectors, covering over three-quarters of the allowances traded on the international carbon market.

It was revised in 2023 to align with the EU’s climate targets, aiming for at least a 55% reduction in net emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

The panellists explained the challenges and opportunities in deploying low-carbon fuels, and how key a role shipping will play in the energy transition globally.

They discussed how dual-fuel technology would play a vital short-term role for maritime, while stating the increasing efficiency of vessels (with wind wings and air lubrication) would also make a valuable contribution.

On EU ETS, Mr Sbraga said: “It’s pushing the industry, I think, in small steps away from use of fossil fuel, and more towards exploring other types of low carbon-based fuels.”

Getting deep into the issue, the panel agreed that fuel was not just a means getting vessels from location to location, it plays a political role and has also changed the way ship managers and operators think and act.

Mr Sbraga added: “What we have at the moment is a gradual shift in mindset towards what fuel is used for. In the past, it was simply viewed as an operating cost, which has passed down the line. Now it has a different purpose; it can have regulatory benefits; it can even minimise exposure through the regulations that we’re seeing coming out at the moment.”

He continued: “People are making strategic choices now. The costs of carbon being passed through the physical transport chain is not only impacting freight and charter hires and business strategies but also fuel choices and decisions as to when it comes to new builds and the type of engines. It’s not easy.”

However the big question, of which alternative fuel would be the one to drive maritime into the future, is a difficult one to answer, the panel agreed.

Mr English said: “It’s clear that heavy fuel has not died yet. The future will really be a combination of fuels. Dual fuel will be the transition towards the transition.

“Why the rush to dual fuel? Optionality. It buys time for ports, suppliers and crews to catch up while protecting global tradability. It also lets teams train on live kit without betting the business on a single fuel trajectory. Gambling that the fuel ‘might be at the next port.”

He also talked about the need for qualified people who can handle these new fuels, saying: “Hardware often gets the budget; people determine outcomes. We’re short of experienced people: LNG competence remains scarce, and ammonia/methanol familiarity will lag demand for some time.”

Mr Damgaard added: “There are still a great deal of concerns around some of the fuel alternatives – ammonia is considered to be too dangerous, while methanol can burn without being seen.

“Spills are as big a concern as fuel costs; the thing with current fuels is that they can be handled visibly and be cleaned. Other fuels are unseen so that requires more expert help. These are things that shipowners need to add to their risk management. Added to that, the effect on nature in unknown.”

He emphasised said that equipping seafarers with the right skills and training to handle the new generation of fuels will also be a is a major issue as well moving forward.",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Maritime-industry-still-debating-its-fuel-of-choice-for-the-future-experts-conclude-during-panel-discussion.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:29.373733

When a little-known UN agency meets in London this month to adopt a deal to cut shipping emissions, it will be up to governments to turn July’s groundbreaking ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) into concrete climate action.

For us, people living in small island states across Oceania, shipping is not a distant, abstract sector – it is our lifeline. Vessels bring medicine and food, while ensuring a connection with the rest of the world. But global shipping is also a major source of emissions, which the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has a duty to address.

October’s IMO meeting is a critical test of whether countries will heed the ICJ ruling by embedding its principles into the Net-Zero Framework, a legally binding regulation that represents the world’s first truly global emission pricing mechanism.

In April, the IMO made world headlines when governments agreed the draft Framework after a long and painstaking negotiating process, and the agreement now needs to be formally adopted in October for it to enter into force in 2027.

Gaps and loopholes

Despite marking a huge achievement in global cooperation and multilateralism, there are still many gaps in the Framework that need to be clarified for it to deliver on the climate action we need, however.

The deal has been criticised by our countries – which abstained in the vote in April in protest – and climate experts, who have said it is too weak, too slow and riddled with loopholes.

Some critics have argued that the Framework risks becoming a “pay-to-pollute” system, allowing wealthy operators to carry on business as usual while we continue to bear the brunt of rising seas.

Oceania states have long been pushing for a flat emission fee on shipping, or a carbon levy, at the IMO, which would bring this sector much closer to the Paris Agreement as well as help drive the most cost-effective clean energy transition.

A first step

But if the scheme is flawed, the answer is not to undermine it, but to strengthen it – in the spirit of the ICJ ruling, which we will carry with us at the IMO. I believe the IMO Net-Zero Framework, if adopted, is just a first step.

The most important element is to guarantee shipping’s green transition is fair and equitable. This will require that the revenues collected from the carbon pricing, worth up to $15 billion a year in 2030, are allocated in a way that prioritises climate-vulnerable countries and those most affected by the impacts of climate change and can help us build climate-resilient transport and shipping systems we can depend on.

The Framework must also incentivise real, long-term clean energy solutions, like renewably produced e-fuels and wind technologies. Without these incentives, the IMO risks locking shipping into cheap and unsustainable alternatives like high-risk biofuels or climate-heating liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Rising seas and climate reality

International climate negotiations are often riddled with the challenge of bringing our stories and perspectives to a rigid world of suits, spreadsheets and square brackets. By participating in climate diplomacy events, I share the voices of my Temamfua – ancestors in the native Rotuman language – and share with them about my Ö’hön, which means both mother and Mother Earth, and how we keep mistreating our Ö’hön, yet she keeps loving us back.

Climate change is a lived reality for us, the people of Oceania.

When I followed the proclamation of the Hague court’s ruling in July, I thought of our family house in Malha’a, on my home island of Rotuma, Fiji, and the vast nearby beach that has steadily disappeared under the waves over the years. I thought of children in Kiribati studying the maps of islands they can no longer walk upon, and of the saltwater in our wells and reefs bleaching.

That is why the ICJ’s ruling was a moral victory that affirmed what we have always known and fought for: climate action is a binding legal obligation for all states. High-emitting countries have the responsibility to mitigate climate change and can no longer hide behind claims of sovereignty or economic difficulty.

When we meet in London again this month, I hope delegates remember that behind their debates and arguments on metrics and fuel standards stand real islands, real peoples and real futures. The ICJ has given us legal recognition. Whatever IMO member states decide, I will stand strong with fellow peoples of Oceania to remind states of their obligations under international law.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/10/John-Taukave-1440x959.png,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:34.669869

Industry voices are calling for clear global fuel standards and a robust greenhouse gas levy, arguing that these are essential to curb the vessel sector’s climate footprint.

The International Maritime Organization has drafted a Net-Zero Framework that combines mandatory emission limits with a GHG pricing mechanism. The plan targets ocean-going ships above 5 000 gross tonnage – which account for around 85% of shipping’s CO₂ output – and is expected to be formally adopted at the Summit, with enforcement beginning in 2027.

The proposals set a goal of net-zero emissions by roughly 2050, with interim targets including a 40% cut in carbon intensity by 2030 and 5-10 % use of zero- or near-zero-emission fuels by that year.

Voices within the industry are speaking out. Mark Bell, General Manager and COO of the SGMF (an NGO promoting gas as a marine fuel), told Seatrade Maritime News: “From what I’ve heard … it’s going to be a vote, yes or no, and it’s going to pass, so it’s going to open the playing fields as to what will happen. So, the floodgates will open.”

Meanwhile, Maersk has cautioned that a trading-credit scheme could unintentionally favour LNG over truly low-carbon alternatives. The firm argues that such a scheme might fail to penalise LNG usage sufficiently, undermining efforts to drive adoption of greener fuels.

Support also comes from across the shipping community: nearly 200 companies have voiced backing for the first global emissions fee under the IMO framework, despite political resistance from the US.

Opposition is not negligible. The US has formally rejected the Net-Zero Framework, warning that the measures would impose undue burdens on its shipping and consumer sectors – even threatening retaliatory action against states that support it.

Proponents of the framework, however, insist that global cooperation is vital. They stress the need for a level playing field and a just transition, especially to support developing nations adopting greener maritime technology.

At the Summit, key topics will include finalising global fuel standards, enforcing a greenhouse gas levy, and revising the Carbon Intensity Indicator to steer efficiency gains.

Analysts note that shipping is responsible for about 3% of global GHG emissions, placing it on a par with some major industrial nations. The Summit is widely viewed as a make-or-break moment: the industry must demonstrate credible climate ambition while balancing fairness and practical constraints.

In short, the IMO Green Summit is shaping up as a pivotal juncture – one in which the international shipping sector will either commit to aggressive decarbonisation or risk falling short of global climate expectations.",https://www.freightnews.co.za/files/styles/article_large/public/article/headline/2025-10/3-s.jpg?h=6e6be3ec&itok=D-xKTgWE,N,,2025-10-08 12:57:52.356131

President Nikos Christodoulides told the audience at the start of this week’s Cyprus Maritime Conference that assuming the European Presidency is both a responsibility and an opportunity that presents itself every 14 years.

He added that for his administration the Presidency is not just a priority, but also a national mission, with the need to boost European competitiveness and defence, through a deepening of the single market.

That means “Safeguarding the European Union's maritime transport competitiveness in the global market as an indispensable component of our efforts to strengthen the union's competitiveness and will be among the priorities of the Cyprus Presidency,” said Christodoulides.

Shipping Deputy Minister, Marina Hadjimanolis told Seatrade Maritime News that the framework for discussions that the Cypriot Presidency will lead includes the education and reskilling of seafarers, with a focus on bringing women into the workforce and an industrial strategy that puts digitalisation and decarbonisation at its core.

“It is a two-fold transition that will help drive the climate and the digital transition of waterborne transport while ensuring the continent's strategic autonomy and security,” explained Hadjimanolis.

Details of the strategy are being worked on now and prepared for a meeting of transport ministers in April next year which will see an agreement on how to move forward fleshed out and culminating in what Hadjimanolis said would be the Nicosia Declaration.

In support of the Cypriot Government’s announcement Apostolos Tzitzikostas EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, told the meeting that coming to Cyprus was like coming home.

He added: “It is a global maritime force and a hub at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa with a proud history of seafaring and a modern fleet that is among the largest in the European Union. Your flag is indeed a symbol of quality and trust.”

Shipping has shaped the EU trade, its economy and its security and it will continue to do so into the future. Shipping can be more resilient, competitive, sustainable and secure said the commissioner.

With EU tonnage declining to 33.6 million tonnes in 2024, from 38.5 million six year earlier Tzitzikostas said that the EU was responding with policies outlined in January this year, including the Competitiveness Compass, a “policy roadmap”, with three priorities: closing the innovation gap with the US and China, aligning decarbonisation with competitiveness and stepping up security and resilience.

“We follow this with a clean industrial deal which is turning Europe's sustainability goals into a competitive advantage for European industries and this has direct meaning for the maritime sector,” explained Tzitzikostas.

According to Tzitzikostas the current legislative framework allows vessel owners to plan fleet investments into retrofitting sustainable technologies.

Moreover, he said, “I will present next month a sustainable investment plan boosting the development of alternative fuels for transport. Because it's one thing to ask for sustainability and another if you cannot find the fuels to be sustainable.”

In what is the closest that any EU official has come to saying the EU will repeal its sustainable regulations once the IMO enforces its global regulations Tzitzikostas said: “Global measures agreed at the IMO aim to create a level playing field worldwide and this is much needed. A level playing field globally is the only, the only way [his emphasis] forward and Europe will continue to live with a mission supporting the IMO net zero framework.”

Solutions for the industry must be pragmatic said the commissioner, as well as efficient and economically viable.

Brussels will work with Cyprus to focus on “Safeguarding shipping, promoting fair trade, and strengthening global connectivity,” concluded Tzitzikostas.

Will shipping be first industry to set global emissions limits and prices?
""Earlier this year, through the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, the member states approved a landmark Net Zero Framework for global shipping.
With this big step, even with undefined areas and uncertainties, shipping is setting out to be the first industry to combine a worldwide limit to emissions and emissions pricing.","There is good news and bad news in shipping’s bid to decarbonise the roughly 3% of worldwide emissions the sector represents, according to DNV chief executive Remi Eriksen.

The Norwegian classification society chief started with the bad news in his outline of DNV’s findings from its latest annual report on the ongoing global transition away from polluting fossil fuels and towards lower-carbon energy systems.

""The bad news concerns the expensive end of decarbonisation, which is the hard-to-decarbonise sectors like shipping, aviation, heavy road transport and high heat manufacturing,"" Mr Eriksen said.

Specifically, the bad news is that these energy-intensive and difficult-to-green segments of the global economy are feeling the ’negative impact’ of geopolitical strife and a resultant economic slowdown, according to the DNV chief executive. In other words, DNV’s reading of future events in these sectors is drawn firmly from the world’s current troubles. DNV’s report sees the fragmentation of the global order, retrenchment toward self-interested, nationally focused energy security policies in some major economies and interlinked energy security narratives as a drag on the speed at which these sectors can decarbonise.

Based in part on these difficulties, DNV decided it needed to extend its Global Energy Transition Outlook forecast’s timeline by 10 years, from 2050 to 2060, ""because the transition is still very much in mid-stride in the 2050s. In fact, we find that net-zero emissions is only achieved a little after 2090. The accumulation of emissions until then takes us well beyond 2°C of global warming,"" as Mr Eriksen put it.

Compounding on the current geopolitical uncertainty to weigh on the energy transition’s progress in the short term is what Mr Eriksen called frustrations with ""unavailable and unreliable power grids"".

""So, what is stopping even faster near-term developments in electrification is lagging grid buildout,"" he said, noting that DNV’s estimation is grid infrastructure difficulties are slowing solar capacity uptake by 16% and wind projects by 8% through 2035.

Taken together, the slowed progress on decarbonisation and renewables equates to higher degrees of global warming by 2100.

""By the end of the century, science has shown beyond any doubt that humanity will then be experiencing, at great cost and discomfort, how critical each 10th of a degree of global warming is to our planet and society,"" Mr Eriksen said.

The good news

Despite the geopolitical and economic frustrations and infrastructure problems that are slowing the ongoing energy transitions away from fossil fuels, renewables are taking market share quickly, with China leading the way.

Overall, DNV’s figures show solar, both with and without storage, and onshore wind making up 32% of the global power mix by 2030. The report also foresees the troubles faced by offshore wind of late, particularly from the anti-wind stance by US President Donald Trump, being overcome by the turn of the decade, when offshore wind will be ""resurgent and starting to help grow the green mix"".

""By 2040, renewables will be 65% of all electricity and, 20 years later by 2060, electricity will be almost entirely non-fossil and will have moved from 21% of global energy demand today to 43% of global energy demand,"" Mr Eriksen said.

So, while the energy transition could and should be faster, according to DNV, the ""electrification megatrend"" means that ""electricity isn’t just growing, it is becoming an unstoppable force"".

Will shipping be first industry to set global emissions limits and prices?

In Mr Eriksen’s words, ""It looks very promising"".

""Earlier this year, through the International Maritime Organization, or IMO, the member states approved a landmark Net Zero Framework for global shipping. With this big step, even with undefined areas and uncertainties, shipping is setting out to be the first industry to combine a worldwide limit to emissions and emissions pricing.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

HyOrc Corporation (“HyOrc,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a Wyoming corporation engaged in the research, development, and commercialization of clean-energy technologies designed to decarbonize heavy-duty transport, industrial power generation, and distributed energy applications. Our mission is to develop commercially viable alternatives to diesel engines and fossil fuels, with a focus on hydrogen, methanol, and waste-to-energy solutions.

Our business is structured around three primary technology and market verticals:

1.Green Methanol Production – producing renewable methanol from waste, targeting shipping and aviation fuel markets.

2.Hydrogen Power Systems – developing modular hydrogen-fueled ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) engines for off-grid power and pay-as-you-go (“PAYG”) deployment.

3.Hydrogen Locomotive Retrofits – converting existing diesel locomotives to hydrogen-fueled systems.

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, SRE Power, Inc., we also developed a 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran, Philippines. While that facility is currently offline due to disputes with counterparties and storm damage, it demonstrates our technical execution capability in building power plants under challenging conditions.

Corporate History

The Company was originally incorporated in Nevada in 1998 as Asia Properties, Inc. (“ASPZ”), focused initially on unrelated businesses. The company was re-domiciled in Wyoming in 2019. In August 2024, ASPZ completed a reverse merger with SRE Power, Inc., a renewable energy company with a history of geothermal project development and hydrogen combustion technologies. As part of the transaction, ASPZ was renamed HyOrc Corporation. Following the merger, former SRE shareholders became the controlling shareholders of HyOrc.

This merger provided HyOrc with:

●Operational experience in power plant construction.

●A platform to commercialize hydrogen and methanol technologies.

●A publicly traded vehicle to access capital markets.

Technology Platform

HyOrc’s core innovation is its External Combustion Technology (ECT) engine, which integrates with ORC turbines. Unlike conventional internal combustion engines or fuel cells, the ECT engine can run on multiple fuels while maintaining high efficiency and durability.

Key features include:

●Fuel Flexibility: Operates on hydrogen, LPG, natural gas, biogas, or syngas.

●Hydrogen Tolerance: Achieves >45% efficiency even with hydrogen purity as low as 97%, whereas PEM fuel cells typically require >99.9%.

●Durability: Stable efficiency over long operating hours, compared with efficiency degradation in PEM fuel cells.

●Cost Competitiveness: Comparable total cost of ownership to diesel engines, but with zero emissions when operating on hydrogen.

In addition to the ECT engine, HyOrc has developed intellectual property for waste-to-methanol production. This technology gasifies municipal solid waste and catalytically converts syngas into methanol. Methanol is an established global commodity chemical, increasingly adopted as a green fuel for shipping and aviation.

Principal Business Lines

1. Green Methanol Production

●Market Context: The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated carbon reduction in global shipping. Green methanol is emerging as a favored solution, with major shipping lines such as Maersk and CMA CGM announcing large methanol-powered fleet orders. Aviation regulators are also exploring methanol-based synthetic fuels.

●HyOrc Projects: The Company is advancing development of methanol projects in Portugal and the United Kingdom, each based on proprietary waste-to-methanol technology. Discussions are underway with potential off-takers and partners.

●Competitive Advantage: HyOrc’s process leverages waste as a feedstock, reducing reliance on costly green hydrogen inputs and addressing municipal waste management challenges.

2. PAYG Hydrogen Power Systems

●Market Context: Critical infrastructure such as ports, hospitals, and data centers require zero-emission, reliable backup or off-grid power. Existing fuel cell solutions face challenges in cost, durability, and hydrogen purity requirements.

●HyOrc Solution: Modular PAYG hydrogen power units powered by our ECT engine. Customers purchase electricity on a pay-as-you-go model, minimizing upfront CAPEX.

●Pilot Projects: HyOrc is preparing pilot deployments in California (e.g., Port of Long Beach) and the EU.

●Competitive Advantage: Higher efficiency than fuel cells over time, lower total cost of ownership, and multi-fuel security.

3. Hydrogen Locomotive Retrofits

●Market Context: Rail is a major contributor to transportation emissions. Europe alone has more than 15,000 diesel locomotives in need of decarbonization. India, with its massive rail network, is aggressively pursuing hydrogen pilots.

●HyOrc Solution: Retrofit kits replacing diesel engines with hydrogen-fueled ECT turbines.

●Progress to Date:

○Advanced proposals submitted to Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) of Indian Railways for retrofitting the first of 1,500 diesel locomotives.

○Initiatives under discussion with EU partners for a fleet retrofit program.

●Competitive Advantage: Retrofit approach allows reuse of rolling stock at lower cost than purchasing new locomotives.

4. Geothermal Legacy Asset

●Through SRE, HyOrc developed a 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran, Philippines, completed in September 2023.

●The plant has remained offline since October 2024 due to a legal dispute with our counterparty. SRE Power retains economic rights and is pursuing legal remedies.

●Classified as Work-in-Progress on the balance sheet, with potential future recovery.

Intellectual Property

HyOrc’s IP portfolio includes:

●Patents filed/granted in India covering hydrogen engines, waste-to-methanol processes, and locomotive retrofits.

●Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) extensions into the United States and European Union, currently under review.

●Trade secrets relating to catalytic conversion and system integration.

Competition

Our competitors fall into several categories:

●Fuel Cells (PEMFC, SOFC): Compete in hydrogen applications, but face challenges with purity requirements, high CAPEX, and limited lifespan.

●Battery-Electric Solutions: Effective in light vehicles and short-range applications but impractical for heavy trucks, locomotives, or long-haul shipping.

●Conventional ICEs: Diesel and natural gas engines remain entrenched but are rapidly facing regulatory phase out in multiple jurisdictions as they cannot economically run with very low or zero greenhouse emissions required to achieve net zero needed to stabilise and reverse climate change. HyOrc differentiates through efficiency, durability, fuel flexibility, and lower lifecycle cost.

Regulatory Environment

HyOrc operates in industries subject to evolving regulations:

●Shipping: IMO 2023 regulations require significant CO2 reductions.

●Aviation: ICAO CORSIA program driving demand for sustainable aviation fuels.

●Power Generation: Renewable portfolio standards and carbon pricing schemes in the EU and U.S. create tailwinds for hydrogen and methanol.

●Rail: India and EU have launched hydrogen locomotive initiatives.

Growth Strategy

HyOrc intends to:

●Secure long-term offtake agreements for green methanol.

●Deploy PAYG hydrogen pilots in ports and critical infrastructure.

●Close locomotive retrofit agreements in India and the EU.

●Raise capital via OTCQB uplist and eventual Nasdaq listing to fund commercialization.

●Expand patent portfolio globally.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

An investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Form 10, before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

Going Concern and Liquidity Risks

We have incurred recurring operating losses since inception, including a net loss of $1.63 million in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $8.2 million. Our auditors have included a going concern emphasis in their report. Unless we can secure additional financing in the near term, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned. There is no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.

Dependence on Access to Capital

Our business strategy requires significant capital expenditures for R&D, manufacturing, and commercialization of our hydrogen engines and methanol projects. We estimate that we will need to raise at least $20 million over the next 24 months to achieve our objectives. If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of our projects, which would adversely affect our growth prospects.

Dilution of Shareholders

We expect to finance future operations primarily through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuances will dilute existing shareholders. Because we are currently an OTCID company with limited trading volume, new financings may be highly dilutive.

Early Stage of Commercialization

Our hydrogen engine technology and waste-to-methanol processes are in the pilot or development stage. Commercial adoption depends on successful scale-up, demonstration projects, and customer acceptance. If we are unable to prove reliability and cost-effectiveness at commercial scale, our business could fail to gain traction.

Technology and Development Risks

While we believe our technology offers advantages over fuel cells and batteries, it remains unproven at scale in commercial operations. Unexpected technical challenges could delay or prevent commercialization. Competing technologies may also advance more rapidly than anticipated, reducing our competitive advantage.

Reliance on Third-Party Manufacturing and Partners

We currently do not operate large-scale manufacturing facilities. Our business plan contemplates reliance on third-party manufacturers, such as Toyo Denki, Leroy Somer, Siemens, Kirloskar, RJ Italia, John Crane, Crompton, and Schneider for production of engines and components. If these manufacturers cannot deliver to our specifications or within agreed timelines, our operations will be adversely affected.

Counterparty Risks – Biliran Project

Through SRE Power, we constructed a 2MW geothermal plant in Biliran, Philippines. The plant is currently offline due to legal dispute for which we are pursuing legal remedies, but the outcome is uncertain. Our inability to recover value from this project could negatively impact our financial condition.

Customer Concentration and Project Risks

Our near-term opportunities involve large projects, such as locomotive retrofits with Indian Railways and methanol plants in Europe. If we fail to secure or execute these projects, our revenue generation could be delayed for years. In addition, delays, cost overruns, or cancellations could materially harm our financial position.

Market Adoption Risks

The success of our products depends on adoption by customers who have historically relied on diesel, natural gas, or grid power. Customers may be reluctant to adopt new technologies due to perceived risk, cost, or lack of familiarity. If adoption is slower than anticipated, our revenue and growth will be adversely affected.

Competitive Risks

We compete against established technologies including: (i) PEM fuel cells, supported by significant investment; (ii) battery-electric systems; and (iii) conventional diesel and gas engines. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and manufacturing resources than we do. If these competitors succeed in improving efficiency or lowering costs, our products may not achieve significant market share.

Regulatory and Policy Risks

Our operations are subject to complex and evolving regulations across multiple jurisdictions. For example, methanol projects depend on renewable fuel standards in the EU, while hydrogen deployment depends on government incentives and mandates in India and Europe. Changes in political priorities or reductions in incentives could materially impact demand for our products.

Intellectual Property Risks

Our competitive advantage depends on our patents and proprietary technology. While we have secured patents in India and filed PCT extensions in the U.S. and EU, there is no assurance that additional patents will be granted or that existing patents will not be challenged. Competitors may develop similar technology that circumvents our IP. Enforcement of IP rights is costly and uncertain, particularly in emerging markets.

Supply Chain Risks

Our technology depends on the availability of high-grade materials, catalysts, and components. Disruptions in global supply chains—such as shortages of metals, electronics, or catalysts—could increase costs or delay projects.

Geopolitical Risks

Our projects span multiple jurisdictions including the Philippines, India, the EU, and the United States. Political instability, changes in trade policies, or currency fluctuations in these regions could negatively affect operations.

Management and Key Personnel Risks

We are highly dependent on a small group of executives and technical leaders. The loss of any key personnel, particularly our CEO or CTO, could harm our ability to execute our strategy. We currently have limited bench strength and may struggle to recruit qualified personnel.

Risks of Operating as a Public Company

As a public company, we are subject to SEC reporting requirements and associated costs. We are in the process of uplisting from OTCID to OTCQB and eventually Nasdaq. Failure to successfully uplist could limit liquidity, reduce investor interest, and impair our ability to raise capital.

Share Price Volatility

Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme price volatility and low trading volume. The market price of our stock may be influenced by announcements regarding project milestones, financing events, or litigation. Such volatility may discourage institutional investors from participating.

Litigation and Legal Risks

We are engaged in disputes concerning the Biliran project. Litigation is costly, time-consuming, and uncertain. Adverse rulings could materially affect our financial position.

Cybersecurity and IT Risks

Our operations and intellectual property are dependent on digital systems. A cyberattack or data breach could result in the theft of proprietary technology or disruption of our operations.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2024, and the related notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10.

Overview

HyOrc Corporation is in the development and early commercialization phase of its clean-energy technology business. Our 2024 financial results reflect the first year of revenue recognition, primarily from technical services provided through our subsidiary SRE Power. The Company also incurred significant expenses related to research and development, legal proceedings, and the reverse merger transaction with SRE.

Expansion of our business is capital intensive, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near term as we build infrastructure, develop pilot projects, and pursue commercialization of our hydrogen engines, waste-to-methanol technology, and locomotive retrofit systems.

Results of Operations

Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2024, Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2023

●Revenues: In 2024, we generated revenues of approximately $617,000, primarily from technical service contracts related to SRE Power’s geothermal power station project. In contrast, we recorded no revenues in 2023. The initiation of revenues reflects early commercialization of SRE’s engineering expertise, though not yet related to hydrogen or methanol products.

●Operating Expenses: Operating expenses increased significantly to approximately $2.2 million in 2024 from $63,000 in 2023. The increase reflects higher R&D and equipment expenditures, legal and professional fees associated with litigation and the merger and expanded corporate governance costs.

●Net Loss: Net loss for 2024 was approximately $1.63 million, compared to a net loss of $63,000 in 2023. The increase reflects the scaling of operations, investment in technology, and legal/professional expenses.

●Balance Sheet Highlights: Total assets increased to approximately $22.2 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $6.5 million at December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to recognition of intangible assets and goodwill from the reverse merger, as well as classification of the Biliran plant contract asset as a non-current asset. Liabilities remained modest, reflecting limited use of debt financing.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had limited cash resources and remain dependent on external financing to fund operations. Subsequent to year-end, we raised approximately $110,000 through the issuance of common stock to investors. These proceeds provide near-term working capital but are not sufficient for commercialization.

We estimate that we will require at least $20 million in additional capital over the next 24 months to:

●Develop and construct our first commercial waste-to-methanol facilities in Portugal and the UK.

●Deploy pilot PAYG hydrogen units in California and Europe.

●Advance locomotive retrofit programs with Indian Railways and EU partners.

Sources of capital may include equity issuances, convertible debt, strategic joint ventures, engineering services and project financing. If we are unable to secure financing, we may delay or scale back projects.

Cash Flows

●Operating Activities: Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $550,000 in 2024, compared to minimal usage in 2023. The increase reflects higher expenditures related to R&D, litigation, and professional services.

●Investing Activities: Minimal, other than expenditures related to technology development and project preparation.

●Financing Activities: Provided cash inflows through equity issuances, including share sales to Richard Oblath and Carl Mueller in early 2025.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Key policies include:

1.Revenue Recognition (ASC 606) – We recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied, which in 2024 primarily related to technical service contracts.

2.Business Combinations (ASC 805) – The reverse merger with SRE required purchase price allocation and recognition of goodwill and intangible assets.

3.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (ASC 360) – We evaluate plant, equipment, and intangible assets for impairment if events indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Biliran project is classified as Work-in-Progress but not impaired at this time.

4.Going Concern (ASC 205-40) – Given recurring losses and limited capital, management has evaluated going concern considerations and disclosed the need for additional financing.

Going Concern Considerations

Our financial statements include an emphasis of matter regarding doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. While management believes we can raise sufficient funds and secure contracts to support operations, there is no assurance of success.

Outlook

Looking ahead, we are focused on:

●Advancing green methanol projects in Portugal and the UK toward FEED studies and offtake agreements.

●Deploying PAYG hydrogen power pilots in California and Europe.

●Securing agreements with Banaras Locomotive Works in India for locomotive retrofits.

●Defending our position in the Biliran dispute to protect shareholder value.

●Uplisting to OTCQB and pursuing Nasdaq listing to access broader capital markets.

Management believes these initiatives, if successfully executed, will position the Company for significant revenue generation beginning in 2026.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of HyOrc Corporation (f/k/a Asia Properties Inc)

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HyOrc Corporation and the subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (deficit) and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of United States of America.

Matters related to Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements if it is unable to obtain sufficient amount of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned development. The company has suffered losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Explanatory Paragraph - Other Non-Current Assets and Related Impairment

We draw attention to Note 1 and Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements regarding recognition of Other Non Current Assets towards the lien by the company over the Geothermal facility establishing the right over those assets and the subsequent impairment on account of the facility being non operational due to persistent grid instability and the physical damage caused by the typhoon and dispute with BGI and realisability of the claim from the insurance company and the consequential management estimate towards recognition of impairment of

$300,000.

Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The company is not required to have, nor we have engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Company was initially organized in the name of Asia Properties, Inc. on April 6, 1998, as a Wyoming Corporation, seeking opportunities to invest in real estate. On April 3, 2019. the Company moved its jurisdiction from the State of Nevada to the State of Wyoming. The Company’s common stock is trading in the OTC Market under the symbol “ASPZ”.

From 2022, the Company has been exploring different potential gold mining opportunities and is focused on gold mines with NI 43-101 or JORC geological reports with indicated or measured reserves.

On June 27, 2024, the Company acquired a Texas hydrogen technology company, SRE Power, Inc (“SRE”) for 655,374,256 newly issued ASPZ common stock. SRE is now 100% owned by ASPZ. ASPZ is now conducting the business of developing the HyOrc hydrogen engine technology and the other technologies owned by SRE. ASPZ filed for a name change with Wyoming in September 2024 and is currently doing business as HyOrc Corporation. (“HyOrc” / “we”/ “our”/ “us”) (Refer to Principles of Consolidation below).

Basis of Presentation

The Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.GAAP”) in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.

Reverse Acquisition and Principles of Consolidation

As described above, on June 27, 2024 (the “Acquisition Date”), the Company entered into a reorganization and stock purchase agreement (“agreement”) with SRE and the 100% shareholders of SRE whereby the SRE shareholders desired to sell and the Company agreed to purchase SRE shares thereby making SRE, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company issued 655,374,256 shares as the purchase consideration to the SRE shareholders. Following the closing of the agreement, SRE shareholders collectively owned around 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company on a fully diluted basis.

Further, at the closing, the then Board member of the Company. Debra Childers had tendered her resignation as the director and the officer of the Company and the then Board considered and deemed it advisable to the best interest of the Company to fill the vacancy in the Board by appointing Reginald Fubara, Shinichi Hirano and James McNaught-Davis as the members of the Company’s Board of Directors effective as of the closing.

We determine SRE an accounting acquirer based on the following facts: (i) after the reverse acquisition, former shareholders of SRE held a majority of the voting interest of the combined company; (ii) former Board of Directors of SRE possess majority control of the Board of Directors of the combined company; (iii) Reginald, being the member of the management of SRE is responsible for the management of the combined company. As such, we have treated the financial statements of SRE as the historical financial statements of the combined company (“consolidated financial statements” / “financial statements”).

We have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified SRE as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired in line with ASC 805-40 – Reverse Acquisitions. (Refer to Note 3).

Consequent to the reverse acquisition, the financial statements of the newly combined entity represent a continuation of the financial statements of the accounting acquirer/legal acquiree. As a result, the assets and liabilities of the accounting acquirer are presented at their historical carrying values in the consolidated financial statements of the newly combined entity and the assets and liabilities of the accounting acquiree/legal acquirer are recognized on the acquisition date and measured by using the acquisition method. The results of the accounting acquiree’s/legal acquirer’s results of operations are included in the combined company’s financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.

The accompanying financial statements prepared following the reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the accounting acquiree, HyOrc but described as a continuation of the financial statements of the accounting acquirer, SRE, with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the accounting acquirer’s legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree.

That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the accounting acquiree. Comparative information presented in these consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree.

The accompanying financial statements represent all of the following:

a. The assets and liabilities of SRE recognized and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts.

b. The assets and liabilities of HyOrc recognized and measured in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations.

c. The retained earnings and other equity balances of the SRE before the business combination.

d. The amount recognized as issued equity interests in the financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of SRE outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value HyOrc determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 applicable to business combinations. However, the equity structure (that is, the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of HyOrc, including the equity interests which HyOrc issued to the SRE shareholders to effect the combination. Accordingly, the equity structure of SRE is restated using the exchange ratio established in the Agreement to reflect the number of shares of HyOrc issued in the reverse acquisition.

For periods before the reverse acquisition, the stockholders’ equity of the combined entity is presented on the basis of the historical equity of SRE before the acquisition, retroactively recast to reflect the number of shares received in the acquisition.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities; the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered and certain amounts disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. These estimates are based on information available through the date of the issuance of the financial statements and actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by the Company include, but are not limited to:

●provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances and tax uncertainties

●business combinations and purchase price allocations

●recoverability of long-lived assets and contract assets and their related estimated lives

●evaluation of goodwill for impairment

●accruals for estimated liabilities

●net-realizable value of inventory and credit loss on accounts receivable and contract assets.

Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. There was no difference between net loss and comprehensive loss presented in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who, together with the Board of Directors, is accountable for overall strategy, resource allocation, and operational oversight. The CODM evaluates financial performance and makes key decisions based on consolidated financial information. There are no individual segment managers who are held accountable for discrete business activities, and the Company does not manage operations or allocate resources based on distinct business lines or geographic components. Accordingly, the Company operates as a single reportable and operating segment for the purposes of financial reporting under ASC 280 - Segment Reporting.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, certificates of deposits and money market funds that are readily convertible into cash, all with original maturity dates of three months or less.

Concentration of Credit Risks

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and receivables. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions.

Customer Concentration Risk

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the entire sales pertained to only one customer. The Company’s reliance on this major customer presents a concentration risk. Loss of this customer or a significant reduction in their order could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance. The Company continues to focus on efforts to diversify its customer base to mitigate such risks. There was no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Related Parties

Parties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions. All transactions are recorded at arm’s length prices, reflecting the fair value of the goods or services exchanged.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740, Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company assesses its income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. In accordance with ASC 740-10, for those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, our policy will be to record the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit will be recognized in the financial statements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is presented down into three levels based on the reliability of the inputs.

Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 Unobservable pricing inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.

The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivable are the dues from customers and are shown net of applicable reserves for doubtful accounts as shown on the face of the balance sheet. There were no accounts that had been placed on non-accrual status. The allowance for doubtful accounts has been estimated by management based on historical experience, current market trends and, for larger customer accounts, their assessment of the ability of the customers to pay outstanding balances. Past due balances and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Changes in circumstances relating to the collectability of accounts receivable may result in the need to increase or decrease the allowance for doubtful accounts in the future.

The allowance for bad debt recognized was $512,815 and $0 within general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment, net (“PP&E”) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives.

PP&E consists of unproved properties and, thus, the costs associated with such properties are not subject to depletion. The Company historically has acquired unproved properties by purchasing individual or small groups of leases directly from mineral owners which leases historically have not been subject to specified drilling projects. Capitalized costs associated with unproved properties, which includes leases that have expired or have been deemed uneconomic, are fully impaired.

Major renewals and improvements are capitalized. Replacements, maintenance, and repairs, which do not significantly improve or extend the useful life of the assets, are expensed when incurred.

Upon the sale or retirement of assets, costs and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations.

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by determining whether there were any triggering events that could impact the Company’s assets. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable the Company performs a comparison of the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset’s fair value generally determined by estimates of future discounted cash flows.

Revenue Recognition

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 upon inception.

To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligation(s) in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract was determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, the Company assessed the goods or services promised within each contract and determined those that were performance obligations, and assessed whether each promised good or service was distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC 606.

PFBT Agreement with BGI

SRE and Biliran Geothermal, Inc. (BGI) entered into a 25-year Project Funding, Build and Transfer Agreement (PFBT Agreement) in June 2021 for a 50 MW geothermal facility at Sitio Pulang Yuta, Brgy. Cabibihan, Caibiran, Biliran Province, Philippines. Under this arrangement:

●SRE finances, designs, constructs, installs and commissions the geothermal power plant in phases, beginning with a 2 MW module commissioned in September 2023. ●SRE also finances and upgrades the existing 13.2 kV distribution lines of Biliran Electric Cooperative (Bileco) to evacuate energy to the national grid. ●Upon final acceptance, SRE Power provides operation and maintenance (O&M) and technical support services over the 25-year term. ●Revenue comprises fixed construction and commissioning fees, reimbursements for agreed costs, and a variable share of electricity generation proceeds, all invoiced monthly per the contractual formula.

The Company identified the PFBT Agreement constitutes a single, enforceable contract. The distinct performance obligations under the Agreement are as follows:

●Design, construction, installation and commissioning of plant modules ●O&M and technical support services during operations ●Revenue share from daily electricity generation

Transaction price for the agreement consists of fixed fees for construction and commissioning, variable consideration based on BGI’s monthly electricity sales share and reimbursements of agreed costs. Estimates of variable consideration are included only to the extent that significant reversals are not probable.

Construction & Commissioning: Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the module passes commissioning tests and BGI has practical acceptance evidence.

O&M & Technical Support: Revenue is recognized over time using an input method (e.g., labor hours, machine- hours) as support services are rendered.

Electricity-Generation Share: Recognize over time on an output basis tied to daily meter readings of power delivered.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the revenue recognized of $617,115 comprised only of the O&M & technical services provided to BGI.

Other Non-Current Assets

Other non-current assets represent capitalized costs incurred for the construction of geothermal plant, which is in progress, that is constructed and commissioned by SRE under the PFBT Agreement (Refer to Revenue Recognition).

BGI will own all equipment, machinery, supplies, facilities, and designs that are supplied, installed, or utilized for the Geothermal Facility. However, BGI agrees to create a Lien over these assets in favor of SRE. This Lien serves as security to ensure repayment for the work that SRE performs on the Geothermal Facility. The Lien will not extend to Bileco Lines because The Bileco Lines are owned by Bileco, not BGI. The parties acknowledge this distinction, ensuring BGI does not impose financial claims over infrastructure it does not control. This provision protects SRE’s financial interests while clarifying ownership limitations regarding the distribution lines. Accordingly, the said asset is recognized and presented under Other non-current assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Considering the persistent grid instability in April 2024 of the equipment which resulted in over 250 grid trips that caused progressive stress and wear to critical equipment and the legal dispute with BGI as described in Note 2 below, the management assessed that the qualitative indicators for impairment existed and hence a qualitative assessment was performed. Based on the management’s judgement, the Company has recognized an impairment loss to the extent of around $300,000 in the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the same was reduced from the carrying value of the non-current assets and the net carrying value of other non-current assets amount to $2,700,000 as of December 31, 2024.

Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities

Accounts payable represents dues to vendors against whom operating expenses are incurred.

Business Combinations

The Company accounts for acquisitions in which it obtains control of one or more businesses as a business combination. The purchase price of the acquired businesses is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments, in the period in which they are determined, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the Company recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. In addition, for transactions that are business combinations, the Company evaluates the existence of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.

Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the excess cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In accordance with Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment or on an interim basis when indicators of potential impairment exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company’s reporting units discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the reporting structure.

The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed for each of the applicable reporting units include, but are not limited to, changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, discount rates, competitive environments and financial performance of the reporting units. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required.

The Company also has the option to proceed directly to the quantitative test. Under the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the excess would be recognized, up to a maximum amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Management can resume the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period for any reporting unit.

For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units, of which there were no indications that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative impairment test was not required, and no impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

Net earnings or loss per share is computed by dividing net income or loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding shares subject to redemption or forfeiture. The Company presents basic and diluted net earnings or loss per share. Diluted net earnings or loss per share reflect the actual weighted average of common shares issued and outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive securities outstanding. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of the diluted net loss per share if their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

The financial statements of the combined entity reflect the equity of the HyOrc including the equity interests issued as part of the reverse acquisition. As a result, EPS is calculated on the basis of the capital structure of HyOrc. In line with ASC 805-40-45-2(d), the following is considered:

In calculating the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator of the earnings-per- share [EPS] calculation) during the period in which the reverse acquisition occurs:

a. The number of common shares outstanding from the beginning of the period to the acquisition date is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares of SRE outstanding during the period multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement.

b. The number of common shares outstanding from the acquisition date to the end of the period is the actual number of common shares of the HyOrc outstanding during that period.

The basic EPS for each comparative period before the acquisition date presented in the financial statements following a reverse acquisition is calculated by dividing (a) by (b):

a. The income of the SRE attributable to common shareholders in each of those periods.

b. SRE’s weighted-average number of common shares outstanding multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement.

The issued and outstanding common shares of SRE through the acquisition date was 1,000,000 and the exchange ratio established in the agreement was 655.36, thereby resulting in the pro-rated weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the purposes of computing EPS to be 382,301,649. Weighted average common shares of Hyorc outstanding from acquisition through December 31, 2024 was 303,414,008. This resulted in the weighted-average total number of common shares for computing EPS to be 685,715,657 for the year ended December 31,2024.

The weighted-average number of common shares multiplied by the exchange ratio established in the agreement resulted in 655,374,256 common shares for 2023.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets primarily consist of patents owned by SRE which have been granted by the Indian government due to work done at the Indian R&D centre. HyOrc is expanding patent coverage with the application process primarily in the USA, EU, Japan through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements. These patents were acquired through an assignment agreement entered by SRE in May 2024 through which SRE acquired ownership interests in the patents including utility models and design patents and registrations and applications assigned by the Assignor.

The consideration terms were agreed in such a way that the Assignor is entitled to 5% of all the shares received by SRE upon SRE achieving a reverse takeover of a publicly traded company whose shares are traded on the OTC markets or similar stock exchanges.

Accordingly, the Company issued 32,768,712 common shares of SRE as the consideration for the acquisition of the patents which represented 5% of the shares acquired by the owners of SRE through the reverse acquisition with the Company at a value of $0.11 per common share. (Refer to Note 3) resulting in a total consideration of

$3,604,588.

The patents have an indefinite useful life because it is expected to contribute to cash flows indefinitely and the associated costs of renewal are not significant. The patents are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired in accordance with ASC 350-30-35-18. For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment, of which there were no indications that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the patents were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative test was not required, and no impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.

In connection with the reverse acquisition, the Company identified intangible assets, which are solely customer relationships (refer to Note 3). For December 2024, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of these intangible assets, of which there were indications that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these intangible assets units were less than their respective carrying values. As such, a quantitative impairment test was performed and the intangible assets were fully impaired with a corresponding impairment loss recognized in the Statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets (including other non-current assets) may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company has implemented all new relevant accounting pronouncements that are in effect through the date of these financial statements. The pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed., and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, establishes incremental disaggregation of income tax disclosures pertaining to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. We intend to adopt this standard in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures.

ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, requires disaggregation of specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements and a qualitative description of the remaining expense amounts not separately disaggregated. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and requires prospective application with the option to apply it retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on our disclosures and we intend to adopt this as and when applicable.

NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN

The Company has a net loss of $1,632,163 for the year ended December 31, 2024 and an accumulated deficit of $8,216,241 as of December 31, 2024.

SRE is the operator of the 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran Philippines and is entitled to 60% of the operating profits from the project for the lifetime of the project which is expected to be 25 years.

Biliran Geothermal Project (2MW) – Operational Status as of December 31, 2024

As of December 31, 2024, the 2MW geothermal power plant in Biliran remained offline and non-operational due to infrastructure damage. The project began experiencing persistent grid instability in April 2024, resulting in over 250 grid trips that caused progressive stress and wear to critical equipment. On October 05, 2024, the plant was taken offline following a technical inspection that revealed accumulated damage to key systems, making continued operation unsafe. Shortly after this shutdown, Typhoon Kristine-Trami struck the region and caused additional physical damage to the facility. Despite the existence of an insurance policy intended to cover such events, we have not received confirmation that a claim has been activated, and we have not received cooperation from the project counterparties responsible for managing the insurance process.

The company continues to engage stakeholders and explore legal and commercial remedies to protect our position, recover losses, and restore the project’s operational viability.

The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the next twelve months following the date the financial statements are available to be issued is dependent upon its ability to produce revenues and/or obtain financing sufficient to meet current and future obligations and deploy such to produce profitable operating results.

Management has evaluated these conditions and plans to generate revenues and raise capital as needed to satisfy its capital needs.

While uncertainties remain with respect to the timing of insurance recovery and revenue realization, management is reasonably certain in the Company’s ability to meet its operational and financial obligations over the next twelve months through a combination of funding, asset deployment, and resolution of existing claims but it cannot provide assurances that it will be successful in doing so.

These circumstances raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to meet its obligations as they come due. If it is unable to obtain sufficient amount of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned development. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.

Since the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has successfully raised post-balance sheet capital through share issuances and continues to actively pursue funding opportunities to support operations and growth. In parallel, the Company has made strategic progress in hydrogen engine development, secured new business opportunities in the UK, EU, and India, and commenced ISO certification to facilitate future deployments in regulated sectors such as rail and energy. (Refer to Note 8 for subsequent events)

The Company has evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.

NOTE 3. REVERSE ACQUISITION

The Company evaluated the acquisition of SRE pursuant to ASC 805 and ASU 2017-01, Topic 805, Business Combinations. As described in Note 1, we have identified the Company as the legal acquirer, as it is the entity that issued securities. Comparatively, we have identified SRE as the legal acquiree, the entity whose equity interests are acquired in line with ASC 805-40 – Reverse Acquisitions.

Accordingly, the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred by SRE was based on the number of equity interests SRE would have had to issue to give the owners of HyOrc the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition.

The acquisition method of accounting requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be measured at their estimated respective fair values as of the closing date of the acquisition. Goodwill recognized in connection with this transaction represents primarily the potential economic benefits that the Company believes may arise from the acquisition. In the reverse acquisition described above, HyOrc’s assets and liabilities were measured in accordance with the guidance in ASC 805 on Business Combinations and Goodwill is measured as the excess of fair value of consideration effectively transferred by SRE, the accounting acquirer over the fair value of the net assets of HyOrc, the accounting acquiree on the acquisition date.

The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation of HyOrc:

Total Customer relationship - Intangibles $932,088 Goodwill 15,755,344 Purchase price consideration effectively transferred $16,687,432

The fair value consideration effectively transferred was determined based on the number of common stock which SRE would have had to issue to the owners of HyOrc at the fair value per share of SRE on the date of acquisition to provide the same ratio of ownership (90%) in the combined entity as a result of the reverse acquisition.

Pursuant to the reverse acquisition, the Company engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to determine the fair value per share of SRE which as determined using the fair value of net assets as on the acquisition date. Given the limited operations of HyOrc in the period preceding the acquisition, the fair value per common share of SRE was considered to be more reliable and reflects the economic substance of the consideration effectively transferred.

The fair value of net assets of SRE as on the acquisition date is as follows:

Total Property, plant and equipment, net $- Other intangible assets 150,000,000 Cash and cash equivalents 347,058 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (160,169) Fair value of net assets $

150,186,889

Number of SRE shares outstanding on the acquisition date 1,000,000 Fair Value per share on the acquisition date $150.19

SRE’s balance sheet includes a geothermal plant, which is classified as Other non-current assets. The fair value of this asset was determined to be $15,000,000 by an independent third-party valuation at the time of acquisition. However, management has concluded that this fair value should not be factored into the overall business valuation of SRE. This decision is based on the fact that the plant is not yet fully commissioned and therefore does not contribute to the company’s business operations. Furthermore, the terms of the agreement with BGI, along with the rights BGI exercises over the asset, limit SRE’s control and ability to derive economic significant benefits from the plant. This rationale aligns with the principles of U.S. GAAP, where the value of an asset in a business valuation is tied to its operational contribution and the economic benefits it provides, not merely its standalone fair value.

SRE would have had to issue 111,111 shares to the owners of HyOrc to maintain the 90% ownership in the combined entity which effectively would have made the total common stock issued and outstanding of SRE to be 1,111,111 as of December 31, 2024.

HyOrc had 72,819,362 common shares issued and outstanding of par value $0.001 each prior to the closing of the reverse acquisition. Further, SRE shareholders received 655,374,256 common shares of HyOrc as the consideration for the share exchange.

Accordingly, the equity structure in the financial statements reflect the sum of SRE’s issued equity immediately before the reverse acquisition, and the fair value of the hypothetical consideration effectively transferred. The equity structure (i.e., the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of HyOrc. However, the balance is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding shares of HyOrc, including the number of shares issued in the reverse acquisition and the difference is recognized as an adjustment to the Additional paid-in capital. For periods before the reverse acquisition, the stockholders’ equity of the combined entity is presented on the basis of the historical equity of the SRE before the acquisition, retroactively recast to reflect the number of shares received by SRE in the acquisition.

Goodwill is primarily attributable to the go-to-market synergies that are expected to arise as a result of the acquisition and other intangible assets that qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

The results of HyOrc have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date.

NOTE 4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:

December 31, 2024 2023 Plant and Equipment – unproved properties 60,000 60,000 Property, plant and equipment, gross 60,000 60,000 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (60,000) (60,000) Property, plant and equipment, net $- $-

Depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 amounted to $0 and $0, respectively.

The unproved property interests comprise the consideration paid in March 2017 for Symba America Oil & Gas’s working interest in an oil well near Ganado, Texas. Having since ceased oil extraction activities, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35. That assessment indicated that the fair value of these unproved properties was negligible or nominal; accordingly, the entire carrying amount has been written down to $0.

NOTE 5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist of the following:

December 31, 2024 2023 Customer relationships – reverse acquisition $932,088 $- Patents 3,604,558 - 4,536,646 - Accumulated impairment loss (932,088) Accumulated amortization - - Intangible assets, net $3,604,558 $0

NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. The Company, in conjunction with its legal counsel, assesses the need to record a liability for litigation or loss contingencies. A liability is recorded when and if it is determined that such a liability for litigation or loss contingencies is both probable and estimable.

Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows, or financial position except as described in Note 2.

NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES

Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The differences relate primarily to net operating loss carry forwards. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not record a current or deferred income tax expense or benefit due to current and historical losses incurred by the Company.

The Company has evaluated its income tax positions and has determined that it does not have any uncertain tax positions. The Company will recognize interest and penalties related to any uncertain tax positions through its income tax expense.

The Company is not presently subject to any income tax audit in any taxing jurisdiction, though its 2022-2023 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state jurisdictions.

NOTE 8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In the first quarter of 2025, the Company issued 11,000,000 common shares and raised around $110,000 through private share placements to individual investors. The Company has also commenced formal procedures for ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification to support manufacturing and environmental compliance for upcoming contracts.

The Company has submitted technical proposals to Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) under Indian Railways for hydrogen retrofit deployment and has advanced few methanol project initiatives in Portugal and UK, and hydrogen retrofitting engagements with local operators and OEM partners. No other events have occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and through the date of these financial statements that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the financial information referred to above. Management has evaluated subsequent events through July 31, 2025, the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

We are providing this letter in connection with your audit of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit) and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of HyOrc Corporation. (referred as “Consolidated Financial Statements”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the period January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 and January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of HyOrc Corporation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We confirm that we are responsible for the fair presentation in the consolidated financial statements of financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Certain representations in this letter are described as being limited to matters that are material. Items are considered material, regardless of size, if they involve an omission or misstatement of accounting information that, in the light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would be changed or influenced by the omission or misstatement. We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, as of July 29, 2025, the following representations made to you during your audit(s).

1. The consolidated financial statements referred to above are fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

2. We have made available to you all—

(a) Financial records and related data, including the names of all related parties and all relationships and transactions with related parties.

(b) Minutes of the meetings of stockholders, directors, and committees of directors, or summaries of actions of recent meetings for which minutes have not yet been prepared.

3. There have been no communications from regulatory agencies concerning noncompliance with or deficiencies in financial reporting practices.

4. There are no material transactions that have not been properly recorded in the accounting records underlying the consolidated financial statements.

5. We believe that the effects of the uncorrected financial statement misstatements summarized in the accompanying schedule are immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

6. We acknowledge our responsibility for the design and implementation of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud.

7. We have no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity involving—

(a) Management,

(b) Employees who have significant roles in internal control, or

(c) Others where the fraud could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

8. We have no knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity received in communications from employees, former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others.

9. The company has no plans or intentions that may materially affect the carrying value or classification of assets and liabilities.

10. The following have been properly recorded or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements wherever applicable:

(a) There are no Related-party transactions involved, including sales, purchases, loans, transfers, leasing arrangements, and guarantees, and amounts receivable from or payable to related parties.

(b) Guarantees, whether written or oral, under which the company is contingently liable.

(c) Significant estimates and material concentrations known to management that are required to be disclosed.

Significant estimates are estimates at the balance sheet date that could change materially within the next year. Concentrations refer to volumes of business, revenues, available sources of supply, or markets or geographic areas for which events could occur that would significantly disrupt normal finances within the next year.

11. There are no—

(a) Violations or possible violations of laws or regulations whose effects should be considered for disclosure in the consolidated financial statements or as a basis for recording a loss contingency.

(b) Unasserted claims or assessments that our lawyer has advised us are probable of assertion and must be disclosed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies.

(c) Other liabilities or gain or loss contingencies that are required to be accrued or disclosed by FASB Statement No. 5.

(d) Side agreements or other arrangements (either written or oral) that have not been disclosed to you.

12. The company has satisfactory title to all owned assets, and there are no liens or encumbrances on such assets, nor has any asset been pledged as collateral except as disclosed.

13. To the best of our knowledge and belief, we make the following representations regarding Other Non-Current Assets and related impairment, as disclosed in Note 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024:

☐ The balance of Other Non-Current Assets represents capitalized costs incurred for the construction of the geothermal facility under the Power Facility Build-Transfer Agreement between BGI and SRE.

☐ Under that Agreement, BGI retains title to all equipment, machinery, supplies, facilities and proprietary designs, and has granted SRE a lien on those assets (excluding the Bileco distribution lines, which are owned by Bileco) as security for payment of SRE’s construction and commissioning services.

☐ During April 2024, persistent grid instability resulted in over 250 grid trips that progressively stressed and wore critical equipment and gave rise to a legal dispute with BGI (see Note 2).

☐ Management concluded that these events constituted qualitative indicators of impairment and, accordingly, recorded an impairment loss of $300,000 in the year ended December 31, 2024.

☐ As a result of that impairment, the net carrying value of Other Non-Current Assets was reduced to $2,700,000 as of December 31, 2024.

☐ All material facts and circumstances related to the lien arrangement, grid-trip events, legal dispute and impairment decision have been disclosed to you and are reflected appropriately in the consolidated financial statements.

14. The company has complied with all aspects of contractual agreements that would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in the event of non-compliance.

15. To the best of our knowledge and belief, we confirm that the geothermal plant recorded under Other Non-Current Assets at a fair value of $15,000,000 determined by an independent third-party valuation as of the acquisition date has not been included in SRE’s overall business valuation. Management’s conclusion rests on two primary factors: first, the plant is not yet fully commissioned and therefore does not contribute to SRE’s operating cash flows; second, the Build-Transfer Agreement with BGI grants BGI title and certain control rights (including a lien on plant assets and the right to direct commissioning timing), which materially restrict SRE’s ability to direct the use of the asset and to derive its economic benefits. This treatment is consistent with U.S. GAAP, under which asset values incorporated in a business valuation must reflect an asset’s operational contribution and its capacity to generate future economic benefits, rather than its standalone fair value. We did not include this fair value of the noncurrent asset in the computation of goodwill.

16. We agree with the findings of specialists in evaluating Existence and valuation of the Intellectual Property Portfolio and have adequately considered the qualifications of the specialist in determining the amounts and disclosures used in the consolidated financial statements and underlying accounting records.

We did not give or cause any instructions to be given to specialists with respect to the values or amounts derived in an attempt to bias their work, and we are not otherwise aware of any matters that have had an impact on the independence or objectivity of the specialists.

17. We represent that the inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value and valuation allowances are made accurately for the inventories whose net realizable value is lower than the cost. Net realizable value is estimated by the management experience and expertise.

18. We further represent that the net realizable value of the inventories has been considered based on the estimated selling prices after deducting the estimated selling expenses of those inventories in the ordinarycourse of business. These are estimated considering the present condition of the inventory along with the contracts entered into by the company.

19. We are currently maintaining inventory records in Excel sheets as part of our early-stage accounting system. However, we have initiated a migration to QuickBooks, which will enable more automated and structured inventory tracking ",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-10-08 07:56:07.774345

Singling out an issue on which he felt Interferry’s intervention, coupled with broader industry concern, had found success, Mr Roos pointed to International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII).
Mr Roos said, “We have been very vocally against it.
“It’s going to be tough – doable but tough,” Mr Roos commented.
That is why at Interferry we have raised a very big stop sign.","The financial implications of environmental regulations were among the most topical issues discussed on the first day of global ferry trade group Interferry’s annual conference, taking place in Sorrento, Italy.

Interferry director of regulatory affairs Johan Roos gave an update which highlighted what he called major issues that the association has been campaigning on. Singling out an issue on which he felt Interferry’s intervention, coupled with broader industry concern, had found success, Mr Roos pointed to International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII). Action on what the industry saw as shortfalls in the policy led to the postponement of the regulation from 2026 to at least 2030.

Mr Roos said, “We have been very vocally against it. Luckily, we made a big contribution to putting it on the backburner and we don’t expect it to come back until 2030 at the earliest and when it does, I don’t expect it to be very negative, so that is good.”

He also homed in on IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF), which measures the carbon content in energy used, and money is paid per tonne of CO2 used to incentivise operators and generate revenue.

“It’s going to be tough – doable but tough,” Mr Roos commented.

The major potential complication with NZF, in the eyes of Interferry and the ferry industry, according to Mr Roos, is that it is one of two parallel instruments attempting to do the same thing, leading to the possibility of double taxation. These parallel instruments are IMO’s rules on fuel intensity and greenhouse gas emissions and the EU’s policies on emissions and fuels, the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Mr Roos said Interferry is campaigning for the EU to harmonise its GHG regulations with those of the IMO to avoid the potential for the sector and the wider shipping industry to incur double taxation as well as other financial and operational challenges.

Mr Roos told delegates, “If we retain EU schemes and add the IMO [schemes] it will double the energy cost in 2028 and in 2035, it will double again compared to 2038, meaning it will be four times what we pay today. That is why at Interferry we have raised a very big stop sign. We are happy to pay into a system to incentivise the lowering of carbon content, but we will not pay twice.”

Should there be an affirmative vote for IMO’s measures at the next extraordinary meeting of the IMO’s Maritime Environment Protection Committee meeting in October 2025, Mr Roos said Interferry will prepare a “very strong” statement.

“We will be knocking on doors in Brussels, reminding them of their obligation: Europe always said it is putting in place regulation as a place holder for global regulations, and then when these come in, it will back off,” warned Mr Roos.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/122/ROOS_Interferry_Main.JPG,N,,2025-10-08 07:56:17.264411

Lines, Ltd. has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NH3 Clean Energy Limited (NH3) and Oceania Marine Energy (Oceania) regarding the development of clean ammonia bunkering operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. This is a memorandum of understanding to promote collaboration with NH3 and Oceania on the Pilbara Clean Fuels Bunkering Hub initiative, which is Australia’s first ammonia bunkering concept announced by the Pilbara Ports Authority in June this year. MOL will be the world’s first ocean-going shipping company to participate in this initiative.

The Pilbara region of Western Australia is home to the world’s largest iron ore export port and serves as a major port of call for Capesize bulkers. The Pilbara Ports Authority has entered into a joint development agreement with NH3, which will supply blue ammonia, and Oceania, which will operate the bunkering business, to realize low-carbon ammonia bunkering in the region. Their goal is to commence bunkering operations for Capesize bulkers at the ports of Dampier and Port Hedland by 2030.

This MoU aims for MOL, NH3, and Oceania to collaborate on the transition of iron ore carriers in the Pilbara region to ammonia fuel and the realization of the WAH2 project(Note 2). Together, we will jointly propose solutions to Western Australian iron ore suppliers and work to address issues such as safety in ammonia bunkering operations.

MOL will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH NV, which are scheduled to be delivered by China State Shipbuilding Corporation’s Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. between 2026 and 2027. These vessels will be chartered by MOL(Note 3). MOL is looking to establish a fleet of ammonia duel-fuelled capesize bulk carriers on the West Australia to East Asia trade route and ensure safe ammonia bunkering operations and consider the procurement of ammonia. As an operator of ammonia dual-fuel vessels, MOL will work for this project to advance considerations regarding safety assurance and ammonia procurement in the Pilbara region.

MOL’s Managing Executive Officer Kazuhiro Takahashi commented:

We are honored to sign this MoU with NH3 and Oceania today, which will be a vital hub for our ammonia dual-fueled capesize bulkers scheduled to commence operations from 2026. This collaboration marks an important milestone in our efforts to establish a safe and reliable ammonia bunkering operation in the Pilbara region. By working closely with our partners, we look forward to building a robust framework for safe ammonia bunkering and advancing sustainable shipping together.

NH3’s Chairman Charles Whitfield commented:

We are delighted to have this agreement with MOL that helps to take the clean ammonia bunkering business another step closer to reality. This new agreement reinforces the growing momentum behind the shift to low-emission maritime fuels and builds on the existing Joint Development Agreement between NH3, Pilbara Ports, and Oceania Marine to establish an ammonia hub in the Pilbara by 2030. We sincerely appreciate Premier Cook and his team’s continued support in helping to establish this emerging clean energy industry – paving the way for a more sustainable future for our mining sector and energy exports.

Oceania’s Managing Director Nick Bentley commented:

Oceania’s collaboration with MOL and NH3 Clean Energy shows how partnerships across the energy and shipping sectors can deliver real emission reduction outcomes for Australia’s iron ore exporters and shipping industry. By combining NH3’s clean ammonia production capacity, Pilbara Ports’ infrastructure, Oceania’s bunker services and MOL’s pioneering dual-fuel fleet, we are creating an integrated end-to-end marine fuel solution that enables our customers to meet the IMO’s decarbonisation targets.

World Maritime Day Parallel Event focuses on advancing innovation and growth while protecting the ocean.

Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, was the stage to exchange ideas, showcase innovation and strengthen international cooperation during the celebration of the 2025 World Maritime Day Parallel Event last week.

The event (30 September – 1 October) was hosted by the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure in collaboration with the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Welcoming delegates, the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, H.E Suhail bin Mohamed Al Mazrouei, said: “This gathering gives us an opportunity to unite our efforts toward achieving that balance of economic growth with protecting the oceans which connect us together and keeping them healthy for the next generation.”

IMO Secretary-General Mr. Arsenio Dominguez said: “By facing environmental challenges, we can unlock a plethora of opportunities for everyone. The shipping sector, for instance, creates a stream of jobs and training prospects not only for seafarers on the ship, but in logistics, law, new technologies and AI, economics and others.”

He highlighted that IMO continuously updates its global regulations to keep up with changes in the industry, while carefully considering their impact on Member State economies.

A call for dialogue and action

The event combined a maritime exhibition showcasing innovations in sustainable shipping, with a series of five panel discussions over two days, featuring experts and policy makers:

Panel 1: Our Ocean, Our Obligation, Our Opportunity underscored the links between ocean health, prosperity and governance, while highlighting opportunities in the blue economy and the importance of ocean literacy and youth engagement.

Panel 2: Decarbonization and climate change examined pathways to net-zero emissions in shipping, including the use of alternative fuels, green corridors, carbon pricing and climate-resilient ports.

Panel 3: Actions to address marine plastic litter explored regulatory gaps, onboard waste innovations, port reception facilities and the role of seafarers as “frontline defenders” against plastic pollution.

Panel 4: The BBNJ treaty and shipping reviewed how the new global framework for protecting marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) will affect shipping lanes and high seas governance.

Panel 5: Capacity development for sustainable oceans spotlighted IMO-led projects and programmes designed to bolster capacity among Member States, especially in developing countries, through maritime training, upskilling and ensuring decent work and wellbeing in the green transition.

Republic of Korea to host 2026 WMDPE

The event concluded with the ceremonial handover of the World Maritime Day Parallel Event flag to the Republic of Korea, which will host the 2026 edition in Busan.

The project encompasses the outfitting of shore power systems for newly constructed containerships, with deliveries due to start in the second half of 2026.
It is understood that Cavotec’s solutions can reduce harmful pollutant emissions by a ‘significant’ amount by allowing vessels to connect to shore power while at berth.
In June, Cavotec also joined forces with energy services provider Equans to provide shore power systems for the Port of Antwerp-Bruges cruise terminal.
Beyond Europe, Cavotec was recently also commissioned by the Mohan Mutha Group to deliver the first shore power system in the Maldives.","Cleantech company Cavotec has signed additional contracts worth a total of €9.35 million (approximately $10.9 million) with an undisclosed shipping player to supply shore power systems for container vessels.

According to officials from Cavotec, the two new orders cover both newly built boxships and retrofitting projects.

To be specific, the retrofitting order, valued at around €5.5 million (around $6.4 million), includes the installation of the cleantech company’s shore power solutions on a ‘large’ but undisclosed number of existing ships.

The projects will reportedly be done while the units are in operation between Asia, the United States and Europe. As informed, equipment handovers are planned to commence sometime this year and continue until the end of next year.

Per Cavotec, the second order—worth € 3.8 million (circa $4.4 million)—is an addition to the €8.1 million (roughly $9.4 million) booking that Cavotec had unveiled in May this year. The project encompasses the outfitting of shore power systems for newly constructed containerships, with deliveries due to start in the second half of 2026.

It is understood that Cavotec’s solutions can reduce harmful pollutant emissions by a ‘significant’ amount by allowing vessels to connect to shore power while at berth.

As the company’s representatives have noted further, this also supports compliance with international environmental regulations, such as the Net Zero Framework (NZF) that has been set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Over the past year, Cavotec has shaken hands with several partners seeking to ensure more environmentally friendly operations.

In Europe, the company won three shore power orders (totaling €7 million, or $8.1 million) for Italian ports, aimed at slashing harmful emissions and improving air quality. The deliveries for these initiatives, which were unveiled in January this year, are also slated for 2026.

“These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions.
It’s a view shared by the group of shipowner associations that have today expressed their support of the framework.
Earlier this year, Djibouti and Gabon levied a $17 per tonne of CO2 equivalent charge on 50% of emissions from voyages to and from their ports, echoing the EU emissions trading system.
The group of associations was unequivocal in its support for the framework ahead of next week’s vote, and in its warning of the alternative.","A GROUP of shipowner associations representing around a quarter of global tonnage has thrown its weight behind the Net-Zero Framework set to be voted on at the International Maritime Organization next week.

In a statement given exclusively to Lloyd’s List, signed by the leaders of the Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association and Danish Shipping, urged IMO member states to “make history in London” by adopting the Net-Zero Framework at next week’s extraordinary meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee.

“As a result of multiple years of negotiations, the Net-Zero Framework is set to propel sustainable shipping at a truly global scale,” the group said.

It offers “concrete mandates” for the reduction of emissions, the associations said, as well as a “pricing mechanism that puts a cost on undercompliance and rewards the use of alternative, greener fuels under a global fuel standard”.

“These are clear, global measures that will drive down the industry’s climate emissions.

“Crucially, it will strengthen the business case for cutting emissions and investing in sustainable energy, fuels and technology.”

That view was not shared by another group of shipowners, who instead voiced their opposition to the framework last month.

The group, including the Angelicoussis Group, Bahri, Capital Group, Frontline, GasLog, Hanwha Shipping, George Prokopiou companies, Stolt Tankers and George Economou’s TMS Group, as well as others, said it did not believe “the IMO NZF will serve effectively in support of decarbonising the maritime industry as per the IMO2023 strategy, nor ensure a level-playing field as intended”.

Crucially, it argued that a failure “to incentivise investment in known and available transition technologies with established standards, and focusing only on unproven ZNZ (zero or near-zero) solutions, will result in the majority of shipping shifting towards pay-to-emit operations”.

They are not the only ones who have poured cold water on the framework in recent weeks.

DNV Maritime chief executive, Knut Orbeck Nilssen, stressed “major concern” over its delivery, questioning why the IMO was putting “roadblocks” in the path of liquified natural gas to decarbonise the industry.

Fellow class society ABS went one step further. Chief executive Christopher Wiernicki called for the IMO to take a “timeout” and rebuild its NZF.

“The IMO needs to approach this as if it were building a ship — systematic, explicit, specific and achievable,” he said.

“The stakes are high, timelines are short, and the current gaps between fuel options are significant.”

Speaking to Lloyd’s List following the dissent from the group of shipowners and class societies, UCL professor Tristan Smith said it was not “particularly surprising or new that some shipowners with various LNG interests are expressing negativity to regulation that will reduce their competitivity, especially when viewed through the ‘coincidence’ of similar ABS and DNV PR from the last few days”.

He said those views were nothing new and had likely already been priced into the positions of member states back in April, when the NZF was initially agreed on MEPC83.

As Lloyd’s List senior reporter Declan Bush said on this week’s edition of the Lloyd’s List Podcast, failing to adopt the NZF does not mean climate regulation will go away. Instead, it will likely mean more rules, not fewer.

It’s a view shared by the group of shipowner associations that have today expressed their support of the framework.

The alternative, they said, “is a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks”.

“Not only is this an entirely wrong solution for a global industry such as ours, such a scenario will also derail ongoing efforts towards the energy transition and jeopardise world trade through distorted market conditions and unfair competition,” they said.

With that in mind, the group has also called on the EU to align itself with the IMO regulations if they are adopted to avoid “double payment for shipping emissions and to reduce the regulatory burden”.

The EU has said that it will align its policy with the IMO’s, but only if it considers the UN body ambitious enough.

That of course leaves the door open for it to continue collecting penalties from FuelEU and the ETS, penalties it has been suggested EU member states might be reluctant to give up.

ECSA European Shipowners (formerly ECSA) said the EU’s policy was in part introduced to nudge the IMO towards action and the adoption of an international system to reduce emissions.

That goal, it said, has now been achieved.

A glimpse of what’s in store should the Net-Zero Framework not be adopted (or if the EU continues to enforce its own rules) has been offered by the action of some African states.

Earlier this year, Djibouti and Gabon levied a $17 per tonne of CO2 equivalent charge on 50% of emissions from voyages to and from their ports, echoing the EU emissions trading system.

The Africa Sovereign Carbon Registry Foundation (the organisation behind the scheme) secretary-general Ahmed Araita Ali said African governments “are not naïve” and said they had the right to require climate accountability from operators working in and around its ports.

Africa makes up 17% of the world’s population but is responsible for just 4% of global emissions and was assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2022 as being the continent most vulnerable to climate change.

“African countries are simply asserting their right to climate sovereignty, and they expect companies from the Global North will respect this autonomy rather than undermine it,” he said.

More countries are expected to join the ASCR’s scheme, and there’s good reason to believe other similarly regional schemes could be set up in the future, should the IMO fail to offer a unified framework.

The group of associations was unequivocal in its support for the framework ahead of next week’s vote, and in its warning of the alternative.

Anything else, it said, would be a “major setback for the green transition” and leave the industry to navigate an “unwieldy patchwork of regional climate regulations”.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/images/regulation/2025-new-pictures/mepc83-overview.png?rev=51b2f5c8628b4a5abf11605308093d3c,N,,2025-10-08 07:57:35.495645

The two bunker calls will enable the vessel to complete a full round trip along the historic coastal route, supported by the ship’s large battery packs.

The pioneering project coincides with an important fork in the road for global shipping and its future fuel ambitions. It will come just a few weeks after what are expected to be tense and tetchy negotiations at the IMO in London next week, where delegates will decide to adopt the UN agency’s ‘mid-term measures’ on decarbonisation, or not.

Observers and analysts warn that this is by no means a done deal. The US has threatened tariffs on countries that back the IMO's Net Zero Framework next week. And in recent days, groups of heavyweight shipowners and operators in various locations have expressed concern over the IMO’s timetable, practicality, and cost to the industry.

However, Havila Voyages is not deterred. “With this voyage,” declares CEO Bent Martini, “we aim to prove that it is entirely possible to operate the entire coastal route climate-neutrally – something we also believe should be the minimum requirement in the next tender period.”

Since announcing the project in August, the company has worked closely with gas suppliers, Barents Naturgas and Molgas. “We are pleased that the delivery in now confirmed,” says Martini. “The amount of biogas we will have on board is significant and will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from this voyage by more than 90%.”

Martini commends a similar endeavour by Hurtigruten, the other operator on the route. The company, with seven ships deployed on the coastal run, plans to carry out a similar exercise using biodiesel on the hybrid coastal vessel, Richard With, at the end of October. However, he is also keen to point out that biogas offers more significant emissions reduction potential.

“Biogas offers even greater reductions – not only in CO2 emissions but also in local emissions such as nitrogen and sulphur oxides which are reduced by 100% with biogas,” he says. “This has a major impact on local air quality in the 34 ports we visit along the coast.”

“Looking ahead, and by the end of 2028, we aim to operate solely on biogas,” he adds. “This gas will be produced and sourced along the Norwegian coast. It’s short-travelled, will create local jobs, and strengthen the value chains along our route.”

Biogass Norge, an industry association, highlights the sources of biogas – food waste, livestock manure, and fish sludge.

Despite LNG’s popularity as an alternative fuel, methane emissions have been the Achilles’ heel undermining its climate credentials.
The trials, running through fiscal 2026, will test system durability and catalyst lifespan before full commercial rollout from 2027.
MOL says it will push for early adoption of the technology across its LNG-fuelled fleet and share findings to support broader uptake in Japan’s shipping cluster.
“Getting closer to the 2030s, we need to protect the bridge, which is LNG with methane-slip controls and credible bio-/e-LNG pathways,” Wierniki said.","Japan’s Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) has achieved a 98% reduction in methane slip during sea trials — a leap that could reshape the emissions profile of LNG-fuelled tonnage ahead of next week’s Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) where LNG as a fuel will likely become one of the flashpoints among delegates.

Working with Kanadevia and Yanmar Power Solutions under Japan’s Green Innovation Fund scheme, MOL tested a new methane oxidation catalyst and engine modification system aboard the Reimei, an LNG-fuelled coal carrier panamax (pictured) operating between Japan and Australia.

The demonstration far exceeded the project’s 70% reduction target — and even topped the 93.8% cut seen in land-based trials certified by ClassNK.

Despite LNG’s popularity as an alternative fuel, methane emissions have been the Achilles’ heel undermining its climate credentials.

By proving a near-total elimination of slip in real-world sea conditions, MOL and partners may have handed LNG a crucial lifeline in the decarbonisation debate — especially as new IMO lifecycle standards tighten scrutiny of well-to-wake greenhouse gas performance.

The trials, running through fiscal 2026, will test system durability and catalyst lifespan before full commercial rollout from 2027. MOL says it will push for early adoption of the technology across its LNG-fuelled fleet and share findings to support broader uptake in Japan’s shipping cluster.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, tabled for adoption at next week’s extraordinary MEPC session, would introduce new carbon fees from 2027 as part of the IMO’s pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

In a surprise intervention, Christopher Wiernicki, the departing chairman and CEO of ABS, the third largest shipping classification society in the world, came out against IMO’s planned net zero framework last month.

“Shipping and the IMO are on different trajectories. There is no clear pathway for green fuel availability and scalability and infrastructure support. LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success and should not be overlooked, over penalised or discarded in the net zero regulation,” Wiernicki said at the launch in London of the 2025 ABS Sustainability Outlook, backing greater support for LNG as a bridging fuel.

“Getting closer to the 2030s, we need to protect the bridge, which is LNG with methane-slip controls and credible bio-/e-LNG pathways,” Wierniki said.

Peter Keller, chairman of SEA-LNG, a lobby group supporting the super chilled fuel as an alternative shipping fuel, claimed yesterday: “The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognises the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway.”

LNG’s credentials as shipping’s leading alternative fuel have driven much debate for years.

Writing for Splash last week, Elissama Menezes and Andrew Dumbrille, directors of NGO Equal Routes, argued that once the IMO applies its comprehensive life-cycle approach under the net zero framework’s guidelines, it becomes clear that methane-based fuels – LNG, biomethane, and e-methane – cannot credibly deliver on climate, pollution, or human rights objectives.

Overall, 192 new orders for alternative-fuelled vessels have been placed in the first nine months of 2025, with LNG-fuelled vessels accounted for the majority of these orders at 121, followed by 43 orders for methanol-fuelled ships, with the remainder made up by LPG carriers (19), ammonia-fuelled vessels (5), and hydrogen-fuelled vessels (4), according to data from DNV.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MOL-Reimei.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 07:57:45.635265

“Energy producers have cut well-to-wake emissions by a quarter in the same period. Engine manufacturers have taken practical steps to almost halve the emissions performance of those engines with methane slip. Real progress towards eliminating methane slip has been this decade.”

At London International Shipping Week in September, SEA-LNG said the leadership of ABS and DNV highlighted the importance of LNG, and the pathway it enables through liquefied biomethane (LBM/bio-LNG) and e-methane.

The industry also cautioned the risk of unintended consequences from regulations for which the supporting guidelines have not yet been fully developed.

“SEA-LNG represents the whole LNG value chain and is the only maritime industry organisation advocating for LNG and the methane decarbonisation pathway. It has for years suggested that regulations be firmly founded on proven science and remain technology neutral,” it said.

“Within this context it is also important that regulators be practical and realistic as to what can be accomplished in any given timeline.”

Peter Keller, Chairman of SEA-LNG, said: “The evidence is clear: LNG is delivering emissions reductions now and providing a practical pathway to net-zero through biomethane and e-methane. It is essential that future regulation builds on this momentum and recognises the proven benefits of the methane decarbonisation pathway.”

Steve Esau, Chief Operating Officer of SEA-LNG, added: “Independent studies by Sphera and Rystad Energy confirm a steady decline in well-to-tank emissions from LNG over the past decade. With further reductions expected as supply chains evolve, and with LBM and e-methane scaling, the pathway is both credible today and vital for the industry’s long-term transition.”

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Captain Rahul Choudhuri, IBIA Board Member & IBIA Asia Regional Board Chair, and President of Strategic Partnerships at VPS, sat down with bunkering publication Manifold Times to offer his take on future challenges of the marine fuels sector.

MT: Heading into IMO 2030, what are the challenges of maintaining bunker fuel quality for safety despite an increasing array of alternative marine fuels? Is the ISO 8217 marine fuel standard enough for end users?

The shipping industry, with 20% of users still on the outdated & withdrawn ISO 8217:2005 edition, is certainly ‘change-averse’. Bunker buyers want a cheaper product [e.g. ISO 8217:2005] but they also need to be aware this is a poorer quality product line.

This slow adoption means the benefits of the new and much improved ISO 8217:2024, which also addresses biofuels for the first time, are not being realised. It’s like a dilemma and a curse and if every new version of an ISO 8217 standard, which is supposed to improve quality and safety, is not really going to be used ultimately the shipping industry will have to pay the price.

And the worst nightmare is when the ship faces engine damage, loses propulsion, stops in midocean and is drifting for several days. This is still happening today and poses a very high safety of life risk.

Another part of ISO 8217 development is that because of the way it is conducted, there are many countries representation involved with necessary compromises when the standard is finally completed.

For example, the latest ISO 8217:2024 standard does not consider biofuel issues such as microbial activity, cold flow, stability, chemical contamination etc.

In contrast, the new Biofuels Standard in Singapore TR140 launched early this year is more comprehensive & covers Biofuels quality more holistically, including future new feedstocks.

To address risks not covered by standard tests, VPS launched the Additional Protection Service for Biofuels testing(APS-BIO) three years ago. This service provides additional protection by testing for a wider range of issues in biofuels, aiming to provide a comprehensive quality control of biofuels that are used for shipping.

MT: Have marine fuel testing labs been able to catch up with risk management of bunker consumption in relation to the evolution of changing bio feedstocks?

Acknowledging the slow adoption of latest ISO 8217 marine fuel standards, VPS has developed a risk management plan for shipowners consuming biofuel bunkers by testing for additional parameters covering Energy Content, Renewable Content, Stability, Cold-Flow Properties, Corrosivity, Microbial Activity & Chemical Contamination. This is part of the APS-BIO package mentioned earlier.

There’s a lot of work that VPS has done in understanding new types of bio feed stock. For example, Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) is now a ‘hot topic’ in certain regions, and we know this is a sustainable feedstock which in principle can benefit the circular economy.

Based on our experience, some CNSL blends have been used without any issues while others have caused engine damage problems, like fuel sludging, injector failure, filter clogging, etc.

So, there is a need for risk management here in how you use such biofuels. What is important is to take proactive measures and do the necessary tests including by blending them into small portions while submitting samples to the lab. More advanced tests like the Fuel Combustion Analyser can be a useful tool as well.

Interestingly, certain blends of CNSL show better ignition & combustion characteristics when blended with Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) when compared to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). This is an example of the benefit by employing risk management and understanding the types of biofuels consumed.

MT: Has the role and challenges of the bunker surveyor changed in the era of MFM, digitalisation and zero carbon/green fuels?

When we look at bunker survey, it is essentially a subset of marine surveying that has been there since the advent of shipping. The primary role of a surveyor is really based on ‘trust but verify’ and that concept is what the surveyor is doing whether it is in bunkering or marine surveying or cargo inspection – so that is here to stay.

But in the context of MFM, the role is changing and for example the surveyor needs to now ensure compliance to ISO 22192 [Bunkering of marine fuel using the Coriolis MFM system] so there is a technologist direction that surveyors need to adopt as well.

The role of the bunker surveyor will be even more important with future alternative marine fuels (such as Methanol) where the level of safety is higher. The types of measurement & sampling are different so in a way the surveyor is moving up the value chain and that must be managed in the industry with proper training etc., and I think those that succeed will be at the forefront of future surveying.

For example, about two years ago there was a methanol bunker delivery in Singapore. VPS was appointed by not only the shipowner but also the product owner. One must be aware that when you do complex fuels like methanol, other parties who operate on a different mindset want to be involved and are interested in this type of product surveying control.

MT: Moving forward, can you forecast the changing role of bunker fuel testing labs past (pre-IMO 2020) and present leading into IMO 2030?

There are several formal studies done which shows the best-case scenario up to 2050 still includes about 50% fossil fuel for global consumption with the rest being taken up with renewable and green fuels. That’s the best case.

I think fossil fuels are here to stay for some time and managing these will continue to be key work for laboratories and testing agencies. Issues such as high Al+Si (Catfines) are not only going away but increasing, and this means better operational control of purification systems onboard vessels.

From a lab point of view, future fuels offer an opportunity to value add at a different level as they are a much more complex and high-end type of products. Those laboratories who are willing to invest and take up positions in these new future marine fuels really will be the winners of tomorrow.

Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) on Tuesday (7 October) said it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NH3 Clean Energy (NH3) and Oceania Marine Energy (Oceania) regarding the development of clean ammonia bunkering operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

The MoU is to promote collaboration with NH3 and Oceania on the Pilbara Clean Fuels Bunkering Hub initiative, which is Australia’s first ammonia bunkering concept announced by the Pilbara Ports Authority in June this year. MOL will be the world’s first ocean-going shipping company to participate in this initiative.

The Pilbara region of Western Australia is home to the world’s largest iron ore export port and serves as a major port of call for Capesize bulkers.

The Pilbara Ports Authority has entered into a joint development agreement with NH3, which will supply blue ammonia, and Oceania, which will operate the bunkering business, to realize low-carbon ammonia bunkering in the region.

Their goal is to commence bunkering operations for Capesize bulkers at the ports of Dampier and Port Hedland by 2030.

This MoU aims for MOL, NH3, and Oceania to collaborate on the transition of iron ore carriers in the Pilbara region to ammonia fuel and the realisation of the WAH2 project.

The WAH2 Project is NH3’s flagship project to supply low-emissions ammonia to the decarbonising powerhouse economies of the Asia Pacific, including Japan and South Korea as well as being a source of decarbonised bunker fuel for powering bulk carriers carrying iron ore from Australia to Asia.

The trio will also jointly propose solutions to Western Australian iron ore suppliers and work to address issues such as safety in ammonia bunkering operations.

MOL will jointly own three ammonia dual-fuel Capesize bulkers with Belgium-based CMB.TECH NV, which are scheduled to be delivered by China State Shipbuilding Corporation’s Qingdao Beihai Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. between 2026 and 2027. These vessels will be chartered by MOL.

MOL is looking to establish a fleet of ammonia duel-fuelled capesize bulk carriers on the West Australia to East Asia trade route and ensure safe ammonia bunkering operations and consider the procurement of ammonia.

As an operator of ammonia dual-fuel vessels, MOL will work for this project to advance considerations regarding safety assurance and ammonia procurement in the Pilbara region.

MOL’s Managing Executive Officer Kazuhiro Takahashi, commented: “We are honored to sign this MoU with NH3 and Oceania today, which will be a vital hub for our ammonia dual-fueled capesize bulkers scheduled to commence operations from 2026.

“This collaboration marks an important milestone in our efforts to establish a safe and reliable ammonia bunkering operation in the Pilbara region. By working closely with our partners, we look forward to building a robust framework for safe ammonia bunkering and advancing sustainable shipping together.”

Molgas Energy Group (Molgas), backed by infrastructure investor InfraVia, has finalised the full acquisition of Titan Energy Holding, parent company of Titan Clean Fuels (Titan), the companies announced on Tuesday (7 October).

The transaction, which follows Molgas’ initial 45% minority stake, marked a major step forward in the Group’s strategic growth in the clean marine fuels sector.

Titan is an independent supplier of liquefied biomethane (LBM/bio-LNG) and LNG, serving both maritime and industrial customers. Its fleet of small-scale bunkering vessels operates across key global markets, with a strong base in the Northwest European region.

Titan’s LNG bunkering operations will merge with Molgas’ existing operations in Norway and all truck-to-ship supply across Norway and continental Europe will now be combined.

With the integration of Titan, the Molgas Energy Group now operates a fleet of seven LNG bunkering vessels and manages a proprietary network of over 70 road-fuelling stations, with more than 200 points of sale including associated partner stations.

This expanded footprint positions Molgas as a pan-European leader in downstream LNG and bio-LNG solutions for industrial, road transport, and marine customers.

The acquisition comes at a time of accelerating momentum for clean fuels. LNG and bio-LNG are increasingly recognised as scalable, low-emission alternatives that can play a vital role in decarbonizing both shipping and heavy-duty road transport.

With tightening regulations, like EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, and therefore growing demand for sustainable energy, Molgas and Titan are well-positioned to lead the transition toward cleaner mobility and logistics.

Following the transaction, Niels den Nijs will lead Molgas’ Marine Business as Executive Vice President, Marine. He will oversee all marine activities, delivering integrated end-to-end ship-to-ship and truck-to-ship bunkering services across Europe.

Sofoklis Papanikolaou, CEO of Molgas, said: “Niels and the Titan team started as true pioneers, showing remarkable innovation and have grown Titan into one of the sector’s most reliable LNG bunkering operators. The success of our initial collaboration laid the groundwork for this acquisition, which significantly extends our reach and capabilities.

“We are welcoming to the group a very experienced team, with leading specific expertise in marine fuels and decarbonisation. Together, we will build a robust platform to deliver LNG and bio-LNG solutions across Europe and beyond.”

Niels den Nijs, CEO of Titan, said: “From the start, our partnership with Molgas was a strong strategic fit and I’m very happy to join their board. By joining forces fully, we substantially strengthen our balance sheet and joint commercial reach.

“Together, we will scale our clean fuel solutions for the maritime sector at a time of accelerating demand and regulatory tail winds. This integration allows us to better serve our long-term customers with an unrelenting focus on our mission: to deliver economical fuel at scale to help decarbonize shipping.”

Athanasios Zoulovits, Partner at InfraVia Capital Partners, said: “As the maritime industry undergoes a major transformation, Titan’s expertise positions Molgas to lead in delivering scalable clean marine fuel solutions. We are proud to support Molgas in its mission to accelerate the energy transition across industrial, mobility, and maritime markets.”

Each milestone is measurable, visible, and achievable — proof that the fleet is learning again to fuel in motion.","From Pearl Harbor’s smoke to the IMO’s clock, the maritime world faces its most decisive refueling mission since 1942.

“The next Guadalcanal of this campaign won’t be a battle at sea — it will be a price curve, a port standard, a policy vote.”

It began in smoke.

Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941. The harbor air was thick with burning oil, flame, and disbelief. Eight battleships took the brunt of the attack — bombs and torpedoes sent five to the bottom within minutes. The Age of the Battlewagon was over, and the Age of the Carrier was born.

The pivot came fast. World War II would not be fought by ships of the line in set-piece battles, but for bloody half-acres at Guadalcanal — a desperate defense of Henderson Field.

The Navy adapted. The U.S. learned to fight an energy war across a vast ocean. Victory came not from tonnage of steel but from fleet oilers, refining capacity, access to crude, food surplus, supply ships, aircraft, destroyers patrolling “the Slot,” and the new reach of carrier power.

Eighty years later, the smoke still hangs in the air — not from Pearl Harbor, but from every ship, port, and refinery that keeps global trade alive. The enemy is different now, but the realization feels the same: the Age of Bunker Oil is ending.

The haze that shrouds today’s world is not the fog of war, but the accumulation of emissions from the twenty-first century’s stretched supply chains. Volatile prices. No swing producer. We’ve optimized our way into fragility.

And so, once again, the world’s fleets are pivoting — this time toward methanol, ammonia, bio-LNG, and drop-in fuels that promise to keep commerce flowing without choking the sky. Not powered by fossil empires, but by innovation and coordination. The old oilers are now electrolyzers; the carriers are container ships; the island bases are ports reborn as Green Corridors. The supply lines stretch from Singapore to Rotterdam, from Los Angeles to Tokyo — and the race to decarbonize is already underway.

The question, as it was in 1942, is simple: Can the fleet pivot fast enough? Will we master change — or will change master us?

The Masters of Change

It takes staggering fuel to keep the sea lanes alive.

Every day, nearly five million barrels of oil are burned to drive 90,000 vessels hauling over a billion tons of freight — a moving continent of combustion. If global energy demand were a world map, shipping alone would be Russia plus China, a superpower of motion.

At the center of the campaign stands the International Maritime Organization, the modern equivalent of wartime Whitehall — issuing the orders, setting targets, demanding accountability. Its campaign plan: net-zero by 2050, and at least 5 percent of maritime energy from alternative fuels by 2030.

The admirals of this fleet wear no medals. They wear hard hats in Singapore, suits in Copenhagen, and grease-stained coveralls in Rotterdam.

Maersk has gone all-in on methanol, ordering twenty dual-fuel ships and investing in plants from Denmark to Egypt — part of a global surge of 190 renewable methanol projects in development or operation by 2030.

Fortescue’s Green Pioneer has completed ammonia bunkering at sea, proving that even the most hazardous molecule on deck can become a zero-carbon contender.

Methanex now offers methanol bunkering from the ARA region to South Korea, fueling the early adopters.

Titan Clean Fuels, freshly acquired by Molgas Energy Group, is expanding LNG and bio-LNG capacity — bridge fuels that keep the convoy moving while the cleaner fleet forms astern.

Even Singapore, the world’s busiest bunkering hub, has barely begun the shift: 880 thousand tons of biofuel blends in 2024, just 1.6 percent of its total bunker sales — a global share of roughly half a percent.

And yet, that’s how every campaign begins — with one pierhead, one pipeline, one spark.

Meanwhile, the only fully commercial drop-in technology today — hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), or HVO — is scaling fast, with projected global capacity of 25 billion liters per year by the early 2030s. Each new plant is another refinery turned from warship to carrier, from carbon to continuity.

They’re not just building ships. They’re building the lifeblood of transformation.

The Arsenal of Innovation

Across the shipyards, the torches burn again — not for armor, but for endurance. Welding arcs flash from Bilbao to Busan. The next fleet is taking shape one molecule at a time.

Drop-in biofuels — HVO, FAME, and bio-HFO — form the first wave. They flow through existing pipelines and burn in existing engines. They buy the fleet time.

Methanol is the campaign’s workhorse: liquid at room temperature, easy to handle, made from biomass, captured CO₂, or renewable hydrogen. Dual-fuel methanol engines are already commercial, proving that cleaner propulsion doesn’t mean slower trade.

Ammonia is the high-risk, high-reward weapon: carbon-free, but volatile. Pure anhydrous ammonia is toxic, corrosive, and potentially lethal in high concentrations. It eats brass, attacks copper, and demands rigorous safety across the value chain. Fortescue’s trials succeeded under strict conditions — a model for what’s coming next.

Renewable methane and bio-LNG provide the transition bridge. Titan and Molgas are scaling production, using existing LNG networks to link present operations to future systems.

Together, these molecules make up the arsenal of innovation — chemistry retooled for persistence. But innovation isn’t only about what fuels the ship. It’s about using less of it.

The Sixth Weapon — Efficiency

The quietest weapon is also the most powerful: efficiency.

While fuels change slowly, efficiency pays immediately. The IMO estimates that improved design and operation could deliver 20 percent of total emissions reduction by 2050 — the low-hanging fruit of the transition.

Every ton of fuel saved stretches the scarce biofuel supply and offsets the lower energy density of e-fuels. Efficiency is the campaign’s logistics arm — the multiplier that makes every molecule count.

The toolkit is broad:

Wind propulsion has returned, with suction sails and Flettner rotors now rising on merchant decks. Three wind-assisted vessels recently entered the Port of Singapore — modern echoes of the clipper age.

Hydrodynamics matter too: cleaner hulls and improved coatings reduce drag by up to ten percent.

Operational measures like slow steaming have already cut consumption significantly across long routes.

Supporting all this are the IMO’s technical mandates — the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new builds, the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) for existing ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for fleets.

Efficiency doesn’t make headlines, but it wins wars. The cleanest barrel is the one the fleet never burns.

The Front Lines of Transition

Every advance encounters resistance. The maritime pivot now plays out across five active fronts:

The Cost Front. Biofuels and e-fuels remain expensive. Analysts estimate that a carbon price of €100–150 per ton of CO₂ is needed to close the gap with fossil fuel. Until then, every voyage is a calculation between courage and cost. Yet among non-fossil options, biofuels remain the most cost-effective bridge to decarbonization.

The Feedstock Front. Aviation, trucking, and shipping are raiding the same pantry of biomass and renewable power. There’s not enough to feed every fleet, and competition is fierce.

The Infrastructure Front. Ports are transforming into fueling bases for the clean campaign. Meeting renewable-fuel demand by 2030 — 18–28 million tonnes — will require around €18 billion in new infrastructure investment.

The Technical Front. Drop-in fuels vary in stability and composition. Some, like FAME, are acidic and can wear engine components. Pyrolysis oils are unstable without hydrotreatment, their high oxygen and water content making them corrosive and short-lived. Compatibility management turns every ship into a floating lab.

The Policy Front. The IMO charts the course, but regional frameworks still differ. The key advance is the Well-to-Wake standard — measuring emissions across the entire life cycle, from production to exhaust. The 2030 goal: 40 percent less carbon intensity than 2008, with at least 5 percent — striving for 10 percent — of maritime energy from alternative fuels.

Despite the headwinds, the fleet is moving. DHL and Henkel will use Sustainable Marine Fuels for 9,000 TEUs of freight next year via Book & Claim accounting — cutting CO₂e by 85%.

And in Singapore, that 1.6 percent biofuel share is doubling yearly. In the fuel war, doubling counts.

The Road to Victory

The clock is ticking — 2030 is less than six years away.

By then, the IMO’s targets must be met or reset: 5 to 10 percent of maritime energy from alternative fuels, 40 percent less carbon intensity, measured Well-to-Wake. The rules are written, the tide is running, and the fleet must now prove it can keep up with its own ambitions.

Victory in this new Pacific won’t come from a single triumph, but from milestones — proof points on the road from ambition to endurance.

Volume.

When global biofuel and e-fuel bunkering passes 10 million tonnes a year—up from barely one million today—the fleet will have crossed from tokenism into transformation.

Demonstration.

When the first ammonia-fueled vessel completes a commercial voyage without incident and under full regulatory approval, zero-carbon shipping will move from theory to fact.

Affordability.

When sustainable marine fuel drops below $1,000 per tonne—roughly parity with fossil MGO at a carbon price near €150 per ton CO₂—the transition will no longer depend on virtue or subsidy.

Infrastructure.

When twenty major ports can bunker methanol, ammonia, or bio-LNG under harmonized standards, the arteries of clean trade will be open.

Policy Stability.

When governments align public incentives, shipowner obligations, and carrier economics, the campaign will have its Grand Alliance—industry, government, and society pulling in one direction.

Efficiency.

When global fuel demand bends downward year-on-year, the war will be half won before the next molecule of green fuel is burned.

Each milestone is measurable, visible, and achievable — proof that the fleet is learning again to fuel in motion.

The industry’s future will be built on the balance between the economic reality of the shipping operations and the environmental decarbonization plan.
As noted by Tan, this balance must achieve fuel and technological shifts in a decarbonization framework and reasonable execution timelines.","The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonization (GCMD) has taken the lead in advancing the strategies that will achieve net-zero carbon emissions for the global shipping sector. As stated by the GCMD Chief Projects Officer, Wee Meng Tan, “a single, universal alternative fuel” will not effectively meet the emissions reduction “holy grail” for the shipping sector. As such, GCMD continues to pursue decarbonization pathways that will sustain a positive transition for the sector in declining carbon emissions. Unlike the fuel-agnostic competitors in the industry, GCMD embraces all forms of technology.

Tan insisted that fossil fuels, including LNG, “will” remain for the foreseeable future, and that the long lifespans of ships will keep fossil fuel “a part of the fuel mix” for decades to come. Tan argues that the necessary scaling of alternative fuel technologies will take “longer” than the ships and that the maritime sector will have to use more “energy-efficient” technologies and “carbon capture” solutions to decarbonize.

The Challenges of Fuel Transition

While analyzing maritime fuel futures, Tan pointed out that it is more important to plan transition pathways, rather than targeting a single end-state for fuels, as there will not be a single end-state for fuels.

Under the net-zero framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), fossil LNG will allow shipowners to avoid penalties until 2035, at the latest. After that, it is expected that shipowners will adopt more sustainable alternatives, with bio-LNG substantially cutting emissions. Tan Augments that bio-LNG could be produced cheaper than many biofuels, but is constrained by competing feedstock demands from power plants that are trying to produce greener grid electricity.

The Promise and Challenges of Bio-LNG

As Tan describes, the strongest argument for Bio-LNG is its ability to serve as a drop-in fuel for existing fleets. This feature is appealing to shipowners who’d rather not spend money retrofitting an engine, but replacing retrofitting. Tan went on to explain that the widespread adoption of bio-LNG is met with challenges, especially the limited availability of feedstock. Biofuels, generically speaking, fall under these challenges; limited feedstock, and from competing sectors, supply constrained overall.

To overcome this issue, GCMD is looking into third-generation biofuels like crude algae oil, biodiesel from animal tallow, and cashew nutshell liquid. These new fuels show potential as substitutes for conventional biofuels, and as Tan mentioned, they can likely increase the sustainable feedstock for maritime.

Book-and-Claim Model as a Solution

There is the challenge of the limited availability of bio-LNG at all ports, which can make it impractical for shipowners in biofuel-scarce locations. GCMD is looking into the book-and-claim model for this issue. Under this system, shipowners can buy bio-LNG certificates that claim the green attributes of biofuel, even if the biofuel is not physically supplied to the ship. Instead, the ship’s bio-LNG is released into the broader gas grid. This way, shipowners can claim the emission reduction benefits of biofuel and fulfill regulations even if they don’t have bio-LNG at every bunkering station.

Investigation of Other Alternative Sustainable Fuels Available

According to Tan, methanol has become an interesting fuel alternative for the maritime industry. Most importantly, methanol is gaining popularity with vessels like the new Disney Adventure, which is set to launch from Singapore this year. This ship will be “methanol ready”. Clearly, this shows that methanol fuel is increasingly becoming a viable option for cruise lines. Tan explains that fuel cells, while providing a clean energy option, lack scale and are more appropriate for auxiliary or hotel loads than main propulsion.

Tan also mentioned a lesser-known alternative, combined gas turbine, electric, and steam (COGES) plants. This approach is akin to what the national electric grids are utilizing. However, while there is potential for this to be utilized within the maritime sector, limitations will always be present in the form of poor fuel efficiency while operating under 50 percent loads.

Economic and Operational Realities

Tan noted that there are several important factors that cruise lines have to keep in mind when switching to alternative fuels; these are the prices and the availability of different fuels, the cost of modifying the engine, and the risk that the chosen fuel will only work for part of the vessel’s operational lifespan. These factors will likely dictate how rapidly the shipping sectors will be able to decarbonize.

Conclusion: The Challenges Ahead

The complexity of the road to net-zero carbon gives the shipping industry no easy alternatives. GCMD maintains the primary focus on the shipping industry’s operational and risk exposures by pursuing various vessel decarbonization pathways, including methanol, biofuels, and carbon capture. The industry is clearly moving, perhaps slowly, toward the decarbonization of its operations. The focus of future efforts should be on the decarbonization of global shipping.

The industry’s future will be built on the balance between the economic reality of the shipping operations and the environmental decarbonization plan. As noted by Tan, this balance must achieve fuel and technological shifts in a decarbonization framework and reasonable execution timelines.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Singapore-Leads-Shipping-Sustainability-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 07:58:11.001478

Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport technical advisers stress that the shipping industry risks locking itself into unsustainable pathways if biofuels are rewarded by the Net-Zero Framework.

“First-generation biofuels come from food and feed crops. That competes with food supply and land, which is risky for developing countries,” said Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport (MCST) legal adviser John Kautoke. “Even advanced biomass is supply-constrained, and aviation is already targeting it for sustainable aviation fuels.

“For our region, importing those fuels would just add cost layers. We need solutions suited to Pacific realities — wind-propulsion, high-efficiency designs, and scalable e-fuels from renewable electricity — rather than locking in costly imports.”

The Pacific submission, which is co-sponsored by Fiji, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu, to the IMO calls for a clear, stringent definition of “zero and near-zero fuels” (ZNZs) that prioritises technologies capable of scaling to net zero by 2050, such as wind propulsion and e-fuels from renewable electricity, while explicitly excluding biomass feedstocks.

IMO members are meeting next week in London to vote on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework.

Experts note that while biofuels can play a limited role in the transition, they are unlikely to meet the sector’s long-term needs. The aviation sector is already competing for the same feedstocks, creating a high risk that scarce resources will be diverted away from shipping.

Climate science underscores the urgency of focusing on scalable, long-run solutions. The latest assessments show global warming has already averaged 1.54°C above pre-industrial levels in 2024, with highly disruptive tipping points that are likely to be triggered between 1.5–2°C. “Investing in fuels that cannot scale wastes precious time we do not have,” Kautoke warns.

Trinidad and Tobago can cash in on Net-zero framework

Ken Chee Hing

THIS country may see economic benefits if the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NZF) becomes law. The framework’s intention is to see a reduction of emissions in the maritime sector.

It was approved in April and is set for adoption this month pending a vote which will take place during the Marine Environmental Protection Committee meeting from October 14-17.

108 members are eligible to vote, including ten from Caricom. If adopted, it will come into effect in 2028.

The framework seeks to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping to align with the 2050 net-zero target.

A news release from the Trinidad and Tobago Energy Chamber’s website on October 6 said that key components include a Global Fuel Standard (GFS) setting annual GHG intensity reduction targets, a two-tier carbon price mechanism, and a credit trading system funded by penalties to reward zero and near-zero emission fuels and support a just transition.

The Framework will apply to all oceangoing ships over 5,000 gross tonnage (GT). These ships are responsible for over 85 per cent of global shipping emissions and are already covered by reporting requirements for fuel data collection. Ships under 5,000 GT are currently not covered.

If adopted, this creates opportunities for countries like TT to seek new markets for petrochemical products produced domestically.

Essentially, the NZF encourages the use of cleaner fuels or technologies. If a ship’s GHG fuel intensity is too high, it will pay a price corresponding to the greenhouse gases it emits above certain thresholds. Conversely, ships will be rewarded for using cleaner fuels.

Methanol, ammonia, and LNG can be used as maritime fuels under this framework since they emit less when consumed than traditional diesel or heavy fuel oil. This provides opportunities for producers in TT and it also opens up the possibility for low-carbon fuel bunkering.

These fuels however are are typically three to four 4 times more expensive today but will reduce over time with increased production and lower technology costs.

Some countries in the Caribbean are concerned that the NZF will significantly push up their shipping costs, which are obviously a very significant issue for small islands states.

The Methanol Institute has recently stated that, “Methanol producers are ready to deliver. Today, there is already enough methanol available to fuel the ships in operation.

The Ammonia Energy Association has also weighed in and said that The Net-zero Framework is a good step in the right direction.",https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24465463.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 07:58:27.542053

It is only natural to build upon that strength.

The Government of Canada's Projects of National Interest list appropriately highlights the significance of ports and marine infrastructure for Canada's economy and trade. Key projects include expanding the Port of Montreal, significant offshore wind development in Nova Scotia, and enhancing northern ports for increased shipping through the Northwest Passage.

But this moment is also about more than building port capacity and doubling down on fossil fuel exports. The next round of nation-building announcements, expected imminently, will provide a critical opportunity for the federal government to demonstrate that it understands the increasingly significant link between clean electricity and economic power.

Ports are critical in the supply chain—connecting offshore wind to the grid, linking shipping to industry, and tying together rail and road networks. Modern, electrified ports can maximize generational investments in clean energy by serving as hubs for offshore wind, energy storage, sustainable fuel trade, and electrified transport.

Geopolitical heavyweights already understand this. China and India are moving at breakneck speed to electrify their ports to support cleaner economic growth and trade. If Canada is serious about competing with global players, it must be able to meet the world where it is going. With abundant wind and solar resources, Canada has a natural advantage in the clean energy transition. Not harnessing it risks falling behind—and facing penalties for the goods we export.

The international shipping sector is moving rapidly to impose penalties for dirty shipping, and reward early adopters of zero- or near-zero-emission shipping fuels such as those derived from green hydrogen. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is targeting steep reductions in the carbon intensity of international shipping, with a goal of being net-zero by 2050. Measures including cleaner standards and a global emissions pricing mechanism are being finalized and are expected to be in force in just two years. The Global Maritime Forum estimates the demand for hydrogen-derived shipping fuel, such as e-methanol and e-ammonia, will be over 500 million tonnes by 2040 due to these regulations, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity and hundreds of thousands of green jobs.

Canadian ports and shipping companies need help with supply and access to zero-emission fuels and renewable energy. Without it, Canada’s world class ports of today, Port of Vancouver, Port of Montreal, and Port of Halifax risk being a destination for the world's most polluting ships.

The government has an opportunity to leverage its historic investments in nation-building projects and port infrastructure to unlock market opportunities for Canadian hydrogen producers and renewable energy developers. To remain competitive with the EU and China, Canada must grow trade without also growing emissions.

Canadians are counting on the federal government to balance economic development with climate action. By embedding clean fuels, electrification, and marine clean tech into today’s port investments, Canada can lead as a strong G7 economy, a responsible ocean nation, and a partner in building a climate-competitive future.",https://assets-nnw.nationalnewswatch.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/NNW-WEBSITE_CARD-GENERIC.jpg?mtime=1697406739,N,,2025-10-08 07:58:39.821738

Meng Tan explained that sustainable fuels like bio-LNG may also not be readily available at every port.
To expand feedstock availability, he said that the GCMD is exploring crude algae oil, animal tallow-derived biodiesel and cashew nutshell liquid as promising third-generation biofuels.
Methanol is also in the picture, according to Meng Tan, who noted that the new Disney Adventure set to launch service from Singapore later this year will be methanol ready.
Fuel cells are currently limited in scale, making them suitable for auxiliary or hotel loads rather than main propulsion, Meng Tan said.","No single alternative fuel will be universally optimal (to meet emissions reduction targets) for global shipping, according to Wee Meng Tan, chief projects officer at the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonization (GCMD) in Singapore.

“The GCMD approaches the future with a tech- and fuel-agnostic stance, focusing on solutions with viable decarbonization pathways,” Meng Tan told Cruise Industry News.

“Fossil fuels are likely to remain in the mix in the near- to medium-term,” he added, “given the long asset lifespan of ships, and the time it will take for alternative fuels to ramp up.

“We also anticipate wider adoption of energy-efficient technologies and carbon capture and storage as it becomes increasingly essential to plan for fuel transition pathways rather than fuel end-states.”

Under the IMO’s net-zero framework, fossil LNG will only allow shipowners to avoid penalties until 2035, at the latest, according to Meng Tan, who said that bio-LNG may be the key to moving the needle on reducing emissions.

“It is also cheaper to produce than most biofuels but producing at scale for shipping would mean direct competition with powerplants using the same feedstock for greener grid electricity, creating a supply constraint,” he said.

Meng Tan explained that sustainable fuels like bio-LNG may also not be readily available at every port. To overcome this challenge, one solution being explored is the book-and-claim model, in which the physical LNG molecule is delivered to a vessel that does not have bio-LNG. Instead, the certified bio-LNG is injected into the wider gas grid or supply chain and issues certificates representing the green attributes of the fuel. A shipowner can thus purchase these certificates, he said, claiming their emission benefits and meet regulatory IMO targets without being restricted to the limited locations where bio-LNG is available for bunkering.

Meng Tan said that while biofuels are appealing for existing fleets as a drop-in fuels requiring minimal retrofitting, their adoption is limited by feedstock availability, which is further constrained by competing demand from other consumers.

To expand feedstock availability, he said that the GCMD is exploring crude algae oil, animal tallow-derived biodiesel and cashew nutshell liquid as promising third-generation biofuels.

Methanol is also in the picture, according to Meng Tan, who noted that the new Disney Adventure set to launch service from Singapore later this year will be methanol ready.

Fuel cells are currently limited in scale, making them suitable for auxiliary or hotel loads rather than main propulsion, Meng Tan said.

He pointed to what he called a lesser-known approach, combined gas turbine electric and steam (COGES) plants, similar to those used by national electric grids. However, COGES is hampered by its limited load flexibility as the fuel efficiency is low when the load is below 50 percent.

“In the end,” he said, “cruise lines must weigh fuel cost and availability, engine modification expenses, and the potential risk that the chosen fuel may offer a shorter period of viability than a ship’s operational lifespan.”",https://cruiseindustrynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/webweemengtan-chief-projects-officer.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 07:56:15.377120

“The North Sea stands at a crossroads, but our analysis shows a clear pathway balancing climate science with energy security,” said Gail Anderson, Research Director, North Sea Upstream at Wood Mackenzie.
This potentially exceeds the North Sea Transition Authority’s mid-range platform electrification scenario savings of 13.4 MtCO2e from 2030 to 2050.
Wood Mackenzie argues for a balanced approach encouraging hydrocarbons, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and wind from the North Sea.
“The government faces pressure to restrict North Sea production, but risks undermining both climate goals and energy security,” added Anderson.","The UK could boost North Sea oil and gas production while remaining within the strictest international climate pathways, according to new Wood Mackenzie analysis. The research comes as the government consults on the basin’s future amid mounting pressure over exploration licensing.

Wood Mackenzie’s research shows the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) production emissions outperform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s net zero scope 1,2 & 3 emissions pathway by 25 to 50 MtCO2e per annum through to 2050.

This creates theoretical headroom for the UKCS to produce 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent by 2050. The surplus remains within climate science requirements whilst delivering substantial economic and environmental benefits.

“The North Sea stands at a crossroads, but our analysis shows a clear pathway balancing climate science with energy security,” said Gail Anderson, Research Director, North Sea Upstream at Wood Mackenzie. “Smart licensing policies targeting known discoveries could extend critical infrastructure life, whilst delivering substantial emissions and cost benefits over importing alternatives.”

The findings emerge as the government weighs whether to ban new exploration licences under its “science-aligned approach” to future UKCS production. Wood Mackenzie’s analysis reveals compelling advantages of maximising domestic production over imports. Every additional trillion cubic feet of UKCS gas saves 15 MtCO2e of scope 1&2 emissions when displacing US LNG imports.

“The more the UKCS produces, said Anderson, the less emissions will be released, and the less the UK will spend on imports. Such an approach will ensure production for decades to come and support the North Sea’s energy future.

Exploration activity collapses to historic low

North Sea exploration has plummeted to unprecedented lows. Due to recent fiscal turmoil, 2025 is set to become the first year since 1960 without a single wildcat well.

The Wood Mackenzie analysis advocates targeted licensing focused on existing discovered resources that could tie back to current infrastructure. A ban on all new licencing would ignore the strategic value of selective development. “Licence awards could be considered if they hold discovered resources or “old fields” which could be tied-back to host platforms” adds Anderson.

Wood Mackenzie identifies 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 7,634 open and relinquished blocks, with gas comprising over one-third. Only 34 blocks contain resources exceeding 20 million barrels of oil equivalent. However, these blocks total 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent and offer crucial tie-back opportunities to maintain host infrastructure viability.

Import dependency threatens emissions targets

The UK faces a stark energy transition challenge as import dependency grows. By 2035, the country will rely on US LNG for over 60% of its gas supply as Norwegian piped imports decline. This shift will triple the emissions intensity of UK gas supply from 3.7 to 11.3 gCO2e/MJ by 2035.

The emissions impact proves severe: 90% of scope 1&2 emissions from gas supply sources will come from US LNG by 2050. Wood Mackenzie’s analysis demonstrates that an additional 1 trillion cubic feet of UKCS gas production could deliver emissions savings of 14.6 MtCO2e. This potentially exceeds the North Sea Transition Authority’s mid-range platform electrification scenario savings of 13.4 MtCO2e from 2030 to 2050.

Economic benefits compound the environmental case. The short-run cost of UKCS gas supply runs at almost half that of US LNG, highlighting dual advantages of domestic production.

European integration maintains supply security

Critics argue that UKCS crude contributes little to energy security because most gets exported. The reality proves more nuanced. Whilst less than 20% of crude refined in the UK comes from the UKCS – down from over 40% in 2010 – the country remains central to integrated European markets.

Three-quarters of UKCS crude exports flow to the Netherlands (48%), Germany (11%), Poland (8%) and Sweden (8%). The UK imports refined products back from these countries in complex commodity flows. This integration secures supply for both the UK and its neighbours through sophisticated trading relationships.

Other European countries increasingly recognise domestic supply value. The Netherlands’ minister for climate and green growth recently agreed to maximise North Sea gas production to reduce import dependency and mitigate climate impacts.

Balanced transition approach recommended

UKCS emissions account for just 3% of net UK territorial emissions, yet the industry faces disproportionate pressure compared to other economic sectors. Wood Mackenzie argues for a balanced approach encouraging hydrocarbons, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and wind from the North Sea. Even under net zero scenarios, the UK will consume around 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and remain a net importer.

“The government faces pressure to restrict North Sea production, but risks undermining both climate goals and energy security,” added Anderson. “The UK needs all types of energy and should encourage more hydrocarbons, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and wind from the North Sea. This balanced approach would deliver the promised fair energy transition, support climate objectives and reduce UK energy costs whilst strengthening supply security.”",,N,,2025-10-07 07:56:31.590877

Who knew that owners were so concerned about the poor consumer? A bemused and a little amused Arsenio Dominguez Secretary General of the IMO, sat in the front row of the Cyprus Maritime Conference in Limassol, pointed out that the UN body has many opinions and these were not the only shipowner opinions.

That much was apparent as only one of the five panellists, Semiramis Paliou, CEO at Diana Shipping, dissented from the majority panel view.

The only woman on stage with four giants of Greek shipping, such as John Coustas of Danaos and Thanassis Martinos of Eastern Mediterranean, George Procopiou, chairman of Dynacom Tankers, and Andreas Hadjiyannis, CEO of Cyprus Sea Lines and Hellenic Tankers. Was it any wonder she admitted to “feeling a little intimidated.”

Procopiou had opened the panel discussion claiming that the IMO’s climate regulations were a kolotoumba, a Greek word meaning that they would achieve the opposite of the intended effect, raising costs and emissions. While in Hadjiyannis’s view man-made carbon emissions were just 10% of the CO2 in the atmosphere and the maritime industry’s contribution was so miniscule that it really doesn’t matter.

Politician’s, said Procopiou, offer the “desirable” solutions because they have a short time in office, whereas shipowners and business people look for the “doable”, shipowners added Procopiou always want to buy the most environmentally friendly ships, because the amount of fuel that you save is proportional to the amount of fuel you burn.

“It is the first time that shipowners and environmentalists are aligned, all of us want less pollution,” but Procopiou, added, no green fuels are available, “If there is a good quality fuel that makes less emissions, tell us where to buy it.”

According to Procopiou, the regulators are making shipping into “a tax collector,”, fleecing the industry with the false hope of decarbonisation.

“If a regulator makes regulations that cannot be implemented then they are being ridiculed, that happened to the previous gentleman that left the IMO, at that time we thought the new secretary general would make a difference, he would consult technical people, people with knowledge. No consultation. Nothing.”

Finishing his monologue Procopiou called for a pause in the regulations, “We don’t need Mr Trump to lead the way, we want to lead the way,” he said. Carbon capture technology, in solid rather than liquid form is the way forward because this technology exists, “The rest is Jules Verne ideas.”

Andreas Hadjiyannis, CEO of Cyprus Sea Lines and Hellenic Tankers, said “he couldn’t agree more,” with Procopiou.

He went on to say that scientists agree that carbon is present at 400 parts per million in the atmosphere, but that 90% of that is not through human activity, but that it is naturally occurring.

Out of the remaining 10% only 2.5-3% comes from shipping, “If you put that into perspective that’s one part per million,” said Hadjiyannis. However, he also acknowledged that the EU ETS “which incentivises people to use clean fuel,” had reduced emissions, but then added that only makes sense if there is a clean fuel, but when there is no alternative fuel the reductions are only through technical improvements.

Hadjiyannis believes that shipowners have operated the most efficient ships for the last 70 years, improving them further in 1973 when the first oil shock sent prices soaring.

“We try for the most economical way of transportation, which translates to less fuel. We’ve been doing that since the second world war,” he said adding there is “Nothing anyone can do to improve that.”

Regulations he said would simply mean very expensive fuels and the people must realise that these higher costs will be passed on to the consumer, making everyday goods very expensive.

Hadjiyannis believes that the costs of the regulations will be hundreds of billions of dollars, but that when that ‘tax’ is passed on it becomes magnified as with the oil companies that see the oil price rise 10%, but the price at the pumps rises by 100%.

“So, the consumer must wake up and react to all this taxation on shipping,” he concluded.

A more measured view was offered by Paliou, who pointed out that it is well known that decarbonisation is very expensive, “not only for shipping but for the world,” and that decarbonisation is not only focused on shipping.

The NZF is “designed to be a catalyst, by reducing the price gap between carbon fuels and alternative fuels, incentivising others to reduce their emissions so they are less penalised by emission charges.”

Income from the emission charging is supposed to be reinvested into the industry to support the research and development of new fuels, their scaling up and their infrastructure.

“The problem arises because our industry feels uncomfortable with a number of things where there is no clarity,” explained Paliou.

A clearer understanding is needed on how a regulatory body will now become a revenue collecting and investment body too, “This lack of clarity creates uncertainty in the shipping community,” explained Paliou.

Moreover, there is concern that these billions of dollars will not come back into the shipping community but will be lost to bureaucracy or invested in other industries.

“What is very important for me,” added Paliou, “Is that we maintain a global level playing field and a global regulation on decarbonisation, anything regional will be a disaster for shipping.”

He joined Ponant as the pandemic recovery was underway and the hybrid electric/LNG-powered icebreaker Le Commandant Charcot was about to be delivered. In the previous five years, Ponant had doubled its fleet.

New itineraries, acquisitions

Under Gastinel, Charcot debuted with a history-making North Pole expedition (the first French and LNG ship to reach the geographic North Pole), and more pioneering Itineraries followed including Canada's first winter cruise, in January this year, also operated by Charcot.

2025 opened with Ponant acquiring Aqua Expeditions with Artémis Group's backing, and Aqua will soon introduce a sixth vessel.

Most recently the Ponant Yachting brand was formed, following a new line of small luxury catamarans introduced in 2024. The newbuild Spirit of Ponant II was just ordered; it will make the 22nd ship in the fleet. Earlier plans by Ponant and Paspaley to convert the 30-passenger former Island Escape into a luxurious expedition ship called Paspaley Pearl by Ponant fell through.

Another significant move was integrating the Ponant and Paul Gauguin brands with certain functions and positions combined. Last spring the 330-passenger Paul Gauguin emerged from a seven-week dry dock with transformed spaces, enhanced amenities and sustainability upgrades.

FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise.
Pooling allows operators, especially smaller fleets or those without immediate access to alternative fuels, to aggregate carbon performance across vessels.
Pooling can be a powerful enabler of decarbonisation, but only if treated as a governance challenge, not a bargain hunt.
FuelEU pooling risks the same fate if the industry isn’t careful.","Compliance doesn’t come cheap when it comes to FuelEU Maritime, warns Philippos Ioulianou, the managing director of EmissionLink.

With the EU ETS reporting deadline passed and FuelEU Maritime enforcement fast approaching, ‘pooling’ has become the buzzword in compliance conversations. Unsurprisingly, most of the debate has been about cost: Who offers the cheapest pool? What’s the price of compliance?

In a sector where margins are thin, this fixation is understandable, but dangerously short-sighted. FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise. It’s a fundamental shift in regulatory responsibility. If shipowners treat it as just another line item in the budget, they risk stepping into the very pitfalls the regulation was designed to prevent.

Pooling allows operators, especially smaller fleets or those without immediate access to alternative fuels, to aggregate carbon performance across vessels. Done right, it smooths compliance and lowers costs. Done wrong, it creates liabilities the industry has never faced before.

Once in a pool, your vessel’s carbon intensity is no longer judged in isolation. You are directly exposed to the emissions decisions of every participant. If one party underperforms, or if the pool manager mismanages compliance, everyone pays the price. That raises urgent governance questions:

Who monitors carbon performance?

Who takes corrective action mid-year?

How are surpluses and penalties shared?

Who ultimately carries responsibility?

Right now, many pooling offers focus on price, using market indexes or spreads between fuel and alternatives as benchmarks. These references may guide cost, but they don’t account for governance, monitoring, or accountability. A cheap pool that hides risk is worse than no pool at all.

If this sounds familiar, it should. The same dynamic is now playing out at the IMO with its proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF). Some of the industry’s biggest names have condemned the NZF for pushing steep decarbonisation timelines without a proper impact assessment. Their criticism is simple: regulators are setting targets that outpace fuel availability, infrastructure readiness, and technological maturity.

As Columbia Group CEO Mark O’Neil observed recently, the gap is most evident with alternative fuels. Their potential is clear, but the challenges of adoption and the pace at which the industry can transition must be carefully managed.

Whether it’s FuelEU pooling or the IMO’s NZF, the lesson is the same: decarbonisation frameworks without strong governance, a clear timeline and commitment from the industry don’t reduce risk, they redistribute it.

For shipowners, this means the old strategy of chasing the cheapest compliance option is over. The real value lies in resilience: choosing partners and structures that can withstand regulatory shocks, fuel market volatility, and underperformance.

At EmissionLink, we believe pooling only works when built on transparency, continuous monitoring and maritime expertise. Participants must know how performance is tracked continuously, not just at reporting deadlines, and someone must carry responsibility if things go wrong.

I would urge shipowners to ask tougher questions before signing into any pooling scheme. Who manages the data and reporting, and how accurate are they? What happens if performance dips? How are penalties and surpluses divided, and who will pay the bill if it’s not delivered? Finally, how do the different frameworks of FuelEU, EU ETS, and the IMO’s NZF align or conflict? These are not academic issues; they can determine whether compliance strategies deliver protection or risk exposure.

Pooling can be a powerful enabler of decarbonisation, but only if treated as a governance challenge, not a bargain hunt. The IMO’s Net-Zero debate shows what happens when ambition outpaces accountability. FuelEU pooling risks the same fate if the industry isn’t careful.

The takeaway is clear: Don’t be seduced by the cheapest pool. Look for experience, responsibility, and alignment with long-term strategies. In compliance, as in shipping, you get what you pay for.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Port-of-Rotterdam.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 07:57:22.787493

How does air lubrication work?
While generating the air bubbles uses energy, with the right hull design air lubrication can achieve an overall reduction in CO₂ emissions of up to 10-15%(link is external).
What impact could air lubrication have on the shipping industry?
What is the future of air lubrication?","If you were on a cruise and a fellow passenger informed you that the ship was sailing on a magic carpet of bubbles, you might understandably think they had inhaled too much sea air.

In fact, there would be a good chance they were correct. As the global shipping industry faces continued pressure to decarbonize, technologies that improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions are gaining increasing attention.

One solution is this carpet of bubbles — officially known as an air lubrication system (ALS) — which reduces a ship’s drag through the water and, in turn, its CO₂ emissions.

How does air lubrication work?

The principle behind an ALS is simple: it reduces the resistance a ship faces as it moves through the water by introducing a continuous layer of air bubbles along the bottom of the hull.

This acts like a cushion between the vessel and the sea, which decreases friction and allows it to glide more smoothly through the water — hence why the effect is sometimes referred to as a ‘magic carpet(link is external)’.

Because friction is reduced, the ship uses less fuel to maintain speed, resulting in fewer emissions and lower operational costs. While generating the air bubbles uses energy, with the right hull design air lubrication can achieve an overall reduction in CO₂ emissions of up to 10-15%(link is external).

Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, a part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) Group, was an early pioneer of the technology(link is external).

Its system — the Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System (MALS) — uses blowers to generate the high pressure and large amount of airflow needed for installation on bulk carriers, container ships, ferries and large passenger ships.

What impact could air lubrication have on the shipping industry?

The global maritime industry currently accounts for almost 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions(link is external) — a figure it is working to cut over the coming decades, but that could rise with the sector’s modest predicted growth(link is external).

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) recently approved regulations for global shipping(link is external) that, from 2027, will require the industry to reduce emissions from ships to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Ships that fail to do so could face financial penalties.

Because it can be fitted to new ships or retrofitted to existing ones, air lubrication can help as an immediately implementable method for large operators — improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact without having to wait for next-generation fuels or redesigned vessels.

What is the future of air lubrication?

Air lubrication systems are not new — MHI’s MALS was first used in the early 2010s and has since been fitted on ferries, cruise ships and more.

As attention to the environmental impact of shipping grows, the market is expanding. Some estimates suggest it will more than double(link is external), reaching $2.5 billion in less than a decade.

More and more companies, from start-ups to established players, are working on ALS technology and the number of both installations in the water(link is external) and orders for systems continues to rise.

One example of innovation can be found in a new strategic partnership between Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Elomatic(link is external), a Finnish engineering firm. The agreement aims to draw on both companies’ expertise to enhance energy efficiency, speed up the adoption of alternative fuels and drive digital innovation in the maritime sector.

One of the first areas of focus for the collaboration will be air lubrication, with MALS being integrated into selected vessels as part of a plan to support the industry as it navigates a path to decarbonization.

How else can shipping cut emissions?

Air lubrication can have a big impact when used in combination with other energy-saving technologies, including ships with low propulsive resistance, high-efficiency propeller systems, and heat recovery from engine exhaust gases.

In the future, alternative fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia and carbon capture technologies will also play a big role.

So while ALS systems won’t magically transport shipping to net zero, they can certainly help smooth the journey.",https://spectra.mhi.com/sites/g/files/jwhtju2216/files/styles/crop_freeform/public/Smooth-sailing%3A-How-air-lubrication-can-cut-shipping-emissions.jpg?itok=U6-ML1KP,N,,2025-10-07 07:57:29.073358

By improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, OptiSave™ helps shipowners comply with the IMO’s base and direct compliance targets.
Conclusion The new IMO MEPC83 GHG requirements will be considered for adoption as amendments to MARPOL Annex VI at an MEPC session in October 2025.","In April 2025, the 83rd session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved the IMO Net-Zero Framework, introducing new emission rules: As of 1 January 2028, all ships above 5,000 GT (except ships trading solely domestically and platforms including FPSOs, FSUs, and drilling rigs, and semi-submersible vessels) must report their GHG fuel intensity (GFI) – and if they do not meet the IMO targets, owners will face economic consequences. The decision is a big step towards lower GHG emissions from shipping.

What are the consequences?

Under the upcoming regulations, shipowners must submit emission reports once a year. The reported figures (calculated using a well-to-wake approach) are compared to targets defined by the IMO.

There are two targets. The most stringent one is the direct compliance target. As shown below, a vessel meets this target in 2028 if it has reduced emissions by 17% or better compared to a 2008 baseline. There is also a less stringent base target; for 2028, this is a 4% reduction compared to 2008.

What happens next depends on which target the ship is able to meet:

If the ship meets (or outperforms) the direct compliance target, there is no cost to the owner. In fact, the owner receives surplus units (SUs) which can offset the Tier 2 compliance deficit of other ships (see below) or be saved for use within the next two years.

If the ship does not meet the direct compliance target but meets the base target, the owner must purchase remedial units (RUs) from the IMO at USD 100 per ton of CO2 equivalents emitted by the ship. These Tier 1 RUs cannot be offset by using SUs from other vessels.

If the ship does not meet the base target, either, the owner must purchase Tier 1 RUs and Tier 2 RUs at a combined cost of USD 480 per ton of CO2 equivalents emitted by the ship. Instead of buying Tier 2 RUs, shipowners can offset the Tier 2 deficit by transferring SUs from other vessels, if any, but the owner must still buy Tier 1 RUs.

As the reduction levels for both direct compliance and base targets increase every year, ships must constantly reduce emissions to stay compliant – and the cost of purchasing RUs quickly adds up. A calculation example from ClassNK shows that a ship consuming around 4,000 tons of LNG annually will cost its owner USD 112,560 a year – even if it meets the base target.

Solution: reducing energy consumption

On almost any ship, it is possible to drive down fuel consumption and emissions by reducing onboard energy consumption. One efficient way of doing this is to operate pumps, engine room fans, compressors, and other equipment based on current requirements instead of design conditions (which are worst-case scenarios intended to prepare the ship for extreme conditions that rarely occur in actual operation).

DESMI calculations show that on a Panamax bulker with three main sea water pumps, for example, it is possible to save 79% of pump-related HFO consumption by adjusting pump speeds. Similar savings can be achieved on other ships, saving thousands of dollars, reducing CO2 emissions, and making it easier to comply with the base or direct compliance target.

DESMI solution facilitates compliance with GFI targets and other requirements

Based on sensor input, variable frequency drives, and decades of experience, the DESMI OptiSave™ solution enables this by automatically optimising equipment operation. It requires no major rebuilding or refitting, making it easy to retrofit and improve efficiency, and it is already operating successfully in more than 700 installations on more than 450 vessels globally.

By improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, OptiSave™ helps shipowners comply with the IMO’s base and direct compliance targets. It also helps them comply with regional emission regulations such as the emission trading system (ETS) used in the European Union. Finally, higher energy efficiency also helps improve the vessel’s CII rating so the owner does not have to develop a SEEMP Corrective Action Plan. Like the GFI targets, CII requirements become stricter year by year, and shipowners need to take action to stay compliant.

Conclusion

The new IMO MEPC83 GHG requirements will be considered for adoption as amendments to MARPOL Annex VI at an MEPC session in October 2025. Though many details are still unclear, it is evident that shipowners must increasingly take steps to reduce emissions or face economic consequences.",,N,,2025-10-07 07:57:45.688954

Availability of low- and zero-carbon fuels, alternative bunkering infrastructure, the disregard of existing fuels and technologies, and safety topped the list of industry concerns that were voiced during London International Shipping Week (LISW) in mid-September.

One of those adding his voice to the chorus of the concerned was Columbia Group chief executive and president, Mark O’Neil. As lead executive for one of the largest shipmanagers in the world, Mr O’Neil said: “[The] runway for widespread adoption of alternative fuels is much longer and much narrower than anyone anticipated,” and urged the industry to slow down. Columbia Group manages more than 400 vessels, has 20 crewing agencies and more than 20,000 employees.

While his firm is committed to maritime decarbonisation, Mr O’Neil called for a reality check in adopting alternative fuels at LISW 2025, echoing sentiments expressed by ABS chairman and chief executive, Chris Wiernicki, earlier in the week.

Adding fuel to the fire is the Trump Administration, which has made it clear that it will not “tolerate any action that increases costs” for Americans. As a follow up to the US walkout during MEPC 83, a joint statement was issued by administration officials in August, serving as a shot across the bow to any IMO member voting for the framework.

“If alternative fuel ships do come in, they will come more gradually”

“Whatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation. These fuel standards would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale,” it said.

The statement, issued by secretary of state Marco Rubio, secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, secretary of energy Chris Wright, and secretary of transportation Sean Duffy, also noted the regulation would “preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where US industry leads such as liquified natural gas and biofuels.”

Concluded the joint statement: “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavour fail.”

Meanwhile, while admitting the fleet of alternative fuel-capable vessels is growing, Mr O’Neil said it “doesn’t mean those vessels are ready to burn alternative fuels.”

And, furthermore, he said, there was a question as to whether “the world is ready to invest considerable sums of money” to provide shipping with alternative fuels, given the current geopolitical tensions and “huge financial constraints throughout Europe”.

He said his company is “realistically ready” for the uptake of alternative fuels. “We don’t need thousands of crews in our crewing pool with alternative-fuel training,” he said, adding that “if alternative-fuel ships do come in, they will come more gradually - and the majority of dual-fuel vessels or methanol- or ammonia-ready will probably never burn those alternative fuels.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/mark_oneil_columbia_groupwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:09.453897

The session offers a rare opportunity to hear directly from two influential voices shaping the direction of the maritime fuel sector.
The material is biodegradable in water and has the potential to be a carbon-neutral marine fuel.","In an exclusive interview with Singapore-based bunkering publication Manifold Times, marine fuel logistics firm Banle Group recently shared insights on the recent 1H 2025 interim financial results of listing vehicle CBL International Limited (Nasdaq: BANL).

Dr Teck Lim Chia, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, elaborated on the company’s diversification of its customer base, factors driving its biofuel sales to surge 154.7% year-on-year in 1H2025, plans on future marine fuels, and future investments:

MT: With sales volume increasing by almost 10%, which shipping industries have been most keen to work with CBL and why is this so?

The increase in sales volume was mainly driven by network expansion, new customer acquisitions, and expansion toward the non-container liner and biofuel segments.

CBL has been actively targeting new customers, including mid-tier shipowners and tankers.

This strategic effort has diversified our customer base beyond container liners to include bulk carriers and oil tankers.

We have been in the industry for long period of time and have weathered various market cycles alongside our clients, building mutual trust through shared experience.

We deliver professional one-stop services, including the bunkering of conventional fuels and biofuels, at reasonable pricing and excellent creditability. This is why we are expanding our customer base continuously, including container liners and non-container liners. Our customer concentration is also coming down continuously.

Shipping companies, which are biofuel early adopters, seeking to comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations have favored us. The surge in our biofuel sales indicates strong uptake from environmentally conscious carriers subject to IMO and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations.

MT: What factors in the market allowed CBL to introduce a triple-digit growth to its biofuels operation while narrowing net loss by 40% in 1H 2025?

On biofuel:

The implementation of IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulations and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations (effective January 2025) has accelerated demand for sustainable marine fuels. These regulations compel shipping companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face penalties, creating immediate market demand for biofuels.

CBL’s early certification (ISCC EU and ISCC Plus) positioned us as a early mover in the sustainable marine fuels space. The successful B24 biofuel deliveries in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and multiple ports in China, have demonstrated our ability to arrange for such services to meet the surging demand from our customers.

Leveraging its early move into sustainable fuels, CBL is expanding its biofuel supply chain and exploring LNG and methanol, positioning itself to capture growth while helping customers meet tightening decarbonization targets across Asia Pacific, Europe, and other key markets.

The carbon emission requirement is the key tune for shipping. As the FuelEU regulations have been implemented since 2025, we expect more ships will use renewable fuel. The marine fuel in the next five years will be very different from those we are using today. CBL is taking a leading approach to adopt the new fuel. The growth of the biofuel will continue, inline of the global demand. We will push CBL staying ahead of this.

On narrowing net loss:

The 38.8% improvement in our bottom line for the first half of 2025 reflects the results of the strategic efforts and resources we have invested over the past few years to expand our port network, grow our customer base, and develop our biofuel operations over the past years.

We are now beginning to reap the benefits of these investments. As a result, we achieved double-digit sales volume growth in both fiscal year 2024 and the first half of 2025. We successfully onboarded new customers and reduced our dependency on our top five clients. Notably, our biofuel segment has continued to deliver strong growth over the past 12 months.

In addition, in the first half of 2025, we streamlined our operations to enhance efficiency, resulting in a 17% reduction in operating expenses.

Going forward, we remain committed to identifying new investment opportunities to further expand our network, with a particular focus on the sustainable fuels segment. In fact, we have adopted a more strategic approach aimed at optimizing profitability.

MT: CBL newly shared an initiative to explore, and possibility include LNG and methanol in its marine fuels portfolio; why is the company doing this and what type of partners are CBL looking to cooperate with?

For us, the biofuel story is just the opening chapter. Right now, we’re deeply entrenched in scaling our biofuel operations.

We’ve got B24 rolling out successfully in key hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and China, and the demand is surging. We’re talking about 155% revenue growth in this segment, just in the first half of the year. But we see this is only the foundation.

So, how are we preparing for what’s next? It’s a three-part strategy.

First, we’re building on our biofuel foundation. We’re not just selling a product; we’re building a certified, compliant supply chain. Our ISCC certifications are like our passport into the future fuel,—they give us and our customers the trust, and verification needed, to navigate through, strict regulations like EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Second, we’re actively exploring the next generation of fuels. Biofuels are a fantastic drop-in solution for today, but we know the market is looking at LNG, methanol, ammonia and more.

We’re already in the early stages of building partnerships, and understanding the supply chains for these fuels. We’re positioning ourselves, to be the partner, that can guide our customers, through this entire journey. From traditional fuel to biofuels, and eventually to whatever the next big thing might be.

Finally, and most importantly, we’re building trust and reliability. This transition isn’t just about having the right product; it’s about having the operational expertise, the digital systems for tracking and compliance, and the financial flexibility to make it all work.

Our expanding network of over 65 ports isn’t just for today’s business—it’s the physical backbone, that will allow us to distribute these new sustainable fuels, whenever and wherever, our customers need them tomorrow.

We are also regularly exploring investments opportunities, into vertical and horizontal supply chain integration.

So, in short, we’re in the process of building a business that is agile, certified, and customer-focused—ready to pivot and scale when the technology and regulations evolve. We’re not just preparing for today’s transition; we’re preparing for tomorrow.

MT: In addition to decarbonisation, the maritime industry has also been adopting digitalisation practises. How has CBL adopted digitalisation into its business operations and what the benefits of doing so?Yes, the bunker trading sector is rapidly embracing digitalisation to enhance efficiency, transparency, and compliance. Integrated platforms now offer end-to-end management of bunkering operations—from procurement and real-time pricing to emissions tracking and documentation. We have explored various software solutions available in the market, but none have been specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of the bunkering facilitation industry. As a result, we began developing our own proprietary system about a year ago.

To date, we have successfully built a management system that supports our daily operations. Looking ahead, we are committed to further enhancing this platform by integrating artificial intelligence — including machine learning — to empower our sales team and management with faster, more informed decision-making capabilities.

CBL’s Digital Transformation Initiatives to integrate with AI:

Real-Time Order Tracking & Analytics:Implement advanced systems for live monitoring of fuel deliveries, quality assurance, and automated reporting, reducing operational delays and enhancing customer trust.

IT tools for Risk Management:Optimize credit risk assessment, cashflow forecast, fraud detection, and supply-demand matching, lowering financial exposures and improving margin stability.

Back-End System Upgrades:Modernize CRM platforms to streamline workflows, automate invoicing/payment processes, and centralize data for faster decision-making.

CBL’s digital adoption strengthens its competitive edge through agility, accuracy, and alignment with industry-wide shifts toward data-driven bunkering.

Further digitalisation will help companies to increase their operating efficiency and we believe that this will be a key determinant in tomorrow’s competitive landscape.

We are also exploring digital tools that enable real-time carbon footprint tracking and compliance reporting for EU ETS/IMO CII, aligning biofuel sales with customer decarbonisation goals.

MT: With cash balance of USD 5.43 million, what are CBL’s plans for this sum of money to support growth?

The majority of capital will be allocated to working capital, ensuring operational stability and supporting increased sales volume without liquidity constraints. A portion will also scale our B24 biofuel operations and secure an ISCC-certified supplier network to capitalize on demand driven by EU ETS, IMO CII, and FuelEU Maritime regulations.

Supported by substantial banking facilities, we maintain a strong liquidity position to meet current obligations and fund future growth. Furthermore, as a Nasdaq-listed company, we have access to capital markets to finance strategic initiatives, including potential mergers and acquisitions for vertical or horizontal integration within the sustainable fuels supply chain.

This disciplined capital allocation strategy reinforces both our immediate operational resilience and long-term strategic objectives, ensuring CBL remains agile and competitive in a dynamic market.

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Constantinos Capetanakis, Chair of IBIA and Bunker Director at Star Bulk, gave bunkering publication Manifold Times an update on the organisation’s growth, industry objectives, and expectations for the upcoming convention.

MT: How has IBIA membership diversification grown since our last interview?

Since the start of my term in March 2024, IBIA has aimed to open membership to more stakeholders. Membership has grown by over 10%; new members include shipowners from many countries including Greece and there has been interest from governmental associations and institutes seeking IBIA’s technical knowledge and expertise regarding the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other decision-making forums.

IBIA aims to represent everyone dealing directly or indirectly with maritime energy and fuels, as it is not an association for a specific sector like bunker suppliers or buyers.

MT: Which agendas and issues in bunkering will IBIA be trying to push for the last quarter of 2025 and for next year?

The primary focus for the last quarter of 2025 is IMO’s decision on the IMO Net-Zero Framework in October. IBIA’s main responsibility will be to make its full membership aware of the framework’s contents, both in theory and practice, by explaining what each party needs to do. We fully support IMO’s role and proposals.

This is crucial as it is a complicated issue as highlighted by IBIA’s Dr Edmund Hughes, former Head of Air Pollution and Energy Efficiency at the IMO, at a recent members’ meeting analysing the implications.

The second major event is the Hong Kong Convention, a significant event within the larger Hong Kong Maritime Week, which we aim for it to be very successful following previous successful IBIA conventions.

MT: IBIA has a plan to expand its influence beyond global regulator IMO; how is the progress on this agenda?

IBIA has established official relationships with world-renowned associations such as BIMCO, GCMD, MPA, Intertanko, and Intercargo, and these relationships are increasing.

Additionally, a European Regional Board has been established with the main objective of participating in discussions and being heard by port authorities in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region, the European Union, and wherever decisions are being made.

The organisation is also expanding its impact in the Americas and Africa. In Asia, its impact in Singapore is growing, and there is a strategic focus on opening into China, which is why the convention is being held in Hong Kong.

MT: What can delegates attending the upcoming IBIA Annual Convention in Hong Kong expect to take away?

Delegates can expect a very high level of speakers, presentations, panels, and marine energy industry related issues to be discussed within the panels. The event will provide significant networking opportunities, fostering an increase in their network, in a professional environment. It will also allow for interaction with other events and people participating in the Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Note: Constantinos Capetanakis will be moderating ‘Session one: Leadership Discussion​’ where he will be in conversation with one of the industry’s most prominent shipowners. This one-on-one interview will explore strategic perspectives on the future of bunkering and shipping, insights into the evolving energy landscape, and reflections on the critical role of collaboration and leadership. The session offers a rare opportunity to hear directly from two influential voices shaping the direction of the maritime fuel sector.

Join the Conversation

With over 300 delegates expected, the IBIA Annual Convention 2025 is set to be a defining moment for the marine fuels industry. Registration is now open via the IBIA Annual Convention website.

The Singapore-flagged Golden Antares, a 7,999 dwt IMO type 2 methanol bunker tanker owned and operated by Singapore bunker supplier Golden Island Pte Ltd, arrived in Singapore Port on 7 August, learned Manifold Times.

The vessel on 23 July completed loading 5,000 metric tonnes (mt) of ISCC EU-certified green methanol from Tianjin Vopak’s storage facility at Tianjin Port before embarking towards Singapore. The Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (Towngas) was the supplier, while Mitsubishi Corporation was the trader for the cargo.

“Our bunker tanker will first undergo port formalities and have its mass flow meter (MFM) unit commissioned in Singapore,” Tomohiro Yamano, General Manager of the Marine Fuel Department at Golden Island, told the bunkering publication.

“After the above is done, it will discharge green methanol to the Stolthaven Terminal in Singapore port on 15 August while keeping a portion onboard for the acceptance test of our Mass Flow Meter (MFM) system to ensure it meets the requirements set by Technical Reference for Methanol Bunkering (TR129).”

As part of efforts to get the vessel to comply to TR129 in order to carry out methanol bunkering operations in Singapore, Mr Yamano also noted that Golden Island has installed safety equipment such as fixed gas detectors from Gastron and fixed thermal cameras from HIKvision on board Golden Antares.

TR129 was launched by the Maritime and Port of Singapore (MPA) and Enterprise Singapore, through the Singapore Standards Council, in March 2025 to provide a comprehensive framework for the safe and efficient use of methanol as an alternative fuel for bunkering operations. It sets out requirements for the safe handling, transfer, and measurement of methanol in bunkering operations.

The development signifies a milestone for Golden Island and the company’s commitment towards sustainability and improved safety arrangement.

All crew members have also successfully completed the Basic and Advanced Training for Handling of Methanol as Fuel for Maritime Personnel courses. The courses were taught by the Singapore Maritime Academy at Singapore Polytechnic, as part of the Maritime Energy Training Facility established by MPA in 2024 to train the maritime workforce to handle and operate vessels using clean marine fuels.

Since 2023, Golden Island has already been designing a methanol bunker tanker for use in Singapore waters.

“We have always believed that for short-term to mid-term decarbonisation targets, green methanol has always been one of the best options available for the shipping industry,” explained Mr Yamano.

“Methanol is liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, thus making it easier to handle and store compared to gaseous fuels. The material is biodegradable in water and has the potential to be a carbon-neutral marine fuel.

“We want to be ready and prepared, overcome potential obstacles and share our experiences and knowledge with all stakeholders. Hopefully, we can help to grow the green methanol ecosystem in Singapore, positioning Singapore as the leading green methanol bunkering hub.”

Towngas

Towngas is the first enterprise on the Chinese mainland to produce ISCC EU and ISCC PLUS-certified green methanol. The successful delivery to Golden Island demonstrates Towngas’s capability to meet the commitments with precision and reliability, noted a spokesperson.

“This achievement underscores the effectiveness of Towngas’s strategic investment in green methanol production,” he said.

“Towngas recognises the growing momentum of the green methanol market across the region and remains dedicated to developing low-carbon solutions that support the shipping industry’s decarbonisation objectives.”

Mitsubishi Corporation

Mitsubishi Corporation, the principal partner of Golden Island in Singapore, acted as a conventional and low carbon methanol supplier, logistic service provider and coordinator of supply chain for the project.

“Mitsubishi views this transaction and partnership as an important step in its methanol initiative to support the global decarbonization of the maritime sector,” stated a spokesman.

Stolthaven Terminal

“Receiving this parcel of green methanol into Stolthaven Singapore through the Golden Antares marks a significant milestone in our efforts to support the decarbonisation of marine fuels,” expressed Guy Bessant, President Stolthaven Terminals.

“As a global storage provider and key logistics partner, we are proud to provide the infrastructure and operational capabilities necessary to handle green methanol safely and efficiently. This delivery not only demonstrates our readiness to support growing demand, but also reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting the future of sustainable shipping in Singapore and beyond.”

Chris Chatterton, Maritime Advisor of Global Centre for Green Fuels (GCGF), believes ethanol should have a seat at the alternative bunker fuel table and he shares with Singapore-based bunkering publication Manifold Times why it deserves to be part of the conversation:

MT: Tell us a little about GCGF, when it started and its mission.

The Global Centre for Green Fuels, or GCGF, is a non-profit global think tank headquartered in Singapore. We were established in 2024 to accelerate the adoption of sustainable fuels across maritime, aviation, and land transport. Our work focuses on enabling real-world deployment of low-carbon solutions through data-driven policy, technical validation, and strategic industry collaboration. We help stakeholders – from regulators to shipowners – navigate decarbonisation challenges with practical, scalable fuel strategies.

MT: As its maritime advisor, why do you think ethanol should be considered as an additional maritime fuel?

Ethanol presents a pragmatic pathway to decarbonise shipping. It’s widely available globally, competitively priced, and can be used with existing methanol dual-fuel engine platforms – often with minor re-calibration. Importantly, ethanol offers very low lifecycle emissions, whether derived from crops, waste or lignocellulosic biomass. Ethanol’s clean combustion profile also helps reduce local air pollutants like SOx and PM (particulate matter). Given the urgency of the IMO’s 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation targets, ethanol stands out as an immediate, scalable, and practical solution.

MT: What’s the current status of the push on ethanol following the document submission, highlighting the use of ethanol as a marine fuel, from Brazil and IBIA at IMO MEPC 83?

That submission was a critical milestone. It called for three main actions: a) inclusion of ethanol in the GESAMP LCA Working Group for lifecycle assessment, b) a request for ISO to develop a marine fuel standard for ethanol, and c) updates to the IGF Code to reflect ethanol-specific safety and operational differences from methanol. The submission was well received and is now being processed through relevant sub-committees like CCC and MSC. GCGF is supporting this by coordinating technical input and promoting pilot demonstrations and engine testing.

MT: With lots of focus on LNG, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen as part of the future marine fuel mix, why do you think there hasn’t been much talk on ethanol and what do you think needs to be done to ensure it is part of the alternative fuel pool?

The ethanol story in shipping is just now being told. Other fuels have had strong industry backing and early movers, whereas ethanol’s benefits – such as its wide availability and infrastructure compatibility – haven’t been highlighted enough for maritime use. What’s needed is greater awareness, technical standardisation, and real-world demonstrations. Ethanol can be bunkered through the same terminals and handled with very similar safety protocols as methanol. Singapore, being a global maritime hub, can play a pivotal role in advancing ethanol’s case through bunkering, pilots and green corridors.

What are the challenges to achieve widespread adoption of ethanol as a marine fuel in terms of production, fuel availability, safety, and long-term viability and how can they be overcome?

Global ethanol supply is already robust – almost 100M mtpa currently – mainly from the U.S., Brazil, Europe, and a growing number of producers in Asia. That’s enough to support near-term maritime demand. Safety-wise, ethanol is classified as a low-flashpoint fuel, similar to methanol, and requires careful handling – something the industry is already accustomed to. Long-term viability depends on sustainability certification, cost competitiveness, and standardisation – all areas GCGF is working to address. The potential is there – it just needs the right regulatory and commercial framework.

MT: As the IMO’s IGF Code already includes methyl/ethyl alcohols as marine fuel, are there specific advantages in using ethanol vs methanol? What are the specific risks of ethanol, compared with methanol?

While it’s true that ethanol has a low flashpoint similar to methanol and as addressed in the IMO IGF Code, it’s important to note that methanol’s flash point, already in use as a marine fuel, is slightly lower. So low flashpoint alone isn’t a disqualifier, it’s a characteristic that must be managed through proper standards and safety protocols. Importantly, ethanol has a significantly lower toxicity risk than methanol, making it safer for crew handling, spill and salvage scenarios.

Ethanol has lower energy density than fuel oil, but higher than methanol, which makes it slightly more efficient too. Therefore, what is needed is a robust, ethanol specific ISO standard that accounts for its unique properties such as water miscibility, energy content, and ignition characteristics. Importantly, ethanol also carries significantly lower toxicity risks than methanol, making it safer for crew handling and spill scenarios.

Interim IMO guidelines already acknowledge ethanol alongside methanol, and class societies have started aligning with these. But we still require marine-specific test protocols, safe handling/safety training, and OEM validation to close the gap and highlight the slight differences between methanol and ethanol as ship fuels. This is a key agenda item for us at GCGF in 2025–2026.

MT: Do engines and tanks on ships need to be modified to use ethanol? How easy or difficult is it to adopt ethanol as a marine fuel?

It’s surprisingly straightforward. Modern dual-fuel engines designed for methanol and electronically controlled – like the Wärtsilä W25, W32, the Everllence (MAN) LGI series and several WindGD models – can be re-calibrated to ethanol with minimal hardware changes. It’s mainly a software calibration and minimal adjustments in the fuel supply system. Several leading OEMs have confirmed this compatibility, and we’re now working with engine OEMs to initiate formal testing and trials. The real opportunity lies in making ships “alcohol-ready,” giving owners flexibility between methanol and ethanol based on cost, supply, and route-specific decarbonisation goals.

Additionally, technology is driving the ability to equalise energy storage on board with the inclusion of Sandwich Structured Cofferdams, enabling lower energy density fuels such as methyl/ethyl alcohols to be bunkered on a Fuel Oil energy-equivalent basis.

MT: With growing interest in cleaner fuels, what are the sustainable advantages of the production of ethanol?

Ethanol supports both climate and energy security goals. Today’s production combines regenerative and precision agriculture with advanced biorefining technologies, resulting in exceptionally low carbon intensity ethanol, on par with or better than many synthetic fuels. It’s also a liquid fuel, meaning it can readily leverage existing bunkering and storage infrastructure. On a macro level, ethanol production supports rural economies, energy security by reducing fossil fuel dependence, and creates a unified supply chain for land, sea, and air transport – as we’re already seeing in places like Brazil, India, and potentially Japan.

As informed, these ships, equipped with dual-fuel gas engines, mark a major step in the company’s decarbonisation plans. Baleària has procured 132 GWh of bio-LNG, enough to keep the three vessels sailing emissions-free until December 2025, representing about 13% of the LNG consumed by its entire gas-powered fleet in 2024.

The bio-LNG is derived from biomethane produced from livestock waste, which captures methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and converts it into renewable energy. The biomethane is then transformed into bio-LNG through Enagás’ regasification plants in Huelva, Barcelona, and Cartagena, using a pioneering conversion process that achieves greenhouse gas savings of more than 200% compared to fossil fuels.

Baleària’s CEO, Georges Bassoul, said the move represents “a real and verifiable step forward” in the company’s net-zero commitment, adding that past investments in dual-engine technology now allow the fleet to fully benefit from renewable fuels.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bal-bio-lng-e1759737807382.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:21.416365

EU member states have been considered key drivers of the NZF driving change at IMO and garnering support from other states concerned about climate change to move shipping’s transition at pace, when compared to much of the IMO regulatory moves. These changes have been made possible by what was thought to be a rock-solid support from across the EU 27.

Speaking at the Cypriot press conference at last month’s London International Shipping Week the Deputy Shipping Minister, Marina Hadjimanolis, flanked by the Permanent Secretary Dr Stelios Himonas and Cyprus’s IMO representative Christos Atalianis, cast doubt on the country’s support for the NZF.

In a move that is expected to anger other member states Hadjimanolis suggested that Cyprus could be swayed by arguments that seek to ease the limitations on LNG, with Himonas suggesting, “We have large reserves of LNG,” indicating this would be economically beneficial for the Mediterranean island state.

One source, who is a representative at the IMO, was scathing about the Cypriot view saying pointing out that any “amendments to the MARPOL agreement were discussed at MEPC 83 in April, that was their opportunity to make changes, any substantive change to now would be going against both Brussels and IMO’s procedure”.

A second source, close to one of the delegations backed that view, adding that, “the details will be discussed at the upcoming Extraordinary meeting, [scheduled to start on 14 October] any changes to the level of ambition should have taken place at the April meeting.”

With detailed discussions already under way and the process now at a watershed moment the stakes could not be higher, with the US already seen as a disruptor, having reportedly approached the Dutch delegation in the hope of breaking the EU consensus, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that other delegations have been or will be approached.

Though Hadjimanolis denies any approach to the Cypriot delegation to date.

It is expected, by most IMO observers, that the two thirds majority vote necessary to pass the NZF will be achieved. That, however, is not the end of the road, the regulations must then be ratified by the nation states in the following ten months, and that requires approval by states whose registries represent at least 50% of global tonnage.

According to one senior figure that could be as little as four flag states, including Panama, Marshall Islands, Liberia and Hong Kong registries alone would secure the necessary 50%.

Moreover, senior industry figures such as Chris Wiernicki CEO at ABS and DNV’s maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen have called for a change of course with Wiernicki stating, “LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success [of the NZF] and should not be overlooked, over penalized or discarded in the Net Zero regulation. Quite frankly, achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard.”

While Ørbeck-Nilssen believes that LNG is a transitional fuel, that with the production of bio-LNG and e-LNG this could lead to the maritime industry “Beginning to swing towards using LNG as an alternative fuel”.

Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, believes that these pronouncements by both Ørbeck-Nilssen and Wiernicki are “highly cynical”.

A policy action grounded on uncritical appraisal of shipping “transporting 90% of everything” could lead to simplistic climate solutions.
These include campaigns to shift to local production and consumption, which might not necessarily curb shipping emissions.","Next week, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is expected to vote on its long-discussed Net-Zero Framework on greenhouse gas emissions. If approved by a two-thirds majority of IMO member states, the framework will create a roadmap for maritime decarbonization. In fact, the regulations will set precedent globally, being the first to combine mandatory emissions limits and a GHG pricing mechanism across an entire industry sector.

But even as this critical decision awaits confirmation, two sustainability researchers are demanding for a more nuanced discussion on why international shipping must be regulated.

Depending on who you ask, there are different justifications to subject shipping to environmental regulations. One of the most common reasons is that maritime industry plays an enormous role in the world economy, hence an important pressure point for global climate policy. To show the impact of shipping on the climate, statistics such as “cargo ships transport 90% of everything” have become commonplace. Based on this fact, some campaigners have recommended people to consume less, or even buy local, as it helps to bring down shipping demand, thus reducing GHG emissions.

Unfortunately, this narrative about maritime transport focuses on the highly unequal levels of consumption around the world, enabled by international shipping. In a new research paper for the journal Global Sustainability, Dr. Christiaan De Beukelaer (University of Melbourne) and Prof. Philip Steinberg (Durhan University), queries the commonly accepted numbers about maritime transport, which are often used to guide environmental campaigns.

“It’s often claimed that 90% of everything is transported by sea, but the reality is far more nuanced,” said Beukelaer. “While ships do indeed carry some 80-90 percent of international trade by weight, they only transport a bit over 10% of the global economy’s 100 billion tons of material footprint every year, as per International Resource Panel (IRP).”

The authors suggest that when dealing with environmental processes and impacts, relying on just the size and scale of systems could be problematic as starting points for policy arguments. The same applies to maritime transport. A policy action grounded on uncritical appraisal of shipping “transporting 90% of everything” could lead to simplistic climate solutions. These include campaigns to shift to local production and consumption, which might not necessarily curb shipping emissions. Before a commodity is shipped internationally, a significant material footprint is usually incurred at the local level.

Globally, shipping contributes to 3% of greenhouse gas emissions. But despite being a large and important industry, most of the global economy’s annual material footprint is not traded internationally - by ship or other means.

“As part of the transition away from fossil fuels, oceans and waterways will need to be safe and reliable conduits for global trade, whether we think of shipping as representing 90% or 10.8% of everything,” the authors concluded.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Union-Pacific-coal-train-Wyoming-Wuzel007-CC-BY-SA-30.9d95ba.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:44.948195
